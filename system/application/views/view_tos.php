			<h1>
				Privacy Policy
			</h1>
			
			<p>It is Rrrewind's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
			
			<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
			<p>	Like most website operators, Rrrewind collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rrrewind&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Rrrewind&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Rrrewind may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>	Rrrewind also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Rrrewind does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
			
			<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>	Certain visitors to Rrrewinds websites choose to interact with Rrrewind in ways that require Rrrewind to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rrrewind gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may ask visitors to provide a username and email address. Rrrewind collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors interaction with Rrrewind. Rrrewind does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
			
			<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
			<p>Rrrewind may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Rrrewind may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Rrrewind does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
			
			<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>	Rrrewind discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Rrrewinds behalf or to provide services available at Rrrewinds websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Rrrewinds websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Rrrewind will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Rrrewind discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Rrrewind believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Rrrewind, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Rrrewind website and have supplied your email address, Rrrewind may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Rrrewind and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Rrrewind takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

			<p>	A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Rrrewind uses cookies to help Rrrewind identify and track visitors, their usage of Rrrewind website, and their website access preferences. Rrrewind visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Rrrewinds websites, with the drawback that certain features of Rrrewinds websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
			
			<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
			<p>	Although most changes are likely to be minor, Rrrewind may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Rrrewinds sole discretion. Rrrewind encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
