         <link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foxD6ZQlnlU</link>
         <description>Two days to set up, and then six months to render. Be sure to watch in 720p HD. The final magnification of the Mandelbrot fractal is 6.066e+228 (2^760). Want some perspective? If you were actually traveling into the fractal, you would be moving faster than the speed of light. So chill out for a while, and stare into the eye of the universe.</description>
