         <title>[+1381] Atheist ad campaigns come in peace, love and understanding</title>
         <link>http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2009/07/16/atheist-ad-campaigns-come-in-peace/</link>
         <description>In the grand scheme of things, it seems odd that the question of whether or not God exists is so controversial. Just as some people go to church and others don't, the dividing line between atheism and belief is largely a private concern, relegated to how people spend their weekends and, to some extent, how they explain their actions.</description>

         <link>http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/07/nation/na-black-wire7</link>
         <description>A construction crew putting up an office building in the heart of congested Tysons Corner in McLean, Va., hit a fiber-optic cable no one knew was there. Within moments, three black SUVs drove up, half a dozen men in suits jumped out, and one said, &quot;You just hit our line.&quot;</description>

         <description>&quot;The rise of Idiot America ... is essentially a war on expertise ... In the new media age, everybody is a historian, or a scientist, or a preacher, or a sage. And if everyone is an expert, then nobody is, and the worst thing you can be in a society where everybody is an expert is, well, an actual expert.&quot; ~ Charles P. Pierce, from &quot;Idiot America&quot;</description>

         <description>ExxonMobil’s sabotage of some 100 Texas oil wells in the past 17 years — going so far as to plug up some wells with explosives — means the world’s largest oil company could be liable for penalties of up to $1 billion, the Texas General Land Office says.</description>

         <link>http://torrentfreak.com/drm-is-dead-riaa-says-090719/</link>
         <description>For years the RIAA has defended the use of DRM, much to the dislike of millions of honest customers who actually paid for their music. Now, in a shocking turnaround, the outfit seems to have come to the realization that DRM does more harm than good and has officially declared its death.</description>

         <description>We now have an official document from the Catholic church clearly stating their position. Anyone involved in an abortion for any reason is to be automatically excommunicated, no exceptions. They've actually hardened their position.</description>
