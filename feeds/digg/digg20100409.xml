         <description>Have you ever suspected that your city or town is trying too hard to catch traffic scofflaws in the pursuit of ticket revenue? A Florida woman received a ticket based on evidence from a red light camera, but believed the ticket was unfair because the yellow light was too short. The power of math proved that she was correct..</description>

         <description>President Obama dismissed criticism by Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin Thursday over his administration's proposal to limit the use of nuclear weapons.

         <title>[+660] Is Celibacy in the Catholic Church Almost Over?</title>
         <link>http://www.newsweek.com/id/236002</link>
         <description>As new cases of child sexual abuse by clergy emerge in Europe and the United States, abuse in Latin America, Asia, and Africa is largely ignored.

         <description>Gmail Sneak Peek allows you to get a preview of the message you’ve currently got selected, without actually opening it. Nested Labels allows you to put your labels in a hierarchy, which excites me less, but apparently is oft-requested.</description>
