         <title>[+614] Study Confirms: Women Worse at Parking Than Men</title>
         <link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6849247/Women-worse-at-parking-than-men-study-shows.html</link>
         <description>Female drivers take an average of 20 seconds longer to park their cars but are still less likely to end up in the middle of the spot, the research suggests. While the researchers expected the women volunteers to be slower, they were surprised to find that the cautious approach did not lead to a tidier final result.</description>

         <description>No one has been able to effectively string together two nanotube transistors, let alone the thousands needed for a chip.
