         <link>http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/apple-google-multi-touch-android/</link>
         <description>So why did Google wait all this time to implement multi-touch when its devices have been capable of it since the G1? With Apple and Google now fighting, all bets are apparently off.</description>

         <link>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2358686,00.asp</link>
         <description>Google Chrome's market share numbers are skyrocketing, blowing past Safari and Opera to become the number three most-widely-used Web browser. That's pretty impressive, and I don't think it's going to stop there.</description>

         <title>[+922] Facebook 'Doppelganger' Craze is Illegal</title>
         <link>http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/02/03/facebook-doppelganger-craze-is-illegal/</link>
         <description>The doppelg√§nger meme currently sweeping across Facebook is actually illegal &amp; breaks the Facebook terms of service. If you don't use Facebook (??), or you haven't logged in during the past week, the 'doppelganger' thing is about replacing your profile pic w/ your celebrity look-alike. Harmless, you might think, but the Facebook TOS forbid it.</description>
