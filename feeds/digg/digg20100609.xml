         <description>Glenn Beck promoted The Red Network: A &quot;Who's Who&quot; and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots, stating that the book is &quot;from people who were doing what we're doing now.&quot; However, the book's author, Elizabeth Dilling, was a virulent anti-Semite, and The Red Network itself contains numerous passages that espouse anti-Semitism and racism.</description>

         <description>The morning the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, a BP executive and a Transocean official argued over how to proceed with the drilling. The BP official wanted workers to replace heavy mud, used to keep the well's pressure down, with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $750,000 a day.</description>
