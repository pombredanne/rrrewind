         <description>Last night, Jon Stewart, er, called out the blogosphere for using overblown adjectives to describe his segments: &quot;If you just followed this show on the blogs, you would think I was running around town cutting people from scrotum to sternum, wearing their skin as a trophy.&quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/02/06/2010-02-06_grade_for_common_sense_f_.html</link>
         <description>On Monday, a teacher caught a 12-year-old doodling on her desk with a lime green magic marker. Instead of just erasing it, the school called police and the girl was walked out in handcuffs. Give me a break! What's next? Will spitballs bring an assault charge? Could kids get 7-to-10 for shooting rubber bands? Grownups can be idiots.</description>

         <description>We've all seen semi trucks turned turtle on the freeway before, but as it turns out, the cleanup aftermath of a rollover can be as action-packed as the initial calamity.
