         <description>On the surface, USA-Russia's new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty may look as though it leaves America vulnerable to attacks from non-nuclear countries. Looking below the surface will reveal otherwise, but why read the details when you can misrepresent the headlines? Ladies and gents: Fox News</description>

         <description>There are many reasons to avoid dining at Kentucky Fried Chicken for the food alone.

         <description>After failing in their case against The Pirate Bay, a music copyrights group has announced it will give up trying to get sites blocked and will leave file-sharers alone.
