         <description>Jon Stewart last night took down Fox &amp; Friends for using poll numbers on global warming -- more specifically, &quot;climate gate&quot; -- that added up to 120 percent. Then he zeroed in on host Gretchen Carlson for playing dumb -- even though she was valedictorian of her high school class, graduated with honors from Stanford and studied at Oxford.</description>

         <link>http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/12/nyc-brooklyn-cyclists-repaint-removed-bike-lane-middle-night-video-bedford-street.php</link>
         <description>2 men were arrested yesterday for trying to re-paint a bike lane on a 14-block in Brooklyn. The bike lane was removed by the city because of complaints by local groups. The video (below) of the repainting concludes with this warning for the city: &quot;Do not try to remove [bike lanes], or we will put them back for our own safety.&quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/08/wireworlds-platinum-starlight-hdmi-cable-is-only-1-000-better/</link>
         <description>You idiot. Where did you buy those cables? Walmart? You probably think you're getting the whole 1080p, don't you! Boy, you couldn't be more wrong. What the big box doesn't want you to know, with their cheap-ass $150 cables is that there are, um, waves and some, uh... electromagnetic spectrats. And they eat your pixels! Yeah, that's right!</description>
