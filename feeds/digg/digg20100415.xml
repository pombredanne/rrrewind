         <link>http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/04/47-of-tea-partiers-pay-no-federal-income-taxes/38924/</link>
         <description>If the Tea Party movement has a similar share of Americans making under $50,000 as the broader population (as a recent Gallup poll suggests), then why is this movement rallying under the banner &quot;Taxed Enough Already!&quot; when half of them aren't taxed at all? Drink the Kool-aid, errâ€¦ tea &amp; fall in line with the rhetoric. Teabaggers are hypocrites.</description>
