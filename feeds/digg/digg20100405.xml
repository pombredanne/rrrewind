         <description>If you want to live in the creative universe where anyone with a cool idea can make it and give it to you to run on your hardware, the iPad isn't for you.If you want to write code for a platform where the only thing that determines whether you're going to succeed with it is whether your audience loves it, the iPad isn't for you.</description>

         <description>The Ultralisk in Starcraft 2 is a BEAST! I am rarely impressed by short vids of unit combats but when 1 unit can destroy 798 zerglings, that is impressive.</description>

         <description>For the first hour, no girls were to be seen, but the boys wanted their photos taken. Many villagers have never had their photos taken. The boys didn’t seem to know what the camera was until they saw their images.The villagers love to get the shots which often are the only photos they have ever owned. Soldiers use a Polaroid camera to take them</description>

         <description>I’m involved with an older man. My boss, actually. Each week, we secretly meet outside of work, behind closed doors, away from the prying eyes of the world. Though ours is not a rendezvous of the heart. No, what we share is more special than clandestine candle lit dinners, fine wine on a beach, or roses petals on pillows. We smoke pot together.</description>

         <description>Hyperbole gets thrown around about &quot;play of the year&quot; type stuff in every sport during the first week of the season -- usually it's just something incredible that reminds us said sport is here. But there's a pretty good chance you want see a play more ridiculous than what Mark Buehrle pulled off on Opening Day.</description>
