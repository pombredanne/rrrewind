         <link>http://rawstory.com/2009/10/grayson-fox-enemy-of-america/</link>
         <description>&quot;Fox News and their Republican collaborators are the enemy of America. They're the enemy of anybody who cares about health care, the enemy of anybody who cares about educating their children, the enemy of anybody who wants energy independence or anything good for this country. And certainly the enemy of peace, there's no doubt about that.&quot;</description>
