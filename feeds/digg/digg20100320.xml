         <link>http://pubrecord.org/multimedia/7239/final-health-protest-partiers-admit/</link>
         <description>On March 16, Tea Partiers gathered (in disappointing numbers) in front of the Capitol building for their final protest against health care reform. Also in town, appropriately, was Barnum &amp; Bailey’s circus.

         <description>McDonald's could replace all its beef with beef-flavored seitan and NO ONE would notice the difference. McDonald's would save a fortune, health would be improved, and the carbon and resource footprint of McDonald's would be massively slashed.</description>

         <description>The A-list actor didn't even vote for himself to win the best actor Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, as he checked off the name of fellow actor (and eventual winner) Jeff Bridges instead.</description>

         <description>Johns Hopkins scientists have found that a safe and inexpensive antibiotic in use since the 1970s for treating acne effectively targets infected immune cells in which HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, lies dormant and prevents them from reactivating and replicating.</description>

         <description>&quot;We must send a clear message to these hundreds—perhaps thousands—of children whose sinful ways have tempted so many of the church's servants into lustful violation of their holy vows of celibacy. The church forgives them for their transgressions and looks upon them not with intolerance, but compassion.&quot;</description>

         <description>Hey, Bart. If you really want to reduce abortions, ask yourself this: Why does godless France, where abortion is nearly free (it's covered by their universal health insurance), have 20% fewer abortions per capita than we do?</description>
