         <description>&quot;I will end 'don't ask-don't tell,'&quot; Obama said at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay civil rights advocacy group.

         <link>http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/03/opinion/oe-rachlis3</link>
         <description>In the 1960s, the U.S. chose public coverage for only elderly and the poor, while Canada opted for a universal program. As a policy analyst, I know there are lessons to be learned, but, as a Canadian with lots of American friends and relatives, I am saddened that Americans seem incapable of learning them.</description>

         <link>http://www.digitaltrends.com/photogalleries/do-it-all-devices/</link>
         <description>TV chef Alton Brown has it right: Unitaskers – specialty devices that only perform one function – have no place in the kitchen.
