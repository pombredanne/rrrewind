         <link>http://mediamatters.org/blog/200909030020</link>
         <description>The conservative freak-out over President Obama's planned speech to students urging them to stay in school and work hard is due to fears that Obama will use his platform as an opportunity to push his agenda on unsuspecting students. Ironically, that's exactly what President Reagan did two decades ago.</description>

         <description>At Backblaze, we provide unlimited storage to our customers for only $5 per month, so we had to figure out how to store hundreds of petabytes of customer data. After looking at several overpriced commercial solutions, we decided to build our own custom Backblaze Storage Pods: 67 terabyte 4U servers for $7,867.</description>

         <link>http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/levi-johnston-calls-palin-a-phony.php</link>
         <description>Levi Johnston's new article in Vanity Fair, in which he dishes all manner of dirt against his almost-mother-in-law Sarah Palin, is a real tour de force of family dysfunction, private dirt, and all-around personal contempt. One taste: &quot;We all knew that she didn't know what to say on TV, and that when she was reading a script she was a phony.&quot;</description>

         <description>Two years ago, I detailed how to build a Hackintosh for under $800 --then covered how to do the same with less hacking. Now that Snow Leopard is out, we're revisiting the Hackintosh, building a Hack Pro from scratch for roughly $900.</description>
