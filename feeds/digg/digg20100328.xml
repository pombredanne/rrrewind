         <title>[+2415] Student Uses Westboro Baptist to Raise Funds for Gay Rights</title>
         <link>http://www.fark.com/cgi/vidplayer.pl?IDLink=5148987</link>
         <description>[VIDEO] Jason beats the Westboro Baptist Church. He doesn't agree with standing across the street and yelling, because that doesn't have the power to change anything.
