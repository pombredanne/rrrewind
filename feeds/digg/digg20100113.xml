         <title>[+3275] Gay Teen Worried He Might Be Christian</title>
         <link>http://www.theonion.com/content/news/gay_teen_worried_he_might_be</link>
         <description>At first glance, high school senior Lucas Faber, 18, seems like any ordinary gay teen. He's a member of his school's swing choir, enjoys shopping at the mall, and has sex with other males his age. But lately, a growing worry has begun to plague this young gay man. A gnawing feeling that, deep down, he may be a fundamentalist, right-wing Christian.</description>

         <description>This one’s actually not about Conan for once. It’s about Jay Leno and his scheisty ass going into damage control now that Conan has rejected NBC’s plan to bump“The Tonight Show” to midnight. &quot;Sources close to former ‘Tonight Show’ host Jay Leno tell me he is furious with the way NBC has treated him and Conan O’Brien and is considering walking away</description>

         <description>Except no, that’s not really what happened. The woman, who worked for Brides (Condé Nast), didn’t technically “show” her boobs, she was wearing a sports bra at the time she revealed them. Two female colleagues asked to see the results, and the woman, who was having the conversation in her office, closed the door, and unbuttoned her blouse.</description>

         <description>&quot;Something happened a long time ago in Haiti and people might not want to talk about it. They were under the heel of the French. Napoleon the Third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil...But ever since, they have been cursed by one thing after the other.&quot;</description>

         <link>http://funnycrave.com/the-5-worst-possible-facebook-status-updates/8117/</link>
         <description>The problem with the status update is there’s no set-in-stone way to use it. With Twitter you only get 120 characters to get your point across. The Facebook status update should work in the same way, but people have yet to figure out things like “brevity” and “coherence.”</description>
