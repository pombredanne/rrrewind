         <description>Phelps' gang were in San Francisco last Thursday &quot;protesting&quot; at the Twitter headquarters and were met by a large contingency of counter-protesters with some of the best signs I have seen in a long time. The counter protest was so successful that Westboro called off their second protest at a Fiddler on the Roof performance scheduled for later . .</description>

         <link>http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html</link>
         <description>&quot;I just tried to write honestly, and I tried to make this little world fun to look at, so people would take the time to read it. That was the full extent of my concern. You mix a bunch of ingredients, and once in a great while, chemistry happens. I can't explain why the strip caught on the way it did, and I don't think I could ever duplicate it.&quot;</description>

         <description>While it can be argued that correlation does not imply causation, the trends revealed by these statistics, in relation to IQ, impoverishment, divorce, crime and political beliefs seem too consistent to refute. Data sources listed at bottom.</description>

         <link>http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/01/teenager-invents-low-frequency-radio-for-underground-communicati/</link>
         <description>Sixteen-year-old Alexander Kendrick has created a device that allows texting and other data transfer from almost 1000 feet underground. The tech could allow rapid emergency communication with the surface and opens the potential for scientific measurements without the need to continually visit (and disturb) the cave environment.</description>

         <description>Taylor Swift had the best problem any singer could have on Sunday. The singer, in the press room at the 52nd Grammy Awards, couldn't keep a hold of the four gramophone statuettes she received, dropping one to the ground -- breaking it.</description>

         <description>Horrible! Utterly horrible! And yet, fascinating... What makes a film so appalling that it transitions from ordinary ineptitude into the sublime; beyond cult status (and all reason) and into that surreal place where you really can't believe what you're watching?</description>
