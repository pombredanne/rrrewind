         <description>A panel of six scientists have investigated the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit - the target of the so-called &quot;climategate&quot; - and cleared them of &quot;any deliberate scientific malpractice&quot;. Moreover, they found that while the scientists could have been better organized, their overall methodology is sound.</description>

         <link>http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/weeds-are-now-resisting-monsanto-weed</link>
         <description>Yep, thanks to Monsanto Roundup, American agriculture is in quite a fix now.

Unfortunately, the weeds learned to resist it--and now their GMO seed is struggling against the pesticide-resistant weeds that evolved as a result of their own product.</description>

         <description>Adobe's much-beleaguered Flash is about to take another hit and online documents are finally going to join the Web on a more equal footing.
