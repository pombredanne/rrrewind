         <link>http://blog.digg.com/?p=1195</link>

Two fun things to commemorate this day: Dec. 4, 2009 has been declared Digg.com day in San Francisco. And we're excited to launch Digg365, a way to see the top 10 stories on Digg on any given day, month or year. Happy 5th Birthday! - Kevin</description>
