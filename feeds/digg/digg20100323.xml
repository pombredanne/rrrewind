         <link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/53880</link>
         <description>IDEVFH has just released his update to the Memory Fox Firefox add-on. This add-on recovers Firefox memory leaks by automatically flushing &amp; recovering fragmented orphaned RAM. It's similar to the AFOM add-on, also by IDEVFH, but includes support for Songbird, iTunes and TweetDeck. I use it and have had excellent results.</description>
