         <description>To commemorate the anniversary, NASA released newly restored video footage of the Apollo 11 moon landings — but the fabled &quot;lost&quot; moon tapes weren't among them. Those tapes, alas, which preserved the highest-quality raw feed from the moon in July 1969, appear to have been accidentally erased.</description>

         <description>Google said publishers can easily tell search engines to take a hike. All it takes is a two-line piece of code, which he helpfully included in his post.
