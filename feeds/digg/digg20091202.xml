         <description>So this guy on YouTube has some gameplay of New Super Mario Bros. Wii running through a PC emulator called Dolphin. The footage has some obvious audio hiccups and the video freezes at 1:10 until 1:18. Beautiful nonetheless.</description>

According to the New York Daily News, many of Salahi’s 11,914-and-counting &quot;fans&quot; have rained insults on the &quot;Desperate Housewives of D.C.&quot; hopeful, calling her a &quot;fame whore,&quot; a &quot;gold digger,&quot; and a &quot;silly, old cow.&quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.observer.com/2009/politics/crushing-legacy-bush</link>

It would be much less fair, however, to ignore the events that led us to this moment.</description>

They sing and dance. He wakes her up in the morning. She wears skimpy little dresses.&quot;</description>
