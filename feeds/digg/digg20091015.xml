         <link>http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathan_moreau/418008212/sizes/l/</link>
         <description>&quot;I found a picture of this the other day while searching for photos from Kansas City and I knew I had to go photograph it myself. This is probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. I live here and I've never heard of it before—it makes me wonder what other secrets my hometown might be hiding. &quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/10/15/fox_news/index.html</link>
         <description>Since Obama’s election, the cable news channel has dropped all but the barest pretense of objectivity.Fox has turned itself into what Anita Dunn recently called “the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party.” Actually, that’s an extremely polite way of putting it. It’s closer to Orwell’s “Ministry of Truth.”</description>
