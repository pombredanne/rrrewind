         <description>Researchers have succeeded for the first time in reprogramming clearly defined adult cells into pluripotent stem cells -- directly and without viruses.

         <description>The Antikythera mechanism, so named because it was found in 1901 in a Roman shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, is thought to have been made about 100 BC.
