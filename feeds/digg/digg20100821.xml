         <description>We all knew the writing staff of Futurama was brainy but this is something else. To work out the ridiculous brain switching plot line from last night's hilarious episode, writer Ken Keeler (who also just happens to have a PhD in mathematics) ended up writing and proving an entirely new theorem. This is probably the most impressive bit of side work</description>
