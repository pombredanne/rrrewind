         <title>[+1957] Windows Phone 7 Interface: Microsoft Has Out-Appled Apple</title>
         <link>http://gizmodo.com/5472010/windows-phone-7-interface-microsoft-has-out+appled-apple</link>
         <description>I'm sorry, Cupertino, but Microsoft has nailed it. Windows Phone 7 feels like an iPhone from the future. The UI has the simplicity and elegance of Apple's industrial design, while the iPhone's UI still feels like a colorized Palm Pilot.</description>

         <description>So I guess testing theories, hypothesis and postulates with critical thinking and true analysis makes you a liberal. Having rules where we actually do critical thinking to prove or disprove an idea is liberal?</description>

         <description>Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) headlined an event on Friday for the North Dakota Republican Party, and lambasted President Obama for what she saw as his historically terrible handling of the nation's finances. The only problem, however, was that her pronouncements didn't bear much resemblance to reality.</description>

         <title>[+702] Sarah Palin Calls Family Guy Joke a &quot;Kick in the Gut&quot;</title>
         <link>http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2010/02/16/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry6212912.shtml?tag=stack</link>
         <description>Early today, Palin responded on Facebook to an episode of the Fox television show &quot;Family Guy&quot; that poked fun at Palin, whose son has Down Syndrome. The episode (you can watch a clip of it here) features a mentally challenged character who says her mother is the former governor of Alaska. Palin said the episode &quot;felt like another kick in the gut.&quot;</description>

         <description>Two Orlando-area residents and complete strangers, were married last Friday, in an attempt to mock marriage just to prove a political point. The groom put out a call to any ladies who wanted to take part in the project on Facebook. Three women showed up, and he spun a water bottle to decide which one with which he would enter into holy matrimony.</description>
