         <title>[+1591] People's Passwords: Worst Practices (Graphic)</title>

         <description>Analysis of the 32 million passwords exposed in the recent breach at RockYou provides further proof that people routinely use easy to guess logins. Many use the same password for everything - from their private work accounts. But how breakable is your password and what does it say about you?</description>

         <link>http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/02/crabzilla-5-ft-biggest-known-crab-uk.php</link>
         <description>Hail Crabzilla! The Japanese Spider Crab is the biggest arthropod on Earth--their legs are believed to grow up to 12 feet long. But since they live at such great depths (typically 1,000 feet down or so) a full grown spider crab has yet to be caught. So for now, we'll have to make due with the 5 foot long Crabzilla.</description>

         <description>Glenn Beck may have thought he had found an easy target in MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan, but Ratigan is fully capable of striking back. The battle began when Beck took exception to Ratigan's statement that &quot;these 'snowpocalypses' that have been going through D.C. and other extreme weather events are precisely what climate scientists have been predicting.&quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/02/getting-geekier-the-evolution-of-the-big-bang-theory/</link>
         <description>That same oft-mined-nerd-joke-territory feeling comes up all through the early episodes. It's all like rehashed Revenge of the Nerds stuff, and that was already well-worn in the 1980s. Now, contrast that with what we see in seasons two and three, and it’s clear TBBT has totally aimed itself at a geek audience rather than making the easy jokes.</description>
