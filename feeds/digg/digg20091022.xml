         <description>Here's another appalling story of how the police get treated one way and civilians quite another. Dallas cop does 70 in a 40 mph zone without his lights or sirens on, hits a kid on a bike and kills him. His punishment: A day off from work. Without pay, I'm sure.</description>

         <description>&quot;The Earth can't take 6.5 billion people. We just can't feed that many. So what are you going to do? Kill as many as you can,&quot; Farrakhan reportedly said during an event in Memphis, Tenn. &quot;We have to develop a science that kills them and makes it look as though they died from some disease.&quot;The 76-year-old added that many wise people won't take....</description>

         <link>http://subwaysights.com/2009/10/sean-hannity-defames-new-yorkers/</link>
         <description>Hannityâ€™s argument is that intolerant leftist New Yorkers are okay with atheists buying subway ads but would be outraged if Christians did the same thing. The problem with this thinking is that Christians have been putting up pro-Christianity ads in the subway for years and nobody cares.</description>

         <link>http://www.moviefill.com/The-7-Best-and-7-Worst-TV-Spinoffs-19039/</link>
         <description>TV spin-offs are an easy way for studios to capitalize on a viewer's addictions to the most successful shows on television. But sadly, they usually end in a travesty, like when we were left watching &quot;Billy&quot; (1992), the lame spin-off of &quot;Head of the Class&quot; (1986). However, some spin-offs are great, and in a few cases, They're even better!</description>
