         <title>[+429] In 6 states human trafficking is legal. Hawaii may make it 5</title>
         <link>http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/21/opinion/la-ed-trafficking-20100621</link>
         <description>Hawaii is one of six states that do not have any laws against human trafficking. Without strong and vigorously enforced statutes, these states risk becoming unintended havens for traffickers. The Aloha State, however, is poised to leave this small club of outliers and become the 45th state to enact anti-trafficking legislation.</description>

         <description>Having multiple accounts has been a pain for GMail users for a while. You have to log out of one account and log back in the next. Now, Google has introduced a way for you to link up to three accounts to your Google account, so you can sign in and switch between them at will - or even open a different tab for each account. Yes!!</description>
