         <description>&quot;What are the chances that we will encounter some alien form of life, as we explore the galaxy?&quot; If the argument about the time scale for the appearance of life on Earth is correct, Hawking says &quot;there ought to be many other stars, whose planets have life on them. Some of these stellar systems could have formed 5 billion years before the Earth.</description>

         <description>A half pound duck and pork patty, cheddar cheese, seven pieces of maple bacon, sauteed onions and zillion island sauce on a kaiser roll. You had me at &quot;A&quot; - by the way, the name of this sandwich, for some reason, is Mork's Dork from Ork. Whatever. Still doesn't spoil the awesomeness that is this sandwich.</description>
