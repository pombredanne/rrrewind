         <description>The Wall Street Journal, Pat Buchanan and others are already condemning the Obama administration for treating Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as a civilian criminal rather than an illegal warrior to whom we can presumably do whatever we please. Do they forget that Richard Reid is away at SuperMax? It's not good enough for the Underpants bomber, too?</description>

         <link>http://brainz.org/the-10-greatest-fantasy-series-all-time/</link>
         <description>Fantasy as a genre is often unfairly maligned.
