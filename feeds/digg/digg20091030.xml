         <title>[+871] 26 Eye-Catching Long Exposure Photographs</title>
         <link>http://pelfusion.com/inspiration/26-eye-catching-long-exposure-photographs/</link>
         <description>Long exposure is really amazing photography technique to capture light and movement. When an image is taken including stationary and moving subjects (for example, a fixed street and moving cars or a camera within a car showing a fixed dash-board and moving scenery) using a slow shutter speed, interesting effects, such as light trails occur.</description>

         <link>http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/29/hulu-free/</link>
         <description>It turns out beloved home of full-lengthy goodness Hulu is not going to start charging after all. A source tells EW that the site’s rumored pay structure would only be in addition to its free content, not instead of it. And a collective “phew” was heard ’round the Internet.</description>

         <description>They say whisky matures with age... but leaving it embedded in the Antarctic ice for 100 years may be going a bit far. Two cases of MacKinlay's Rare Old Whisky that Ernest Shackleton's team abandoned on their failed 1908 expedition to the South Pole have been uncovered intact and unopened.</description>

         <description>Supporters of dedicated servers for FPS games claim that the current system is necessary to allow for a full gaming experience. Needless to say, the recent news that dedicated servers aren't being supported in the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 hasn't exactly gone over well with a lot of the computer gaming community.</description>

         <description>The piracy tracking company DtecNet has made quite a name for itself in the past few months after partnering with the RIAA and several local governments to assist in the ‘war on piracy’. One would think that these projects would require at least some basic knowledge of BitTorrent, but a recently published paper proves the opposite.</description>
