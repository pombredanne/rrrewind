         <description>Artist Glen Brogan's whimsical take on our favorite Italian plumber's morning ritual. &quot;I wanted to include as many of his power-ups as possible, but the main rule I had to follow was that I couldn't include things that actually transform Mario himself rather that just changing his wardrobe, like the Boo mushroom from Mario Galaxy&quot;</description>

         <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/jim-campbell-maine-republ_n_397403.html</link>
         <description>I have been very frustrated with the Republican Party in Maine, and nationally, for their failure to address the health care crisis in a meaningful way. Nobody has all the answers, but the Republican Party has none when it comes to health care reform. This move is about the working people and our seniors who need action.</description>
