         <description>The idea that Dubai is an oasis of freedom on the Arabian peninsular is one of the great lies.Yes, it has Starbucks &amp; Gucci, but beneath these, there is a dictatorship built by slaves. The people who really built the city can be seen in long chain-gangs by the side of the road, or toiling all day at the top of the tallest buildings in the world.</description>
