         <title>[+705] Ben Stein is off his rocker in dissing unemployed</title>
         <link>http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2010/07/20/ben-stein-is-off-his-rocker-in-dissing-unemployed/</link>
         <description>Ben Stein is losing it. At 65, the economist, actor, writer and funny guy is either having a senior moment and forgot to think before writing about the unemployed, or as a millionaire with homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu is so far removed from reality. (Also: Stein responds.)</description>

         <description>One of the many brilliant things about the PC is that you’re not tied to the mainstream. Unless you’re housed deep within the labyrinthine offices of the most far-flung Activision studio, you’re free from the shackles of commercial viability and you can make whatever the hell you deem fit.</description>
