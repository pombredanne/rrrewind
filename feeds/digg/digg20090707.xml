         <description>The first two times Jason brought his truck in to his local Toyota dealership for service, he noticed that someone had taken quarters from his change compartment. He complained both times, but was ignored. So the third time he brought his truck in, he placed a video camera on the passenger side. The dealership didn't ignore him this time.</description>

         <link>http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/07/president_obamas_first_167_day.html</link>
         <description>U.S. President Barack Obama has now been in office for 167 days, and it's time for a look back. Why 167 days? Why not - it's just as arbitrary a number as the usual &quot;100 days&quot;. In that time, President Obama has contended with stimulating the U.S. economy, reshaping U.S. policy abroad, and starting work on domestic issues such as health care reform.</description>

         <description>WITH VIDEO - We knew when the incendiary rhetoric was ratcheted up very early in the Democratic administration that there was no where else for it to go but over the edge.

         <description>9) Misuse of Overhead Compartments: If you're one of the first 10 passengers to board, shoving your jacket into the overhead bin is a total a-hole move. It's frustrating to have to check someone's carry-on because your jacket has taken up half the overhead bin when it could easily have gone under the seat in front of you</description>
