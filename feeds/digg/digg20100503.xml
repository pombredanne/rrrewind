         <description>&quot;I would never say and I have never said, because it's not true that Republicans, all republicans are racists. That would be silly and wrong. But now days, if you are racist, you're probably a Republican. And that is quite different,&quot; explained Maher.</description>

         <description>No, really, it’s going to I cop it any day now. In fact, it may even have expired by the time you read this introduction. After all, people have been predicting its demise for 20 years now – it’s all piracy this, expensive hardware that, niche appeal this, compatibility problems that… Oh, shuddup. PC gaming isn’t going anywhere.</description>

         <link>http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/26/opinion/la-oe-rodriguez-20100426-14</link>
         <description>Arizona's anti-immigration law looks like it will take racial profiling to work. We can safely assume that most illegal immigrants in AZ are of humble origins, right? So, should the police &quot;reasonably suspect&quot; people with darker faces? What about fair-skinned Mexicans? Are work boots or jeans a dead giveaway? Would someone draw more suspicion...</description>

         <link>http://www.ismashphone.com/2010/05/how-the-ipad-killed-hp-slate.html</link>
         <description>The iPad can't multi-task, it doesn't have Flash and it doesn't exactly do anything a laptop can't do. Yet somehow, Apple's latest gadget was able to see two successful launches in one month. HP, who was destined to give the iPad a run for its money, can't even manage a release. But why?</description>

         <title>[+560] Why all apes, except us, have 48 chromosomes &amp; we have 46</title>
         <link>http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm</link>
         <description>All great apes apart from man have 24 pairs of chromosomes. There is therefore a hypothesis that the common ancestor of all great apes had 24 pairs of chromosomes and that the fusion of two of the ancestor's chromosomes created chromosome 2 in humans. The evidence for this hypothesis is very strong.</description>
