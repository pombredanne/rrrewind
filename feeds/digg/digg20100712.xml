         <link>http://www.politicususa.com/en/o-reilly-palin-beatdown</link>
         <description>Sarah Palin made another rash appearance on Bill O’Reilly’s &quot;The Factor&quot; Friday night, wherein he grilled her about immigration reform. The half-term governor left the Fox News Channel program angry and humilitated as O’Reilly exposed Palin’s limited knowledge for the Fox News crowd to see. You have to watch the video for yourself.</description>

         <description>Our economy can't thrive when the richest 1% get an ever larger share of the nation's income and wealth, and everyone else's share shrinks. The problem isn't that typical Americans have spent beyond their means. It's that their means haven't kept up with what the growing economy could and should have been able to provide them.</description>

         <description>John McTiernan’s film Predator is an 80s classic. It’s biggest problem, however, is that it was too successful for its own good and, in the last 23 years, has spawned three other films featuring the Predator that have never been worthy of the original. This weekend the 5th movie in the franchise finally did right by it. Here's how.</description>

         <description>Debra Rousey doesn't want to get an unemployment check every week. She'd much rather get a paycheck, as she used to back in November, before she lost her job as an assistant bank manager.

         <description>For the better part of the last couple of decades, conservatives took a fairly aggressive approach to constitutional amendments: they wanted several more. Indeed, by the mid-point of his presidency, George W. Bush was on record supporting at least six different proposed amendments to the Constitution: (1) prohibiting flag burning; (2) victims’ ri..</description>
