         <title>[+1905] The Dark Side of Vitaminwater</title>
         <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/the-dark-side-of-vitaminw_b_669716.html</link>
         <description>In a staggering feat of twisted logic, Coca-Cola is defending the lawsuit by asserting that &quot;no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking vitaminwater was a healthy beverage.&quot; does it mean that it's okay for a corporation to lie about its products, as long as they can then turn around and claim that no one actually believes their lies?</description>

         <description>I might get banned for saying this, but honestly I think this is what will destroy the new Digg -- Indie publishers are going to get screwed and Lamestream Media will dominate even more than it does already.</description>

         <link>http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/12/21/1523497.htm?site=science%2Fgreatmomentsinscience</link>
         <description>I told my son that I would give him a million dollars if he could fold a piece of paper in half, and in half again, and so on for a total of 10 times. Of course he tried, and of course he failed. I knew that this would happen, because it was &quot;Accepted Wisdom&quot; that it was impossible to fold a piece of paper in half 10 times. Now I know I was wrong.</description>
