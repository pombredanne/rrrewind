         <description>&quot;A Floridian biology teacher fired after posing for racy pictures has landed a new career in pornography. &quot;I'm not particularly proud of it. To be honest, I hate it,&quot; Tiffany Shepherd told Page2live.com. &quot;I'm an educated woman, but I never thought it would come to this. No one gets brought up thinking they'll be a floozy.&quot;</description>

         <description>George Orwell once observed: &quot;All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.&quot; In wartime governments everywhere resort to propaganda, which at its simplest and starkest often takes the form of outrageous posters: occasionally beautiful, sometimes racist, &amp; often brutally jarring.</description>
