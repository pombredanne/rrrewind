         <description>Google's Chrome browser has overtaken Apple's Safari in the United States, according to web analytics company StatCounter.

         <description>Well this is kinda wacky. Citing a &quot;very credible source,&quot; Digg founder Kevin Rose tweeted that Google is preparing to release &quot;Google Me,&quot; a service intended to go toe-to-toe (face-to-face?) with Facebook. It's like Google stalking, but official, and thus marginally less creepy!</description>

         <title>[+985] The 7 Most Popular Hidden Easter Eggs In Star Wars</title>
         <link>http://furiousfanboys.com/2010/06/the-best-star-wars-easter-eggs/</link>
         <description>The Star Wars movies are filled with little Easter Eggs that you normally have to go frame by frame to see. Some, like the infamous Return of the Jedi tennis shoe (more on this below) are impossible to see. Others, such as E.T. in The Phantom Menace or the Millennium Falcon in Attack of the Clones, are easier to spot.</description>

         <description>High Definition Gaming hit the planet only a few years ago with the arrival of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. But more then a decade ago, Sega had proclaimed that Sega Genesis had &quot;High Definition Graphics&quot;. I wonder what Microsoft and Sony have to say about the same.</description>

         <link>http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/25jun_hayabusa/</link>
         <description>Last year, high school science teacher Ron Dantowitz played a clever trick on his students. He asked them to plan a hypothetical mission to fly on a NASA aircraft and observe a spacecraft disintegrate into Earth's atmosphere. On March 12th, he stunned them with the news: &quot;The mission is real, and you're going along for the ride.&quot;</description>

         <description>Somewhere in America right now a Religious Studies graduate in white shutter shades is sucking the Pabst Blue Ribbon from his wispy mustache while listening to a pig-tailed girl offer her position on Metamorphosis. They are hipsters, I know this because I met them. They hang out in front of a Coffee Bean.</description>

         <link>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37959624/ns/health-cancer/</link>
         <description>Days before dying in federal prison, Adam Montoya pleaded with guards to be taken to a doctor, pressing a panic button in his cell over and over to summon help that never came. An autopsy concluded that the 36-year-old inmate suffered from cancer, hepatitis and HIV. The cancer ultimately caused his spleen to burst. Montoya bled to death internally.</description>
