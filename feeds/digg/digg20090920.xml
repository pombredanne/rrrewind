         <description>Intolerance is a bitter beast. There are many groups in America that are subject to discrimination and prejudice, but none are more hated than atheists. Research conducted a couple years ago at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis found that atheists are more distrusted than Muslims or homosexuals.</description>

         <description>So, the government in Egypt decided a while back that it should kill all the pigs in the country. You know, to stop the dreaded Swine Flu. On the surface, this was an unbelievably stupid idea. But it turns out, it was even dumber than first thought -- because those pigs were eating Egypt's garbage. Now they've run out of places to put the stuff.</description>
