         <title>[+3621] Obama calls Kanye a 'jackass'</title>
         <link>http://www.politico.com/click/stories/0909/did_obama_call_kanye_a_jackass.html</link>
         <description>ABC News employees prematurely tweeted a portion of those remarks that turned out to be from an off-the-record portion of the interview. This was done before our editorial process had been completed. That was wrong. We apologize to the White House and CNBC and are taking steps to ensure that it will not happen again.</description>

         <title>[+1540] Philadelphia To Shut Down All Public Libraries</title>
         <link>http://consumerist.com/5358416/philadelphia-to-close-all-public-libraries-october-2nd</link>
         <description>What frugal person doesn't like libraries? They're like a video store, only better. Which is why we're horrified to learn that thanks to the economic meltdown and the state of Pennsylvania's inability to pass its budget, the Philadelphia Free Library is closing on October 2nd. They'll be ending all services and programs, and closing the buildings.</description>

         <description>Over the weekend, conservatives enthusiastically passed around a photo they said showed a huge crowd protesting President Barack Obama's policies during the &quot;tea party&quot; protest on Sept. 12, 2009. It may be a real photograph, but it does not depict the much smaller crowd that showed up for the protest. We rate it Pants on Fire!</description>

         <description>Burtynsky's images are intriguing in many ways. He captures the price we pay for our industrialized planet and yet somehow makes it beautiful. To find and convey the beauty in a strip mined mountain or a pile of dismantled oil tankers is what really sets Edward Burtynsky among the elite of modern day photographers.</description>

         <description>Clearly, the Dude abides. The question is: Why? ... The film - which was released to mixed reviews and spent all of six weeks in theaters, barely recouping its $15 million budget - has spawned a vibrant subculture that draws both scholars and slackers to the fold. The Dude has been cited in hundreds of doctoral dissertations and academic papers</description>
