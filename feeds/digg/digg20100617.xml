         <link>http://money.cnn.com/2010/06/15/news/newsmakers/Warren_Buffett_Pledge_Letter.fortune/</link>
         <description>In 2006, I made a commitment to gradually give all of my Berkshire Hathaway stock to philanthropic foundations. I couldn't be happier with that decision. Now, Bill and Melinda Gates and I are asking hundreds of rich Americans to pledge at least 50% of their wealth to charity. So I think it is fitting that I reiterate my intentions.</description>

         <description>Since making its rounds yesterday on digg (digg.com/d31U3Cb), the woman in question was spotted in the crowd during Monday's World Cup match. The picture of this bombshell fan and her conveniently placed cell phone has made its way onto computer screens around the world.</description>

         <description>Sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good. If he had suffered a real skateboard fail, it would have been much tougher to face his friends. I mean, this isn't really a skateboard fail at all. Is a skateboard fail on a trick really a fail at all? If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it...</description>

         <description>We're sorry that the government is forcing you to set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims for creating the worst environmental oil spill disaster in the history of the United States, one Republican congressman suggested Thursday. Texas Republican Joe Barton actually called the $20 billion trust fund a &quot;slush fund&quot; and a &quot;shakedown.&quot;</description>

         <description>The concept of government-backed web censorship is usually associated with nations where human rights and freedom of speech are routinely curtailed. But if Canberra's plans for a mandatory Internet filter go ahead, Australia may soon become the first Western democracy to join the ranks of Iran, China and a handful of other nations where .......</description>

         <link>http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/06/palin_call_in_the_dutch.php</link>
         <description>Palin said Obama had really blown it by not reaching out to the Dutch since they proved themselves so good at building dykes and sluices and dams to reclaim land from the sea. Which when you think about it is pretty much the same thing has capping an oil gusher a mile underwater.</description>

         <description>Over the past month, heavy rainfall from different storms across parts of Europe has caused massive amounts of flooding - some water moving slowly across river plains and farmland, some moving swiftly through cities and villages. Dozens have lost their lives, many thousands evacuated their homes, some repeatedly - Poland in particular is suffering</description>

         <link>http://www.womansday.com/Articles/Family-Lifestyle/12-Worst-Movie-Accents-of-All-Time.html</link>
         <description>It takes a lot of skill for an actor to master a foreign accent. But when they pull it off, like Heath Ledger did as a cowboy in Brokeback Mountain or Gwyneth Paltrow as a Brit in Sliding Doors, it's a huge success. When they fail, however, it can ruin the movie and their reputation. Some actors actually become famous for their botched dialects.</description>
