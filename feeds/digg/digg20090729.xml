         <description>Olivia Munn and I have sort of a love/hate relationship. On one hand, I feel like she’s a complete attention slut (that’s one step beyond whore), and will do anything to further her public profile. On the other hand, I have to respect her, as I think she’s an absolute genius.</description>
