         <title>[+2571] Placebo Button?! We Are *Seriously* Being $#%!ed With [WTF?]</title>
         <link>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_button#more</link>
         <description>&quot;A placebo button is a push-button that appears to do something, but actually has no effect, like a placebo. They exist to give the user an illusion of control.[1] Many walk buttons at pedestrian crossings in New York City were once functional, but now serve as placebo buttons.[2] Many door close buttons in elevators are placebo buttons.[1][3]&quot;</description>
