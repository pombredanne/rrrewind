         <description>Home Depot had a problem: their employees kept sawing off their own extremities with the saws they used to cut lumber for customers. Michael Powell invented a gadget which fixed the problem, and offered to sell the device to the chain for $2,000 each. Then, the inventor's lawsuit alleged, Home Depot simply stole the gadget's design.</description>

         <description>In the three weeks since the April 20th explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, and the start of the subsequent massive (and ongoing) oil leak, many attempts have been made to contain and control the scale of the environmental disaster.</description>

         <description>Missouri stick in the mud Matt Bartle (R-Kansas City) has spent the past eight frickin' years trying to get strippers to not strip and drinkers to not drink in Show-Me state strip clubs. Presumably he wants fun banned, as well as the option for adults to make a decision on their own.</description>

         <description>Social Security, Medicare and the retirement of the baby boom generation wasn't enough of a burden for the American taxpayer. We will now be paying as well for the generous pensions of Greek bureaucrats retiring in the warm Mediterranean sun at age 55, thanks to the foresighted leadership of our very own international statesman, Barack Obama.</description>
