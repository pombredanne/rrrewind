         <description>Privacy may be becoming a scarce commodity on the Internet today, but we think this is one area where it should be preserved. In a situation where frivolous lawsuits against college kids have already tarnished the recording industry's public image, this only digs the RIAA into a deeper PR grave.</description>

         <description>&quot;Well, it's not exactly perpetual motion or energy, but it's getting closer than most such attempts. Plus, instead of being backed by some sort of random crackpot scientist, this particular project has the backing of NASA and the U.S. Navy.&quot;</description>

         <description>For women getting laid is a much easier task. It can be as simple as having a vagina and low self esteem. For men, approaching women and that initial meet and greet is often lost in translation.</description>
