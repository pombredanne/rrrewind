         <link>http://www.metacafe.com/watch/bg-3016404/octopus_locomotion/</link>
         <description>Octopuses are amazing creatures. They have no bones, and therefore can go almost anywhere they want. Even a very large octopus weighing 600 pounds can squeeze into a passageway no larger than a quarter. Octopuses don't have air bladders or gas pockets that could implode at great depths, so they can live at the very bottom of the ocean.</description>
