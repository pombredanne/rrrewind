         <title>[+1355] Why Don't Honest Journalists Take On Roger Ailes &amp; Fox News?</title>
         <link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031102523.html</link>
         <description>One question has tugged at my professional conscience throughout the year-long congressional debate over health-care reform, &amp; it has nothing to do with the public option, portability or medical malpractice. It is this: Why haven't America's old-school news organizations blown the whistle on Roger Ailes, chief of Fox News, for using the network ...</description>

         <link>http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2010/03/bay_city_crack_overkill.php</link>
         <description>Do the math, kids. That's basically one year for every nanogram of crack that a Texas man had on him when he was arrested last year. In other words, Melvin Johnson III is going to prison -- almost for life -- for having one-half of a dime's weight in crack cocaine.</description>

         <description>A piece of music that is literally stitched into the fabric of American blue-collar culture, Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, is, according to right-wing pundit Glenn Beck, &quot;anti-American&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot; that people must &quot;wake up&quot; from.

         <link>http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/new-mccarthyites</link>
         <description>Today, McCarthy’s heirs are more slick and glib than he ever was, yet their fundamental methods are the same. When Elizabeth Cheney, William Kristol and their media friends slander Justice Department attorneys as the “Al Qaeda 7” and malign the “Department of Jihad,” they are engaging in the smear tactics that became synonymous with McCarthy.</description>
