         <link>http://twitter.com/ConanObrien/statuses/10041591698</link>
         <description>&quot;I've decided to follow someone at random. She likes peanut butter and gummy dinosaurs. Sarah Killen, your life is about to change.&quot; She has no idea. In 5 minutes, she went from 550 followers to 1,868 and counting. Wonder how many she had before I got there. What talk show will she be on first?</description>

         <link>http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100305/0317058431.shtml</link>
         <description>Wow. The RIAA is getting seriously desperate these days. Now the RIAA is claiming that P2P file sharers are &quot;undermining&quot; humanitarian efforts in Haiti. Now that's quite a claim, and you would think the RIAA would have some evidence to back it up, but (of course), it doesn't. It's just making stuff up.</description>

         <description>Photographer Richard Mosse traveled to Iraq to document this bizarre circumstance, this juxtaposition of supposed liberators dwelling in the very home of the dictator they vowed to depose. He called the resulting book Breach, a nod to the liberators stepping into the breach they created when Hussein was removed from power.</description>
