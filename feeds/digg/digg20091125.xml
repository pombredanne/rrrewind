         <description>The big chiefs at Fox News aren't happy at the string of high-profile lies they got caught telling recently, so they're going to start firing people who get caught in the future, because they hate having to admit mistakes. &quot;That means we will start by going to air with only the most essential, basic, and manageable elements&quot;, so no Glenn then?</description>

         <description>Health care reform means less money for insurance companies. Thus, less money for the GOP. We should pass this bill for that reason alone.</description>

         <description>At first it was just an unverifiable assertion. Now it turns out to have been a case of bureaucratic ineptitude and possible fraud. Transparency and accountability aren’t working out the way President Barack Obama had hoped.</description>

         <description>The BBC has today said it has &quot;no intention&quot; of charging for online news, in a declaration that is unlikely to please James Murdoch and his father Rupert as they prepare to start charging for News Corporation content on the internet.</description>

         <description>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky census worker found naked, bound with duct tape and hanging from a tree with &quot;fed&quot; scrawled on his chest killed himself but staged his death to make it look like a homicide, authorities said Tuesday.</description>

         <description>Last week, Microsoft showed off some browser technology that could help Internet Explorer leapfrog the competition. But if Mozilla succeeds in its hope, Microsoft could be playing catch-up instead.</description>

         <description>It's an ugly rumor. There's no way Microsoft would resort to bribing Web sites to get delisted from Google, is there? I mean, aside from the restraint of trade issues and the callback to the tribulations the company went through with its dirty Internet Explorer tricks, Microsoft has learned to compete fairly, right?</description>
