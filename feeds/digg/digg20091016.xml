         <description>Rachel Maddow takes on Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips. &quot;Your group is corporate funded, founded by the head of Coke industries, an oil &amp; chemical company, and you're staffed by experienced Republican pro's. You're maintaining that you are a grass roots group, you may have a lot of members, but you're not a grassroots group&quot;.</description>

         <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/15/interracial-couple-denied_n_322784.html</link>
         <description>HAMMOND, La. A Louisiana justice of the peace said he refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple out of concern for any children the couple might have. Note, I love the assumption that they can't have children without getting married, and must have children if the do get married.</description>

         <description>When it started, The Office was a show about regular people like you and me working in a dead-end job at a generic company. Now, it looks like Jim and Pam are the only normal ones in the bunch. Every other character on the show has turned into an over-the-top caricature of those personality quirks that used to make them relatable.</description>
