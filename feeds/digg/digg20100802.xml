         <link>http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/31/antenna-videos/</link>
         <description>One of the key points at Apple's recent press conference to discuss the iPhone 4's antenna, was that the problem is not unique to the iPhone 4. To highlight this, Apple showed videos of the problem on smartphones by rival companies. Those videos were then posted to a special antenna page on Apple's website.
