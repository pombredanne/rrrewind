         <description>There’s a reason they’re trusted brands and, you expect, you’re getting higher-quality ingredients, product safety and, best of all, a much more efficient cure for just a small premium in price.

         <description>Turns out that ABC - and not executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse - threw that scene in there as a “visual aid” to ease the transition from the emotional ending of the series finale to the 11 p.m. news.</description>
