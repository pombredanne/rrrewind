         <link>http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?_r=1&amp;hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all</link>
         <description>It’s happening all over, in all sorts of families, not just young people moving back home but also young people taking longer to reach adulthood overall. It’s a development that predates the current economic doldrums, and no one knows yet what the impact will be. Getting to what we would call adulthood is happening later than ever. But why?</description>

         <title>[+739] The 15 Biggest Box Office Bombs</title>
         <link>http://www.cnbc.com/id/38815985</link>
         <description>What makes a movie a box office &quot;bomb &quot;? Just losing money doesn't make it qualify. It's the amount of loss from the production costs to ticket receipts that makes the difference. For example, 2006’s Zyzzyx Road took in a shocking $30 at the box office, but since it cost only $1 million to make, it didn't lose enough money.</description>

         <description>Theories abound for why Intel bought McAfee, but the reality is more prosaic than most imagine.

But to do that, they had to be able to offer products and services directly to the consumer.</description>
