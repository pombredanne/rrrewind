         <description>It's hard enough to find someone who could do this trick using their hands, so to witness someone execute it so flawlessly with the help of only their index fingers is nothing short of ridiculous.</description>

         <description>We can always count on Lady Gaga to wear something outrageous when she does just about anything. In fact, by the time this year ends, we are pretty certain that she already has worn costumes more outrageous than the ones listed here. 'm not complaining because it's entertaining to watch paparazzi photos of her.</description>
