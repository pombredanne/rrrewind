         <description>Sounding more like a banned iPhone app than a tablet, the iPed is exactly what you’re probably thinking: a Chinese knockoff. Now available (!!!) in Shenzhen, China, the iPed is an Intel-driven, Android-based copycat packaged like an Apple product and, to be honest… it doesn’t look half bad. An Android device for ¥9,600 ($150)? Yes, please.</description>
