         <description>The country is split over President Obama saying Harvard police acted &quot;stupidly&quot; in arresting Henry Louis Gates, Jr. But is anyone really surprised? It's just like those people, always looking out for their own. I'm talking about Harvard men, of course. I heard Conan O'Brien and Tommy Lee Jones don't even have to pay taxes now.</description>

         <description>With over 120 million units sold, no company comes close to the success that Apple has enjoyed with its iPod.
