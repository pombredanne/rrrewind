         <description>&quot;Scientology is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adepts by pseudo scientific theories... and to exercise a kind of blackmail against persons who do not wish to continue with their sect,&quot; wrote California Superior Court Judge Paul G. Breckenridge, Jr. &quot;</description>

         <description>To call Christina Hendricks' clevage &quot;epic&quot; doesn't even come close to doing it justice. Not since the days of Dolly Parton in her prime has America been so mesmerized or hypnotized by one woman's cleavage.</description>

         <description>When Veronica Rodriguez opened Wesson Attendance Center's Yearbook on Friday, she didn't find a trace of her lesbian daughter Ceara Sturgis after a long battle with school officials to include a photo of her daughter wearing a tuxedo in the school's 2010 yearbook. &quot;They didn't even put her name in it,&quot; Sturgis' mother Veronica Rodriguez said.</description>
