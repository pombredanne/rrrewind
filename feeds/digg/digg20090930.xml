         <link>http://mediamatters.org/blog/200909290042</link>
         <description>&quot;Imagine a bloodless coup to restore and defend the Constitution through an interim administration...Skilled, military-trained, nation-builders would replace accountability-challenged, radical-left commissars.

         <title>[+1135] Somewhat More Realistic Cartoon Characters</title>
         <link>http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/35759</link>
         <description>Tools like Photoshop make it easier than ever to give texture and shadow to plain line drawings, so converting our favorite cartoon characters into a more realistic style is too tempting to pass up. This is sometimes called “un-tooning.”</description>

With casualties mounting, the debate over U.S. policy in Afghanistan is sharp &amp; heated. The number of arrivals at Dover is increasing. But the journalists who once clamored to show the human cost of war are nowhere to be found.</description>
