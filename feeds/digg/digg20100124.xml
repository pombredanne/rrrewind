         <description>A group of cops, prosecutors and judges is cheering the recent successful marijuana legalization vote in the California state legislature. They liken the ban on recreational drugs to Prohibition, when the government's ill-fated attempt to end the sale of liquor created a lucrative industry for criminals. Sound familiar?</description>
