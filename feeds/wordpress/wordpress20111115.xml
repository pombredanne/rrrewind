			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is something that really grinds my gears, I have never once owned a computer printer that was not a completely useless pile of shit. They can make computers that can outsmart the guy that won Jeopardy, they can make cars that can run almost entirely on batteries, but nobody can make a printer that doesn&#8217;t jam?! Seriously!</p>
<p>The printer is nowhere near as complex as say a computer or a Playstation 3, it really only has one main function: to print out a fucking document when you need it. Have you ever noticed that when you really need to print something at the last minute your computer suddenly can&#8217;t communicate with the printer? But it works whenever you&#8217;re too lazy to write out an address to type into your GPS so you just print out the Google Maps page with the address on it. Great!</p>
<p>How can the computer not communicate to the printer that is literally 12 inches away from it and plugged into it? Forget even trying to get a networked printer to work more than 90% of the time. My last printer was able to load files from an SD card, print photo-quality images, scan, print, and cop! Yet it couldn&#8217;t identify a brand new ink cartridge that was made by the same manufacturer, was the correct number cartridge, and was exactly the same as the one that came with the printer. The box that the cartridge came in even said that it worked on my specific model number! I&#8217;m not going to mention any names but the manufacturer&#8217;s name rhymed with &#8220;Kodak&#8221;. Never buying another product from them.</p>
<p>Every printer I ever had broke or stopped working for some nonsensical reason within 2 years of purchase. I had a printer that broke from my cat sticking his paw in the paper tray. WTF? Every printer I ever had has either jammed, said it was out of paper when it clearly had 20 pieces of paper loaded in it every time I tried to print a document. Then whenever I have a large document with a bunch of pages to print, the printer decides to suck the entire 20 pages loaded in it in at once and print gibberish on every single page so that I have to throw them all away!</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that there is a little gremlin that gets inside of all of my printers and makes them malfunction just so I will have to shell out another $10o+ for a new one.</p>
<p>I think that everyone can relate to this scene from Office Space:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left Lima this morning with a heavy heart and a stuffed llama.  My volunteer work has come to an end, and my journeys from this point forward will be solo traveling.  I leave behind my <em>compañeros</em>, <em>amigos</em> and <em>niñitos,</em> and have to hope I&#8217;ll find as much joy in my next destination as I have in Lima.</p>
<div id="attachment_307" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 425px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040259.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-307  " title="Gifts" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040259.jpg?w=415&#038;h=553" alt="" width="415" height="553" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Te quiero mucho.&quot; Goodbye gifts from my roommates.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_306" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040220.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-306  " title="Fun" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040220.jpg?w=553&#038;h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Volunteers having fun, once again, in Barranco. </p></div>
<p>My last few days working in Villa El Salvador were far less frustrating than they&#8217;ve been in the past, perhaps because I didn&#8217;t care to dwell on the small annoyances on the eve of my leaving.  On Friday, Senorita Marina told the class that it was my last day and I wouldn&#8217;t be returning to them.  Their smiles disappeared and the turned to look at me with those enormous glossy puppy-dog eyes, as if asking, &#8220;Why are you leaving?  What did we do wrong?&#8221;  <em>La</em> <em>profesora</em> had them say &#8220;Gracias&#8221; and &#8220;Thank you&#8221; and sing me a heart-warming, if imperfect, rendition of &#8220;Bah Bah Black Sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>I cried.  I couldn&#8217;t help myself.  I can&#8217;t believe how attached I&#8217;ve gotten to the little <del>monsters</del> angels.  Behind each of their faces in my mind is a wealth of memories and idiosyncracies and a new respect for the individuality and creativity of small children.</p>
<div id="attachment_308" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040114.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-308  " title="Class" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040114.jpg?w=553&#038;h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Showing off their artwork</p></div>
<p>Pulling up roots and moving on is hard, especially when you didn&#8217;t particularly expect or hope for those roots to grow in the first place.  Lima has been very good to me, and I know I will be back someday.  As a tribute to this lovely and underappreciated city, I have compiled a list of quirks and eccentricities I&#8217;ve noticed in the past five weeks.  These are not necessarily isolated to Lima or Peru, and the list is far from exhaustive, but they are things I will always associate with my time there.  Enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Observations in and around Lima</strong></p>
<p>1.  Cars will not yield to humans.  Do not tempt them.</p>
<p>2.  A stop sign is really a suggestion to give a courtesy honk before flying through an intersection.  A stop light is a suggestion to yield.  Lanes?  Just rough guidelines.</p>
<div id="attachment_309" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040052.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-309  " title="Mototaxi" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040052.jpg?w=553&#038;h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The infamous moto-taxi (euphemism for rickshaw?). Yet another fun obstacle to try to avoid while driving in Lima.</p></div>
<p>3.  Peruvian time (&#8220;la hora Peruana&#8221;) is different from the time that appears on the clock.  Just subtract an hour from what you see and go take a nap.</p>
<p>4.  Ice cream is not sold in musical trucks like in the United States, but by men on bicycles.  They dress in all yellow and toot kazoos to attract attention.  The first time I heard the sound, I thought it was the death cry of an exotic bird.</p>
<div id="attachment_305" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 425px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1030893.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-305  " title="Ice cream" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1030893.jpg?w=415&#038;h=553" alt="" width="415" height="553" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peruvian ice cream trucks: The D&#039;Onofrio man. Oddly, we match.</p></div>
<p>5.  Cold is everyone&#8217;s greatest enemy.  My students come to school on days when the high is 78 degrees Fahrenheit dressed in three or four layers, and old women shiver when they see me wearing a t-shirt or tank-top outside.</p>
<p>6.  Everything tastes better with some<a href="http://southamericanfood.about.com/od/glossaryofterms/g/ajiamarillo.htm" target="_blank"> ají </a>on it.  Everything.  Including fried bananas.</p>
<p>7.  Gringos are apparently interesting enough to warrant random photo taking on the beach.</p>
<div id="attachment_310" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_2004.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-310   " title="Paparazzi?" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_2004.jpg?w=553&#038;h=354" alt="" width="553" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paparazzi? Swarms of people asking for photos deluged Mark (the tall one) and me (the yellow dress) on the beach in Punta Sal. Photo by Romana.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_311" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_2005.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-311  " title="Posing" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_2005.jpg?w=553&#038;h=414" alt="" width="553" height="414" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Posing for the cameras. Maybe they thought I was an Olsen twin? Photo by Romana.</p></div>
<p>8.  Sea food is served only for lunch, when the catch is freshest, not for dinner.</p>
<p>9.  Men here like to express their appreciation for female beauty openly and sometimes offensively.  I have never felt seriously threatened, but I still bristle at the &#8220;kissy noise&#8221; method of cat-calling.</p>
<p>10.  The worst dancers in Lima are better than the best in the US.  (Ok, exaggerating, but only a little).</p>
<p>11.  Eating cow heart (<em>anticuchos de corazon</em>) is very common and surprisingly delicious, but best enjoyed in dim lighting.</p>
<p>12.  Peruvian children are the cutest on the planet.</p>
<div id="attachment_312" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 425px"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040124.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-312  " title="Mi favorito" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p1040124.jpg?w=415&#038;h=553" alt="" width="415" height="553" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No comment necessary. The cuteness speaks for itself.</p></div>

<p><em>Why Greece?</em> I asked.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;My family is Greek and I got the shirt when I visited Greece after they had won European Championship.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes, Greece&#8217;d won the Euro, still hard to believe it. No matter what tactics they used to get there, not always a joy to watch, it is an admirable thing. Sam is a great kid, born in Montreal, but proudly shares his origins. He&#8217;s been a frequent guest in our home, a great company. Grčka (Greece, as it is called in Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian) appears even more mythical when called in one of these South Slavic languages. Go Grčka!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thecafephenomenon.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-15-at-12-35-05-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-224" title="Screen Shot 2011-11-15 at 12.35.05 PM" src="http://thecafephenomenon.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-15-at-12-35-05-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=297" alt="" width="300" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Since his debut studio album <em>Thank Me Later</em> dropped back in June 2010, Drake has been on his game. With ladies swooning, rap’s biggest names wanting to collaborate with him, four hit singles off the album, partnership with YMCMB, menthorship from Lil’ Wayne, and <em>Thank Me Later</em> being certified as platinum &#8211; you could say that the little man from Degrassi has done alright.</p>
<p>His first addictive album had a triumphant and upbeat sound, long but solid verses, and more than enough crazy hooks to cement Drake’s place on the international hip-hop scene.</p>
<p>Naturally, fans and critics have been eagerly awaiting the release of his second album. Promising to not let his creative decisions be dictated by anyone other than himself and his collaborators, Drake announced that <em>Take Care</em> would be about keeping it honest and creating songs that he truly loved. “Headlines”, the first track to be leaked on the web, even ends with a few explanatory lines for his loyal fans: “I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies; rather hear what was and what will be than what is; rather you make this an open letter&#8230;”.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://thecafephenomenon.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/take-care-drake-does-it-his-way-and-does-it-well/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/cimoNqiulUE/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>True to his word, <em>Take Care</em> is honest, introspective, and thoughtful. Fans feel like they’re getting a glimpse of the real, maybe even wiser, Drake. And the shift from popular hip-hop songs about fame, money, partying, and broads is a nice change. That’s not to say that the album is less cool or less masculine than Drake’s previous harder-hitting tracks. It’s simply a different approach. Flows about his “flashy lifestyle” do come up, but the “good guy” interior synonymous with Drake and his music envelops the album.</p>
<p>In 2009, Drizzy said <em>Thank Me Later</em> was created after studying his favourite rappers, Nas and Andre 3000. Now, in an interview with Vevo, he sites iconic artists like <span id="more-223"></span>Stevie Wonder (who is featured on the album, playing the harmonica on the heart-breaking track “Doing It Wrong”) and Tupac as inspirations for <em>Take Care</em>’s sound. As a result, most of the beats are softer and more melodic, the musicality is better, the vocals are stronger, and the collaborations are harmonious, not forced. Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, The Weekend, Lil’ Wayne, Rick Ross, and Andre 3000 make for huge featured names, but the partnerships aren’t just about pairing two superstars for commercial reasons.</p>
<p>For fans who loved the hard-hitting, repeat-worthy songs on <em>Thank Me Later</em>, check out “Headlines”, “HYFR” feat. Lil’ Wayne, and “Underground Kings”. But Drake’s strength is in the swoon-worthy, chill out tracks reminiscent of the smooth, melodic rap of 90s artists like Tupac, old school Biggie, and A Tribe Called Quest (“Over My Dead Body”, “Shot For Me”, and “Crew Love”).</p>
<p>There are also more serious and more personal tracks than what we’re used to from Drake. “Doing It Wrong” ft. Stevie Wonder and “The Real Her” ft. Lil’ Wayne and Andre 3000 make you want to just turn the lights off and listen. Their subject matter adds undeniable value to the album and makes Drizzy more relatable to his fans. There are lyrics on the kinder side: &#8220;May your neighbors respect you, trouble neglect you, angels protect you &amp; heaven accept you&#8221; (from “Shot For Me). And there are hooks and clever verses that will be playing over and over in your head: &#8220;you hate the fact that you bought the dream &amp; we sold you one&#8221; (from the title track, ft. Rihanna).</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://thecafephenomenon.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/take-care-drake-does-it-his-way-and-does-it-well/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Oblbu3aUfis/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Nothing is off the record on <em>Take Care</em>, including Drake’s private life. The flows are mostly about the music industry’s expectations, his competition, his return to the scene, his love for Toronto, his family, his recent experiences and the women in his life.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the topic of women, the contradictions come into play. Many have pegged Drake’s lyrics as womanizing at times or brash in terms of his description of strip clubs and the women who occupy them. Yet, although some flows can seem misogynistic, others are sweet verses about the women he loves/loved. “Marvin’s Room” is a ballad about him drunk dialing a girl he has feelings for, who happens to be with an undeserving guy. While the very personal “Look What You’ve Done”, a thank you to his mom for her support, ends with a clip of her speaking to Drake. The album is somewhat lyrically driven by Drizzy’s relationships with women. Like most us, there are times when he sings about being hurt and then there are times where he’s doing the hurting.</p>
<p>Drake’s singing is at it&#8217;s best on <em>Take Care</em>, as he continues to blur the lines between hip-hop and R&amp;B. He surprises with his strength &#8211; sometimes even making you wonder if he&#8217;s really the one singing that part. Strong vocals are also present on the powerful track “Lord Knows” ft. Rick Ross, when both rappers are backed by an entire gospel choir.</p>
<p>The beauty of the album is that despite the pressure and fame, Drake&#8217;s still keeping it real. He seems to know what the industry wants right now (smoother, more personable rap) and has the perspective and talent to deliver it. Ever aware of his strengths, he&#8217;s mastered the art of the slow-burn. <em>Take Care</em> boasts strong lyrics that you want to pay attention to, melodies that are sometimes nothing short of gorgeous, and powerhouse collaborations. Drizzy gives his fans all of himself and, as a result, you feel as if you’ve just been let in on the real side of Drake.</p>
<div>Although the album was leaked early (an unfortunate recurring theme with Drake’s releases), it’s still predicted to sell well today. The official release date for <em>Take Care </em>was set for November 15. As a testament to his class, Drake tweeted kindly about the leak on November 6th: “Listen, enjoy it, buy it if you like it&#8230;and take care until next time.”It&#8217;s safe to say, we have a long term crush on Drizzy. The album is his best stuff yet and it’s nice to know that he&#8217;s one Canadian artist whose success is also long term. When it comes to Drake, there’s no doubting that &#8220;the real is on the rise&#8221;.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rating</span>: 9/10.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ran the half marathon and I don&#8217;t even know what to say about it.<br />
It was awesome&#8230; every single bit of it.  But to be honest, there isn&#8217;t<br />
much TO say about it.  Nothing incredibly dramatic happened, no big<br />
life lessons were learned, there was no <a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/couch-to-10k-the-results/">crazy sprint to the finish</a>, and although it was a huge &#8211; HUGE &#8211; achievement for me, it lacks the feeling of a life-changing event.  I<br />
think that&#8217;s becasue the life-changing things are already happening &#8211; they&#8217;re happening every day that I run, every day that I train, and every day that I fight the mental battle of &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this&#8221; and get out there and do it anyway.  Today I read a quote that I really loved.  It said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be days you don&#8217;t think you can run a marathon. There will be a lifetime of knowing you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen to that.</p>
<p>There were funny things that happened, though, that I&#8217;d like to remember.<br />
Such as the fact that pretty early in the race, we found an older<br />
gentleman right on our heels, speed-walking.  Talk about a flashback!!!<br />
When he passed us, I decided it would be in my best interest NOT to<br />
give chase.  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>As usual, the first two miles or so were the toughest for me and right around mile 3, I wanted to quit.  I asked myself: &#8220;are your legs hurting?  Are your feet hurting?  Are you having trouble breathing?&#8221; and when I discovered that the answer to each of<br />
these questions was &#8220;no,&#8221; I gave my legs a little pep talk: &#8220;Legs&#8230;<br />
tell your brain that it might as well stop complaining, because you&#8217;re<br />
not stopping!&#8221;  From there, things got easier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, how I argue with myself when I&#8217;m running.  At mile 6, Confident Me had a<br />
conversation with Doubtful Me that went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>CM: You&#8217;re halfway there!!!</p>
<p>DM: OHHHHHHHHH&#8230; that means I have to do what I just did ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!  <em>GROANWINEMOANCOMPLAIN!!!</em></p>
<p>CM: Yea, but now you&#8217;re all warmed up for it!</p></blockquote>
<p>I think one of my favorite times in the race came at mile 10&#8230;<br />
(actually, all in honesty it came at mile 9 but I&#8217;d rather not admit<br />
that!) when I realized (or rather, thought I realized) that I only had<br />
three more miles to go and said to myself: &#8220;just a 5k left!&#8221;  I<br />
understood then how far I&#8217;ve come because there was a time, and not very<br />
long ago, when I couldn&#8217;t run a 5k.  And when I realized that I&#8217;d done the math wrong, well, what&#8217;s one more mile?  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I think it really settled in that I was going to do this when I passed the second water station, at mile 4.  The water tables were stationed every 2 miles and so I decided to count the miles by the water stations.  At mile 4, there were only 4 more water stations to go, which mentally helped me to put things into perspective.  That, and the fact that after my disastrous 12 mile run two weeks ago, I called my friend Patrick to complain: &#8220;do you know how FAR 12 miles is?&#8221;  Without missing a beat, he responded: &#8220;do you know how SHORT 12 miles is?&#8221;  That really put things into perspective, too.  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it was easy.  In fact, I&#8217;m pretty well convinced that I<br />
would have been better served and ended up with a better time had I<br />
walked some of the way instead of trying to run it all.  There were<br />
several times &#8211; especially on the hills &#8211; when I know I could have<br />
walked it faster than I was running it.  There were run/walkers who<br />
came in far ahead of me, and many people who walked the entire way who<br />
went faster than me (including the older gentleman who, after a mile or so, I couldn&#8217;t even spot in the distance.)  But this wasn&#8217;t about having a good time or being<br />
fast.  This was about forcing my body to do something it&#8217;s never done<br />
before.  Forcing myself to accomplish something I&#8217;ve worked so incredibly<br />
hard to do.  I wouldn&#8217;t have been disappointed with myself if I&#8217;d had to<br />
walk, but I wanted to do my very best.  And on Saturday, November 12th,<br />
my very best enabled me to run &#8211; not walk &#8211; 13.1 miles.</p>
<p>Thanks to Manuela, I have several pictures of myself running the race, that<br />
I&#8217;ll always treasure.  Incidentally, that&#8217;s a great illustration of the<br />
difference between Manuela running and Rina running&#8230; Rina: lock eyes<br />
on one tiny spot in the distance and concentrate on putting one foot in<br />
front of the other and trying to breathe.  Manuela: take in the<br />
scenery, snap a few photos, talk on the phone&#8230;  Poor Manuela, I make a<br />
pretty lousy running partner.</p>
<p>Here we are, together before the race:</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard01-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-7017"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7017" title="Clipboard01" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard01.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>(Love the port-a-potties in the background.)</p>
<p>This is probably my favorite picture that Manuela took during the race, because it was during a stretch through the park that I really enjoyed.</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard06/" rel="attachment wp-att-7018"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7018" title="Clipboard06" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard06.jpg?w=500&#038;h=836" alt="" width="500" height="836" /></a></p>
<p>This next one makes me laugh, because right before she took it, Manuela asked me &#8220;do you want me to take a picture of you from the front or the back?&#8221;  And I groaned: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; and thought it was crazy that she could even THINK about taking pictures right that moment!</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard07/" rel="attachment wp-att-7019"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7019" title="Clipboard07" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard07.jpg?w=640&#038;h=382" alt="" width="640" height="382" /></a>Manuela talks a lot about bringing her good camera with her on these runs, and in theory I agree that it would make for some beautiful pictures, but I know in practice that I wouldn&#8217;t take a single one.  Something about my need for oxygen and the fact that if I stop I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to start again makes it pretty unlikely that I&#8217;ll ever be able to advertise myself as The Running Photographer.  I&#8217;ll gladly let Manuela corner that market.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve shown off the back of this shirt before, here&#8217;s a closeup:</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard08/" rel="attachment wp-att-7020"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7020" title="Clipboard08" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard08.jpg?w=244&#038;h=301" alt="" width="244" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch it in the other picture, the front of it says (or said, before we changed &#8220;10k&#8221; to &#8220;half marathon&#8221;) &#8220;couch to 10k.&#8221;  Manuela and I and two of our other friends, Michelle and Amy, got them to run our last race in, and the backs have each of our personal weight loss numbers and goals on them.</p>
<p>Here I am, in the last stretch, fiddling with my ipod.  Pretty sure I was trying to find &#8220;Faith Enough.&#8221;  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard04-crop-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-7021"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7021" title="Clipboard04 crop" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard04-crop1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=836" alt="" width="500" height="836" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll look closely, you&#8217;ll see that my left foot is off the ground while the right foot is making contact.  In the rules of speed walking, this would disqualify me as a RUNNER, thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>Need a closer look?</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard02/" rel="attachment wp-att-7016"><img title="Clipboard02" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard02.jpg?w=640&#038;h=382" alt="" width="640" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>Right foot: OFF the ground.  Left foot: ON the ground.  RUNNING.</p>
<p>My friend Michelle took this one, as I came up on the finish line!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard09/" rel="attachment wp-att-7022"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7022" title="Clipboard09" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard09.jpg?w=640&#038;h=491" alt="" width="640" height="491" /></a>You can see my husband in the back, watching (he&#8217;s the guy with the beard and the sunglasses.)  He actually ran in with me, and then left me just before I got to the finish line so I could cross it on my own.  Running with him at the end was absolutely wonderful!</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard18/" rel="attachment wp-att-7039"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7039" title="Clipboard18" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard18.jpg?w=640&#038;h=493" alt="" width="640" height="493" /></a></p>

<p>Official time: 2:56:08  (not sure why the clock here says 2:58:35, on the website it&#8217;s posted as 2:56:08&#8230; either way, I don&#8217;t care, I made it under 3 hours!!!)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Manuela running in (she came in before me):</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard15/" rel="attachment wp-att-7024"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7024" title="Clipboard15" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard15.jpg?w=638&#038;h=459" alt="" width="638" height="459" /></a></p>

<p>Crying on Michelle&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>Crying on Jon&#8217;s shoulder:</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard17/" rel="attachment wp-att-7029"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7029" title="Clipboard17" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard17.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The bling:</p>

<p>We did it!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://rinamarie.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/well-i-did-it-from-260lbs-to-half-marathon/clipboard14/" rel="attachment wp-att-7027"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7027" title="Clipboard14" src="http://rinamarie.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/clipboard14.jpg?w=628&#038;h=509" alt="" width="628" height="509" /></a></p>
<p>Afterward, we came home and I had Jon and Bunchkin take some pictures of me with my medal:</p>

<p>30 minutes later, my daughter took one last picture:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been turning the thought of making custard over in my mind even before November&#8217;s  <a href="http://mycustardpie.com/2011/11/01/custard-mingle/">monthly mingle</a> (hosted by <a href="http://mycustardpie.com/">My Custard Pie</a>) was announced.  But, I always hesitate a bit about custard&#8211;not because I&#8217;m worried about the classic concerns, such as a glum pudding that resembles runny scrambled eggs (though I worry about that too) or that comes out overcooked (also angst-worthy)&#8211;but because it feels a bit profligate to use all those egg yolks.  I feel bad wasting whites, <a href="http://threecleversisters.com/kitchen-notebook/">so I keep them in my freezer until&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Yes, the guilt.  (What is that old saw about women feeling needlessly guilty all the time?)  My husband, who is very encouraging of my making of custard, has been trying to convince me this is silly and to <em>just make some already.  (</em>Might I note that he also is blissfully unaware of my constant reshuffling of the fridge, shifting expiring items forward and sliding unopened milk cartons and orange juices jugs towards the rear).</p>
<p><a title="Maple Custard (4 of 6) by SaraBClever, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35543556@N00/6339139680/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6339139680_12e5a33a2d.jpg" alt="Maple Custard (4 of 6)" width="500" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>Much as some of us buy new gym clothes to encourage us to work out (with not always stellar effect)  I not-so-recently bought some miniature cocotte pots at Williams Sonoma&#8217;s (ahem) Christmas clearance sale (ahem) last January.  (Another takeaway from this is to never doubt the power of the words &#8220;50% off already reduced prices.&#8221;  Please note I was only seduced by very deep discounting:  I don&#8217;t want you to think I spent the originally stickered $50 each). </p>
<p>And while you might think the fact that I had to pull those stickers off of them last week to make this custard could be the irrefutable proof that they were an unwise impulse buy, I have no regrets.  They are just too charming.  You know how it goes with things in miniature.  And in my defense, it could have been worse.  I could have decided I needed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?ref%5F=nb%5Fsb%5Fnoss&amp;url=search-alias%3Dgarden&amp;field-keywords=kitchen%20blowtorch&amp;rd=1">kitchen blowtorch </a>for creme brulee while I was at it.  (Oddly, my husband thinks this would be a sensible purchase.  This seems to beg another cliché about men and fire).</p>
<p>Now that this preamble is out of the way, on to the custard.</p>
<p><a title="Maple Custard (3 of 6) by SaraBClever, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35543556@N00/6338387617/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6338387617_611d1712b2.jpg" alt="Maple Custard (3 of 6)" width="500" height="396" /></a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but love this whole genre:  creme caramels, pots de creme, crema catalana, flan, puddings&#8230;I went through a period where I just kept ordering creme brulees on the restaurant menu, until I realized I was becoming far too predictable and it was time to stop neglecting the other desserts out there.  But one resists change:  if dessert is about comfort, it&#8217;s hard to get more at that essence than this. </p>
<p>With just three components, using good ingredients matters, as does technique (for more on that, please see <a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/shuna/">Shuna Lydon&#8217;s </a> very helpful <a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/shuna/2011/03/food52-hones-in-on-custard-making-with-me-at-peels-pastrylandia.html">video tutorials </a>over at <a title="Food52" href="http://www.food52.com/" rel="homepage">food52</a>.)  I used my favorite Berkshires <a href="http://highlawnfarm.com/">Jersey cream </a>and local maple syrup.  (Sadly, my source for free-range eggs has dried up, as chickens don&#8217;t lay as much when the days are shorter). </p>
<p>As for the technique, please see those videos I mentioned above, but here&#8217;s a few comments of my own.  You&#8217;ll need to place your custard cups in a water bath:  set your filled cups in a large cake pan, and then fill up about an inch or so with hot water.  Make sure it&#8217;s hot, or it will never finish cooking (as I learned with a bad bread pudding episode).  And make sure not to add too much water, or you risk splashing yourself&#8211;ouch&#8211;or your custards&#8211;sniff&#8211;with it when you go to remove the finished product from the oven.  (Again, I learned the hard way).  A hot water bath ensures your custards bake gently, resulting in a creamy, gliding texture.</p>
<p><a title="Maple Custard (2 of 6) by SaraBClever, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35543556@N00/6338387561/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/6338387561_7fc55e0e7d.jpg" alt="Maple Custard (2 of 6)" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The other potential misstep is making a custard that more closely resembles oversweetened, runny scrambled eggs.   The same principle of the water bath applies:  You want to be sure you do not allow the yolks to cook too quickly when they first come into contact with your hot milk or cream.  Temper the eggs by stirring only a bit of the hot cream into your eggs, whisking well to prevent lumps.  Add a bit more, whisk, and then you can finally completely combine all the cream&#8211;but keep whisking!  <em>Tempering</em> merely means bringing two items of differing temperatures to the same temperature (it&#8217;s often done with chocolate as well). </p>
<p>As further insurance, strain your custard mixture through a fine mesh sieve.  This will strain out any large cooked egg particles, as well as those stringy fibrous bits of egg white that can cling to even a well-separated yolk. (The technical name is  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalaza">chalazae</a>, but please don&#8217;t ask me how to pronounce it).</p>
<p><a title="Maple Custard (6 of 6) by SaraBClever, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35543556@N00/6338387819/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6039/6338387819_c13f1cc168.jpg" alt="Maple Custard (6 of 6)" width="500" height="355" /></a></p>
<p>This dessert:  subtle but delicious.  The maple was almost a background note, floating lightly and delicately in the rich pudding.  The custard tasted almost nutty to me at first, which was startling, but then made perfect sense:  why else would maple pair so pleasingly with nuts, from pecans to walnuts? </p>
<p><em><strong>Baked Maple Custard</strong></em> (adapted from Lindsay Shere&#8217;s  <a class="zem_slink" title="Chez Panisse Desserts" href="http://www.amazon.com/Chez-Panisse-Desserts-Lindsey-Shere/dp/0679755713%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0679755713" rel="amazon">Chez Panisse Desserts</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2c maple syrup</li>
<li>6 egg yolks</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325F.</p>
<p>Heat the cream until steaming hot.  Whisk the syrup into the egg yolks (do not allow the mixture to sit unmixed as the sugar will chemically &#8220;cook&#8221; the yolks).  Pour about a 1/4 c or so of the hot cream mixture into the yolk-sugar mixture, whisking all the while.  Add about another 1/4-1/2c and whisk.  You can now add this back into the hot cream, continuing to whisk.</p>
<p>Pour into your custard cups (anything ceramic or cast iron will work well).  Use a kitchen scale to make sure you pour the same amount into each cup, so that everything bakes evenly.  Set your cups into a cake pan, and fill halfway up the sides of your custard cups with hot water.  Place in the oven.  (You can also add the water after you put the pan in the oven).  Lay a piece of aluminum foil over your cups.</p>
<p>Bake for 45 minutes or up to 60 minutes or more (a deeper pot, like mine, will cook more slowly).  Your custard will still jiggle when it is done, and you can use a tester to double-check.  (If it comes out clean, it&#8217;s definitely done and hopefully not overdone).  Chill before serving.  (We ate it warm, and it&#8217;s certainly good that way, though better cold).</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:   Since maple syrup is the star here, it&#8217;s worth saying a few words.  Maple syrup comes in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup#Grades"> various grades</a>.  Grade A &#8220;Fancy&#8221; is perhaps the most well-known, but Grade B (which is preferred by &#8220;real&#8221; New Englanders) has a more robust flavor.  (This recipe in fact suggests Grade C maple, which I have never seen for purchase)    I usually buy only Grade B, but here I used a mix of A and B, for no other reason than that I was trying to use up a small jar of Grade A syrup I bought at the farmer&#8217;s market <em>last</em> year.  Please don&#8217;t tell me if maple syrup doesn&#8217;t keep that long.  I don&#8217;t want to know).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice, if you watch the videos (which I hope you do) that I did not incorporate all of Shuna&#8217;s suggestions.  Namely because I started these custards too late in the day!  But I hope to try all of her tricks very soon.</p>
