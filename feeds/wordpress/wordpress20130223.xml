				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Or not. Because that&#8217;s just stupid.</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#8217;m interested in the actual topic of inspiration versus just sit down and work.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure: I am not good at anything but writing. I have a creative brain but little in the way of skills. My crafting is almost always a one-time thing. I would never call myself a good artist (and I believe my art school instructors would hasten to agree with me). I have no skill with language or math, a terrible memory for history and facts, and a sort of stereotypical dislike for science. In short, I could never be anything but a writer. I just suck at everything else.</p>
<p>I do not think I am special. If anything, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m more pathetic than your average bear. My skills are rooted in sitting around and amusing myself with imaginary people, and then typing what I think. It&#8217;s not a far cry from a monkey with a typewriter, except for the fact I rarely throw feces.</p>
<p>You did catch the <em>rarely</em> part, right?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in inspiration. Inspiration sounds entirely too divine to describe what I do. I sit,  I think, and my brain does its job. WELL DONE, BRAIN. Here&#8217;s a cookie in the form of endorphins brought on by sex and wine.</p>
<p>I fear for those writers who elevate the process to something akin to a religious experience. We are not God, even in our little made-up worlds. Stories, in order to function, require a more articulate hand than that of God. It&#8217;s tinkering, not a great flood or&#8230; something (let&#8217;s be honest here: not only am I not a Biblical scholar, but I don&#8217;t really care, either. I was raised by apathetic agnostics, after all. Our spiritual beliefs are summed up with an &#8220;eh, I suppose something could be out there. Or not.&#8221;)</p>
<p>To believe one is evolved, elevated, in such a way is dangerous dangerous thinking. To claim one needs inspiration to churn out a clump of words is ridiculous. Wouldn&#8217;t you think a neurosurgeon refusing to operate because he was &#8220;lacking inspiration&#8221; horrifying? How self-indulgent.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, a writer isn&#8217;t really saving lives (let&#8217;s not get too metaphorical here). But the commentary still stands.</p>
<p>A writer is a writer because they write. Sitting around and not writing is, what, a thinker? And he doesn&#8217;t even <em>move</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all week, people.</p>
<p>PS. I misspelled &#8220;inspiration&#8221; every single time I attempted it in this post. My inability to spell can be a topic for another time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Yesterday a car did a burn-out in my street. It was noisy and disruptive and smelly and offensive.</b></p>
<p>I could see the car doing it. I could read the registration number. And I thought: if I was wearing <a title="Google Glasses explanation, Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Glass" target="_blank">Google Glasses</a> right now, I could record this. And then perhaps pass it onto the police for them to follow up. Or post to YouTube for the audiences who like that type of thing.</p>
<p>I’m excited by Google Glasses.</p>
<p>I love the idea of easily being able to capture and share images and video. This includes sharing imagery with others live.</p>
<p><b>But I’m also pondering what could go wrong.</b></p>
<p>If Google Glasses become widely used, there’s potential for a massive impact on our behaviour and in particular the way we interact with each other.</p>
<p>Imagine somebody wearing Google glasses and sharing their experience while they’re:</p>
<ul>
<li>being sanctioned in the workplace</li>
<li>in a classroom where a teacher is reprimanding a student</li>
<li>witness to a street fight</li>
<li>having an argument with their spouse</li>
<li>being interviewed for a job</li>
<li>at the scene of an accident where a resuscitation is taking place</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2115" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 265px"><a href="http://prakky.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/prakkygoogleglasses2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2115" alt="Mega artistic vision of a Google Glasses future by Prakky" src="http://prakky.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/prakkygoogleglasses2.jpg?w=255&#038;h=300" width="255" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mega artistic vision of a Google Glasses future by Prakky</p></div>
<p>If you and I are having an important conversation – even a dispute – and I put on my pair of Google Glasses, how would you react?</p>
<p>Some spaces – schools, workplaces – may ban such devices. But what’s to stop a person walking down a street capturing that image of you littering / jaywalking / falling over/ picking your nose?</p>
<p><i>Sure. We’re all going to be super well behaved so it won’t matter.</i></p>
<p>Which raises the question: could Google Glasses’ content be the subject of witness accounts and therefore court proceedings? What does that mean – not just for us but for Google as a company?</p>
<p><b>Think sexting is a problem now?</b></p>
<p>Imagine the ease of filming – and live sharing – your girlfriend or boyfriend disrobing, showering, dancing around naked and so on. (Sure, wearing Google glasses may reduce your chances of reaching said intimacy, but hey …)</p>
<p>Do celebrities wish the paparazzi and Twitter and Instagram hadn’t been invented? Just wait until the world’s wearing Google Glasses!</p>
<p>There were complaints when Google Streetview was relatively new, and captured images of some people doing embarrassing things. We seem to have learned to live with Streetview now. (The Google Streetview capture of our house shows one of my son’s putting out the rubbish bins. A rare moment captured for the world). And yes, we already have the technology to be able to share images and video quickly and easily. But we’re talking about <i>glasses</i> here, people! Minimalist-looking glasses which could become ubiquitous and make us think twice about what we do in our everyday lives for fear of being on the world’s stage or having our recorded actions pored over later by others without context.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I can see that Google Glasses can be used for good rather than evil.</p>
<div id="attachment_2116" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 281px"><a href="http://prakky.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/prakkygoogleglasses.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2116" alt="Google Glasses cartoon" src="http://prakky.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/prakkygoogleglasses.jpg?w=271&#038;h=300" width="271" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not that I cook .. but, envisioning Google Glasses future at the family dinner table</p></div>
<p>It’s the same case with social media. We have wonderful supportive communities online. We also  have horrendous and hurtful trolling. It comes down to unpredictable and wide-ranging human behaviour.</p>
<p><b>For some, the glasses may have sensational impacts:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Medical practitioners might share what they’re viewing and seek advice from colleagues</li>
<li>Coaches and teachers can impart advise and knowledge over distances</li>
<li>‘Citizen journalists’ could share footage</li>
<li>Families can share special moments with those who can’t be there: cutting the birthday cake, saying I Do, sending a grandchild to their first day of school</li>
<li>We could more easily document our lives for future generations</li>
</ul>
<p>Here in Adelaide, roving radio reporters like ABC radio’s Spence Denny could capture what they’re seeing. Today, Spence describes events on air for the studio journalists and listeners, and also shares images on social media. But if he can capture that burst water main with his Google Glasses?</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not the first person to ask these questions and envisage a scary future. <a title="TNW article on Google Glasses" href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/09/16/do-google-glasses-present-serious-privacy-problem-overreacting" target="_blank">The Next Web </a>said: “The glasses situation comes down to each of us deciding how much is too much sharing and when we’ve finally lost too much privacy” .  But most criticism seems to revolve around the potential of ads being pushed at us, and Google storing data about our behaviour and movements, rather than an examination of how it may change us.</p>
<p><a title="ABC news blog" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/04/google-glasses-will-you-want-google-tracking-your-eyes/" target="_blank">Jonathan Macintosh</a> made a video about the privacy implications of Google glasses, demonstrating what it might look like to the wearer, should Google layer the experience with advertising:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/_mRF0rBXIeg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Sure, you don’t have to wear Google glasses.</p>
<p><i>But our Google Glasses experience can be impacted by others.</i></p>
<p><b>We may not be the wearer. But we may be star of the film.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the_enchantments-950.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5876" alt="Backlit Alpine Larches at Crystal Lake in The Enchantments" src="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the_enchantments-950.jpg?w=720"   /></a><em>Golden Alpine Larches reflecting in the turquoise waters of Crystal Lake</em></p>
<p>Our goals for the two days in the Lower Enchantments were modest: we wanted to explore the shores of Inspiration Lake and Talisman Lakes, and hike up to Gnome Tarn to get the classic and oft-repeated photograph of Prusik Peak reflecting in the tarn. Distances are not long up here, so our day hikes were to be at a leisurely pace, allowing us to photograph these Indian Summer days to our heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>One hike took us to Prusik Pass. When we reached the pass, there was a cold torrent of wind funneled over this low place on the ridge. We had to put on extra layers, and we watched as the forest fires on distant ridges blew up in billows of fresh smoke. I was photographing when I heard a sudden shout of horror: one of our group had his camera on a tripod, and a sudden blast of wind tossed it right off a ledge onto the rocks below, damaging an expensive piece of equipment. I learned a quick lesson by his experience, and clung to my gear as the wind howled.</p>
<p><a href="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-520.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5801" alt="Prusik Peak Viewed from Gnome Tarn in The Enchantments" src="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-520.jpg?w=720"   /></a><em>Prusik Peak reflecting in Gnome Tarn</em></p>
<p>From Prusik Pass, we bushwhacked up and over a ridge to get to Gnome Tarn. The tarn was diminished in size by a seasonal drought, so the shores were extensive and muddy. Clouds skittered across the sky in the high winds, sending their shadows racing to keep up. A Peregrine Falcon zoomed overhead. Below us, a pair of male Mountain Bluebirds, the color of sky captured in feathers, were a perfect complement to the golden Alpine Larch needles where they foraged.</p>
<p>Since the shore was so muddy, I laid down atop a plastic bag and waited patiently or impatiently for the sun to light up the peak in between long periods of shadows. I also waited for the wind to subside, so that the ripples on the tarn would diminish, making for a better reflection. With my companions, I waited &#8230; and waited &#8230; and got chilled almost to the bone. But the peak was finally revealed enough that I got some good pictures of The Enchantments&#8217; iconic peak. Toward dark, the clouds grew thicker, and several of us decided that the peak had passed. The most persistent among us (not me) hung on longer, and got the best pictures of the day. Oh well; it&#8217;s always hard to know when to hold em or fold em in poker, and sometimes photography is the same way.</p>
<p><a href="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-528.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5802" alt="Prusik Peak Viewed from Gnome Tarn in The Enchantments" src="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-528.jpg?w=720"   /></a><em>Prusik Peak at Gnome Tarn, where sunlight and shadow fleetingly crossed the peak</em></p>
<p>We cooked a late dinner of Backpacker&#8217;s Pantry Pad Thai and crawled into our tents. Or at least most of us did, I stayed  out in the dark to try and get a few more pictures. The sky had cleared substantially by now, though there were still some clouds racing by. I was struck by the look of all four of our tents lit up by headlamps, so I asked everyone to cooperate for photos of the group of illuminated tents looking like fragile, glowing nylon fairies in the night. Then I noticed the clouds over a distant ridge; a full moon was rising and backlighting the clouds that were racing over the ridge.</p>

<p>The next morning was to be our hike into the Upper Enchantments, which I&#8217;ll describe in another blog post, but before beginning that hike we went about our regular morning activities. These included a pre-dawn hike up the rocky slope behind camp to Inspiration Lake, where there was lovely dawn light on the surrounding peaks–and where the outhouse was located. Actually, it was not really an outhouse, since the vault toilet had a seat, but no walls. It was more like a throne with a great view through a sheer curtain of golden larch needles. It was beautiful enough to encourage us to &#8220;Skip to the loo &#8230;&#8221; Sitting there, I knew I was missing some great light, so I tried to speed things along, and eventually finished and ran down to where I had left my camera and tripod. Fortunately, I was not too late and was able to capture the red glow on the ragged peaks towering over the lake.</p>

<p>Each morning was cold in The Enchantments; after all, we were in the mountains in October, when the golden Alpine Larches were spreading the word that the end of warmth was near. One of our group was a young guy with not much meat on his bones, and he shivered and lay wide awake all night. He said:  &#8220;It was almost the worst night of my life.&#8221; When I asked him what night had been worse, he replied &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t think of any.&#8221; He decided he had gotten all the great pictures he needed, and decided to hike out on his own, two days early. It&#8217;s a good thing he got out when he did, because the next morning it was 16°F, which makes me shiver just thinking about it. It was so cold that it was painful to brush our teeth, and the water bottles were nearly frozen solid.</p>

<p>We met occasional hikers in the high country, with more as the days sped by and people realized that The Enchantments weren&#8217;t going up in flames. I often wear a University of Michigan baseball cap, which advertises my alma mater. It is amazing how many people I encounter in the Pacific Northwest who grew up in Michigan, went to the University of Michigan, then moved out West for better economic opportunities. It is a real brain drain for Michigan, but that is another story.</p>
<p>Anyway, on one morning near Perfection Lake, there was a pretty, young woman hiking alone. She struck up a conversation when she saw my cap: it turned out that she had grown up in Ann Arbor and had recently gotten her medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical School and was now doing her emergency room residency at a Seattle hospital. Her mother from Michigan had hiked as far as Snow Lakes with her, but the steep climb from there was too much for her Midwestern legs, so she stayed back in camp. The bad part about meeting a new young doctor, as I get older, is the nagging feeling that &#8220;surely she can&#8217;t be old enough to be a doctor!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old and young Alpine Larches, blazing gold, were everywhere in the Lower Enchantments. As the week wore on and the cold and high winds took their toll, more and more needles lost their color and fell, but there were still concentrations of intense gold.</p>
<p><a href="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-462.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5791" alt="Hiker with Prusik Peak and Perfection Lake in Autumn in The Ench" src="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the_enchantments-462.jpg?w=720"   /></a><em>One of my companions looking across Perfection Lake toward Prusik Peak, with a vast panorama of golden Alpine Larches</em></p>
<p>I grew up in the Midwest and have lived in the Northeast and the Rocky Mountains, so I am well-acquainted with autumn colors: Red Maples burn with scarlet intensity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; Sugar Maples glow brilliantly in Vermont; and Trembling Aspens shiver with golden light in Colorado. Here in the Northwest, autumn color was a bit of a disappointment until I learned about the timberline Alpine Larches. These are unusual, in that larches are a decidious conifer that somewhere along the evolutionary path strayed from the law that conifers are evergreen. Even here in Washington, the Evergreen State, they drop their needles.</p>
<p><a href="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the_enchantments-926.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5868" alt="Autumn Alpine Larch Needles along Perfection Lake in The Enchant" src="http://leerentz.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the_enchantments-926.jpg?w=720"   /></a><em>Alpine Larch with golden needles and a cone, with the aqua waters of Perfection Lake forming a beautiful backdrop</em></p>
<p>For a tree living at timberline, where snow falls by the foot rather than by the inch, there are certain advantages to losing needles. The trees don&#8217;t have to carry as heavy a snow load with all the needles gone, so branches are less likely to break. Without needles, the larches don&#8217;t have to feed hungry Mountain Goats all winter. The trees don&#8217;t suffer as much from the dessicating effects of frigid winter winds. Perhaps most important, the vital amino acids, which are the building blocks for healthy needles, are safely tucked away in the roots and trunks of these trees living on the edge.</p>

<p>The other trees growing at timberline were the Whitebark Pines. These pines were more scattered than the larches, and have a fascinating co-evolutionary relationship with Clark&#8217;s Nutcrackers that I described in an earlier post about <a title="Clark's Nutcrackers in Banff National Park" href="http://wp.me/peJRU-X6" target="_blank">Clark&#8217;s Nutcrackers in Banff National Park</a>. We observed several of the nutcrackers flying through The Enchantments, commuting to their favorite trees. Whitebark Pines are threatened by White Pine Blister Rust, a disease imported from another part of the world, and by the Pine Bark Beetle, which has exploded in population as our climate has warmed.</p>
<p>Huckleberry leaves were scarlet, but there weren&#8217;t many berries to sample: it was another bad year for the bears. Mountain Bog Gentians bloomed in our campsite, and there were occasional purple asters along the trails. I associate these species with the last gasp of the dying summer in the high country, but it&#8217;s nice that they provide a bit of vivid purple to the landscape.</p>

<p>We camped on Perfection Lake, or was it Rune Lake? Both names are used. The U.S. Forest Service originally established the place names of The Enchantments, and used such workable but rather dull names such as Perfection Lake, Inspiration Lake, and Isolation Lake. But the names got complicated when Bill and Peg Stark began visiting The Enchantments starting in 1959, and gave new names to the lakes, tarns, and peaks, based upon the legend of King Arthur and Norse mythology. Thus Perfection Lake also became Rune Lake. Inspiration Lake became Talisman Lake. Gnome Tarn is a name of their creation, as is Aasgard Pass. The place names of The Enchantments are now officially a blend of the two naming conventions, and there is enough overlap to cause plenty of confusion. Which makes the experience more fun. Myself: I love all the mythological names.</p>

<p>On these golden days in the Lower Enchantments, there was plenty of leisurely time for watching a pair of Meadow Voles leap from their grassy nest, and examining the texture of ice forming on the edge of a pond. Sometimes, people get so wrapped up in hiking long distances in the mountains that they fail to stop and smell the gentians. Not us: we revel in these long days of nature observation and photography.</p>
<p>A highlight was twice seeing a Douglas Squirrel race by, along the shore of Talisman Lake, with a big mushroom in its mouth. Mushrooms are a favorite food of squirrels, and they often store a mushroom among the twigs of a shrub, perhaps to dry it out for later storage or perhaps to let the rain leach out toxins. I&#8217;m not sure which, but I find the behavior fascinating. Can it really be instinctive to temporarily store a mushroom in the open? Other wildlife was scarce; the marmots had apparently already entered hibernation. We saw a single Pika and found its stored haypiles near our camp.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Link to Stiglitz article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-is-now-a-myth-2012-6"><img class="aligncenter" alt="wealth and inequality" src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/4bbcbdbb7f8b9acb194a0300-593-446/wealth-and-inequality.gif" width="417" height="313" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In The <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/the-great-divide/">New York Times’ series</a> on inequality in America, Columbia professor and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz recently argued that measurable social mobility in America is incongruent with the often ascribed “land of opportunity” label.  Stiglitz did reference <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2007/11/generations-isaacs">data</a> from a reputable source (The Brookings Institution) to draw his conclusions, but his interpretation of said data is perplexing.</p>
<p>According to Stiglitz, “only 58 percent of Americans born into the bottom fifth of income earners move out of that category, and just 6 percent born into the bottom fifth move into the top.”</p>
<p>The word “only” in that statement is an interesting rhetorical choice. I don’t know exactly what percentage of America’s poorest children the professor thinks should be moving out of the untouchable caste, but 58% seems pretty good. And while 6% seems rather paltry when I pay sales tax on a Burger King Whopper, the fact that 6 out of 100 of the most indigent kids in America can go from dirt poor to filthy rich sounds almost too <i>good</i> to be true.</p>
<p>This is certainly all a matter of perspective, right? Maybe not.<span id="more-76"></span></p>
<p>Stiglitz is obviously concerned with the 42% of American children who are quite literally stuck in a cycle of poverty, and this is noble. No decent non-Republican human being would argue that these 42% are undeserving of assistance just because others were able to succeed. However, Stiglitz completely ignored the flip-side to upward mobility in America: downward mobility. Maybe he simply overlooked it—or maybe, more likely, he dismissed it because the facts don’t support his thesis.</p>
<p>I would never have imagined that so many of America&#8217;s poorest were able to climb at least one rung of the social ladder. The revelation that so many could (whether thanks to government assistance or despite government dependency) made me wonder about my preconceptions about the richest Americans. Before reading the Stiglitz article, I always thought it was a general rule that the poor got poorer and the rich got richer, generationally speaking anyway. Since Stiglitz made no mention of what happens to kids born to the richest parents, I went to the source.</p>
<p>The Brookings report indicated that 61% of children born into families at the top income quintile FALL into a lesser bracket. That’s right “only” 39% of the richest kids stay the richest kids. Relatively speaking, this means that if you were solely concerned with social mobility, you would be statistically better off being born into one of the poorest families (58% chance of moving up) than being born into one of the richest families (61% chance of moving down).</p>
<p>I don’t deny that more equality of opportunity in this country is needed in order to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance to reach the socio-economic status they desire. I am a strong advocate for government assistance, public education, and universal health care. However, people like Joseph Stiglitz, who support similar agendas for helping the poor, are doing themselves and the progressive cause a disservice when they try to shape a debate with deceptively selective data and phrases like “only 58%.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thewordsisaw.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/africa-by-peter-reid.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1212" alt="© Peter Reid" src="http://thewordsisaw.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/africa-by-peter-reid.jpeg?w=720"   /></a>I remember watching them high up in the sky, so high I had to squint my eyes. I remember Papa taking me to the falls where they would dive with the water, quickly lost to the mist-filled canyon beneath us. I remember the evenings sat on Mama’s lap, outside our brick home, listening to them sing to the stars and me. That’s how I want to remember them, and not as this small pile of bones, with their flesh lost to the red arid-soil before me.</p>
<p><i>Bones are all that remain of the starved</i>, Papa once told me. <i>But we live off them; they feed us Daya, because the sugar company needs them to bleach their cane</i>. I look at my rice sac, thinking back to Papa’s words, haunting me. <i>But they’re just bones in the end; like all of us, aren’t they?</i> I want to say to him.</p>
<p>I dust it clean and pinch the tiny breastbone between my fingers, before dropping it into my sac. It clinks like a note I had once played on a long wooden instrument at school. I had hit it with a stick, the instrument, and it sounded just like tapping two bones together. I peer inside against the smell. Not many of them are birds; they’re too big to be birds, too big to be animal.</p>
<p>It’s almost as tall as me now, and too heavy to lift, but if I drag it then my sac slides easy enough over the land, causing a red mist to rise up behind me. I pull as the rough hemp cuts into my shoulder. I squint against the pain as I mimic the sound of that musical note I had once played.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>‘Mama,’ I call out after arriving at our tent home. ‘Mama, I found lots Mama!’</p>
<p>But Mama doesn’t respond. I tie my sac tightly shut, and turn to see the amber sky deepening over the village. Sand is lifted by the rising winds of dusk, causing everything to shimmer beneath the descending darkness. I see him, leaning against the canvas walls of my neighbour’s home, staring at me and my sac. I want to take it inside, but Mama says we live with Death close enough already, without inviting it into our homes as well. So I push my sac up against the tent, turning to see that the man I don’t know has gone. I open the flap and walk inside.</p>
<p>‘Mama,’ I say running to lower myself into her arms. ‘What’s wrong, why are you crying?’</p>
<p>The blanket I had placed over her before leaving in the morning to collect had barely moved. She remains lying on the floor, with my baby brother asleep by her side.</p>
<p>‘Oh Daya, my sweet girl, Mama is not well today.’</p>
<p>She then begins violently coughing. I hold her tightly in my arms.</p>
<p>‘It’s OK Mama; I collected half a sac today. The sugar men will give us twenty cents for half a sac. We will eat tomorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow,’ she says before closing her eyes.</p>
<p>I stand and walk around Mama to kiss Rudo on the head. He was born in the village and never saw our brick home, or Papa. When I’m not collecting then I tell Rudo about our life before; I tell him about Papa. I miss Papa. I felt safe when he was alive, as he could collect much better than me.</p>
<p>I pull my dusty clothes off and place them in one corner for tomorrow, as Mama’s wheezing breath fills the growing silence of the night. I light our only candle to get ready for bed, shadows dance around me in its flickering light. After putting on one of Papa’s old blue t-shirts, which falls all the way to my shins, I cross to the door to tie it shut. But first, I peer out to see my sac, illuminated under the glare of the moon. I briefly look up to see a world of stars above me.</p>
<p>‘Please God,’ I whisper.</p>
<p>Turning, I blow out the candle and find Mama’s side in the darkness. I lie pressed up against her and close my eyes, listening to her breath in order to drown out the hunger that’s constantly punching me in my belly.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>‘Papa was a great man,’ I tell Rudo, as he sits chewing his fingers on my lap. ‘We were never hungry when Papa was alive; he was a wise man and could make bird traps out of sticky berries. Mama would then pluck the Dusky Larks, roast them, and then we would sit just here,’ I tap the earth beneath us, ‘in a circle, laughing and eating larks. Yes, Papa was a great man Rudo, but,’ I look at Mama drifting between her delusions and dreams, ‘Death took him from us.’</p>
<p>Rudo giggles and climbs up my chest to begin chewing my nose.</p>
<p>‘<i>Mira</i> Baby,’ <i>stop </i>I say, ‘it’s sticky,’ I add, laughing and hugging him tightly.</p>
<p>I like my mornings with Rudo. Before Mama wakes I sit and play with him. I let myself be nine again. But once Mama is up I must start work again, because if I don’t try and find food, if I don’t care for us, then no one will.</p>
<p>After placing Rudo on the edge of Mama’s frayed blanket, I pull Papa’s t-shirt up over my head and quickly run from the morning chill to the corner of the tent. My work clothes scratch against my skin from all the dirt trapped inside them. The river is a morning away, so I can only wash them once a week. I pick up the broom, which stands taller than me, and fill the dawn silence with the shiver of bristles sweeping dust. Rudo begins scratching at the ground. I work around him, laughing as he crawls after the brush-head at my feet.</p>
<p>When I sweep I think about our brick home, and how tidy Mama used to keep it, and how Mama and Papa both wailed on their knees, crying out to God, when the bad men came and bulldozed it. I sweep and see a sea of us, lost in our own country, all walking together to this: I sweep a pile of dust to the door and, after opening it, force a small grey cloud outside into the face of the rising sun.</p>
<p>The engine of a truck hums in the horizon. I smile, now knowing that for at least today and tomorrow we will not die, for twenty cents will buy enough maize to feed us.</p>
<p>‘Mama,’ I call. ‘The sugar men are here.’</p>
<p>Rudo claps his hands together before patting Mama on the head. She fights to wake but her dreams are too safe to leave. Gazing back outside, I watch people beginning to exit their tents around me, carrying their sacs to the truck which hoots its horn. Two men step out and begin assessing the sacs, before tossing them on the back of the truck and handing out coins. I look down at my own sac, but it is gone.</p>
<p>‘No!’ I cry. ‘My bones, my bones have been stolen!’</p>
<p>My mouth is filled by a desperate saltiness, as my tears crash from the brink of my lip. I turn to look back at Mama and Rudo, who has also fallen asleep beside her, with his bulging belly rising and falling beneath his tiny ribs. I run.</p>
<p>‘<i>Pamusoro</i>, <i>pamusoro</i>,’ <i>excuse-me </i>I say, pulling at the jacket of the man who is giving out coins. ‘My sac was stolen but I collected half, please give me twenty cents to feed my family.’</p>
<p>He raises the clipboard in his hand and slaps me around the face with it, hard enough to knock me to the ground.</p>
<p>‘No bones, no money,’ he hisses, before kicking the dusty soil over me.</p>
<p>‘But I will get you half a sac next time; just give me twenty cents for today. My Mama and baby brother are starving. I’m starving, please.’</p>
<p>He raises the clipboard high above my head, as I scramble away between the legs of my neighbours.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>The soil crumbles as I dig down, sifting amongst the rubbish buried within it. I lift my hoe to try again, but my empty stomach feels as though it might collapse under the strain. The hoe drops to the ground, as I bring my hand to my belly to soothe it, with my vision misted by the sun’s hot rays.</p>
<p>‘Papa,’ I say, ‘I can’t dig Papa, my hunger eats me.’</p>
<p>Papa looks up at me and smiles, as he avidly turns over the soil picking up bone after bone.</p>
<p>‘We dig to eat, Daya; the sugar company will reward us for our hard work.’</p>
<p>I lean over and collect my hoe, seeing a partially covered bone beside its stone-scratched metal head. I scrap it free with my fingers, and tap it against the hoe’s wooden handle. It makes the right note so I stumble to the white sac and drop it inside.</p>
<p>‘But Papa,’ I say again, turning back to the shrunken man, with his blue t-shirt hanging loser each day, ‘I don’t want to scavenge anymore; the other girls laugh at me Papa.’</p>
<p>He forces his hoe into the ground and pushes his curved spine up straight as he turns to face me; his breaths falter as he fills his lungs with the sticky-air.</p>
<p>‘It’s not scavenging Daya,’ he says, looking out across the rubbish heap we’re stood upon, lifting us high up into the cloudless sky. ‘We dig to survive, and there’s nothing wrong about surviving.’ Papa lifts his hoe before breaking though the heap’s crust, releasing the potency of poverty further more. ‘There’s nothing wrong in survival Daya, and never let anyone tell you otherwise – understand?’</p>
<p>‘Yes Papa,’ I reply, but my words are cast astray on the breeze, lost with my dreams.</p>
<p>I sigh and turn to my sac, with them rattling inside as I shake it. I begin to drag it behind me, stopping to look for Papa once more, but my vision clears with the setting sun, and Papa is gone. I often cry while I’m out on the heap, as it’s the one place where I’m always alone.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>I don’t know what it’s like elsewhere in the world, but here, in my village, suffering seems to find its way into all of us.</p>
<p>‘<i>Mhoro</i>!’ I call out, pushing the air in the top of my sac downwards to make it bulge at the bottom.</p>
<p>A flickering light seeps beneath the walls of the tent, licking at the darkness by my feet.</p>
<p>‘Hello,’ I call again. ‘Mother Amadika, <i>mhoro</i>, it’s me – Daya.’</p>
<p>The flap drops and I am bathed in light, blinded, and unable to find the eyes of the black silhouette before me.</p>
<p>‘What is it child?’</p>
<p>My vision adjusts to see the vibrant colours of her dress, tainted by hardship and sweat.</p>
<p>‘Mother Amadika, please take these bones I have collected, and all for a little bit of maize.’</p>
<p>Her towering figure and heavy breasts fall forwards as she lifts the sac, assessing its value, before carrying it inside.</p>
<p>‘I have little maize to give,’ she says, no louder than a whisper.</p>
<p>I follow her into the tent; a small fire warms a pot in one corner, with the flames ravaging the air around them. Mother Amadika lifts a small tin bowl and lowers herself beside the pot, scraping at the contents with a metal spoon. I turn to the sound of the wheezing man, lying along the far canvas wall – his body shaking with fever.</p>
<p>‘I can give no more.’</p>
<p>Mother Amadika places the bowl into my outstretched hand, too hot to hold on its bottom. I look at the few spoonfuls of porridge; there’s barely enough to feed Rudo, let alone Mama and me.</p>
<p>‘<i>Ndatenda</i> Mother Amadika,’ <i>thank you </i>I say stepping away.</p>
<p>I stop at the entrance, trapped by my thoughts. I turn and face Mother Amadika, whose curly her hair is cut short like mine.</p>
<p>‘He’s dying, isn’t he?’ I ask, pointing at her son, now lying still with his eyes wide-open – searching.</p>
<p>She walks towards me and places her heavy hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>‘We’re all dying Daya, but,’ her sadness clenches me tighter, ‘some of us are freed from this life much sooner than others.’ She lets my shoulder go and lifts the flap, covering me in shadow. ‘Now run home child. Don’t get caught with that maize in your hands.’</p>
<p>‘I won’t Mother Amadika, <i>ndatenda</i>.’</p>
<p>I hug the warm bowl close to my chest and run quickly, skipping over the black festering puddles.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>I hear his cries from far away.</p>
<p>‘Rudo!’ I call, running quicker towards our home. ‘I’m coming Rudo!’</p>
<p>I dash towards the full moon that hangs like a beacon, directing me towards the village’s end, while dodging the shadows calling out to me to sit with them, to keep them company just for tonight.</p>
<p>‘Rudo,’ I shout, tearing at the door shielding his screams inside.</p>
<p>I enter our home and edge my way through the darkness, placing the bowl of maize on the floor, before collecting Rudo in my arms.</p>
<p>‘It’s OK Baby, I’m here.’</p>
<p>His screams fade as he digs his head into my neck, clenching me tighter.</p>
<p>‘Mama,’ I say, lowering to find her hand in the darkness; it’s as cold as a pebble exposed to a winter’s night. ‘Mama?’ I say again.</p>
<p>I place Rudo back on the floor; his sniffles are accompanied by my scrambling to light our candle. The match sparks and I meet it with the blackened wick, before the tent is given a shimmering light. I slowly walk back to Mama and lean over her; her eyes peer right through me. I fall with my tears to her side, and hold her before kissing her cheek. I push back her hair, and see that her pain has now left her. I wish her goodnight.</p>
<p>‘<i>Urare zvakanakat</i> Mama,’ I whisper, pulling the blanket up to cover her face, ‘kiss Papa for me.’</p>
<p>I look over Mama at Rudo; his little hands and parting smile are covered in sticky porridge. Moonbeams fight their way through the many holes in our canvass walls, creating a pattern of stars in the black universe behind him.</p>
<p>‘It’s just us now Baby,’ I say.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>The soil trickles between my fingers, before I smooth it with my palm as Rudo plays with two sticks beside me.</p>
<p>‘We’ll be OK now Rudo,’ I say to him, taking the sticks before tying them into a small cross with some string. ‘Now Papa can take care of Mama, and I will be able to feed us better.’</p>
<p>Rudo reaches out for the cross, but I place it into the centre of the newly turned soil.</p>
<p>‘Come Baby.’</p>
<p>I stand and pull him up into my arms. Stumbling, I begin to walk away but I’m soon drawn towards a small slope, and the sound of scraping being carried up it on the morning breeze. I wait with the moment; familiar with the noise of collecting; familiar with Death’s song. A man, the stranger, staggers up the horizon before me, with my white rice sac sliding over the land behind him. I look down at Mama, hidden beneath the red arid soil. I lean over with Rudo still in my arms and pull out the cross. <i>May they never find her,</i> I say silently.</p>
<p>I hold Rudo and head towards our tent home; humming in his ear like Papa would once do to me. But he points at something over my shoulder and burbles the word, <i>Mama. </i>I smile with Rudo’s first word, but I turn as he says <i>Mama</i> once again.</p>
<p>There, pecking at the soil above Mama’s grave, is a small bird so white, I imagine the feathers of an angel could not fall any purer. I stand and stare, before watching the bird, and Mama, fly away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If he&#8217;s honest with himself, the cat will admit that this toilet paper tube is now 100% more entertaining than it was when he first started playing with it. (When it was still just a tube. That&#8217;s so boring. We can do better than that.)</p>
<p><a href="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-770" alt="cattoy" src="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I made that spiraling dangly thing just for him. Is he grateful? Not that I can tell.</p>
<p>The above photograph was bad from the start (poor lighting), and I over-brightened and over-sharpened it in Photoshop, just to make it somewhat viewable. Anyway, it&#8217;s still a bad photo, but something about it started to intrigue me. I liked the shapes, and the shadow of the spiral.</p>
<p>I decided to mess around with Photoshop filters. The Cutout filter yielded this&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-771" alt="cattoy1" src="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy1.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;which was kind of interesting, but not enough on its own. I took the Cutout file and copied it into a file with the original photo. With the Cutout on a layer above the original, and the Blending mode set to Multiply, I ended up with this:</p>
<p><a href="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-773" alt="cattoy2" src="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy2.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Which is an improvement on the original, I think. The same file, but with the Blending Mode set to Exclusion results in this:</p>
<p><a href="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774" alt="cattoy3" src="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy3.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>Returning to the original photo, I used a filter that I have <strong><em>never</em> </strong>had any success with. The Stained Glass filter. Always a disaster. So, why even bother trying it? That&#8217;s the triumph of hope over experience. And&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-775" alt="cattoy4" src="http://lynnsimon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cattoy4.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>OMG! I really kind of love that!</p>
<p>Every time I use Photoshop filters I hear voices in my head, the clamor of professionals saying, <em><strong>Take a competent picture to begin with! Filters are</strong><strong> cheating!</strong></em> And I get what they&#8217;re saying. I really do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this started out as a toilet paper tube. You know?</p>

Since last week Thursday South Africa has been gripped by the story that Paralympic hero Oscar Pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine&#8217;s Day.

<p>Deep in the oak woods, something stirs. Tiny creaks and crackles fill the spaces between the air with gossamer wisps of sound.The sap hidden beneath the crusty crackled skin of bark begins its upwards journey towards the wooden finger tips of the trees. The earth turns back towards the sun, and the unstoppable yearly process of growth and decay, turns the trees out of winter and into spring. But look a little deeper and this grand yearly cycle is nestled like a Russian doll within far greater, longer cycles of process and change.</p>
<div id="attachment_1448" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 436px"><a href="http://breathofgreenair.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/process-as-a-russian-doll/20130219-092119-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-1448"><img class="size-large wp-image-1448" alt="Viking warrior bares belly" src="http://breathofgreenair.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130219-092119.jpg?w=426&#038;h=640" width="426" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viking warrior bares belly</p></div>
<p>Lightening is drawn inevitably, like a tragic star struck lover, towards the heartwood of oak. The bleached lightening struck branches gleam like bones, revealing the first step in the big process of decay from life.</p>
<div id="attachment_1454" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 436px"><a href="http://breathofgreenair.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/process-as-a-russian-doll/20130219-093952-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-1454"><img class="size-large wp-image-1454" alt="Broken limb" src="http://breathofgreenair.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130219-093952.jpg?w=426&#038;h=640" width="426" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Broken limb, fallen dancer</p></div>
<p>Weakened by the heaven sent fury, the ground is littered with the fallen carcasses of limbs once swaying in the summer breeze, reaching towards the sky.</p>
<div id="attachment_1450" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://breathofgreenair.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/process-as-a-russian-doll/20130219-092531-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-1450"><img class="size-large wp-image-1450" alt="Rope twist in wood" src="http://breathofgreenair.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130219-092531.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" width="640" height="426" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rope twist in wood</p></div>
<p>The contact with the earth sets off the next stage in the process of decay. The bark falls like flesh, and the grain in the wood is chiseled out by millions of tiny organisms, unseen by human eye. The wood is re-clothed with moss, fungi and lichen, as its structure softens further, releasing its hard held form back into the soft earth.</p>
<div id="attachment_1451" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://breathofgreenair.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/process-as-a-russian-doll/20130219-092631-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-1451"><img class="size-large wp-image-1451" alt="Wood to earth - new hope" src="http://breathofgreenair.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130219-092631.jpg?w=640&#038;h=488" width="640" height="488" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wood to earth &#8211; new hope</p></div>
<p>In the end, the strength of the tree dissolves into soil, and tiny acorns are nourished by its soft life giving blanket.  Change and process are hidden all around us in unseen layers within layers, if only we have the eyes to see. The stately process has come full circle, and the earth breathes out, into growth, and into the next layer of the Russian doll of life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://confederacyofspinsters.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wedding-diet-500x485.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1041" alt="Wedding-Diet-500x485" src="http://confederacyofspinsters.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wedding-diet-500x485.jpg?w=258&#038;h=250" width="258" height="250" /></a>There is great danger ahead. The bridal magazines warn of it and dress clerks speak of it in hushed, panicky tones, as though the barest mention can summon its cream-filled wrath. It is the monster they call fat and it&#8217;s the quickest way to ruin a wedding.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. <em>But, Grace, I&#8217;m happy with my size! Dr. Swoodilypooper fell in love with me just as I am, so why change now</em>? Don&#8217;t ask me, dearest. Personally, I think you&#8217;re the bee&#8217;s knees and should stay as you are, but I do not make the wedding rules. If I did, there would be more elephant rides. Unfortunately, the wedding industry is against fun<em> and</em> your body. You are a bride, so you should lose weight. It&#8217;s in all the literature!</p>
<p>As soon as you get Facebook engaged, that paramount sign of commitment, you&#8217;re inundated with wedding ads. Photographers, venues, and DJs all want <del>your money</del> to help with your special day. None, however, seem more concerned than the personal trainers. <em>Look perfect on your special day,</em> they promise. <em>Don&#8217;t you want to be a shiny, happy wedding princess</em>? Well, princesses aren&#8217;t a size 12, so join a boot camp, fatty fatpants. A true bride prepares for her wedding like it&#8217;s a <em>war</em>. Death to the thunder thighs!</p>
<p>No matter the bride, improvements are necessary. Sure, you may already be a size 2, but are you a toned size 2? Worse, do you have a bit of cellulite, that natural way female fat is stored? Disgusting! Stop eating this instant. You&#8217;re going to be <em>in pictures</em>, darling. They&#8217;re worth a 1000 words, 999 of which could be variants of &#8220;chunky apple pie face.&#8221; You don&#8217;t want your grandchildren thinking you looked like a lace-cased sausage, do you? They won&#8217;t love you anymore! You are a woman, darling, and women are delicate flowers. Just because you&#8217;ve fooled a man into thinking your body is sex incarnate, doesn&#8217;t make it acceptable.</p>
<p>As a bride, you have certain responsibilities. Chief among them is looking conventionally beautiful. You only get this one day<em> ever</em> to be happy, so make it count. Heaven forbid your guests leave chatting about the great food and lively conversation! If they&#8217;re not complimenting your spindly collarbone, you have failed. And if you fail at being a bride? Barbie comes to life, knocks in your door with a magenta battering ram, and revokes your woman card. Then, who will do your husband&#8217;s laundry? Get dieting now, or else&#8230;</p>
<p>Or, call me crazy, you could find a dress that makes you happy and sashay up to the alter as the person you are. Shock your guests and &#8211; <em>gasp!</em> &#8211; look like the you they already love. It&#8217;s one thing to want to feel better or combat health problems, but why exactly are we dieting ourselves down to an unmaintainable size for one party? Your wedding photos don&#8217;t actually follow you around, shadow-like, for all your days. Despite what the magazines tell you, you are <em>not</em> your dress size. Not this day, not ever. You are your career, your friends, your perfectly twee impression of Zooey Deschanel. You are not a bride, you are a <em>person</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">- Grace</p>
