				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_164" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bermuda-038.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-164" style="margin-right:10px;" title="Casemates" src="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bermuda-038.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Empty room of the vacant Casemates Barracks &amp; Prison, Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda (photo by Travis Parno)</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking lately about a recent (and excellent) <a href="http://paulmullins.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-politics-and-archaeology-of-ruin-porn/" target="_blank">post</a> about the politics and archaeology of so-called &#8220;ruin porn&#8221; by Paul Mullins.  In his entry, Mullins delves into the contemporary fascination with ruins and ruination, particularly as it is expressed in art photography.  He outlines the critiques of approaches that sensationalize and aestheticize ruins, using these discussions to explore the underlying politics of documenting, and indeed relishing, the traces of ruination.   Mullins thoughtfully probes the label &#8220;ruin porn,&#8221; arguing that although such photography may be guilty of fetishization, it shouldn&#8217;t be rejected outright.  He instead maintains that, &#8220;any photograph is a selective representation of reality that cannot hope to capture concrete experience. Pornography does at least visually own up to its desires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullins&#8217; post is thought-provoking and offers an exciting look into an extremely contemporary debate.  As our economy continues to muddle along, we have become increasingly familiar with the aesthetics of decay and ruin.  From streets and buildings to homes and lives, we&#8217;ve seen the tragic results of years of fiscal downturn.  They are emotional and visceral.  This is where concerns with images of ruination arise&#8211;the human toll, exacted over weeks and months and years, is not immediately evident.  Knowing this, the thought of someone, anyone, getting pleasure out of these scenes (destruction in slow-motion) is upsetting.  These are sentiments with which most would agree.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bermuda-037.jpg"><img style="margin-left:10px;" title="bermuda 037" src="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bermuda-037.jpg?w=225&h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another scene from the Casemates Barracks &amp; Prison, Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda (photo by Travis Parno)</p></div>
<p>I worry, however, that we risk denying the potency of the imagination.  Photographs, while ostensibly static images, are a known commodity; that is, most contemporary audiences possess at least a working knowledge of their production, from a real scene to a composed shot to a captured image to a distributed picture.  We know what it&#8217;s like to hold a camera, measure an angle, and press the button.  This familiarity with a picture&#8217;s production does not vanish when we view an image.  It may retreat into the subconscious, but we&#8217;re typically aware, when looking at a photograph, that we are looking at something produced by an individual with a camera (here I&#8217;m excluding abstract images designed to divorce the photograph from the photographic process&#8211;sometimes it&#8217;s tough to tell exactly what we&#8217;re looking at!).  There is a narrative to photography that extends from the life of the depicted scene through to its capture on film.  When we view a photograph, our mind tries to catalog the scene, fitting it into a constructed story.  It would then seem unreasonable to suggest that, when seeing an image of ruination, we are unable to fit the picture into a larger narrative of decay.  It may not be reflective of a distinct reality with fixed details, but we sense that these decrepit buildings were not built decrepit.  They did not spring forth in an advanced stage of decay; time dragged them into debilitation.</p>
<p>The trouble, according to critics, comes from seeing beauty in the breakdown.  Here I echo Mullins (and others, such as the <a href="http://ruinmemories.org/" target="_blank">Ruin Memories</a> project and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal) who argue that archaeology should confront elements of the contemporary past that may be painful, awkward, or politically incorrect.  I also wonder though if we aren&#8217;t guilty of conflating aesthetic appreciation with a lack of empathy.  Can we appreciate the beauty of a photograph and the tragedy of its condition simultaneously?  How much self-flagellation is appropriate before we&#8217;re able to gaze in awe at a striking picture?  Ruin porn is not the first movement to elicit these sorts of questions.  For instance, the work of New York City crime photographer <a href="http://www.icp.org/museum/exhibitions/weegee-murder-my-business" target="_blank">Weegee</a> at once shocked and fascinated audiences in the 1930s and 40s.  Weegee&#8217;s subject matter was different and more immediately graphic, but was instilled with similar emotions, captured in an artistic, gritty, and evocative light.  Today his photographs hang in museums.  There is no doubting the loss contained in Weegee&#8217;s subjects, but can the same be said about images of ruins?  Must every ruin symbolize catastrophe?  Is there such a thing as a triumphant ruin, a building that was not the stage for some vicious downfall, but was rather simply left, forgotten, and then transformed into a thing of beauty?</p>
<div id="attachment_171" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hawaii-079.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-171" title="hawaii 079" src="http://travisgparno.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hawaii-079.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Metal detritus on Glass Beach, Kauai, Hawaii (photo by Travis Parno)</p></div>
<p>Archaeology, as it sits at the intersection of the temporal and the material, is one way to explore some of these questions.  Many contemporary archaeologists are immediately drawn to the difficult stories and they are to be applauded.  Theirs is a challenging path, but they often are able to draw out the significance of contemporary ruination and strife, however distressing or laborious it may be.  But attention is also due to those less traumatic tales of spaces that slipped through the cracks, those triumphant ruins that live on in ruin porn, unabashed at their glorious nakedness.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been out of work for any length of time, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard the old adage: &#8220;Job hunting is a full-time job,&#8221; or some variation of it at least. I&#8217;ve been thinking about that for the last few days, and while I understand the sentiment, I think the analogy is wrong. </p>
<p>You see, if job-hunting was an actual job, you&#8217;d get paid for it, and I don&#8217;t know anyone that gets paid to look for a job. The relationship between job-hunter and job-hirer is not that equitable; it&#8217;s much more like trained-monkey performing on the street corner and passer-by.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been to almost any city, you&#8217;ve likely encountered a busker or two, performing for tips in the busiest parts of town. Sometimes they draw a crowd, many times they do not. Sometimes a passer-by will drop a few coins in the busker&#8217;s hat, many times they don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a much better analogy for the job search.</p>
<p>You (the trained monkey) work on your craft, carefully learning how to walk on stilts, and one day a passer-by stops to watch your funky little monkey show. You begin to dance, performing astounding tricks and trying to impress the passer-by so they might drop a paycheck into your hat. We call this an interview.</p>
<p>As you dance, the passer-by stands there, looking unimpressed. You finish your monkey-on-stilts shuffle-off-to-Buffalo, and wait for the coins to drop. In the mean time, another passer-by stops to see the show, and off you go with your trained monkey dance once again. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll get one of the passers-by to drop a few coins into your hat. These days, if you are lucky, you&#8217;ll probably be disappointed at the small amount of change they are willing to part with, but hey, at least it&#8217;s a job. More than likely these days, the passer-by will question your choice of stilts, claim that your stilts are too tall for their needs, or something like that, and move on to another monkey dancing just down the street.</p>
<p>But what option do you really have? Dance You Job-Seeking Monkey! Dance!</p>
<p>- TUJA</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1451" title="gkas 002" src="http://thephoenixmind.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gkas-002.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Last July, I wrote the beginnings of a post on Alzheimer’s Disease. I found out during my graduation that my granddad was going for tests to see if he had it.</p>
<p>That was over a year ago, and that post is still sat in my drafts document; with all the details of senile plaques being toxic to neurons and theories of neurofibillary tangles helping balance out oxygen levels…</p>
<p>I’ve gone back to it so many times, but I didn’t take any courses in dementia or aging – I know the brain regions and I know how chemicals affect neuronal structure.</p>
<p>But “severe loss of life”, I do not know about.</p>
<p>And I’ve found I really don’t want to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#5a8c97;"><strong>Emotional Reactions</strong></span></p>
<p>I think of myself as a scholar and a seeker, I’m intrigued by life, keen to understand the world and to create my own senses through writing.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I can even entertain the idea of being slave to a condition <strong>“which strips away your living self a bit at a time.”</strong> (<a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/?page_id=54">Terry Pratchett</a>)</p>
<p>But there I was yesterday, sat next to the man who used to laugh, to go on and on about being hospitable to others and providing a service for your neighbours. The man who hiked up mountains until a few years ago and who told me I should do whatever it was that made me happy – countering every other male in my family who went on and on about getting A-grades.</p>
<p><span style="color:#699d85;"><strong><em>He is the only decent male role model I’ve ever had, and he is fading.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>The man sat next to me yesterday was depressing, picking up on negatives which weren’t there, focusing on how “I seem to have another qualification but no one wants to employ me” and talking about how there’s no point being here when everything in his body is falling apart. <em>(I only finished at University last Thursday, I’m not worried about not having a job yet).</em></p>
<p>And then he spoke, looking at me, trying desperately to<span style="color:#699d85;"> <strong><em>remember my name</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p>Last night, I dreamt of writing to Terry Pratchett; despite his particular variant meaning he can <a href="http://www.theheadologist.com/2012/08/02/the-author-who-cant-read-giving-back-to-terry-pratchett-in-a-roundabout-way/">no longer read</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#5a8c97;"><strong>Knowledge</strong></span></p>
<p>My granddad does still remember my name, after prompting a few times. This is the early stage, I know. They’ll have assessed the density of the plaques and tangles and judged him “early”. Each time I visit, I see decline, and I’m reminded “it’s only going to get worse”.</p>
<p>They’ve taken him off the Aricept medication, as it caused side-effects to his heart. He’s still able to speak, still able to move his hands and legs, still able to pour drinks and to play croquet with us.</p>
<p>He’s survived skin cancer, a knee operation, eye treatment and is now losing his mind; a little bit each day.</p>
<p>All I find myself wanting to do is to remember every moment with him and to distil those memories of him, and the lessons he wants. I want to make a guidebook for my life with all of his knowledge and beliefs within it&#8230; so that he can still give me guidance once he&#8217;s no longer there.</p>
<p>~ ~ ~</p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.theheadologist.com/2012/08/02/the-author-who-cant-read-giving-back-to-terry-pratchett-in-a-roundabout-way/">Ellie’s post</a> over at <a href="http://www.theheadologist.com/blog">The Headologist</a> a few weeks ago, thinking of my granddad as I read each word about the Aricept, the frustration and that sense of loss she felt as Terry would never read a word she had written.</p>
<p>And I realised my grandfather will probably never see my life – he may see it, but he won’t recognise it. I’ll be the first one he forgets; being the youngest (the most recent new memory), the less-often-visiting. He’ll forget my name, and not understand why I tell him about any job I get, any achievements I have… when I tell him I’m happy; that I did what he asked and did something I enjoyed… he’ll wonder why I’m telling him.</p>
<p>If he lives long enough to meet my kids, he will never<em> know</em> them, and they will never <em>know</em> him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#5a8c97;"><strong>The Scientist</strong></span></p>
<p>I feel I need to know about this. His wife and my mum have both asked what’s happening in his brain, and I could only open a textbook and try to read it out loud, explaining the jargon as best I could.</p>
<p>I don’t want to know, to foresee his future. Yet I do.</p>
<p>Next his speech will go, he’ll lose the ability to perform daily tasks, his long-term memory will start to fade and I will most likely be removed then.</p>
<p>And then, if he survives any falls and lives beyond that, he’ll reach “advanced” and will be able to perhaps use phrases of speech, fall into apathy/exhaustion and no longer be able to feed himself or move.</p>
<p>~ ~ ~</p>
<p>I cannot be a scientist when the only person who has made an effort to be compassionate and just, is leaving me. I cannot explain the biological function of plaques when the main motivation for all my studying and all my work will never see me complete it.</p>
<p>And I will only have memories from when I was too young to understand, to guide me in how to be a decent human being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#699d85;"><strong>Mostly though, I’m mourning that he won’t be playing chess again; the game he taught me was the answer to all of life’s problems.</strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, <em>Salon.com</em> had an <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/19/americas_worst_historians/">essay</a> on the recent Fareed Zakaria plagiarism case. For those of you who don’t follow American middlebrow news sources with a passion, the story is that Zakaria—a regular commentator and columnist for CNN and <em>TIME</em> magazine—lifted a paragraph about the book <em>Gunfight </em>almost wholesale from a <em>New Yorker</em> article by Jill Lepore to include in his column. (See the comparison at NewsBusters, <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2012/08/10/talk-about-concealed-carry-fareed-zakaria-plagiarized-paragraph-history-">here</a>.) Zakaria’s been suspended from both jobs, and has published one of those “I shouldn’t have done this, though I make no attempt to explain why I did” apologies.</p>
<p>The authors of the <em>Salon</em> piece, two history professors from Louisiana State University, use Zakaria as the jumping-off point for an attack on big-budget popular history and the non-historians who do it. I’m happy to see them get in some punches on the genre’s recycling of what we already know as “Great New Discoveries!” but I don’t think the argument that the problem is a lack of professional historical training is the problem here. Journalists know to give credit when credit is due (like those ubiquitous “additional reporting” tags) and people with doctorates in other fields (Zakaria received a PhD in Government from Harvard) know what plagiarism is. Plus, there are plenty of people with doctorates in history who are happy to write books that recycle old platitudes as “Great New Discoveries!”</p>
<p>I think the bigger problem is the extent to which the general readership has very little idea how much work it takes to develop something original, and why plagiarism is not just an ethical transgression but also a mark of boring work. Did Zakaria really not have anything to say about <em>Gunfight </em>that Lepore didn’t?</p>
<p>One of the big reasons readers don’t distinguish between the in-depth and the superficial is that they don’t realize how difficult that in-depth research is. I remember when I was planning a research trip to Britain just how surprised some of my friends were that nineteenth-century prime ministerial papers weren’t online, and these were grad students in physics: people working on the same university campus as me. As I experienced in my latest 6 month gap with no university library access, most serious scholarship is still behind paywalls or up in the stacks. Even if you only want basic secondary sources, it takes time to uncover what you need.</p>
<p>I’m not ranting here that everything should be freely and easily available on the internet, though it would be nice. My point is that getting dug into a topic beyond the most superficial level is work. It’s not quick, it’s not easy, and it’s not at anyone’s fingertips.</p>
<p>When someone lifts Jill Lepore’s summary of Adam Winkler’s <em>Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America</em>, a book that itself is based on the research of hundreds of other scholars, we’re not just talking about an ethical transgression. We’re also talking about a situation where dipping a toe in the water gets presented as deep thinking. Look at the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2121660,00.html"><em>TIME</em> column</a>. Aside from the Winkler-citing paragraphs in the middle, the only sources worth naming are <em>New York Times</em> columnist David Brooks and syndicated columnist George Will. Does this sort of thing even count as writing about gun control?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with admitting that the world is filled with smart people who do smart work. Fareed Zakaria, up against a deadline, could have told people to read Lepore&#8217;s article (it&#8217;s available online <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/23/120423fa_fact_lepore">here</a>), or Winkler&#8217;s book, or Randy Roth&#8217;s <em>American Homicide</em>. There&#8217;s really no shortage of reading, even good reading, about the issue. It&#8217;s really too bad he took the road he did instead.</p>
<p><em>(UPDATE: Why I left the sciences out when talking about research, and why it would be nice if &#8220;humanities journalism&#8221; was a profession <a title="More on Respecting Research: or, Why oh why isn’t humanities journalism a profession?" href="http://devilofhistory.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/more-on-respecting-research-or-why-oh-why-isnt-humanities-journalism-a-profession/">here</a>)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://daddydrinksdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/astronaut-edwin-aldrin-saluting-amer-flag-after-being-second-man-on-moon-during-apollo-ii-mission-july-1969.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-158" title="astronaut-edwin-aldrin-saluting-amer-flag-after-being-second-man-on-moon-during-apollo-ii-mission-july-1969" src="http://daddydrinksdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/astronaut-edwin-aldrin-saluting-amer-flag-after-being-second-man-on-moon-during-apollo-ii-mission-july-1969.jpeg?w=300&h=271" alt="" width="300" height="271" /></a></p>
<p>Parents lie to their children. That’s a fact of life. Some do it better than others, but we all do it. Could you imagine a world where parents were honest with their kids?</p>
<p>“Actually, Timmy, there’s a really, really good chance that you won’t be an astronaut. Considering your complete inability to understand long division, you’re probably going to sell cars when you grow up. Now let’s talk about Santa Claus.”</p>
<p>So we lie. Mostly about the little things. My parents were great at it. The most famous lie my parents ever told their kids happened during a move from Georgia to Texas. My parents told their kids that it was against the law to transport a dog across state lines.</p>
<p>Brilliant. The dog was a pain in the ass, they didn’t want to take him along. I understand this now, and it serves as inspiration for my own suite of lies that I rely on to get through the day.</p>
<p>The key to a good lie, is to lay the blame on a third party. For instance, let’s say you want your kid to wear a jacket. Tell him it’s an order from his pediatrician. “Dr. Love (our pediatrician) says you have to wear a jacket when it’s below 50 degrees. I’m sorry, son, there’s nothing I can do about it.”</p>
<p>We lay a lot of shit on Dr. Love. “Dr. Love says I’m not allowed to carry you on walks anymore. You have to walk on your own. I know, I think it sucks too. We should talk to Dr. Love about it the next time we see him.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Love says you’re big enough now to open the fridge and get daddy a beer&#8230;”</p>
<p>You see where I’m going with this. So, here are five lies I’m okay with telling my children.</p>
<p><strong>1. Elmo is sad because you didn’t take a nap. </strong>(Simple, effective&#8230;no kid wants to disappoint Elmo. You can use that love to your advantage.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Princesses always pick up their toys after they’re done playing. </strong>(I’ve never met a princess, but something tells me they don’t spend a lot of time cleaning up after themselves.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Every time you flick the lights on and off, a fairy dies</strong>. (Harsh? Sure. But do my kids constantly flick the lights on and off, anymore? No.)</p>
<p><strong>4. We have to leave this park right now, because there are killer bees. </strong>(This one works, but it comes with consequences. My kids are really scared of bees now.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Mommy and daddy have a work meeting, that’s why we have to get a babysitter.</strong> (There is no work meeting. Mommy and daddy just need three hours of peace and quiet and a meal that doesn’t include french fries. Okay, even that was a lie. We’re totally ordering the french fries.)</p>
<p>So, parents, what are the best lies you tell your children? Or, what lies did your parents tell you as a kid?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Recently, we promoted The Frailest Thing to Freshly Pressed with the post “Toilet Paper: A History.” On this blog, Mike writes about technology and how it intersects with culture, philosophy, and even religion. In this post, we especially liked how he breathed life into a seemingly mundane topic—toilet paper.

Here are three ways he accomplished this:<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=9759&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

This toilet paper post, for example, doesn&#8217;t rely on images.</p></div>
<p>Recently, we promoted <a href="http://thefrailestthing.com/">The Frailest Thing</a> to Freshly Pressed with the post <a href="http://thefrailestthing.com/2012/07/25/toilet-paper-a-history/">“Toilet Paper: A History.”</a> On this blog, Mike writes about technology and how it intersects with culture, philosophy, and even religion. In this post, we especially liked how he breathed life into a seemingly mundane topic—toilet paper.</p>
<p>Here are three ways he accomplished this:</p>
<h2>A hook reeled us in.</h2>
<p>This post comments on how all technologies—even those we take for granted, like toilet paper or the refrigerator—have their own histories. It&#8217;s a sprawling topic, but Mike&#8217;s &#8220;hook&#8221;—a pop culture reference and episode from the TV show <em>Seinfeld—</em>introduces the big idea he&#8217;s exploring, and does so in an entertaining way.</p>
<p>We read so many posts on WordPress.com every day, so an opening that piques our interest and makes a subject accessible and relatable is a good start. A hook comes in many forms: a famous quote, a personal anecdote, an account of a conversation you&#8217;ve had that has resonated with you, and more.</p>
<h2>The blogger acted as a narrator.</h2>
<p>In the middle of recounting the scene from <em>Seinfeld</em>, Mike interjects in order to steer his discussion about toilet paper—but also to reconnect with his reader:</p>
<p><em>Now stick with me. I know you’re probably wondering why I’m writing about toilet paper, but there is a point here.</em></p>
<p>In a post like this, which dives into cultural commentary and history, don&#8217;t lose your voice. Mike speaks directly to his reader throughout, and in occasional asides in parentheses, while allowing his more historical discussion to unfold:</p>
<p><em>Toilet paper has a history. Of course it has a history. But who thinks of it? Like George, we take most of our technology for granted.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re the storyteller, so talk to us. Ask questions. Or crack a joke, if appropriate. Be authoritative, but don&#8217;t distance yourself: interact with your reader. Engaging nonfiction writers employ narrative techniques—just as fiction writers do—and experiment with elements such as point of view, persona, and tone.</p>
<h2>The subject was so common—yet so unique.</h2>
<p>Who knew a post about toilet paper could be interesting? We give Mike props for exploring a topic in which we all have personal, tangible experience, but probably have never considered in a thoughtful, intellectual way. (And likely never outside of the bathroom!) He could have investigated the history of another kind of technology—something more obvious, like a phone or a fax machine, to illustrate his point. But by choosing to highlight this unglamorous household product, he creates a unique discussion.</p>
<p>One way of improving your own writing is to look at how other blog posts cover <a href="http://wordpress.com/#!/read/topics/">topics</a> in which you&#8217;re interested. What different devices or distinct perspectives does the author use? If they approach a topic through Door A, try going through Door B. Experiment with an unlikely example. Transform the mundane into something meaningful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davidnilsen.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/eric-idle.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-290" title="eric idle" src="http://davidnilsen.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/eric-idle.jpg?w=385&h=268" alt="" width="385" height="268" /></a></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#666699;">(This article was originally posted at</span> <a href="http://evangelicaloutpost.com/">The Evangelical Outpost</a>)</em></p>
<p>Only one televised event in history was worse than the London Olympics opening ceremony:  The London Olympics closing ceremony.  While the opening ceremony had some genuinely fun and entertaining moments, the closing ceremony reminded anyone familiar with British history and culture that the end has come.  The ceremony was billed as &#8220;a celebration of British music.&#8221;  Apparently the British did not produce music prior to 1960.  The high point of the evening was Russell Brand singing a song from the 1971 film <em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em>.  That says something.</p>
<p>There was one other fun moment, however, especially for a Monty Python fan like myself.  <span id="more-289"></span>Eric Idle appeared on stage, as a kind of elder statesman of the proceedings, to sing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_Look_on_the_Bright_Side_of_Life">&#8220;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&#8221;</a> from the Pythons&#8217; 1979 film <em>Life of Brian </em>(as millions sang along).  For those not <del>nerdy</del> cool enough to be in the know, Life of Brian is about a young Jewish man named Brian who is born on the same day, and right nextdoor to, Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.  As you can imagine, the film is entirely blasphemous and those of us who still harbor a secret admiration of the Monty Python films probably have loads of unconfessed sin.  At the climax of the film, as Brian hangs upon a cross, those being crucified around him break into the song, &#8220;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1979 this film was incredibly controversial.  The film was boycotted by religious groups and banned in certain locations in the UK, as well as countries like Ireland and Norway.  It was the ultimate expression of anti-Christian, underground counter-culture.  In 2012, it is celebrated on an international stage as one of the best representations of authentically British culture.</p>
<p>Those of us who love Britain weep bitter tears.</p>
<p>What is more interesting, and especially relevant to evangelicals seeking to spread the gospel today, is that as the counter-culture has become the mainstream, it seems to have stagnated.  The critique of Christianity (and religion in general) presented by the Pythons is the same basic critique that one sees in most of Hollywood today.  Religion is silly and should be mocked until the religious people quit being so public about it all and become like the rest of us (it would also be ideal of they went ahead and replaced the bread and wine with marijuana and&#8230;actually, the wine can stay).  In 2012, we have not moved passed this stage of counter-Christendom into anything more extreme, at least not in any noticeable sense.</p>
<p>While Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens might have mused in their writings that religious parents engage in a subtle kind of child abuse, and that it would be best for society if we just removed all children to secular government schools, they never went so far as to seriously and publicly call for this to happen.  Comedians like Bill Maher might up the rhetoric and say that Christians who oppose gay marriage are evil, but he has not yet called for preaching against homosexuality inside of a church to be a criminal offense, and in any case he remains confined to the small, liberal bubble that is HBO subscription.  Can you imagine a film that depicts this kind of extreme anti-religious bigotry (comically or otherwise) becoming one of the top grossing films of the year?</p>
<p>It is unlikely that this cultural stagnation will continue indefinately, and I believe the current situation can only go one of two ways.  Either the culture of counter-Christendom will finally be given some impetus to move forward, and outright religious persecution will begin in the West, or else there will be a renaissance of religious (specifically Christian) thought in Western academia and the media.  There is evidence for both.  On the one hand, the increasingly heated rhetoric of the gay marriage debate (along with a growing number of incidents like the recent Chick-Fil-A debacle) suggests that the impetus for genuine persecution is right around the corner.  Pastors in Canada and Europe have already been fined or jailed under &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws, and similar laws are being proposed in the US.  However, there has been a resurgence in the last decade of &#8220;high brow&#8221; Christian thought  in the universities (both public and private).  <a href="http://www.biola.edu/academics/sas/apologetics/">Christian apologetics</a> is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and more programs spring up all the time.  Even more important for cultural renewal, there are serious pushes for <a href="http://as1.org/">Christians to become more involved in the arts</a>, especially film, and to place the Church back into the historic position of &#8220;patron of the arts&#8221; and creator, rather than consumer, of culture.  We are also, as far as I can tell, winning the abortion debate.</p>
<p>If Christianity could be effectively wiped out as a significant cultural force in Britain within one decade (which it was), then it is possible for a reverse shift to happen in the same space of time.  True, things could simply get worse, and this is what most evangelicals tend to assume will happen.  Between our fascination with eschatology and the latest social issue that has the country &#8220;more divided than ever&#8221;, we see doom on every new horizon.  With a little hard work and a lot of prayer, though, things could also get better.  When the atheist can no longer thump the Bible-thumper in a debate because he knows more philosophy and history, or when &#8220;love&#8221; is defined not by the libertine romantic comedies of today but by the sort of Christian ethics that produced Jane Austen, the church wins.</p>
<p>I hold out hope that I will find my tears for beloved Britain have been premature, that rumors of her death have been greatly exaggerated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>(CHECK OUT PART TWO, <a href="http://wp.me/p1fxJv-jQ" target="_blank">HERE</a>.)</strong></p>
<p>This weekend my friend Andrew and I went to the Salton Sea, a salt water lake about 3 hours south of LA.  I&#8217;d been hearing a lot about it since I moved here and I&#8217;ve really wanted to take a photo trip there to see it with my own eyes.  The desert fascinates me for a number of different reasons, not the least being the solitude.  The vast open expanses&#8230;the quiet&#8230;the lack of life.  I can&#8217;t explain it other than that.  I&#8217;m drawn to it.  I want to know it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1215" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://cultfitz.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1215" rel="attachment wp-att-1215"><img class="size-full wp-image-1215" title="Salvation1" src="http://cultfitz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/salvation1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Salvation Mountain</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to start with the sea, however.  I&#8217;d like to show you Slab City first.  Outside the seaside resorts, about 20 miles from the stench of that fetid lake is a city called Niland.  Niland is small, quiet, and only about half-inhabited.  There&#8217;s a bar, a grocery store and a gas station mixed among empty lots and boarded up buildings.  It was for the most part, deserted, although I saw about three people walking around on our way out of town. If you follow Main St it will take you directly out of the city and to a hill called Salvation Mountain in the middle of the desert.  Brightly colored and covered in bible verses, it&#8217;s been the life&#8217;s work of a man named Leonard Knight who until recently lived there.  What it is exactly is hard to describe.  A big, painted, man-made hill with small caves cut into it would give you the quickest answer, but it&#8217;s a lot more than that.  Painted cars and trucks surround it.  Hundreds of paint cans litter the dirt behind the mobile homes parked next to the mountain.  There are photographs plastered into the hill, along with glass, tree limbs, and a plaque from the National Folk Art Council (or whatever group is the governing body of Folk Artists.) <a href="http://cultfitz.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1216" rel="attachment wp-att-1216"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1216" title="Salvation2" src="http://cultfitz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/salvation2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a> In retrospect, I&#8217;m trying to determine what I feel like is special about Salvation Mountain.  It&#8217;s big, but not on a scale that is unfathomable.  I&#8217;m not religious, and no part of it speaks to me spiritually, per se.  But when you are there, standing in front of it, walking around it, being completely brutalized in every aspect by the environment, I will admit that there is something to it.  Environmental art, if we can call it that, has a special place in my heart for the sheer amount of stubbornness and obstinance it requires to create it.  It&#8217;s beautifully anti-gallery, but Knight didn&#8217;t intend it to be.  This was the spot that spoke to him, and so he built a mountain.</p>
<div id="attachment_1219" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://cultfitz.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1219" rel="attachment wp-att-1219"><img class="size-full wp-image-1219" title="Swag" src="http://cultfitz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/swag.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So Jesus is to blame for 10,298 rap songs flagrantly abusing this word until it means nothing?</p></div>
<p>A man sat in a souped-up VW bug and greeted people who walked by.  I asked him if he was Leonard and he told me that he was not, that he was John, and that he came to Salvation Mountain to get away from Niland.  He said that he felt more at home in Slab City.  &#8221;Leonard was commissioned by God,&#8221; he explained.  And then began to break down the symbolism of the colors on the hillside.  He saw my camera and suggested I take a drive into Slab City Proper a few miles down the road. Slab City is off the grid.  Named for the concrete slabs that remain from a WWII base, it&#8217;s maybe 12 sq miles of sand, unpaved roads, and the occasional trailer home.  There&#8217;s no water, no power, and most importantly, no law.  John explained that Slab City is mostly drifters, felons, criminals, and poor folks just looking to disconnect and that no one would bother us if we wanted to drive around.  And, he added, &#8220;There&#8217;s a post-apocalyptic sculpture garden at the very end.  Look for a sign that says &#8216;East Jesus.&#8217;  Don&#8217;t tell them I sent you.  They want people to find it on their own.  But I know you&#8217;d like it.&#8221;  I thanked him, took his photo, and we headed down the road.</p>
<div id="attachment_1218" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://cultfitz.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1218" rel="attachment wp-att-1218"><img class="size-full wp-image-1218" title="JohnAtSalvation" src="http://cultfitz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/johnatsalvation.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">John, who advised me to wear sunscreen and drink lots of water. Also, directed me to an underwater river where I could take a bath.</p></div>
<p>Andrew and I made our way back to the gravel road that would take us into Slab City and drove into the mouth of the beast.  Concrete water towers left over from WWII spotted the horizon and a small, blue shack on the side of the road read &#8220;SLAB CITY INFORMATION.&#8221;  I felt informed already, so I did not get out.  Half buried vehicles, burned out buses and demolished RV&#8217;s dotted the landscape.  There were few signs of life.  A car here and there that looked functional hinted at the possibility of life inside an adjacent mobile home.  Solar panels.  Recent garbage.  It was, in a word, bleak.  We rounded what we imagined to be the last corner and did indeed find a sign that said &#8220;East Jesus.&#8221;  Andrew took the left turn and about 50ft off in the distance, I see a child, shirtless, holding a machete.  Andrew and I are both from Memphis, so we weren&#8217;t deterred by this in the slightest.  However, I could only imagine what life would be like growing up 5 miles from the nearest toilet.</p>
<div id="attachment_1220" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 675px"><a href="http://cultfitz.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1220" rel="attachment wp-att-1220"><img class="size-full wp-image-1220" title="EastJesus" src="http://cultfitz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/eastjesus.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="1000" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">East Jesus, indeed.</p></div>
<p>Come back Thursday and I&#8217;ll finish the tour.</p>
