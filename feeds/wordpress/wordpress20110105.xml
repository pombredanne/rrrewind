<p>Wow!  Yeah, I know&#8230;I&#8217;m still trying to realize this decision I&#8217;ve just made &amp; committed to of posting to my blog every week during this awesome New Year ~&gt; <strong>2011</strong>. Wow!&#8230;&#8230; {pause} &#8230;&#8230;WOW!  At some point, soon, it&#8217;ll really hit me I&#8217;m sure.  Perhaps during a late night blog writing session in which I&#8217;ll probably be pulling my hair out trying to edit my piece in time to post before midnight deadline of course, or is it 5am deadline?!  In any case, the words &#8220;deadline&#8221; and &#8220;late&#8221; are main focuses.  Hah!</p>
<p>I love challenges and this definitely is a great one!  It won&#8217;t be easy with being a full-time mother of four angels, working a full-time pay-the-bills job and working a startup of my own.  Insane?  Most assuredly!  I have a feeling that the road ahead is not only going to be full of heart-pumping thrills (so we hope) but perhaps you &amp; I will experience something awesome, wonderful &amp; inspiring on this next leg of the wild journey of self-discovery I&#8217;ve set out for.  Whoa boy &#8211; I think I better take another moment of&#8230;.. {pause} &#8230;&#8230; okay done!  Time to get movin&#8217; <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>To help me along the way, I&#8217;ve signed up for <em><strong><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Post</a></strong></em> and will participate in the community of other bloggers with similar goals.  I will do my best to ask for help when I get stuck and will promise to encourage others.</p>
<p>I will love it &amp; will be ever so humbly grateful if you would come along and walk this adventure with me.  Your encouragement through comments and likes will aid me to stay on track, learn from mistakes and grow.  Heck, we all may grow together in this!  Yay!  I&#8217;m so Excited &amp; I hope you are too!  ;)</p>
<p>{whisper} That&#8217;s alot of exclamation points huh?&#8230; {snickering}</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.highway12ventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/connect-the-dots-00001.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="connect the dots 00001" src="http://www.highway12ventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/connect-the-dots-00001-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Business is all about making and receiving introductions, so be sure to be up on your email etiquette.</strong></p>
<p><em>By Mark Solon, contributor</em></p>
<p>One of the lesser known parts of my job is making introductions. It’s something I do every single day and, for me, it’s very gratifying to connect two people who might benefit from meeting and perhaps even establish a lasting relationship. Growing up in a Jewish household where my parents and grandparents spoke Yiddish, we even had a word (<em>shadchen</em>) for those who were matchmakers!</p>
<p>For me, it’s a game of connecting the dots. When one of our portfolio companies is looking to fill a position, more often than not I meet a handful of people with the right qualifications for the job. Additionally, when someone looking for a job in a startup sends me a quality resume that suggests some unique and valuable attributes, it’s rare that I don’t know of a company or two in the region that might be a good fit. Other times it’s a service provider looking for a similar introduction. Given that I get to meet hundreds of startups in the region each year, it’s a good bet that I can make these types of introductions and I’m happy to do it.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, most VCs I know spend a great deal of time and energy trying to introduce their portfolio companies to new customers or partners and at Highway 12, we try to leverage our firm’s collective network to do this as much as we can.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people who have asked me for an introduction do a good job of following up and use good judgement in the manner that they do so. However, you’d be surprised how often I’m left shaking my head at the lack of etiquette that I see on a somewhat regular basis when it comes to follow up by those who have asked for the introduction. It’s disappointing to make a connection for someone (which is essentially a soft recommendation, isn’t it?) only to see them make you look bad for doing so. I’ll never stop doing this part of my job because I enjoy it and it’s a great way to help folks on both sides, but poor follow ups are a sure way to make sure that favor won’t be repeated.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to consider when asking someone to make an email introduction for you. Remember, the game is long. By following these ideas, it will help ensure that people will continue to lend a hand when you ask.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reach out promptly</strong>. Sounds easy right? You’d be surprised at how often I see people take days to reply.</p>
<p><strong>2. Move the person making the introduction to BCC.</strong> There’s no need to spam that person a dozen times as you and the third party make plans to meet for coffee. Moving me to BCC ensures that A) I see that the connection was made and B) takes me out of the loop of follow-on correspondence. Start your reply like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>John, (moving Mark to BCC)</em></p>
<p><em>Great to meet you and thanks Mark for the introduction. I’m interested in talking to you about blah blah blah.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3) Save the person you’re being introduced to some time and effort.</strong> If there’s something they can read to help them prepare for meeting or talking to you, attach it in your reply, and make sure it’s brief.</p>
<p><strong>4) If they offer to meet or talk, bend over BACKWARDS to accomodate THEIR schedule</strong>. Remember, you’re the one asking for something. Don’t ever say something like “I’m available next Thursday at 9:30.” The only proper way to address this is “Please send me a few dates and times that work for you and I’ll be sure to make one of those work.”</p>
<p><strong>5) Same thing for location if it’s a face-to-face.</strong> Don’t ask them to come to your office or suggest a place to meet. Ask what’s most convenient for them. You’d be amazed at the chutzpah I’ve seen in these requests…</p>
<p><strong>6) Use spell check</strong>. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>7) Remember that once you’ve engaged</strong>, you’re no longer just representing yourself, but the person who made the introduction as well. Be prompt and well prepared for your follow up call or meeting and take the time to write them a thank you note.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you&#8217;re still looking for new year&#8217;s resolutions, here&#8217;s a good one from Arianna Huffington, co-founder of <a title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a title="TEDWomen" href="http://conferences.ted.com/TEDWomen/program/">TEDWomen</a>, Huffington in the video below encourages her audience of powerful women to &#8212; wait for it &#8212; sleep. Yup, you&#8217;ve read that right: <strong>sleep</strong>.</p>
<p>Drawing from her own experience (she fainted from exhaustion two and a half years ago) and using good humour, Huffington made a good case for her simple (and yet big) idea.</p>
<p>Many studies have confirmed the value of getting lots of sleep. Studies have suggested, for instance, that consistently getting a good night&#8217;s sleep might <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-michael-j-breus/sleep-heart-attack_b_789718.html" target="_blank">benefit your heart&#8217;s health</a> and help you <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/16/fight-the-common-cold_n_797327.html" target="_blank">avoid the common cold</a>. Huffington concluded that sleep can lead to &#8220;a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life&#8221;. Sleep a lot <strong>and</strong> be successful? Sounds like a good deal to me!</p>

<p><span id="more-788"></span>Getting enough sleep is a challenge for many because they can&#8217;t sleep early enough, but here are some things that have worked for me in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doing Bikram&#8217;s yoga.</strong> It tires me out and leaves me with no other choice but to hit the sack.</li>
<li><strong>Running for 30 minutes in the daytime. </strong>See <em>Bikram&#8217;s yoga</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Getting my life organized.</strong> Because it leads to less stress, which lowers the chances that I&#8217;ll be up late.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding coffee after 1:00pm. </strong>Let&#8217;s face it: caffeine isn&#8217;t always your friend, especially once you&#8217;re past a certain time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m no expert in this field though &#8212; in fact, I&#8217;m guilty of sacrificing sleep during busy times &#8212; and so I&#8217;d recommend reading this article that offers <a title="15 tips for better sleep" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-taylor/15-tips-how-to-escape-to-_b_794559.html" target="_blank">15 tips on how to get a better sleep</a> instead.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Can sleep help you become a more successful person? Or is sleep overrated?</em></p>

Since Ryan turned 5 on New Year’s Eve, I thought he just might be deserving of a little ink.</p>
<p>Ryan’s come a long way. When he was 2, a speech delay caused worry that he too was autistic. For a while, he received speech therapy through the school. When you see him now, he is full of life, verbal and quick, playful and sweet. He is good at assembling things and problem solving. He is an attention junky who, when he doesn’t get his fix, can be ornery.</p>
<p><a href="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ryansbirth0991.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-452" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ryansbirth0991.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I am grateful that Ryan will have a normal life, or what society considers a normal life. But feeling gratitude for having a “normal functioning” child makes me feel that I am somehow diminishing Ben, which I would never do. I hated when my parents compared me to my brother &#8212; and here I am doing the same thing! So I will henceforth stop; let’s just agree that Ben and Ryan, like your child and all children, are perfect and precious in their own ways. Let’s also agree that parents who have multiple kids on the spectrum are worthy of our greatest respect. They do not feel cursed &#8212; burdened at times, of course, but equally blessed.</p>
<p><a href="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_5028_edited.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-455" title="IMG_5028_edited" src="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_5028_edited.jpg?w=269&#038;h=300" alt="" width="269" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Ryan’s still very much in his Me phase where the world revolves around him. He loves to play with his action figures and watch Scooby Doo, whereas Ben has never engaged in toy-play. I like to observe Ryan when he’s in his zone, immersed in play, unaware of my proximity: the way he creates his little worlds, or fantasies, and involves his toys in his good-guy-versus-bad-guy dramas.</p>
<p>But it’s also a period of transition for Ryan, as he asserts his independence. Like some pint-sized revolutionary, he recently pulled off a well orchestrated protest, boycotting Daddy for two weeks until he got his “big boy” car seat. He can operate the Roku and always looks for occasion to show me that he doesn’t need my help. When he turned 5, he said, “Now you can’t call me baby.” Yeah, like that’s going to stop me.</p>
<p>The other day Ryan said he wanted more cuddling time with me. Did this kid receive assertiveness training or what? I was very happy to see he has no problem advising me of his needs. In all seriousness, it’s good for me to keep this in mind. Ben is so cuddly while Ryan is always on the move and seems to have less need to be held. But the affection distribution meter is out of whack. He’s right that it’s become lopsided. The little revolutionary has spotted an injustice, and now that I am aware of it I will address it.</p>
<p><a href="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_52751.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_95931.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-463" title="IMG_9593" src="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_95931.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Ryan loses patience with Ben easily. If Ben harmlessly stumbles into Ryan’s space and God forbid brushes up against him ever so slightly, Ryan practically has a crying fit. He points to Ben like a prosecutor: “He did it!” On the trampoline there are now turf battles.</p>
<p>If sometimes Ryan becomes annoyed at Ben, I don’t rush to protect Ben, because I don’t want to create an artificial bubble around him. That’s not fair to Ben or Ryan. It’s why I don’t hesitate to punish Ben with timeouts or mock-spankings and even look for opportunities. It’s important for Ben to know that he won’t receive special treatment. Of course it’s equally important for Ryan to see this.</p>
<p> <a href="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1100097_edited.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-459" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://autismdad1966.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1100097_edited.jpg?w=281&#038;h=300" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>How much does Ryan know? Occasionally he asks, “How come Ben doesn’t answer me?” or “Ben doesn’t really say much of anything, does he, Dad?”  I’ve never spoken to Ryan in any detail about Ben’s autism. He understands that Ben is different from other kids. Sometimes I wonder how this is shaping Ryan. It certainly means he will have to adapt to more alone time and become more independent. Will he become a strong, caring brother who looks out for Ben? It’s already happening. All I know is that I don’t want to be on Ryan’s bad side. What if he boycotts me again? </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have ever travelled near the Texas-Mexico border and stopped at a repurposed snow-cone shack for a cup of <em>shrimp cocktail</em> and wondered what the heck was in it, keep reading.  Even if your travels have never brought you this way, read on.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is a difference between what Canadians consider to be a shrimp cocktail, and what my southern family thinks this should be.  An argument that could start a year-long debate was averted by accepting that a rose by any name would still smell as sweet,  and a shrimp would taste as scrumptious. </p>
<p>The Canadian version, as I will refer to it, consists of big cooked shrimp and a tomato-based horseradish sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://midnitechef.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/100_3278.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-908" title="roasted shrimp cocktail" src="http://midnitechef.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/100_3278.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>To my family here in the south, shrimp cocktail looks more like ceviche.</p>
<p><a href="http://midnitechef.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_0125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-909" title="the other shrimp cocktail" src="http://midnitechef.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img_0125.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Either way you want to prepare a spicy and fresh shrimp appetizer suits me just fine, what matters is enjoying the time spent with those sharing the food.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to prepare the two variations of shrimp cocktail seen above.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600;">The Canadian Version</span></h2>
<p>You will need big shell-on shrimp (10-15 per pound size, ask your fish guy), depending on how much your crowd loves them, buy 3-5 per person or what you can afford.</p>
<p>Simply clean the shrimp by removing the shell, keeping the tails on so you have a handle for dipping.  I find the easiest way is to gently fold at the seam of the tail section, the connective shell structure will pop so that the body portion can be removed without ripping the tail apart.  I always remove the digestion tract (I won&#8217;t eat shrimp with it left in &#8211; ew).  Toss them in a little olive oil, salt and pepper and transfer to a baking sheet in a 400ºF oven for 10 minutes.  You can flip them over after about 7 minutes but they will cook just fine on their own.</p>
<p>The dipping sauce for this cocktail consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>horseradish (from a jar, <em>creamed </em>is fine)</li>
<li>chili sauce (also jarred, I found it next to the Dijon mustards at my local grocery)</li>
<li>Ketchup</li>
<li>fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix equal parts of the chili sauce and ketchup in a small bowl.  Add about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, or a light squeeze of half a lemon.  Add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and stir to incorporate.  If you like a fiery shrimp dip add a good amount of the horseradish, if you are not partial to the heat you can leave it out entirely and still enjoy yourself.  I added 3 teaspoons of horseradish and everyone loved it, however we tend to like heaps of wasabi on our sushi as well.   </p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600;">The Mexican Version</span></h2>
<p>Under the direction of mom, I was tasked with the appetizer to our family gathering.  She called it shrimp cocktail and then went on listing the ingredients I would need to prepare the dish.  My hubby and I looked at her quizzically &#8211; <em>do you mean ceviche?</em>  No, it&#8217;s shrimp cocktail.  It was like trying to explain that a crepe and a pancake are in fact two different things, however they do share some of the same ingredients and look pretty similar.  Just let it go, I thought.  All I wanted to do was eat, and helping in prep means we eat all that much sooner.</p>
<p>This version has a few more ingredients than the road-side original.  In no particular order, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 cups of cooked baby shrimp, the frozen ones work great</li>
<li>6 &#8211; 8 Roma tomatoes, finely diced</li>
<li>2 large avocado, cubed</li>
<li>1 white onion, finely diced</li>
<li>1 &#8211; 2 roasted Poblano peppers, diced</li>
<li>6 Serrano or jalapeño peppers, diced</li>
<li>1 bunch cilantro (about 1/2 cup when chopped)</li>
<li>1/2 Orange pop bottle</li>
<li>juice of 2 limes</li>
<li>1 cup ketchup</li>
<li>big pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Toss everything in a large bowl.  You can make this ahead of the party but leave out the cilantro and avocado until serving time. </p>
<p>Spoon into glasses and provide tortilla chips and crackers for munching.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/185811819_90418abf3e_z.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-282884" title="185811819_90418abf3e_z" src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/185811819_90418abf3e_z.png?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A brush fire has been <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=rss&amp;wm=false">swirling through the blogosphere</a> of late over whether RSS is dead, dying, or possibly severely injured and in need of assistance. It seems to have started with a post <a href="http://camendesign.com/blog/rss_is_dying">from UK-based web designer Kroc Camen</a> that got picked up by Hacker News and re-tweeted a lot. The flames were fanned by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/techcrunch-twitter-facebook-rss/">a blog post from TechCrunch</a> that drove RSS developer Dave Winer into a bit of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/04/rss-war/">a Twitter frenzy</a>. But is RSS actually doomed, or even ailing? Not really. Like plenty of other technologies, it is just becoming part of the plumbing of the real-time web.</p>
<p>Camen&#8217;s criticisms seem focused on the fact that Firefox doesn&#8217;t make it easy to find or subscribe to RSS feeds from within the browser (although Mozilla staffer Asa Dotzler takes issue with that case <a href="http://camendesign.com/blog/rss_is_dying">in a comment near the bottom of the post</a>). Instead of the usual RSS icon, he says, there is nothing except an entry in a menu. But did anyone other than a handful of geeks and tech aficionados make use of those RSS icons? It&#8217;s not clear that many regular web users have done so &#8212; or ever will. Browsers like Internet Explorer (s msft) have had built-in support for RSS for years, but there&#8217;s little sign of it becoming mainstream.</p>
<p>So can we say that RSS is dead? Sure &#8212; in the same way that HTML is dead, or the web itself is dead (if the &#8220;death of RSS&#8221; idea seems familiar, that&#8217;s because it has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/09/13/no-rss-is-not-dead-and-neither-are-rss-readers/">reared its head</a> several times <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/">before</a>). There used to be plenty of HTML editors out there, which allowed people to create their own websites and web pages, but they never really went mainstream either, and HTML has evolved to the point where it&#8217;s a specialty that requires actual programming skills in order to be effective. Is that bad thing? Not if you make a living as a web designer. Hypertext markup language has become part of the plumbing of the web, and now allows far more utility than it used to.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/rss.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-282890" title="rss" src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/rss.png?w=128&#038;h=128" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>In a similar vein, <em>Wired</em> magazine recently <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/08/17/the-web-isnt-dead-its-just-continuing-to-evolve/">advanced the argument that the web is dead</a>, based largely on some faulty data and a perception that apps for devices like the iPhone and iPad (s aapl) are taking over from the regular web. While there is some reason for concern about walled gardens such as Facebook and the control that Apple continues to exert over its ecosystem &#8212; as both the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/11/19/like-democracy-the-web-needs-to-be-defended-its-creator-says/">web&#8217;s inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> and <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/11/25/tim-wu-google-facebook/">law professor Tim Wu</a> have argued in separate opinion pieces &#8212; the reality is that the web is continuing to evolve, and apps could well be just an interim step in that evolution.</p>
<p>In the same way, RSS has become a crucial part of how web content gets fed from blogs and other sites into real-time services such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as aggregation apps like Flipboard, as <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mmccue/status/22199044130476032">CEO Mike McCue noted</a> during the debate between Winer and TechCrunch. Do Twitter and Facebook compete with RSS to some extent, in terms of content discovery? Sure they do &#8212; but they also benefit from it. Along with real-time publishing tools such as Pubsubhubbub, RSS is one of the things that provides a foundation for the apps and services we see all around us, including real-time search (and <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/01/rss-not-dead-yet.html">plenty of people still use RSS readers</a>, says venture capital blogger Fred Wilson).</p>
<p>The fact that RSS may be fading in terms of mainstream user awareness is actually a good thing rather than a bad one. The sooner people can forget about it because it just works in the background, the better off we&#8217;ll all be &#8212; in the same way many of us have forgotten (if we ever knew) how the internal-combustion engine works, because we no longer have to pull over and fix them ourselves.</p>

Dictionaries, even the stodgier names, regularly add new words and phrases that hit the big time, and eventually phase out unused, obscure ones to rescue shelters like <a href="http://www.savethewords.org/" target="_blank">this</a>. Also, we see annual lists of words and phrases that <a href="http://www.lssu.edu/banished/current.php" target="_blank">grate on us like nails on a blackboard</a>, such as refudiate, epic fail and viral.</p>
<p>I like and hate this about my native tongue. I like the fluidity of our daily conversations, the LMAO moments of our melting pot. But I&#8217;m apprehensive about what our collective shorthand will do to our cultural communication skills. Will we graduate class after class of students who can&#8217;t master the art of the complete sentence? Already, I see it creeping into the workplace. My husband, once looking to hire a web designer, received an inquiry written completely in incomplete text-message-speak. &#8220;Ready when u r,&#8221; would not be too far off the mark. This dude&#8217;s first contact with a potential employer was tapped out as casually as the text he just sent his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Something&#8217;s wrong here. I&#8217;ve worked for myself and pitched jobs. I&#8217;ve worked for others and hired freelancers. But I don&#8217;t recall a single cover letter or e-mail to or from a potential employer that was worded so lackadaisically. (Now, there&#8217;s a word worth keeping.)</p>
<p>Maybe this was an isolated incident, and I&#8217;m being too hard on the class of 2011. After all, the only constant in this world is change. Who am I to even think I can hold back the advancing glacial foot of the English language? Perhaps some had bemoaned the introduction of movies, radio, and television as the death knell of civilized culture, as I rail against thumb-typing and strange acronyms now.</p>
<p>We survived early technology. We survived cartoon violence and Watergate. We survived Benny Hill, Wham! and Vanilla Ice. I have a feeling we&#8217;ll survive this current shift in our cultural paradigm.</p>
<p>After all, old expressions have their way of hanging on and easing us into the future. For every three sparkly new words entered into the Urban Dictionary, only one is jettisoned. We still say &#8220;dial&#8221; the phone even though we no longer have dials on our phones. We &#8220;cc&#8221; colleagues who may never have seen carbon paper. Collections of published music are still called &#8220;albums&#8221; even they may only exist as electronic files. Who knows? One day we might still &#8220;drive&#8221; cars that require little more than coordinate programming. Or &#8220;type&#8221; e-mails and blog posts (as I often do) by dictating into our computers. It will be a fascinating world. Although I do hope we continue talking to each other with our mouths, and not just with our thumbs.</p>
<p>Word up.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry. I just have to. This is too good not to share.</p>
<p>So I went to the doctor recently for a physical. There was a blood test, mainly to check that my kidney is functioning appropriately. (It is.)</p>
<p>I had a particular issue to address at this visit with my doctor. Not to worry. It was nothing life threatening or even mildly alarming. Just an annoyance I wanted taken care of. So I was referred to another doctor and the results of my blood test were sent to her office.</p>
<p>Monday, I went to my appointment with the new doctor and upon introducing herself to me, she declared, &#8220;I think you have the best cholesterol I&#8217;ve ever seen. Obviously you take very good care of yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought back to the card I received in the mail with the results of my blood test:</p>
<blockquote><p>Total Cholesterol &#8211; <strong>190</strong>. Normal = under 200</p>
<p>Triglycerides (fats) &#8211; <strong>69. </strong>Normal = under 150</p>
<p>HDL (good cholesterol) &#8211; <strong>87. </strong>Normal = over 39</p>
<p>LDL (bad cholesterol) &#8211; <strong>86. </strong>Normal = under 130</p></blockquote>
<p>I was momentarily confused. I wondered if my sporadic gym visits, in which I am diligent for a couple of weeks before slacking off for two or three weeks could be considered taking good care of myself. (Okay, that was maybe just in December when I got sick and then became consumed with holiday preparations. I do try to make it to the gym on a somewhat regular basis. But I am far from what you would call disciplined.)</p>
<p>Were my stellar cholesterol levels the result of the sodium laden Lean Cuisines I eat for lunch,  alternated with visits to Arby&#8217;s, where the potato cakes are deliciously greasy and salty? Or Asian Express where, when you order Sesame Chicken, they give you about two pounds of chicken in a delicious caramelized sauce? Plus a huge scoop of rice. Plus egg roll.  (Oooh. I might need to go there tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Wait a minute! Maybe the benefits of <strong>bowling</strong> are much greater than anyone could have ever believed! <strong>That&#8217;s got to be it!</strong> Everyone should bowl at least once a week, a minimum of three games per bowling alley visit. And don&#8217;t forget to drink a few beers. My preference is Michelob Golden Light, but feel free to substitute with your beer of choice. Joining a league and wearing an ugly shirt every week are optional, and not likely to contribute in any beneficial way to your cholesterol levels. But they are fun options. Just a suggestion. (My bowling scores continue to improve with the new bowling ball, by the way. Thanks for asking!)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Really, the only meal I ever eat that I can honestly claim to eat somewhat healthy-like is breakfast. That&#8217;s because I have to bring breakfast to work and I force myself to have some fruit and oatmeal. And once I&#8217;m there, I have no other choice than to eat what I brought. Not that I&#8217;m always happy about it. Lunch is a crap-shoot, as you can see. And dinner? Ranges anywhere from a balanced meal (rare) to breakfast food (semi-frequently) to Christmas cookies (seasonally) to grazing on whatever finger foods are available throughout the evening (most often).</p>
<p>These thoughts all floated through my brain as the doctor was still singing the praises of my healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I just smiled. Healthy? Nah. Lucky is more like it. Somewhere in the gene pool, there must be some good ones, and I was fortunate to get just the right combination.</p>
<p>Of course now that I&#8217;ve just spelled out the particulars of my &#8220;healthy&#8221; lifestyle, I&#8217;m thoroughly disgusted with myself and not naive enough to think I can keep this up without any ill effects.</p>
<p>See where bragging gets you? Guess I won&#8217;t be going to Asian Express tomorrow. Dang.</p>
