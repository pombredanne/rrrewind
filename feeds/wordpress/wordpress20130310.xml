				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_80" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 234px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-80     " title="Babies.... yum." alt="" src="http://adventuresofaculinarymulticulturalist.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/finished-octopus-dish.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" width="224" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I dismembered, cooked, and ate a baby animal today. What worthwhile thing have you done with your life?</p></div>
<p>Scaring my mother with groceries is something of a guilty pleasure of mine.  It&#8217;s one of the few avenues of resistance left to a humble citizen of the People&#8217;s Republic of Food.  I&#8217;m also a big fan of the works of H. P. Lovecraft.  So when I passed the frozen fish section this week and spotted a package of baby octopus, I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>I perhaps should have mentioned that I&#8217;ve got a gold medal in leaping before looking.</p>
<p>A few internet searches later, I knew a few things.  One: baby octopus is better than full-grown octopus (apparently the adults are a bit stringy).  Step ahead, as usual.  Two: either way they&#8217;re tough little sods and have to be tenderized.  The best way to do this is freezing them.  Step ahead again.  I mucked about on the Googles for a bit until I found the dish I was looking for.  One of the Korean restaurants in our neighborhood serves this dish, and I altered the online recipe somewhat to match what I recalled eating there.</p>
<p>When I brought said little sods out of the freezer this afternoon and left them into the sink to thaw, the Gastronomic Gestapo threw a hissy fit.  What the hell were those horrible tentacle monsters in her sink, get them out of there, oh god, o god, there were horrible tentacle monsters in her sink.  &#8221;<i>Ph&#8217;nglui mglw&#8217;nafh Cthulhu R&#8217;lyeh wgah&#8217;nagl fhtagn,&#8221;</i> I gurgled as best I could, but I don&#8217;t think the reference went through.</p>
<p>I had assumed when I bought the suckers (sorry) that they came cleaned.  Oh how wrong I was.  Now, mind, I&#8217;m not squeamish in a general way.  I&#8217;ve gutted many fish, squirrels, and other sundry critters without turning a hair.  But I hate eyeballs.  Eyeballs freak me out.  Octopus eyeballs are apparently worse than other sorts of eyeballs.  I gritted my teeth and cut around them.</p>
<p>My father, to my surprise, begged to try it when I brought it to the table.  I guess it provided a persuasive alternative to the bean soup we seem to live on most of the time.  I&#8217;ve been expecting my mother to yell &#8220;This! Is! Sparta!&#8221; any minute for a year.  He liked it, even though he&#8217;s no great seafood eater.</p>
<p>Mum wouldn&#8217;t touch the stuff with the bow of a steam yacht.</p>
<div id="attachment_81" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 234px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-81  " title="I'a Cthulhu!  I'a Dagon!" alt="" src="http://adventuresofaculinarymulticulturalist.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/octopus-dish-in-progress.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" width="224" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Here you can actually see the octopus.</p></div>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>1 lb baby octopus, frozen (about six of the buggers)</li>
<li>1/2 yellow onion</li>
<li>2 fresh green chilies</li>
<li>1 small red bell pepper</li>
<li>4 to 6 shiitake mushrooms</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sesame cooking oil</li>
<li>2 1/2 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
<li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
<li>5 cloves fresh garlic or 2 tbsp crushed garlic from a jar</li>
<li>1 tbsp sesame cooking oil (usually a mixture of sesame oil and some kind of vegetable oil)</li>
<li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
<li>2 green onions</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Thaw the octopuses by running water gently over it and then letting it sit for a few minutes in a lukewarm bath. Cut tentacles from head.  In the center of the tentacles will be the beak.  Pop it out and take care not to cut your fingers.  Cut tentacles into two-tentacle sections. Open head and remove the insides.  Discard guts, beak and eyes. Cut head into equal sized strips (quarters or eighths).</p>
<p>Cut onion in half from top to bottom, then thinly slice (about 1/8 inch thick). Remove stem from chili/jalapeño peppers, cut in half from top to bottom, and slice into thin slivers. Cut bell pepper in half from top to bottom, then thinly slice into strips. Thinly slice mushroom caps.  Discard stems. Crush or mince garlic into a medium mixing bowl.  Add soy sauce, sesame oil, and gochujang.  Mix well.  Let stand at least fifteen minutes. Add octopus to sauce and let stand for fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Heat a stir fry pan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium.  Quickly add sesame cooking oil, onion and peppers.  Stir fry for one minute. Add all other ingredients and stir fry for about five minutes.  Octopus sections should curl up when thoroughly cooked.  Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.  Serve with rice.</p>
<p>Serves 2 with rice.  Riceless, I devoured the whole shebang myself.</p>
<p>In his house in my stomach dead Cthulhu lies dreaming.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The last 12 months have been a busy time for Seb Lee-Delisle. With a buzzing schedule of speaking, creative coding workshops, exhibitions and public events, it looks like this is the year he's found his feet as a digital artist.

His path has taken many turns. He started by dropping out of a computer science degree, then hopping around various creative digital disciplines, from desktop publishing to music production. In the early 2000s he began to carve out a career in multimedia production for the web. A growing client list led him to set up his own agency, Plug-in Media. But client work began to take its toll:

"We were doing probably the best work you could imagine, very creative, for high-profile clients, but the thing I realised was, even with the best clients, " he said. "I only spent about 10 percent of my time doing the stuff I really wanted to do and the other 90 percent negotiating, in meetings, scheduling, budgeting, and team management – all this extra stuff, which I wasn't that interested in doing. It was frustrating; I just wanted to do that 10 perent."<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=287014&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I've wanted to attend SXSW for years, deeply curious about the confluence of media and technology that descends on Texas each March. In my first trip in person, here's what I've learned so far (and how I've come to understand people who grow weary of "Southby").<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=618890&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I&#8217;m a journalist and somewhat of a nerd, which means I do things like read Romenesko and Poynter for fun every day, I&#8217;ve wanted to come to SXSW in Austin for years. I don&#8217;t remember when I first started feeling the pangs of missing-out-on-coolness-emanating-from-Texas in March, but I definitely muted the Twitter hashtag for at least the past two years and was deeply jealous of anyone I knew who went. When my journalism professors complained about having to go and moderate a panel last year, I thought they were the height of annoying. How could you possibly complain about hanging out with super hip people in a super hip city with tacos?</p>
<div id="attachment_618920" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/10/5-things-ive-learned-in-24-hours-as-a-sxsw-newbie/screen-shot-2013-03-10-at-10-40-31-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-618920"><img class="size-medium wp-image-618920" alt="One of the most in-demand services in Austin? Phone charging." src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-10-at-10-40-31-am.png?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the most in-demand services in Austin? Phone charging.</p></div>
<p>But now, less than 24 hours into my first SXSW experience, I&#8217;m sitting on the floor of the Austin Hilton charging all my dead iDevices, telling someone that, no, they can&#8217;t take my picture for a Tumblr of people charging things and wondering if naps on the plush carpeting are acceptable. My hair is looking sort of frizzy from the humidity and I&#8217;ve been offered more free drinks in place of food than I thought possible. (Please let me know if you see vegetables anywhere. To the lady who told me that &#8220;Bloody Marys are the same as breakfast,&#8221; no, that&#8217;s just not true.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m texting people and complaining about various aspects of SXSW. And thank goodness, they&#8217;re reminding me to shut up.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/06/what-to-expect-at-this-years-sxsw-marketing-makers-and-shadow-events/" target="_blank">the warnings that SXSW isn&#8217;t what it used to be</a>, and despite the frizzy hair and excess drinks, I&#8217;ve still had a blast in the 24 hours I&#8217;ve been here. I&#8217;ve found plenty of geeks, heard live music three different times, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/09/anne-marie-slaughter-on-female-workplace-equality-its-about-men-too/" target="_blank">seen people I&#8217;ve only read about speak in person</a>, and have bookmarked <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP15875?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pulsenews" target="_blank">the idols</a> I <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP15945" target="_blank">still want to meet</a>.</p>
<p>So if someone tries to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/03/05/173097673/why-im-not-going-to-sxsw-this-year" target="_blank">tell you it&#8217;s not as cool as it used to be</a> or that it&#8217;s just over-hyped marketing next year, you should ignore them. And do SXSW your own way. (Even if <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/sxsw-interactive-expanding-next-year-with-las-vega/nSmFZ/" target="_blank">part of the conference is moving to Las Vegas</a> next year.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned in my 24 hours here so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planes from San Francisco to Austin on the Friday before the conference should be re-labeled SXSW shuttles. They should be properly labeled as such, at least for other passengers who don&#8217;t enjoy the sight of startup sweatshirts, discussions of the Soundcloud party, or questions like, &#8220;Hey bro, is that a Pebble watch?&#8221;</li>
<li>When someone asks if your name is &#8220;on the list,&#8221; you should always say yes. Similarly, if they ask if you&#8217;re with &#8220;event PR,&#8221; you should say yes, because it&#8217;s possible they said &#8220;NPR&#8221; and you just misheard them and it will be an awesome party. Similarly, when you hear &#8220;Facebook jazz party&#8221; it could actually be &#8220;basement jazz party.&#8221; These are all good calls.</li>
<li>Pedi-cabs are apparently normal in Austin, and the drivers wear absurd costumes to stand out. I don&#8217;t know who thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to ride one. But people do. And they look like fools.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself to everyone. Say hello. People are fascinating. I took a Sidecar ride (which was free) and my driver told me about his job tutoring inmates in an Austin prison. I took an Uber car (also free) and my driver had worked at a mortician&#8217;s office. A completely random person and I bonded over trying to sneak into a line for free sandwiches before getting kicked out of said line. Seriously, this is like extrovert central; embrace it.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;re always missing out on something cooler happening somewhere else. I think that&#8217;s an inherent part of the experience. But I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m just going to roll with it, and enjoy whatever I&#8217;m doing whenever I&#8217;m doing it. My best time so far was sitting in the basement (not Facebook) jazz bar drinking gin and tonics with basically complete strangers. And there wasn&#8217;t a tacky Interactive badge in sight.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think I&#8217;m an idiot for missing out on some crucial Austin tip or experience? I&#8217;m here till March 12 &#8212; tweet at me at @elizakern and let me know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been getting the question &#8220;When are you competing again?&#8221; especially when I attended the L.A. Fit Expo. With some I have avoided answering them or have given a generic answer. The answer to that question is<strong> NO</strong>. It took a lot for me to write this blog, especially because it is very personal. The reason why I decided to be open about this is because I know there are many girls out there like me that have gone through the same things. They are just too scared and embarrassed to talk about it. I know they feel alone because I did and felt so lost. I wanted to speak out about it because I know I am a role model to others and I don&#8217;t want to say that everything I did in my competitive career was easy. I am at a better place now so I feel open to talk about it.</p>
<p>When I got into my fitness lifestyle I just wanted to be healthy and get  into the best shape of my life. I really didn&#8217;t even know anything about the fitness industry . I just remember seeing the fitness models in the magazines and thought &#8221; Man I would love to look like that&#8221;. Having a pageant background I figured hey this is perfect for me I love working out ,  getting dolled up and getting on stage.I didn&#8217;t really know about health issues that may occur. Even if someone brought it to my attention I kind of blew it off and figured they were just jealous because I was actually doing it instead of talking about it. I trained for 13 weeks for my first show and carb depleted 6 weeks out so I was one hungry girl. Rawrrrr . lol&#8230; After  my competition I remember I pigged out like crazy but hey who didn&#8217;t right? I was in absolute carb coma! I remember for about 4-6 weeks I couldn&#8217;t stop eating and eventually I put the weight I lost back on. Luckily I wasn&#8217;t too heavy before because I was already eating clean and working out so I just looked &#8220;normal&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t think anything about that at all. I just figured since I ate so strict it was ok and normal to go crazy and go to every restaurant. This is a habit I picked up after every show! (like many do) After I would eat bad, I always felt like crap and I thought gosh this is not healthy. The reason why I wanted to get into fitness was to be healthy and here I am wanting bad food like crazy and eating like I have never eaten in my life. At that time I never thought anything of this and I didn&#8217;t think it was an issue. I thought I just needed to get it together and get back on track.</p>
<p>I loved the feeling of being on stage and for my first show I did pretty well that I was hooked. I figured I can keep on doing this. If I continue to compete, I will always be in shape. I will just always eat super healthy and strict. I decided to continue to compete and at my 3rd show I had become an IFBB Bikini Pro. I was on cloud 9! It felt amazing to say I was a pro.</p>
<p>In the two years that I competed as a pro the longest &#8220;off season&#8221; I had was one month. Out of 9 shows, that is not good for you at all especially doing so much cardio and being in a caloric deficit! The first year as a pro I didn&#8217;t care and didn&#8217;t think anything could happen to me. I just wanted to get that Olympia qualification and Arnold invite. I would have done even more shows if I had to to get it.</p>
<p>Before I went on to my second year of competing as a pro, I experienced my first rebound experience oh and the binging was happening again. This is also when I started having insecurity issues with my image. I felt so embarassed  because I had gained weight.  I started having a bigger following and  women that looked up to me so I felt a little more pressure to be super lean. When your in an industry where you get judged on your physical appearance including body fat, you feel a little more pressure to look a certain way. I put on more weight  this time and went into a 12 week prep heavier.  If I would have known better I would have taken a break. But the truth is I didn&#8217;t. I received my invite to the inaugural Bikini International and who wouldn&#8217;t want to do that?  Well this was the first prep that I felt so physically tired from the beginning to the end. It was harder for me to lose the weight and to stay motivated. My heart was not in it like it was for the other shows. The rest of the year was up and down for me. I had so much going on that year  that I was physically and mentally stressed. I moved twice, restarted my business, traveled almost every week, on top of that, strictly dieting and overloading on cardio. I didn&#8217;t realize stress could affect me so much.</p>
<p>After my last show, which was the Bikini Olympia 2011, I had my wedding, honeymoon and just needed a break. In other words not dieting or working out more than two hours a day. I rebounded even worse than the last time. I was such an emotional mess because of the way I looked. It was a drastic change. I didn&#8217;t even want to leave the house. I thought people would talk about my weight gain(which in the industry THEY DO!). I felt so heavy and so tired. I switched gyms because I didn&#8217;t want people to talk about the super fit bikini girl that turned fat. I didn&#8217;t even have motivation to go to work. None of my clothes fit except my black stretchy pants. I refused to buy new clothes because I didn&#8217;t want to accept that I had gained the weight. I told myself &#8221; No! I will get back on track and start doing more cardio&#8221;. That didn&#8217;t work either! By this point I started wishing I had never competed. I deleted my Facebook because I didn&#8217;t want to hear about who was training and dieting for whatever show because majority of my friends on it compete.</p>
<p>I had to figure out what was wrong with me. After talking to a few friends that had experienced the same things as  me, I finally went to see a homeopathic doctor. Well just like many other figure and bikini competitors I had metabolic damage and my hormones were all out of wack. I thought &#8221; how did I get myself into this mess and what am I going to do to fix it?&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what did I do? I got a lot of support from a lot of people. I slept more. I  took time off from the gym. I stopped doing cardio and strength training for a little while to let my body rest and reset. For my sanity I did yoga. I ate healthy but I didn&#8217;t deprive myself. If I wanted a treat meal, I had a treat meal. I  took a break from stimulants. I was drinking too much coffee and too many fat burners. I also gave myself a lot of time. I am still giving myself time. I have lost majority of the weight but I am not so worried about it anymore. I know that it will come and I am no longer in a hurry. When you decide to not stress about it your body will respond better. I have accepted myself any size shape or form. For simply being, we are all beautiful. I finally got to a point where I enjoy working out and love eating healthy again. I don&#8217;t get unhealthy cravings all the time and when I do I allow myself to have treats in moderation.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t write this blog to bash anybody that competes because I respect many women that do. If It wasn&#8217;t for competing I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today. It has allowed me to have a platform to continue to motivate others. You don&#8217;t have to compete to inspire others though. This doesn&#8217;t happen to everyone but it does happen to many. If your going through the same thing please for the sake of your health take a break! Your body will love you for it. Also If your body can&#8217;t get lean enough in a certain prep time to where you have to do hours of cardio or crash diet, give yourself more time. Competitions will always be there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150045.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12429" alt="P1150045" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150045.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about layers. Mostly mundane ones: clothes, coats and covers, the management of which occupies a ridiculous amount of my time, what with a child and March&#8217;s capricious climate. Not that this ridiculous amount of time ever seems to pay off. I am, it seems, destined to always get it wrong and we end up either hot and bothered, cold and cantankerous or simply soaking wet.</p>
<p>My almost impressive ability to misjudge meteorological matters was less important when it was just me. But now I have a small boy clamped to my chest or clutching my hand, a small inappropriately dressed 18 month-old boy whose every sniff and sneeze precipitates a chorus of <em>street tutting </em>and disapproval &#8211;  &#8217;<em>Non si fa cosi signora! Povero bambino</em>&#8216; &#8211;  I wish I could judge the layers better! At least once in a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150046.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12430" alt="P1150046" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150046.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Inappropriately dressed we&#8217;ve been walking in search of less mundane and more intriguing layers. Armed with Elizabeth Speller&#8217;s engaging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rome-Granta-Guides-Elizabeth-Speller/dp/1862077444" target="_blank">book</a> of ten guided walks &#8211; of which we have now completed seven &#8211;  we&#8217;ve been discovering Rome anew, observing layer upon layer of her glorious and inglorious past and her shambolic and sublime present. Of course the great baroque facades, imperial ruins and <em>palazzi</em> of renaissance prices are stupendous. As are the tiny <em>piazze</em>, labyrinthine cobbled alleys and half forgotten fountains. But it&#8217;s the unexpected and incongruous that really arrests me, when fragments, as ES puts it, &#8216;burst forth.&#8217;</p>
<p>A single arch of an ancient edifice rising forlornly between two 19th century apartment blocks, a 2000 year old column holding up a tenement kitchen, a routine hole for a routine check by the Roman water board that has been appropriated by archeologists, a mechanics workshop built into an ancient pile of broken pots, an ancient arch &#8211; onto which an unsupervised dog is relieving himself &#8211; marooned in the middle of the pavement beside a busy road. Antiquity bursting forth and then just sitting there nonchalantly while perfectly modern lives roar or meander by. Layer upon layer.</p>
<p>At home there have been layers of <em>lasagne</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150047.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12440" alt="P1150047" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150047.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>It has taken me a year to lift the pasta maker maker out of its box and clamp it to the work surface. I&#8217;m as proficient at procrastination as I am meteorological misjudgment. If the truth be known the chrome plated steel <a href="http://www.imperia.com/prodotti/imperia_ipasta.php" target="_blank">Imperia</a> would still be languishing in cardboard at the bottom of the cupboard were it not for Paola: my friend and <em>lasagne</em> teacher. I met Paola a few years ago when she hosted a party for our mutual friend Sergio in her garden. It had been noted that we&#8217;d get on and that Paola was an excellent cook, We did and she is, particularly when it comes to <em>lasagne</em>.</p>
<p>Before coming to Italy I was deeply suspicious of <em>lasagna</em>, traumatized by too many encounters with thick yellow sheets that managed  - quite impressively &#8211; to be both over and undercooked, big bulging layers of very busy ragu, floods of floury white sauce and cheddar crusts. Thud, squelch, indigestion. It was awful. I was scarred for <em>lasagna</em> life. So scarred, that even the more refined, relatively well executed <em>lasagna</em> left me unmoved. I decided it was best that I just let <em>lasagne</em> lie.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150048.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12431" alt="P1150048" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150048.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I almost spurned the slice Vincenzo brought over to me during the party. Then I realised it was unlike any <em>lasagne</em> I&#8217;d ever seen. Paola rolls her fresh handmade egg pasta <em>as thin as thin can be</em>, which renders it light, extremely delicate and allows it to be the absolute protagonist, appearing in eight or nine layers. The sauces and others layers. whether they be a rich ragu, sautéed vegetables, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, a limpid white sauce are all merely supporting artists. Very important supporting artists mind: proud, present and bestowing deep flavour, but never swamping or overwhelming the star: the almost transparent leaves of pasta. The slice looked a little like a closed accordion, it managed to be delicate and imponderous and yet richly flavored and substantial. I ate three slices. I then lay in somnolent posture under a tree.</p>
<p>Some years later I&#8217;m standing in Paola&#8217;s kitchen in her house near Velletri, a town about an hour south of Rome. It is a vast enviable space, with a pale marble-topped work surface, wood burning stove and wooden table long enough for twelve. It&#8217;s a comfortable and unpretentious space though, with nothing twee or themed about it, no suggestions of whimsical rustic. I note that I could spend a lot of time in this kitchen. We drink coffee and then roll up our sleeves, tie on our aprons and make pasta.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150049.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12432" alt="P1150049" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150049.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>First we make our dough, kneading methodically and rhythmically until it&#8217;s smooth and soft as putty. Then we position ourselves bedside Paola&#8217;s chrome Imperia, launch a blizzard of flour over the worksuface and then begin passing the pieces of pasta between the metal rollers.  9 pieces, passed one by one through the six settings. That&#8217;s 54 rounds. 54 raptious rounds as rolling pasta is one of the nicest kitchen tasks I&#8217;ve undertaken in a very long time.</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how a good and patient teacher can make even the most complicated of tasks seem entirely manageable and you &#8211; the student &#8211; feel capable and just a little chuffed. Not that rolling pasta is particularly complicated. You do need guidance though and some sound counsel about cutting, folding, feeding, dusting with flour and how to manage the ever-increasing lengths of soft, egg <em>lasagne</em>. I&#8217;ve tried as best I can to include Paola&#8217;s guidance in the recipe below. I do hope it is helpful. I would encourage you to find a teacher too, a patient and capable one.</p>
<p>And so the filling.  Being, as it is, the season for the tender hearted warrior of the vegetable world, Rome&#8217;s <a href="http://racheleats.wordpress.com/category/artichokes/" target="_blank">glorious globe</a>, a <em>lasagne </em>with artichokes and ricotta seems appropriate, at least it did in our flat last Monday. Having made your pasta and set it aside to rest, you set about preparing your other layers. First the artichokes, which need trimming, slicing and then cooking in olive oil and wine &#8211; a slow sauté/braise really until they are extremely tender. Extremely tender: a soft, creamy mush really but with some discernible pieces.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150041.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12485" alt="P1150041" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150041.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Next you make a panful of béchamel, which needs to be loose, fluid and pourable. And finally you whip the ricotta into a light, lactic cream with whole milk and season it prudently. It&#8217;s also important to eat at a little of your ricotta cream on toast while you watch your<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68299235@N05/8539086868/in/photostream" target="_blank"> son</a> putting oranges and your purse in the washing machine.</p>
<p>Having rolled the pasta as thin as you dare, you need to par-boil it. A vast pan of well salted, fast boiling water is important, as is an equally large bowl of cold water and plenty of clean dry tea towels arranged strategically<em> all</em> over your kitchen  - which will make it feel a little like a chinese laundry. Bold and brave moves are best. Drop five sheets of <em>lasagne</em> into the water. Once the water comes back to the boil, let the sheets lumber and roll for a minute before scooping them out as you would a slippy, wriggling toddler from a bath tub, plunging them into the cold water (to halt the cooking and prevent sticking, the curse of long, exquisitely thin <em>lasagne</em>) and then spreading them out on the tea towels.</p>
<p>Now is all that&#8217;s left is to assemble, to put layer upon layer. A layer of Pasta, a layer of artichokes, béchamel and parmesan, another of pasta, the next of artichokes, ricotta and parmesan, another of pasta and so and so and so. Use scissors to snip the pasta into shape and do not be afraid of patches. Keep in mind the layers of artichoke, ricotta and bechamel should be<em> scarce and subtle sploges </em>rather than a dense layer<em>,</em> supporting, bestowing flavour but <em>never</em> dominating. 15 minutes in the oven and then a 15 minute rest.</p>
<p>Layer upon layer for lunch. And what a good lunch: delicate and imponderous and yet richly flavored and substantial. A lunch during which I felt proud as punch. <em><a href="http://www.chezraz.eu" target="_blank">Paola</a> ti voglio bene</em>. This is may well become my Sunday best.</p>
<p><a href="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150065.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12433" alt="P1150065" src="http://racheleats.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p1150065.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This recipe is &#8211; like most of my posts &#8211; long and possibly rather daunting (and/or trying.)  The length is due to all the simple but numerous phases, please don&#8217;t let it deter you. Of course time, effort and organisation are required! But it is undeniably, irrefutably, <em>assolutamente</em> worth every minute, knead, rock and roll, chop, whisk and blooming-lovely layer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lasagne ai carciofi e ricotta &#8211; Artichoke and ricotta Lasagna</em></strong></p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.chezraz.eu" target="_blank">Paola</a>, with sound advice from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X" target="_blank">Marcella Hazan</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leaves-Walnut-Tree-Recipes-Lifetime/dp/1857935705/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362768855&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+walnut+tree+cookery+book" target="_blank">Franco and Ann Taruschio</a></p>
<p>serves 6</p>
<p>for the pasta</p>
<ul>
<li>300 g <em>farina di semola</em> (semolina flour) or plain pasta flour</li>
<li>3 medium-sized free range eggs</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p>for the artichoke layer</p>
<ul>
<li>8 large /10 medium globe artichokes</li>
<li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>a glass of white wine</li>
</ul>
<p>for the bechamel sauce</p>
<ul>
<li>50 g butter</li>
<li>50 g plain flour</li>
<li>700 ml whole milk</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>black or white pepper</li>
<li>nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ricotta layer</p>
<ul>
<li>300 g ricotta</li>
<li>150 ml whole milk</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>100 g parmesan cheese</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Begin the pasta.</strong>  Make a mound of flour on the work surface and scoop a deep hollow in the center. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt. Break the eggs into the hollow and then using your fingers beak the yolks and start working the egg into the flour. Bring the dough together until you have a smoothly integrated mixture.</p>
<p>Knead the dough, pushing it forward with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough in half, give it a half turn and press it hard against the heel of your palm again. Knead for a full eight minutes by which time the dough should be smooth and soft as putty. Cover the pasta with cling film and set it aside.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare the artichokes</strong>. Prepare the artichokes by first pulling away the darker tougher leaves, tugging them down towards the base of the artichoke and snapping them off just before the base. Then using a sharp knife, pare away the tough green flesh from the base of the artichokes and the stem. As you work, rub the cut edges of the artichoke with a cut lemon or sit them in a bowl of acidulated water. Slice away the stem and cut it into thick match sticks and then cut the bulb into 8 wedges. In a heavy based pan, warm the olive oil and then saute the artichoke pieces briefly. Add a pinch of salt and the wine, stir and reduce the flame so the artichokes bubble gently. Cover the pan and allow the artichokes to steam/braise for about 20 minutes or until they are extremely tender. The artichokes <em>must not dry out, but stay extremely moist so </em>add more water if necessary. Mash the artichokes gently with the back of the wooden spoon so they collapse into a creamy mush but with some discernible chunks.</p>
<p><strong>Make the béchamel.</strong> In small pan heat the milk and bay leaf until it almost reaches boiling point. Remove the milk from the heat and then leave to sit for 5 minutes. Heat the butter in a heavy based pan; as soon as it starts to foam, whisk in the flour. Keep whisking steadily for 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. Add a little of the milk and whisk until you have a smooth paste. Return the pan to the heat and then add the rest of the milk, whisking continuously until the milk boils. Season with salt, black pepper and a grating of nutmeg. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring and whisking frequently for about 10 minutes or until the sauce is thick.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare the ricotta</strong>. Using a fork beat and whip the ricotta with the milk until you have a soft, light paste, season with salt and  black pepper.</p>
<p><strong>Roll and cook pasta</strong>. Cut the ball of pasta into 9 pieces (the general rule is the number of pieces should be 3 times the number of eggs. So 3 eggs = 9 pieces). Sprinkle the work surface with flour. Set the pasta machine to the widest setting. Flatten one of the pieces of dough by pummeling it with your hands and then run it through the machine. Fold the pasta as you would an envelope by bringing the two ends over each other, so the piece is a third of its length, and run it through the machine again. Repeat with the other 8 pieces.</p>
<p>Close the gap in the rollers down by one notch and run the pasta pieces through one by one. Continue thinning the pieces progressively closing down the notches one by one until the pasta is as thin as you want it. Paola rolls her pasta through all six settings so it is impressivly thin. You may need to cut the pieces in half.</p>
<p>Bring a large pan of well salted water to a fast boil. Prepare a large bowl of cold water. On your largest work surface spread out clean tea towels. Lower 5 sheets at a time into the water. Once the water has come back to a fast boil allow the sheets to cook for 1 minute before scooping them out, plunging them into the cold water and then laying them out on the clean tea towels. Repeat until all the sheets are cooked.</p>
<p>Set oven to 200 ° and grate the parmesan.</p>
<p><strong>Assemble the lasagne.</strong> Rub a little olive oil and a smear of béchamel over the base of the tin ( a <a href="http://www.falconenamelware.com/products/bake-set" target="_blank">34 cm tin</a> is ideal). Arrange a layer of lasagne first, try not to have more than 6 mm of overlap, use scissors to cut the lasagne. Spread a thin layer of artichoke on the pasta, then a layer of béchamel and sprinkle over a little parmesan. Now another layer of pasta, another (thin) layer of artichoke and one of ricotta, more parmesan and a little olive oil. Repeat putting artichokes and parmesan in each each layer but alternating bechamel and ricotta. You should finish with the eighth layer of pasta. Spread over the last of the béchamel, sprinkle with parmesan and drizzle over a little olive oil.</p>

<p>          On the seventh day, God created Facebook, and He saw that it was good. Circa 4.6 billion years later, social media experts attempted to isolate and split a single Facebook atom in order to clone its success. The result was an unanticipated and enormous success. Instead of creating a new Facebook, two opposite descendants arose; the witty Facebook status and wall post chromosomes formed a new site called Twitter, while the mobile upload and photo album DNA became that which we refer to as Instagram. The photo-sharing app burst onto the scene in early 2010 and has been rapidly gaining popularity. How much popularity? The InstaArmy is reported to be about <a href="http://www.geekshut.com/instagram-hits-100m-monthly-active-users/8930">100 million strong</a>. That’s more than the <a href="http://www.google.cz/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&amp;met_y=population&amp;idim=place:3651000&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population%20of%20new%20york%20city">population</a> of New York City. Times ten. But what is it that makes this app so special? Is it the way the ‘Veranda’ filter can make a normal meal look like it came from a five star restaurant? Or the way ‘Hefe’ can transform a random side street into a spectacular destination? Maybe the way any filter can turn a regular girl into a #selfie-proclaimed supermodel #nomakeup #nofilter (#yeahright)? A typical post will garner at least 11 likes from friends. If you’re really good, you can get tens of thousands.</p>
<p>There’s no denying that Instagram can make one feel like a great photographer. When I post a photo of a black-and-white filtered landscape and it gets 70 likes, I feel like a star (The name&#8217;s Adams. <a href="http://www.anseladams.com/">Ansel Adams</a>).  But does taking a quick iPhone picture and slapping a filter on top of it qualify as photography? In the classical sense, I would say it does not. There is so much more to photography than anything one can do with an iPhone. Photographers spend days, weeks, lifetimes documenting places, events, and people. They can shoot hundreds of frames of the same shot to get what they feel is perfection. Personally, I have spent days upon weeks in the dark room working with film and printing photos so I could begin to understand the bare basics of the art of photography. No matter how much thought you put into your instagrams, the whole process maximum from taking to posting the photo takes about five to ten minutes (if you’re spending any longer you’re doing it wrong/need friends). Instagramming itself, to me, is more of a science than an art. One must figure out the proper angle and composition of the photo which makes the subject look most appealing to a viewer, which filter creates the most dramatic effect, at which time of day to post said insta to optimize the number of likes, and which hash tags to utilize to get the largest audience possible. It combines some photography skills along with SMS savvy and knowledge of marketing, including knowledge of your target audience and observation of feedback from your followers.</p>
<p>I don’t think Instagram poses any sort of a threat towards the art of photography; there is a clear division between what makes a good photo and what makes a good Instagram. To sum it up, <a href="http://geofflivingston.com/2012/08/14/instagram-killing-photography/">Geoff Livingston</a> said &#8220;For the vast majority of Instagram users, it’s about people sharing their lives, not engaging in photography as a profession or hobby.&#8221; I believe that while Instagram can be a good way for artists to show off their work, it does not merit any iPhone-wielding teenager a degree in photography. Digital enthusiasts and film fanatics alike can breathe a sigh of relief. (The minute you start seeing “Amaro” exhibits in photo galleries or “Lo-Fi” advertisements in magazines, then you can start to worry.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the morning, a thick, billowing mist blanketed the densely forested slopes of Mt. Marsabit, the extinct shield volcano that lends its name to one of Kenya’s largest and most sparsely populated counties. The soupy fog completely enveloped the rustic cabins of Marsabit Lodge, obscuring from view the picturesque clearing on which it sits. The tepid early morning light struggled to fight its way through the brume, but still managed to rouse D from his deep Sunday morning slumber, the first night of real rest he had enjoyed in a week during which consecutive 12-hour workdays melded into a continuous, frantic rush of last-minute pre-election preparations.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-samburu-women.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3113" alt="old Samburu women" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-samburu-women.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683" width="1024" height="683" /></a></p>
<p>We both volunteered to serve as observers for Kenya’s first presidential election under its new constitution. S was assigned to cover a county in western Kenya. Because D had organized a <a title="Kenya’s badlands" href="http://towelspacked.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/kenyas-badlands/">work trip to Kenya’s remote northern lands</a> in December, the election team decided to send him to Marsabit, a grueling ten-hour drive from Nairobi.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/goat-herder.jpg"><span id="more-3108"></span><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3111" alt="goat herder" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/goat-herder.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683" width="1024" height="683" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/child-with-sibling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3109" alt="child with sibling" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/child-with-sibling.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=678" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p>By mid-morning, strong gusts of wind had dispersed the fog and were busy wreaking havoc on the dusty streets of Marsabit Town. The residents of this sleepy, forgotten part of northern Kenya wrapped their multi-colored shawls tighter and shielded their eyes from the dust clouds as they went about their business, attending open-air church meetings or stocking up at the Sunday market in anticipation of the elections. D and his companions criss-crossed the unmarked, bumpy roads, searching out the ramshackle primary schools that would serve as polling centers for Monday’s vote.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/shopping.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3115" alt="shopping" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/shopping.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=678" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wazee-wawili.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3118" alt="wazee wawili" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wazee-wawili.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683" width="1024" height="683" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lady-in-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3112" alt="lady in red" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lady-in-red.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=678" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p>The day’s work complete and Monday’s route mapped out, D turned the convoy back to the lodge, which is located ten minutes inside one of Kenya’s hardest to access national parks. In December, there had been no time for exploring. D had glimpsed a handful of buffalo in the swamp grass beneath the lodge when he arrived in the evening and saw half a dozen hyenas in the road on the way back out early the following morning. With a free afternoon this time around, D did not need his arm twisted when his Kenyan colleague suggested a game drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/smiling-woman.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3116" alt="smiling woman" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/smiling-woman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=678" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p>The lodge manager spoke of another clearing deeper in the forest, called Paradise, and swore it would stun and amaze anyone who set eyes on it. The road wound its way lazily through the woods, descending precipitously and then ascending again up the steep, rocky hillsides. After 45 minutes, during which no animal deigned to show itself, D’s companions started wondering aloud if the drive was worth it. At last, the path crested one final time, bringing the car to the edge of a precipice.</p>
<p>There was a sign marking a viewpoint, the first indicator that this patch of wilderness actually belonged to a national park. A troupe of baboons had set up shop by the stone marker, but they scattered as the car pulled up and would not return, despite the driver’s best attempts to lure them out of the bush with an apple. The view really was magnificent. Whereas the lodge sits on a clearing made by a small, dried-up lake, Paradise is a full-blown crater. D found himself looking several hundred feet down a sheer cliff that encircled the lush basin, at the bottom of which a shallow lake persisted.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paradise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3114" alt="Paradise" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paradise.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=678" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p>Two KWS rangers materialized out of the woods and pointed out the carcass of a baby buffalo that had been killed by lions inside the crater the previous day. They indicated the path to descend into the crater, but asked the driver to steer clear of the buffalo remains so as not to disturb the lions.</p>
<p>In addition to the baboons, the only mammalian denizens that had shown themselves during this game drive, Marsabit is also home to many unique bird species. However, D’s companions were utterly indifferent to the birds and he decided not to antagonize them by stopping the car at every flutter of wings. Even without the animals, the drive to Paradise was exceptionally pleasant, and a welcome respite before Monday’s hectic runaround.</p>

<p>12. Assume that it&#8217;s possible to recapture the way you felt when you were young, how the perfect clockwork mechanism of the universe used to leave you breathless and giddy with wonder.</p>
<p>13. Assume that there will always be more stories to tell, or at the very least new ways of reinterpreting old fables.</p>
<p>14. Assume that nothing is permanent, that someday even the sun will disappear; remember that everything we see and touch and taste is made of stars that grew and pulsed and died long before this planet ever existed.</p>
<p>15. Assume that you are under some kind of obligation to make the world a better place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moment that Watson became the Jeopardy champion will be remembered as a watershed moment in human history. It is the Gutenburg Bible of our time.</p>
<p>Media interest in Watson seems to have reawakened this month, with IBM now talking about how exactly Watson is being implemented to help make <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/02/08/ibms-watson-gets-its-first-piece-of-business-in-healthcare/">difficult</a><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/02/08/ibms-watson-gets-its-first-piece-of-business-in-healthcare/"> medical diagnoses</a>. In this area where humans just can&#8217;t process the amount of data necessary to make the best decision possible, Watson could be truly revolutionary. For now, Watson&#8217;s work will still need to be checked by meatspace doctors to make sure he doesn&#8217;t send some poor soul off to have a limb amputated unnecessarily, but this does not take away from the awesome power of data processing this will be putting into the hands of doctors.</span></p>
<p>This got me thinking about how life is going to change when we all have access to our own Watson. This raises important questions about how much control over our lives these intelligent agents will have. If you could have a hyper-connected computer intelligence which could monitor everything you say and do to check for errors and help you to consistently come to the best decisions, wouldn&#8217;t you want it? It is not only the high level decisions of doctors that could benefit from more data integration, but every decision we make as individuals could really benefit from a little more intelligence.</p>
<p>Lets take a simple example &#8211; the run of the mill job search in 2025</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Instead of writing a resume, you task your artificially intelligent agent (AIA) to investigate job opportunities. Under your direction, AIA will explore the internet for available job opportunities which might mesh well with your specific skills and knowledge. The stored knowledge base of your AIA might also play into the decision, as you two are really a team at this point and that should be taken into account. Other factors your AIA might take into account, are your interests or willingness to move, where your family and friends live, how much time you have available, how much money you want to make etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The beauty of getting your AIA to do all of this work is that it can make a decision which balances all of the many factors involved with a finesse that a lone human would never hope to achieve. So in just under an hour, AIA brings up 7 draft emails to companies she proposes she proposes would be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>You see that one job is in Sydney, Australia. Your ex-wife lives in Sydney. Do you really want to open that can of worms again? Does AIA have an eye on your romantic life with that option? Maybe AIA just wanted you to consider whether you are interested in rekindling some connection there&#8230; maybe if you decide against this it will lower AIAs ranking of putting you in a situation possibility of reconnecting you with youjr ex-wife&#8230; You have been down this road before, there is no point spending time trying to figure out what AIA is thinking&#8230; Scratch Sydney.</p>
<p>So of the remaining 6 emails: 4 are applying to open job postings that might be interesting to you, 1 is an email reaching out to an old friend at a company you used to work for to see if they are looking for anyone, and the last email is to a company that doesn&#8217;t have an open posting but that AIA inferred from public financial data that it could improve its profitability by 112% by hiring you. In short order, you look over all the emails with the attached optimized resumes and send them off.</p>
<p>The companies all have much more powerful AIA helping their decisions, so within a day or two you have heard back from all of those places you applied. Two of the applications were turned down flat, including the hail mary AIA sent to the company with no official posting. AIA is aware of the emotional impact that such a rejection might have on you, so she softens the blow by pointing out that there is no way to know what crazy strategy their corporate AIA has come up with.</p>
<p>AIA prioritizes what she thinks is the best offer and shows it to you. Its a short contract in San Francisco, the pay is good, and they only need 3 hours a day (under the normal 4-5 expected in many offices these days). AIA also shows you the better salary and work agreement she thinks she can negotiate for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;People used to do all this themselves, <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">what a headache that must have been&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> you think to yourself, shaking your head in nostalgic disbelief. You go ahead and tell AIA that you&#8217;ll accept the job in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Having an intelligence like Watson in your pocket will change every facet of your life; f<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">rom something as mundane as submitting tax forms or figuring out what to have for dinner, to the highest level social and medical decisions</span><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">. You cannot overestimate how significant of a change it will be to have a powerful artificial intelligence agent looking over your interests. Ultimately, the power of decision will still rest in your hands, but an AIA lets you better see the map of where those decisions lead. </span></p>
<p>In the end, with the emergence of AIAs we will address something we hate to admit to ourselves. We are shitty decision makers.  We do our best to weigh the relevant factors and come up with what we think will be the best plan, but we can really only take into account a fraction of what we should. How many ills of the world come about from bad decision making compounded upon mistakes? Some people might fear the loss of control associated with having an AIA help in your decision making, but at the end of the day the AIAs will make us smarter, and a smarter world is a better world.</p>
