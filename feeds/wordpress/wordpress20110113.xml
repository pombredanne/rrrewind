			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lovemesomebooks.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/shallows.jpg"><br />
</a><a href="http://lovemesomebooks.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/shallows1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73" title="shallows" src="http://lovemesomebooks.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/shallows1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=455" alt="" width="300" height="455" /></a></p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve seen the ad campaign for the new search engine, Bing.  The basic structure of the ads is formulaic: someone asks a simple question, and the question sets the hearer off on a stream of consciousness, spouting search engine results that have nothing to do with the original question.  The campaign is called “Search Overload Syndrome,” and it’s not too far from the reality of what the internet is doing to our brains.  Or at least that’s the thesis of Nicholas Carr in his book <em>The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to our Brains</em> (minus the reference to the Bing ad campaign).</p>
<p>Carr is no Luddite: though an English major at Dartmouth, he has been riding the computer wave since before it really took off in the mid-80s, and he readily admits his addiction to Blu-ray, Wi-Fi, Netflix, Pandora, and YouTube.  Nevertheless, Carr doesn’t let this addiction blind him to the very real downsides to our growing dependence on multimedia technology, particularly the Internet.</p>
<p>As the dust jacket notes, the book is “part intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism,” and Carr pulls it off with aplomb.  Drawing on such diverse sources as Socrates and Plato, Augustine, Nietzsche, Stanley Kubrick’s <em>2001</em>, and modern studies on neuroscience, he makes a compelling case that the new technologies have negatively affected our capacity for “deep reading,” and thus for deep thinking.  Usually when people debate new technology, be it the radio, the television, or the computer, the point at issue is the content the media provide rather than the medium itself.  Carr seeks to redress this deficiency.  Carr asks not whether the content available on the internet is good or bad – rather, he asks how the nature of the medium affects the way we think.</p>
<p>The Internet is not the first technology to alter the way we think.  Carr points to cartography and clocks as inventions whose effects extended beyond their original purpose.  Maps, of course, were originally intended to help people navigate and reach places they had never been before.  Once they came into common use, though, they offered human beings a new way to conceptualize the world.  A similar change accompanied the invention of the clock, which led society to conceive of time as discrete units and to construct more precise schedules.  Examples could be multiplied.  Upon abandoning writing by hand for an early version of the typewriter, Nietzsche noted how the device changed his writing style.  With each of these changes, there is both loss and gain.</p>
<p>Carr focuses primarily, though not exclusively, on the loss that the Internet has precipitated.  In my first post to this blog, I suggested that the Internet generates or reinforces ADD.  I made that claim simply based on experience.  It would seem that science actually backs this up.  According to Carr, studies have shown that the nature of the Net as a multimedia technology actually impedes our ability to memorize and to read carefully.  The reason for this is the way our brains work.  In a nutshell (and oversimplifying dramatically), Carr describes the Internet as a multimedia “distraction device.”  The combination of text, images, video, and audio overstimulates our brains and thus reduces our ability to focus.  Moreover, our reliance on technology has impaired our memory, making the act of memorization more rather than less difficult.  Unsurprisingly, one of the primary engines driving the explosion in this technology is money.  To take the most obvious example, Google has an investment in making us surf the web faster and faster.  The more links we click on, the more opportunities Google has to create new ads and thus to make more money.</p>
<p>Again, the book is not an anti-technology screed.  Nevertheless, Carr does raise some reasonable cautions about where this technology might lead us, and at what cost the information superhighway comes.  He also offers some (to my mind sad) prognostications.  Though he doesn’t expect the book to disappear completely, he does see society returning to a more stratified literacy, with only a small elite preserving the ability to read deeply, while society at large continuing down the path toward shallow thinking.  Whether he is right remains to be seen, of course, but the science would seem to support his hypothesis.</p>
<p>On the whole, <em>The Shallows</em> is a quick and engaging read.  Carr has an easygoing style, and he covers a number of fascinating topics: the development of writing and different media, from clay tablets to parchments to the codex; neuroscience; the thoughts of poets and other deep thinkers on the way the brain works.  The structure of the book wittily reflects the nature of internet thinking, with digressions periodically disrupting the flow of the argument.  More seriously, he cautions us about the reduction of thought to information and data and the potential loss of our capacity for reflection and contemplation.  The book helped explain why my students don’t read books (Carr even quotes a Rhodes Scholar from Florida State – a philosophy major, no less – who says that he doesn’t read books!).  It also reinforced my decision to keep this book project going and to limit my time on the web.  Moral of the story: get off the blog, and go read a book!  Your brain will thank you!</p>
<p>Four down, (at least) forty-eight to go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lindsayelisabeth.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/we-heart-it-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1863" title="we heart it 2" src="http://lindsayelisabeth.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/we-heart-it-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing this for about a year&#8230;but I&#8217;ve always been writing songs, I just sort of didn&#8217;t do anything with them. &#8230;But now I am. And everyone seems to like it, which is nice.&#8221; &#8211; Florence + The Machine</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“We don’t like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.” – Decca rejecting the Beatles in 1962</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;All you need is ignorance and confidence, and success is sure!&#8221; &#8211; Mark Twain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love creative things&#8230;I love art&#8230;and I love music.  But I find it so interesting, to see what takes off in popular culture and what doesn&#8217;t, and quite frankly, I get so annoyed when I hear about how many albums Lady GaGa has sold, I laugh when I think of Justin Bieber, and I wonder with all my heart who in the world is buying Kesha&#8217;s album&#8217;s on I-tunes to make her number one?!!&#8230; Sigh, alright, so glad I got that off my chest:).</p>
<p>But the point is, there are a number of different things that may make something &#8220;a hit&#8221; that really have nothing to do with the actual quality of the <em>thing</em> itself.  So what I <em>absolutely love</em> to hear about, are things like the quote about the Beatles above. Sometimes, it takes a while for something <em>really great</em>, to be recognized as <em>really great</em>. &#8230;Take Jane Austen for instance, she died before her most beloved novels were ever called &#8220;beloved&#8221;, before &#8220;I Love Lucy&#8221;, Lucille Ball was told numerous times to try another profession, in Emily Dickenson&#8217;s lifetime, fewer than 12 of her 1,800 poems were ever published, Jack London&#8217;s first story received 600 rejection slips before finally being accepted,  and Ludwig van Beethoven was told over and over by teachers, that he would never succeed!!! </p>
<p>Which just goes to say, that &#8221;really great things&#8221; might  not come in the package that popular culture declares it will, and that truly being &#8220;great&#8221; is not trying to <em>fit into </em>the culture, but <em>stand out.</em>  And in today&#8217;s day, that might even mean just being&#8230;well <em>normal</em>!! Along with quality, talent, hardwork, and with a touch of imagination, and dreams.  &#8230;I like Julia Child&#8217;s recipe for success! :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“This is my invariable advice to people: Learn to cook, try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!” – Julia Child</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So here are some songs I&#8217;ve been listening to from a great little music project called &#8220;Watch.Listen.Tell&#8221;. These bands are <em>definitely</em> not Kesha look-a-likes, which is probably why I like them.</p>
<p><object width="500" height="306"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/b3jjwTWo_9A?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/b3jjwTWo_9A?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="306" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for a good clapping number with awesome harmony, and this has such a sweet vintage/retro sound with a modern spin.</p>
<p><object width="500" height="306"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Oxcs7wkarFE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Oxcs7wkarFE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="306" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I really love this song! And I really like Two Door Cinema club!&#8230;and they&#8217;re Irish!!! U2 is Irish&#8230;Far &amp; Away is an Irish movie&#8230;plus the Irish have very cool accents. This song is so catchy without compromising good guitar riffs and genuine style.</p>
<p><object width="500" height="306"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Aei31Nj_pdA?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Aei31Nj_pdA?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="306" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>She has a nice mix of J.J. Heller and Gemma Hayes in my opinion. I like it for a song to put on while driving through the country in the evening, when the sun is going to set soon.</p>

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">THE Barcelona Chair(s)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align:left;">No really, <em>THE</em> original.  From 1929.  Impressed?  Maybe not.  Well, let me tell you the story of this internationally famous silla&#8230;</p>
<p>Created for the <a href="http://www.expo2000.de/expo2000/geschichte/detail.php?wa_id=11&amp;lang=1">International Exposition</a> of 1929 (hosted by Spain), the Barcelona chair was exclusively designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> for the German Pavilion.  An icon of  modernist design, the chair has subsequently led to countless reproductions throughout the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&amp;q=barcelona%20chair&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=648">You may have seen a few.</a></p>
<p>During the <a href="http://www.steelform.com/bauhaus_furniture.html">Bauhaus era</a>, many architects and designers were keen on creating homes and furnishings for the &#8216;common man&#8217; &#8211; however the Barcelona chair was an exception.  Designed so that the Spanish Royalty could oversee the opening  ceremonies of the exhibition, Time magazine described the chair as  inhabiting Mies van der Rohe&#8217;s &#8220;sumptuous German pavilion.&#8221;<sup> </sup></p>
<div id="attachment_899" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://daraparker.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4105.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-899" title="Mies van der rohe Pavillion" src="http://daraparker.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4105.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh that&#039;s &quot;sumptuous.&quot;</p></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about sumptuous&#8230; but they do charge you $4.5 euros to walk around the marble box.  Typical.</p>
<p>Despite  the industrial appearance of the Barcelona chair, the construction apparently requires significant hand  craftsmanship.  Manufactured by <a href="http://www.knoll.com/products/product.jsp?prod_id=827">Knoll Inc</a> since 1953, the chair is available in  two different steel frame configurations, chrome and stainless.  Of course if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to afford the genuine product (at $6,658 USD a pop), then you will have the opportunity to show your other rich friends the exclusive Ludwig Mies van der Rohe signature stamped into your chair.  Oh wait, did I mention it comes with an ottoman?</p>
<div id="attachment_898" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://daraparker.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4104-e1294837076537.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-898" title="Barcelona Ottomans" src="http://daraparker.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4104-e1294837076537.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The original Barcelona Ottomans</p></div>
<p>I guess once you&#8217;ve won the Museum of Modern Art Award (1977), you&#8217;re allowed to charge as you please.</p>
<p>Disappointingly if you choose to visit the Mies van der Rohe Pavilion, you will NOT be allowed to sit in the chair.  Despite having paid $4.5 euros.  The icon of modernist functional design is no longer functional&#8230; &#8217;tis a shame, no?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;"><img style="float:right;" src="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Health/blackberry_071017_mn.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" />Over my self-indulgent hibernation, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with a smartphone that I happened to receive over Christmas. It&#8217;s a neat little device, and I&#8217;m constantly overwhelmed by all the intricacies of it and the Android OS. It&#8217;s entertaining, but it&#8217;s gotten me thinking about cell phones in general.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;">I haven&#8217;t had mine long enough to fully conceptualize what I&#8217;m going to talk about (which really should say something about how fantastic a writer I am. No, no, please, your thanks are definitely not necessary.) Heck, it still feels like an <span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>electric shock</strong></span> probes its way into my thigh whenever I get a text message. Thanks, vibrate mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;">However, for the cellularly-adept, the opposite problem seems to occur<strong>. <span style="color:#ffffff;">&#8220;What&#8217;s that?</span></strong>&nbsp;Surely that was my phone; after all, people NEED me! I am their lifeblood! They want MY van&#8217;s candy! So let my open up this gadget real quick&#8230;&#8221; and BAM, nothing. Hopes are dashed and disappointment creeps in. Chalking it up as phantom noise, or a mistake in the phone, you go back to your regular duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;">If it only happened once, well, that would be fine. Actually, this process can repeat itself many times throughout the average day, causing a compounding effect with the hopes and disappointment. Especially when you&#8217;re really hoping to hear from someone. It&#8217;s frustrating, because the fault lies entirely with the device&#8217;s owner. The emotional-warhead side of it can aggravate, too. Appearing, at times, like you should spill acid in your ears in order to cleanse this mistaken sensory stimulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;">I can&#8217;t wait until I reach this stage. <span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>Trust me</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;color:#c0c0c0;">Everyone needs to feel wanted. Unfortunately, everyone wants to feel needed, too.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“Anyone can give up, it’s the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that’s true strength.”</em></p>
<p>In honor of the New Year, I thought I&#8217;d see how everyone was keeping up on their resolutions! Each year, you can find that almost everyone adds to their list of resolutions something that has to do with health, weight or being happier. The <em>idea</em> of making these resolutions is very admirable, but the actual <em>execution</em> is usually a lot harder to attain and <em>keep</em> than actually making the goals themselves. Why is it that we work so hard the first couple of months and then just let our old routine sneak back up on us? Before we know it, we&#8217;re back at square one. What is that extra <em>push</em> that we need to complete these tasks?</p>
<p>A short <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5726305/" target="_blank">article</a> describes how creating New Year&#8217;s resolutions is a form of &#8220;cultural procrastination&#8221;, and I <strong>agree. </strong>We wait for a good <strong>reason</strong> to actually <em>start</em> changing a habit that has been negatively affecting us (because obviously the actual habit wasn&#8217;t reason <em>enough)</em>. So we allow ourselves to keep the habit until, <em>hm</em>, the New Year! And although statistics prove that following through with each New Year&#8217;s resolution normally doesn&#8217;t work out, we <em>still</em> attempt them over and over with an incoherent faith that <em>this </em>time<em>, </em>it<em> <strong>will </strong></em>be<em> different.</em> One reason for these failed endeavors, according to the article, is that the goals made are too <strong>broad</strong> and a year is usually <em>too</em> much time to give yourself. If you set more detailed goals within a stricter time line (e.g. monthly), you will be able to reach checkpoints that will eventually bring you to your desired result. Most people make their goals with expectations that are too high, don&#8217;t see results, and end up regressing to their former state. Why? Because it&#8217;s <em>easier</em> than changing your lifestyle, and the old <em>routine</em> is just <strong>too</strong> comfortable. But, <em>is</em> it?</p>
<p>Just like starting a new diet, with resolutions we begin <em>cut-throat</em> and with an unstoppable ambition to be <strong><em>better.</em> </strong>However, after the first couple weeks of starting your new healthy routine, you let yourself slip and eat an entire box of cookies, that TV show about insects you <em>really</em> <strong>need</strong> to watch <em>happens</em> to be on during the time you&#8217;re suppose to be at the gym, and so on&#8211;you know how those excuses go. To avoid burnout from extreme lifestyle changes, creating smaller and more feasible objectives is a much better way to initiate your plan. For instance, instead of avoiding all fats and sugars in your new, <em>hard-core</em> diet, you should allow yourself sweets and goodies in <em>moderation</em>. I mean, who can resist a piece of cake every now and then anyway? This blog is about delicious food, cooking and eating and I absolutely can&#8217;t (and <strong>won&#8217;t)</strong> tell you <em>not</em> to eat anything that might be a little too sweet for a diet! But if you&#8217;ve made a goal (<em>any</em> goal!) this year, I encourage you to work hard towards it&#8211;because I guarantee the feeling and sense of accomplishment after reaching it is a feeling <em>unlike</em> anything else<strong>. </strong>Don&#8217;t forget, this blog is <em>also</em> about living a happy and healthy lifestyle!</p>
<p><em>So, </em>take a look at those goals that you set for 2011 and <strong><em>refine</em></strong> them. Whether it&#8217;s a new exercise/diet routine, being more productive, saving money, learning a new language or <em>keeping up with a <a title="New Year, New Goals, NEW BLOG!!" href="http://lifetasteslikefood.wordpress.com/2011/01/01/new-year-new-goals-new-blog/" target="_blank">new blog</a>,</em> don&#8217;t give up and settle for <a title="2010 Blog Fail" href="http://lifetasteslikefood.wordpress.com/2010-blog-fail/" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s standards</a>. Instead, narrow down each goal by month and write down what you would like to <em>see </em>at the end of that month. This will keep you on track, and each month you can see what you need to <em>adjust</em> to make your end result reachable. It&#8217;s ok to modify your goals, just don&#8217;t give up entirely on them.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s be <strong><em>different</em></strong> this time and not just <em>say</em> we&#8217;re going to do it, let&#8217;s <em>actually</em> do it! Who&#8217;s with me? My resolutions are: post to this blog at least 3 times a week, exercise at least 3 times a week, and spend more time with family and friends. I will also remind myself to assess my progress each month to see how I am keeping up with everything!</p>
<p>What are <em>your </em>goals for this month/year?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being someone who has environmental leanings, i have often found it rather disturbing that here in the UK, applications for wind turbines can be rejected with one of the main reasons being that people complain they will be able to see them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be able to see them from my house!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be able to see them on the hill over there, it&#8217;s just not right!&#8221; Yet mention to these same people that you can see the line of electricity pylons from their house, or that you can see lines of them across that same hill, and strangely enough, they don&#8217;t have a problem. &#8220;But they&#8217;ve been there for years, we&#8217;re used to them!&#8221;. They can&#8217;t seem to see how crazy that is. The fact we have sprawling cities, roads, railways, huge industrial areas etc, then surely wind farms can&#8217;t be any worse&#8230;.can they?</p>
<p>To highlight this attitude people around DRAX coal fired power station, the largest in Britain, were asked about the wind farm built next to it. They complained about the wind farm, yet said the huge ugly power station was ok because they were used to it. Maybe if they give themselves a little time then they&#8217;ll get used to the wind turbines too, they&#8217;re certainly less ugly that a huge power station, and they don&#8217;t give out the pollution either.</p>
<p>Another irony is that houses are often placed right next to pylons, this despite the concerns they can cause cancer to those living nearby. Yet an application for a handful of wind turbines can be rejected mainly because someone will be able to see them from their house a couple of miles away, and of course, they may upset visitors to the area due their presence on the landscape, just like the pylons don&#8217;t!</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that i started taking photos of pylons. Whilst the aim was to show how many there are in our countryside, especially around power stations, i gradually started to see them for the compositional value they can offer an image. The structure of them can also be quite interesting, especially if you get nice and close to them. So although they&#8217;re really quite ugly in the landscape, i have come to see them as a very attractive/interesting photography subject.</p>

That is behind the WHOA!! I&#039;ve got to say one of your finest, no joke!!&quot;  She got what i was trying to do, and said it far more eloquently than i would have.</p></div>

<p>As an add on to reasons given for objecting to wind turbines, i think the funniest has to be against an application for just five on a hill (near a line of pylons) The local complainants claimed that people walking on a nearby footpath would feel like the blades were coming down to chop their heads off!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Handmade Spool Holder" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8_yAcFGYtPA/TSnPrYRFTtI/AAAAAAAAApQ/QQcdO3_bF9w/s512/SANY0393.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="512" /></p>
<p>I had been meaning to make one of these for ages, but it was only after I found all those beautiful vintage wooden spools of thread at the charity shop that I was really spurred on. I wanted to display them as I found them so aesthetically appealing, as well as be able to view and select the colour thread I needed quickly and easily.</p>
<p>When I say I made this, what I actually mean is I designed it and collected all the materials. All the actual labour was done by the boy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how we made it:</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
<p><strong>One piece of MDF 16&#8243; by 12&#8243; </strong>( this was the size the piece already was when we found it in the bin store. Any size could be used)</p>
<p><strong>One electric drill with a wooden drill bit</strong></p>
<p><strong>18 small wooden dowels </strong>(£2.99 from Homebase for a pack of 50)</p>
<p><strong>1 metre of wooden doweling </strong>(from our supply of wood that we scavenge)<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 junior hacksaw</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ruler</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pencil</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emulsion paint </strong>(I used leftover paint from painting the walls)<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wood glue </strong>(£1.99 from Homebase)</p>
<p>(total cost: less than £2 for materials used. I like cheap projects)</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong></p>
<p>Draw a grid of 2 inch squares on your piece of wood.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two: </strong></p>
<p>Using a drill bit the same size as the diameter of your dowels, drill a hole at all the intersections of the horizontal lines with the vertical, making sure you drill about the same distance down each time and don&#8217;t go through the bottom of the wood.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your selection of spools, decide how many small dowels you need (for old-fashioned smaller spools of thread) and how many longer dowels you will need for the modern longer spools. Once you are decided, cut your long piece of doweling to make enough longer dowels for your longer spools. I cut them about 2 and a quarter inches long, using the hacksaw.</p>
<p>I had 35 holes drilled, so decided on 18 short dowels and 17 long dowels.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Constructing the spool holder" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8_yAcFGYtPA/TShkGXgm4-I/AAAAAAAAAT8/L7SflaYTAO0/s640/SANY0013.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="336" /></p>
<p><strong>Step Four</strong></p>
<p>Once all your holes are drilled, put a dab of wood glue onto the end of each dowel and hammer it into a hole. It is quite therapeutic, the boy certainly enjoyed it. Leave it to dry overnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Constructing a spool holder" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_8_yAcFGYtPA/TShkDWz95sI/AAAAAAAAAto/saONNYcEZlg/s640/SANY0012.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="336" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Handmade Spool Holder" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_8_yAcFGYtPA/TSnPkpWKngI/AAAAAAAAAo8/Mqxgpkya--I/s512/SANY0006.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="512" /></p>
<p>Before we had cut the longer dowels to size and inserted them, I couldn&#8217;t resist trying it out with the vintage wooden spools to get a feel for how the finished product would look. Lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Step Five</strong></p>
<p>Prime and then paint your new spool holder in the colour of your choice. I chose white, as it is my favourite colour to paint things, and I think it helps show off the lovely colours of the thread, but any colour would work.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Finished Spool Holder" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8_yAcFGYtPA/TSnPrYRFTtI/AAAAAAAAApQ/QQcdO3_bF9w/s512/SANY0393.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="512" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once it is finished and the paint is dry you can just prop it up on a shelf and admire your handiwork. I have a friend who has a really tall one (she is a professional tailor though) and it is at least 1.5 metres tall. Very impressive. I like mine. I especially like admiring the vintage wooden spools of thread every time I walk past.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alarm clock went off bright and early this morning, and I nearly fell out of bed in my anticipation of grabbing the phone and calling work.  The dreaded snow-line rarely gives any comfort.  In fact, I&#8217;m convinced that the recorded voice I hear on the other end of the line &#8212; the voice which tells me that the offices will be open as usual despite the falling snow &#8211; must come from a tanned individual who resides on the sunny beaches of Florida.  Surely someone from New England would see that the weather outside wasn&#8217;t fit for man nor beast.</p>
<p>But snowstorm after snowstorm, I hold my breath as I make that call, hoping that maybe I&#8217;ll get to spend the day in the comfort of my cozy home.  And then, snowstorm after snowstorm, that recording tells me in its monotone voice that the offices are open and that I should probably get shoveling.  This snowstorm was no different. Visions of relaxing inside with the hubby all day were instantly replaced with the vision of me outside in the cold and wind, shoveling in the darkness. </p>
<p><a href="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5813.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1697" title="DSCN5813" src="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5813.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I think I stared out the window for a good five minutes, willing myself to be tough.  And reminding myself that I wouldn&#8217;t melt, even if I would look a tad bit messy.  There was this struggle of should I call out of work anyway, since I knew that most of the department would.  No one would scold me for taking safety precautions and remaining home during the blizzard.  Safety first, right?</p>
<p>But still, I didn&#8217;t feel right skipping work, when I&#8217;ll have Monday off (due to Martin Luther King Day).  So that was that.  I had to accept reality and just make the best of it.</p>
<p>Still, there was this moment, when Nate and I were outside shoveling, that I just wanted to throw down the shovel and stomp my way back into the house.  I don&#8217;t mind shoveling as a general rule, especially when there&#8217;s a hot shower and a cup of cocoa waiting for me afterward.  But getting sweaty underneath my jacket and also feeling as though my fingers and toes are going to fall off from the cold, just before I go to work for the day?   (It never fails to amaze me how I can be so sweaty and yet so cold all at the same time).  It was almost enough to send me into a frenzy of tears. </p>
<p><a href="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5823.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1699" title="DSCN5823" src="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5823.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Or into a fit of laughter, which is what I did&#8230; twice.  Apparently I laugh when I&#8217;m exhausted, cold, and getting ready to drive to work in a snowstorm.  Good to know.</p>
<p>This guy kindly drove me into work, so that I didn&#8217;t have to face the treacherous, country roads.  It was his day off too, so he could have still been in bed.  Instead he woke up early to help get me shoveled out as well.  I love my husband to bits!</p>
<p><a href="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5828.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1700" title="DSCN5828" src="http://lovingsimplemoments.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5828.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p> Anyway, even if I didn&#8217;t get my snowday, I think I made the right decision in going into work.  God taught me a few things&#8230; Such as how to have a positive attitude, even when things aren&#8217;t turning out the way I want.  <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>That being said, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not REALLY looking forward to having Monday off.  I&#8217;m really, REALLY looking forward to it now! </p>
<p>And who knows&#8230; The winter season is still young.  Maybe I still have a shot at that snow day.  <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
