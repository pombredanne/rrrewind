				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://holisticgender.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/the-rorschach-view/" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-2453 alignright" title="rorschach" src="http://signalstoattend.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/rorschach.jpg?w=270&h=243" alt="" width="270" height="243" /></a>My daughter is taking a poetry class in the fall, and I noticed a book about Rilke&#8217;s <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> on its reading list. She is an occasional poet, the teacher is one of the most talented at our school, and my daughter will get a great deal from the book and the class. Perhaps she&#8217;ll write the poems she&#8217;ll later call &#8220;her first real poems.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recollect my first poem exactly, but my <em>feelings</em> about writing poems haven&#8217;t changed much. Poems are elevated expression—part venting, part vision, part visit with the unknown. After hour upon hour <em>thinking</em> about poetry, however, I&#8217;ve never touched defining the thing itself, the fundamentally mysterious and defiant thing. If a young poet asked me about poetry, I might shirk. My answers double back. You reconsider. You regret.</p>
<p>Over the last year or so, I&#8217;ve been stealing from myself by revisiting posts on my old blog <a href="http://joefelso.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Joe Felso</a>, and one post responded to a challenge from another blogger to say what poetry is and does. The four items I found in my list now seem partially true but also partially overblown, partially strident, and partially self-justification. They need revision—undoubtedly, they will need revision again in a couple of years—and I&#8217;m willing to try. What I said is in <strong>bold</strong>, what I now think follows.</p>
<p><strong>1. A poem isn&#8217;t an argument or a message.</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite articles about poetry to share with students is Mark Strand&#8217;s &#8220;Slow Down for Poetry,&#8221; which appeared in the <em>NY Times Book Review</em>  in 1991 and used his personal story of becoming a poet to meditate on the distinct pleasures of reading and writing poetry. Along the way, he differentiates between fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. Strand says fiction and nonfiction are mired in reality, the former seeking to add to our experience in the real world and the latter explaining it. A novel is successful when you look up and discover you&#8217;ve read thirty pages, all of it happening in your head. However, of poetry he says, &#8220;a sense of itself is what the poem sponsors and not a sense of the world. It invents itself.&#8221; He also says poetry, &#8220;is language at it most beguiling and seductive while it is, at the same time, elusive, seeming to mock one&#8217;s desire for reduction, for plain and available order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strand&#8217;s comments are cogent and wise, but, reread something often enough, and you begin to see holes. This assumption that poetry defies order and our normal sense of the world can be seductive. Suggesting poems have implications rather than meaning invites wandering as well as exploration. And now I wonder, does a poet need something to say? I&#8217;m not talking about poems-with-a-point, poems as arguments, or diatribes, but some necessity to speak, even if that necessity is tough to pin down. Does a poet need a <em>sort</em> of clarity even if it&#8217;s <em>strange</em> clarity? Poems demand emotional logic even when they&#8217;re arational. They come from somewhere and something. Students like to think poems &#8220;Mean what you think they mean,&#8221; but are poems really Rorschachs? How does someone write a Rorschach?</p>
<p><strong>My current verdict:</strong> I do think poets should avoid undue neatness, the sort of diminishing, clarifying activity appropriate to explaining (as in prose) but the poet needs some compulsion to speak even when he or she can&#8217;t clearly define it.</p>
<p><strong>2. No fuzzying up</strong></p>
<p>I ran into an <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/poet_takes_extra_5_minutes?utm_source=onion_rss_daily#email_this">Onion news item</a> once about a poet who takes extra time to remove verbs and punctuation &#8220;in order to give the piece a level of vagueness more suitable for publication.&#8221; What makes this article hilarious is its image of what poets sometimes find themselves doing. However, when you have something subtle to define and express you don&#8217;t need another layer of obscurity. The challenge of helping a reader feel is complicated enough. The modernists made complexity one of the highest aesthetic values, and we&#8217;ve absorbed their perspective by deliberately seeking ambiguity and general murkiness. However, they really sought <em>intrinsic</em> complexity, not after-the-fact, revised complexity. If a poem is complex—and it doesn&#8217;t have to be—it should be because what it represents is complex.</p>
<p><strong>My current verdict:</strong> Don&#8217;t overwork the dough.</p>
<p><strong>3. Think as a child</strong></p>
<p>None of us truly remember when language was new. When my daughter was very young—maybe three—she used to call out from her car seat as we approached the garage, &#8220;Touch the moose! Touch the moose!&#8221; I was worried about her. Then, one day I looked at the garage opener clipped to one of the sun shields. Each shield was a paddle that narrowed to its attachment point in the middle…<em>like two antlers</em>, on either side of the rear view mirror that hung down…<em>like a head</em>. In that moment, I finally saw what she saw, a moose. If we could return to that state of invention—looking for whatever words might cover our feelings or observations—we all might be better poets.</p>
<p><strong>My current verdict:</strong> Everyone says &#8220;Avoid clichés,&#8221; which is good advice. I prefer its positive formulation though. Be fresh. My daughter wasn&#8217;t trying to be creative, to fuzzy up the world or dazzle me…though she did. She was just looking for a way to express what she saw, and, being new to this planet, had to <em>rely</em> on something new.</p>
<p><strong>4. No individual poem matters</strong></p>
<p>When I originally addressed this topic, I said that four of the poems I&#8217;d written were okay and the rest stunk. That statement is just a tad disingenuous. More accurately, many of the poems written to be great poems were overreaching and stilted. The ones written to understand something not finally understandable have been passable. However, if you regard all poems as pure practice, preparing for the day when, having trained the mind to think poetically, you might achieve what thus far you haven&#8217;t, you might be waiting a long time. I love improvisation and play—you need to be receptive—but you also need ambition, at least the hope your current search may yield something good. Otherwise, you will be rehearsing forever.</p>
<p><strong>My current verdict:</strong> Maybe individual poems don&#8217;t matter, but you need to behave as if they do&#8230; because they may.</p>
<p>&#8220;What poetry is&#8221; undergoes constant revision in my mind. In the end, I know little and enjoy that perspective. Poetry exists where challenge and desire meet, where the inexpressible meets the compulsion to speak.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onestalkofcorn6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4304" title="onestalkofcorn" src="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onestalkofcorn6.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>I can be pretty slow at times, especially when I ride my bike.  But that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.  As the only person actually peddling on a road where others are simply pushing a gas pedal, I notice a lot.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center;">For the past couple years, I&#8217;ve been regularly riding on a country road that gives me a great deal to think about: </span></p>
<p><span style="text-align:center;">A plowed cornfield with only one stalk left standing;</span></p>
<p>A barn with what appears to be an old American flag I can&#8217;t identify;<a href="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/barn10.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4305" title="barn" src="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/barn10.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>And a gate that, for all I can tell,  is completely ineffective.</p>
<p>The gate crosses a gravel road that runs between two fields.  Until this week, green stalks of corn filled one of the fields, while the other had no discernible crop. This week, both were plowed. So the road now runs, and eventually dead ends, between two muddy, empty fields.</p>
<p>Other than providing farm workers easy access to the fields, the road doesn&#8217;t serve much purpose. It certainly doesn&#8217;t lead anywhere interesting or provide enough privacy to be a lovers&#8217; lane. Because of that, the importance of  a locked gate with a fading private property sign eludes me.  Since there is no fence on either side, the gate isn&#8217;t really preventing anyone from simply driving around it.</p>
<p><a href="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pointlessgate10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4306" title="pointlessgate" src="http://trinabartlett.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pointlessgate10.jpg?w=300&h=214" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>After passing the gate day after day, I finally took a picture and posted it on Facebook with a question about its purpose.  I got a variety of responses ranging from people who took the question seriously to those who didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The general consensus was that there had probably  been fences around the fields at some point.  When they were torn down, the gate stayed to mark private property.</p>
<p>While this concept still puzzles me, it also reminds me of human behavior in general:  we often tear down fences but leave gates standing.</p>
<p>We say we believe in equal rights and demonstrate this by tearing down barriers for others. Yet we still leave up gates to protect what we believe we earned or deserve and fear others may access or take away.  Sometimes these gates are words. Sometimes they are the policies we support. And sometimes they are even religious beliefs.</p>
<p>But whatever the reason, the gates are there.  And, just liked the locked gate I pass every day on my bike, they provide a false sense of security for some and serve as a challenge for others.</p>
<p>At times, I know I&#8217;ve protected my own gates. But the rebel in me also spends a lot of time thinking about how to get around gates.  And I admit, there have been many times when riding my bike on the country road, I&#8217;ve been tempted to ride around the gate. The silliest thing is I would have no desire to ride on the gravel road if the gate weren&#8217;t there. I certainly don&#8217;t want to cause any problems or do any damage.</p>
<p>But then, I don&#8217;t think people who are seeking greater opportunities have any desire to trample on the achievements of others. They just know the possibilities would be endless if they weren&#8217;t constantly slowed down by so many locked gates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finland, as I&#8217;ve <a href="http://snohomishobserver.com/2012/02/26/before-rather-than-after-the-fact/">written previously</a>, completely revamped its education system. It did so for both obvious and more subtle reasons. First, its international test scores sucked. Second, Finnish leaders were anxious to create a more vibrant, competitive private sector, one it hoped would be spurred by increased educational performance. They succeeded, spectacularly so (<em>source</em>: Wikipedia).</p>
<p><a href="http://davald.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/international-test-scores.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4005" title="International test scores" src="http://davald.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/international-test-scores.png" alt="" width="600" height="759" /></a></p>
<p>But you won&#8217;t hear much about the Finnish reform movement. It is so un-American in both concept and execution. Moreover, even the author of <em>Finnish Lessons</em>, who himself played a prominent role in the revamping, realizes that educational reform of the Finnish kind cannot occur in a vacuum. He quotes from an external audit conducted by the Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development:</p>
<blockquote><p>…it is hard to imagine how Finland&#8217;s educational success could be achieved or maintained without reference to the nation&#8217;s broader and commonly accepted system of distinctive social values that more individualistic and inequitable societies may find difficult to accept.*</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States, as these pages have documented on numerous occasions, is an intensely &#8220;individualistic and inequitable&#8221; society. We have given new meaning to unfairness and inequality. So, it does not surprise me in the least that we cannot comprehend, let alone even acknowledge, that there is a different and far better way to reform our public schools.</p>
<p>In America, we do things insanely backwards, always focusing on after-the-fact approaches while expecting different outcomes with each wave of educational reform. No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top are two egregious examples, both of which attempt to change an entrenched system via &#8220;accountability.&#8221; It works in broad outlines like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Mary wants to be a teacher. She attends college, with an emphasis on education, of course. She graduates, receiving her teaching certificate. A school district hires her. Go forth and teach, she&#8217;s told, probably ill-equipped to do so without months if not years of constant struggle with disturbing child behavior and frustrating institutional pressures. Many of her colleagues will give up the grueling process. And no matter how well Mary believes she&#8217;s doing in the classroom, increasingly she will be judged by how well her students perform on standardized tests.</p>
<p>All teachers in America are under threat by those who presume to know best how to improve academic learning, though they may be furthest removed from the educational enterprise, what I call the crucial interface between teacher and pupil. New York City&#8217;s Mayor Bloomberg offers us the latest initiative, one designed to weed out under-performing teachers. Here&#8217;s the headline from this morning&#8217;s <em>New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Many New York City Teachers Denied Tenure in Policy Shift</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>The accompanying <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/nyregion/nearly-half-of-new-york-city-teachers-are-denied-tenure-in-2012.html?_r=1&amp;hp">article</a> begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly half of New York City teachers reaching the end of their probations were denied tenure this year, the Education Department said on Friday, marking the culmination of years of efforts toward Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s goal to end “tenure as we know it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To many of us, such measures, however draconian, seem reasonable. After all, very few of us are guaranteed employment security. We may think ourselves fortunate to land a job and even more so if we retain it over time. Why should teachers enjoy the same privilege as Supreme Court judges?</p>
<p>Yet, this is certainly not the Finnish way. Nor will Bloomberg&#8217;s harsh strategy improve academic performance. And the reason is as simple as it may appear impossible: successful reform is all about preparing teachers <em>before</em> they enter the classroom and not afterwards. But that&#8217;s not all.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of education? That should be first and foremost in any effort to change the system. Here is Sahlberg&#8217;s suggested answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create a community of learners that provides the conditions that allow all young people to discover their talent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? No accountability? No high stakes testing? No rewards and punishment? No consequences for underperformance? Nope. Finland has none of the above.</p>
<p>To understand why requires a completely different mindset. The Finns have established a selection and training process that yields that only the best and the brightest teach their children. Once successful candidates enter the classroom they are judged professional, with all the prestige and respect accorded doctors and lawyers and architects, if not more so.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned above, the Finnish educational system exists within a broader context, one that is clearly and intensely social democratic. The Finns believe in equality and willingly tax themselves for generous public services. Again, so un-American. Oh, and I should add that nearly one hundred percent of Finnish teachers belong to a labor union, one that is part of the solution and not the problem.</p>
<p>Sahlberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Finnish Way of educational change should be encouraging to those who have found the path of competition, choice, test-based accountability, and performance-based pay to be a dead end. The future of Finnish education described above can moreover offer an alternative means to customized learning. For the Finns, personalization is not about having students work independently at computer terminals. The Finnish Way is to tailor the needs of each child with flexible arrangements and different learning paths. Technology is not a substitute but merely a tool to complement interaction with teachers and fellow students.</p>
<p>As a countervailing force against the global educational-reform movement driving school systems around the world, the Finnish Way reveals that creative curricula, autonomous teachers, courageous leadership and high performance go together. The Finnish Way furthermore makes plain that collaboration, not conflict, with teacher unions leads to better results. The evidence is clear and so should be the road ahead. [pg. 144 of <em>Finnish Lessons</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p>Ironically, the modern Finnish education system draws its intellectual foundations from an American philosopher, John Dewey. Fancy that. Sahlberg invited a U.S. professor, Seymour Sarason to visit Finnish schools and universities. This was a few years ago. At the end of his of his observations and interviews, Sarason told Sahlberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why did you bring me here? Your school system to me looks very close to what John Dewey had in mind and what I&#8217;ve been writing about teaching and schools for the last three decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>Arne Duncan, Mayor Bloomberg, G.W. Bush, Barack Obama, and a host of governors and other politicians offer nothing of value when it comes to reforming our schools. The solution, it seems, is on our library shelves under Dewey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/0023.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1659" title="002" src="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/0023.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>How do you choose one book from a nation of 1.2 billion people – a country that is one of the most culturally rich and diverse in the world and a country, that, as I discovered when I was lucky enough to visit West Bengal last year, is so varied in its constituent states, let alone across its 1,269,219 square miles, that it makes a nonsense of the term &#8216;nationality&#8217; as it is commonly understood?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid I still don&#8217;t have the answer to this question. I struggled with it long and hard. As the suggestions of Indian writers poured in from visitors to this blog I did my best to research and weigh up each one. All to no avail: the more I looked into the many excellent and intriguing Indian authors whose names I&#8217;ve heard this year, the more impossible it seemed to limit my selection to just one work. An Indian friend of mine kindly posted my dilemma on Facebook and yet more names flooded in. The truth was, I could have spent a decade reading Indian literature and still barely have scratched the surface of the literary delights this country has to offer.</p>
<p>One thing I did know: I wanted to read the work of an author who was prized and celebrated in India rather than one who had made his or her name outside the country. As Tim who recommended Kushwant Singh just this week put it, &#8216;rather a lot of the “Indian” writers beloved of the international literati seem to live in London or New York&#8217;. Talented though many of these authors are, they didn&#8217;t chime in with what I was looking for: I wanted to read the work of someone who wrote primarily for Indian readers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, one among the many comments I&#8217;ve had about Indian literature stood out. It was from Suneetha:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;I am from India, and I note that both the suggestions in comments and your list for India reads are those written originally in English. I have to say these are just second best to what regional literature we have here in over 23 official languages and a couple of hundreds of other languages spoken across the country.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>This struck a chord with me. After all, if I was looking for an Indian writer who wrote to be read by his or her compatriots, surely I should choose something written in a regional language, rather than the international lingua franca of the country&#8217;s colonial past? And so it was that I plumped for a novel by one of Suneetha&#8217;s favourite authors: the much decorated Malayalam novelist and filmmaker <a title="Wikipedia on Nair" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._T._Vasudevan_Nair" target="_blank">M T Vasudevan Nair</a>.</p>
<p><em>Kaalam </em>(Time), which won Nair the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1970, follows Sethu Madhavan as he leaves home for college and tries to make his way in the world. The expectations of his rural village rest on his shoulders and his excellent academic record seems to promise him a bright future. Yet, as the years pass and Sethu staggers from one failure to another, consoling himself with a series of hopeless love affairs, his potential seems to tarnish and warp and he grows disgusted with his life. At last, obliged to return to the family home he has spurned for so long, he is forced to face up to himself.</p>
<p>MT (as he is known) excels at presenting experiences that are at once universal and very specific to his characters&#8217; time and place. Readers everywhere will recognise the adolescent Sethu&#8217;s embarrassment at his relations&#8217; eccentricities – his aunt who lies scantily clad on the verandah, for example, and his mother who grumbles whether anyone is listening or not – and his desire to hide his poverty from his friends, as well as the perennial graduate&#8217;s dilemma of needing experience to get a job and a job to get experience.</p>
<p>What makes MT&#8217;s portrayal of these relatively commonplace rites of passage is his insight into the inconsistencies and contradictions that wrestle beneath the surface of all of us as we seek to move through life. From Sethu&#8217;s exasperated interior monologue in the face of an interview panel, to his stilted encounter with a friend who left education long before him and is now married and running a company, the author is a master of the tricks we use to disguise our shortcomings and the way casual questions and pleasantries can strike a person to the bone. This is particularly evident in MT&#8217;s depiction of his protagonist&#8217;s dealings with women: Sethu&#8217;s delight in the &#8216;illusionary obstacles&#8217; that mask the impossibility of his feelings for teenage Thangamani and his wild justifications of his cruelty to his first love Sumitra both point to the self-delusion that keeps him crashing blindly, wilfully on.</p>
<p>These insights are couched in scintillating descriptions, which make the novel a joy to read. There is the loveless married couple for whom &#8216;words had become brittle showpieces in a glass case, to be used only on special occasions&#8217;, the minutes that &#8216;swam before [Sethu's] eyes like bubbles distilled from the indistinct colours of sunset clouds&#8217; and, perhaps my favourite of all, Sethu&#8217;s numbed reaction to his mother&#8217;s death: &#8216;The news stood just outside his mind like a traveller in search of shelter&#8217;.</p>
<p>The editorial decision not to explain culturally specific terms in the text but instead to confine their definitions to a rather incomplete glossary at the back means that readers from other parts of the world may find it hard to work out some of the roles of and connections between characters. There are also some gremlins in the e-edition, which mean that odd words have been misrepresented, making for some rather strange sentences that have to be read twice to tease the proper meaning out.</p>
<p>These glitches in no way hampered my enjoyment of the novel, though. If anything, the initial confusion I felt over the interrelationship of the characters is an added bonus: it means that I will have to read the novel again now that I&#8217;ve got them sussed. I&#8217;m already looking forward to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the cliché goes, little things mean a lot. Recently, I returned to a beach resort I had visited back in the spring. In my previous visit, I noticed that the “C” on the gateway sign to the tennis facility – the Racquet <strong>C</strong>lub &#8211; was missing. Who knows why – maybe it fell off due to age, maybe it was accidentally knocked off by a landscaper, maybe it was removed by a “mischievous youth” as part of a summer prank – but it really doesn’t matter because these things happen, right?</p>
<p>No question, but what also happens at first class resorts is that these things get fixed, usually in very short order. After all, it’s pretty simple &#8211; take a few minutes to hang the “C” back up. However, at this particular resort, which has struggled for years to differentiate itself from other, more prominent nearby vacation spots, if you want to play tennis, still many months later, you go to the “Racquet  lub.” On the surface, a seemingly minor point, but it sure makes you wonder how much effort they put into other details, such as cleaning, food service, etc. If you want to be known as a high-end, exclusive resort, there’s just no room for this kind of slackness.</p>
<p>Most folks agree that changing a culture is one of the toughest tasks you can take on as a leader; however, if you have the wrong culture, you can’t shy away from making the adjustments. One of the toughest assignments of my career was to turn around the culture of a services company that was by all accounts underperforming (especially from the perspective of the angry customers). After a period of assessment, we found that the company had no discernible common culture overall and that, what micro-cultures were there, trended negatively. As a result, we set out on a broad transformation project to build a quality and service-based culture around a set of common core values. Readers of these pages have seen postings before about that macro change process and how it works. The missing “C” reminded me, however, of the importance of making sure you also attend to the micro, almost subtle details in your transformation effort and in your daily management thereafter.</p>
<p>Recently I had the privilege of touring one of our <a title="GWI" href="http://www.yellowparkgarden.com/growing-international-jobs-in-georgia.php" target="_blank">GWI</a> partners’ manufacturing facility (a fascinating and uplifting experience – contrary to popular belief, we do build a lot of cool stuff here in the U.S.A. with skilled, happy workers – but that’s a topic for another day). As we walked the floor, I paid close attention to the gaze and mannerisms of the supervisor/tour guide – he was constantly scanning the environment to make sure all of those little, seemingly minor details were top of mind. Making sure the safety guy had his radio clipped to his belt rather than leaving it on the table nearby. Asking the assembler to move his ladder to a different side of the assembly so it was out of the way (and less likely for someone to trip over its legs). Helping another assembler organize her hand tools in the most efficient way.</p>
<p>In a big manufacturing facility, these aren’t little things – they are <em>tiny</em> things. Why bother? Answer: “Because I tell my people it’s all about Safety, Quality . . . and then Productivity. We do things the right way here.” The supervisor didn’t yell, chide or scold, but he did make sure that his employees’ behavior in all respects conformed to his overall cultural goals.</p>
<p>As the dramatic real estate market fluctuations buffeted my last company, one of my Board members advised me that, no matter what, every day I had to exude confidence, to project to our workforce that I believed in my heart that things were going to work out and to show that in my behavior and mannerisms. Sage advice. Every day, no matter how bad I felt from staying awake all night agonizing over layoffs, struggling with uncertainty, and dealing with the regret of lost opportunity, rather than rolling out of bed late and “going casual,” I got up, put the tie on, and walked uprightly into work bright and early. While we still had to deal with layoffs, uncertainty and regret, we were also able to provide quality services and satisfy customers.</p>
<p>Culture – both and in the broad, macro, Core Value sense and in the micro, behavioral, seemingly nitpicky detail sense &#8211; provides the margin between success and failure. Leaders don’t have to (and in my opinion shouldn’t) be maniacal or ill-mannered like some CEO’s of recent fame, however, to be successful, they do have to insist that their organizations pay attention to detail and do things the right way, no matter what the circumstances. How you deal with the “C” in your organization speaks volumes about what you want your organization to be. Paying attention to detail made the difference for us and for the organizations of those famous CEO’s (the one that paid the most attention to detail likely made the smartphone that’s in your pocket).</p>
<p>Thanks as always for reading, commenting, forwarding and tweeting. Take care.</p>

<h3>Do you live somewhere where it&#8217;s traditional to fence in the family plot?

Any ideas?</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During our week of camping in the Tetons, followed by my daughter&#8217;s wedding, we were audience to the continually changing beauty of the Tetons. I wanted to post a few photos of the Tetons, to show how different they looked at various times of day, but rather than just &#8220;a few,&#8221; decided to post all of the best photos.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>MORNING:</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After unzipping the tent each morning, the Tetons were always my first sight. It became a game each morning to discover how the mountains would look that first hour of the day.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://leavetracks.photoshelter.com/image/I0000cJqRoqcyQHQ"><img title="Foggy Tetons" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000cJqRoqcyQHQ/s/500/I0000cJqRoqcyQHQ.jpg" alt="Foggy Tetons" width="500" height="310" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our first morning&#8217;s view, before the fog had lifted in the valley</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://leavetracks.photoshelter.com/image/I0000vuBy6YyVTwM"><img title="Teton view from the campsite" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000vuBy6YyVTwM/s/500/I0000vuBy6YyVTwM.jpg" alt="Teton view from the campsite" width="500" height="278" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This was the view from our campsite.</p></div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>NOON:</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The afternoons were very warm, and the sunshine at altitude was intense. Everyone got sunburned the first day within the first hour. Each afternoon seemed to bring dramatic weather, with winds and dark clouds, though many times the rain never hit the ground.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://leavetracks.photoshelter.com/image/I0000w4YmvxyLmUQ"><img title="Tetons after the rain" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000w4YmvxyLmUQ/s/500/I0000w4YmvxyLmUQ.jpg" alt="Tetons after the rain" width="500" height="188" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our first view, after a huge downpour</p></div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>and NIGHT:</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The evenings were simply gorgeous. Each evening was different from the one before, depending on the clouds and colors. Our first night there, the Milky Way arced across the sky like a white rainbow.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://leavetracks.photoshelter.com/image/I0000dHk7.OnXrJ4"><img title="Teton Sunset" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000dHk7.OnXrJ4/s/500/I0000dHk7.OnXrJ4.jpg" alt="Teton Sunset" width="500" height="144" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our first sunset</p></div>

<p>Words are funny little things. They are comprised of the smallest components and manifest themselves in ordered scribbles and patterned sound vibrations. But these small words have made or broke lives, formed civilizations, and even created a bridge between our world and us.</p>
<p>Words are one of the greatest and most enduring gifts that have ever been bestowed upon man. Through words, we can learn about the lives of people who we could never possibly encounter, and even about people who never even existed.</p>
<p>There is a reason why wars have been started over words; why kings have restricted their circulation; why people have dedicated their lives to words: words have the power to move souls. They also have the power to bring chaos if used for negative intentions. The old saying goes that the pen is mightier than the sword. This is because the sword can only touch one person at a time, but a word&#8230;a single word can spread to every mind if given the chance. It’s not only mightier than the sword, perhaps the two should not even be uttered in the same breath.</p>
<p>They can relay everyday information: “meet me here.” They can spring with divine majesty: “there can always be a bright future for the human being.” They can connect people on the deepest of levels: “I will always love you.” The potential for the word is limitless.</p>
<p>However, the word has one weakness; one glaring flaw that can instantly condemn it to oblivion – it only exists for as long as we decide to use it. For when we stop trying to connect with words, they will simply fade away like a forgotten dream. This is why we must always strive to give speeches, to write, to converse and to <a href="http://therenaissancemind.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/the-divinity-of-human-wonder/">wonder</a>. A single word can seem small, but its import couldn’t be bigger. And when combined with other words, it can give us a livelihood all of our own. So, let us use our words, and use them with wisdom and care.</p>
<p>Then again, what I do I know&#8230;they’re just words, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My phone displayed that I had a voicemail. Normally I don&#8217;t bother with my phone while I&#8217;m traveling abroad, and I figure that I&#8217;ll listen to voicemail when I get back to the U.S. Besides, anyone important who needed to reach me while I was on holiday in Bath, England knew to just text me.</p>
<div id="attachment_1064" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0399.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1064" title="Castle Comb" src="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0399.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Castle Comb in the Cotswolds</p></div>
<p>It was day three of my epic romantic rendezvous in Bath, England with my long-distance suitor <a title="A Scotland Rendezvous" href="http://babyaspirinyears.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/a-scotland-rendezvous/">I met in Scotland</a> just eight weeks prior. No distractions. No phones. Just the two us to discover Bath, the Cotswolds, and to see if I could muster the courage to say, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the phone. There was a message on it and I had this feeling I needed to listen to this voicemail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Lisa,&#8221; the voice said. &#8220;This is Jana, Jessica&#8217;s sister. I&#8217;m sorry to have to tell you, but Jessica passed away and I know you two were close and I found your phone number in her address book. I wanted to let you know when the funeral will be, so call me at&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just stood there looking at the stupid phone in my hand. Tears welled up in my eyes so fast that it felt like they were coming like a big wave that crashes on the shore. I inhaled and then crash! I couldn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>Jessica and I worked together in Menlo Park, California back in the 90s. When I moved away we phoned each other weekly and wrote long epistles back and forth to each other over email where we lamented about men, our jobs, men, our coworkers, men. You get the picture. We would even watch the Oscars together over the phone and make snarky comments throughout the show. (This is what we did before Twitter, my friends.) We went to Giants games when I would come to town and traded books through the mail.</p>
<p>She also had lupus and had contracted an infection from a pedicure she received from a salon in her neighborhood. The infection was so bad she was hospitalized the last several months of her life and I frequently called her at the Kaiser Hospital in Mountain View, knowing I could be easily directed to her room where I would update her on what happened in Scotland and this fantastic guy I had just met.</p>
<p>But she died.</p>
<p>Steve walked in the room and I looked up at him and he had that look on his face—the &#8220;Oh crap, she&#8217;s crying. What do I do?&#8221; look. I blurted out the words, &#8220;My friend.&#8221; Tears not just rolling but pouring down my face. &#8220;She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;Her sister. She left me a message.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t breath and pressed my face into his chest and sobbed. I sobbed big heavy, almost-hyperventalating tears.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;I love yous&#8221; and the never-ending tears</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m in Bath. Just the night before I said, &#8220;I love you&#8221; and he said it back (<em>thank goodness</em>). Big moment. <em>Colossal</em> moment. This is the desired outcome Jane Austen writes about, but I was grieving. I pulled myself together and we went downstairs to breakfast where our Bed and Breakfast host served us breakfast while I gave up trying to control the tears that seemed to never ever stop. I was sure that the other guests and the host thought we had been fighting.</p>
<div id="attachment_1063" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0396.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1063" title="Castle Comb" src="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0396.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A church in Castle Comb in the Cotswolds</p></div>
<p>Move on with our day&#8217;s plans. That was the only thing that we could really do. This was the day we were going to discover the Cotswold region. Every guidebook seemed to write lovingly of the romantic quaint region with its stone homes, thatched roofs and cream teas. I studied the region ahead of time. I was prepared to get wrapped up in it, but I was sad. So very sad.</p>
<p><a href="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_04151.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1068" title="100_0415" src="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_04151.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>The verdant landscape of the Cotswolds was like looking at a poem. There is a cadence to the hills and each little village was like hitting upon the rhyme at the end of a line. They all looked similar, but they had their own character, like words that sound the same but aren&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t a sad poem and it wasn&#8217;t a happy poem, but it was a comforting one.</p>
<div id="attachment_1066" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0408.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1066" title="Bourton on the Wold" src="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0408.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bourton on the Wold</p></div>
<p>We held hands as we walked along the pathway at Bourton on the Wold, and we would have moments of silence and then I would start talking about Jessica. Then I would tear up again and return back to silence. I didn&#8217;t quite know how to feel. My heart hung heavy with grief, but was also bursting out of my chest with spectacular joy and the feeling of being in love. I couldn&#8217;t have been in a more bifurcated moment in my entire life. Or is it possible to have two hearts in this kind of experience?</p>
<h3>This picture with smiles and a sad heart</h3>
<p>I wanted a photo of us in this lovely place. I asked a man if he could take our photo and Steve and I sat on a bench. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; the man said as he pointed to another bench. &#8220;Sit over here. It&#8217;s much better.&#8221; We moved to the other bench and the man, who turned out to be a photographer, took this photo with my little Kodak point-and-shoot camera. This beautifully, perfectly angled photo.</p>
<p><a href="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0410_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1067" title="Bourton on the Wold" src="http://babyaspirinyears.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/100_0410_2.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a></p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m spoiling the ending here but you know already that I married that man. Fast forward almost two years later and as a wedding gift, the women at my church had an artist paint a portrait based on this photo. When they revealed it to me I wept again. This photo took me back to that time when I was swept up in love in England, where &#8220;I Love Yous&#8221; were exchanged, and if you look really closely you&#8217;ll notice that in my heart I&#8217;m grieving the loss of my friend, Jessica.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Photographer</strong>: Jürgen Heckel</p>
<p>Over the past two months I&#8217;ve been spending my nights working on a personal project that I&#8217;m very excited about. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a couple years now, while I&#8217;m still young. Though I&#8217;m not going to officially announce what it is just yet, I will tell you that it has been one of the most rewarding challenges I&#8217;ve faced since being a student. It has forced me to address various mediums I&#8217;m unfamiliar with; research multiple facets of design that I&#8217;ve never dealt with; trust in, and fight against, myself and my thoughts on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Just recently, I was working on a piece that is going to be one of the final designs for a specific milestone in the project. However, after breezing through the previous designs and necessary projects related to this specific milestone, I found myself at a halt. I had seemingly hit a large brick wall for no apparent reason &#8211; stopped dead in my tracks. I just could not find a way to create something that was satisfactory. I was struggling with forms. I was hesitant about color combinations. I was lacking balance. I was feeling defeated. I was simply not able to connect my thoughts in a way that would allow me to engineer a design with a natural, comfortable feeling result.</p>
<p>That is, until I turned to nature.</p>
<p>I cleared my mind and read a magazine &#8211; something I hadn&#8217;t done in weeks. I watched a movie at home &#8211; something I hadn&#8217;t done in months. I skated on my longboard &#8211; something I had barely done all summer. I did my best to reconnect to habits I lost due to my obsession for this project. I went to the ocean and felt it. I tasted things I hadn&#8217;t tasted in a year. I did nothing for the first time in a long time. Once I returned I found myself slightly refreshed.</p>
<p>Then I turned to the one habit I have regardless of whether I&#8217;m designing or not &#8211; electronic dance music. I put the headphones on and thought about the universe in whatever way my mind felt like wandering. I do this often when listening to EDM. I went from colors, to silence, to darkness, to chaos, to the ticking of a clock, among many other random avenues in my imagination.</p>
<p>I do the best I can to remind myself that we are not in the universe, but that the universe is in us. We&#8217;re a piece of nature. And nature is the greatest designer. With that thought I stumbled upon the following series. This sequence of ideas and events might seem unorganized, erratic, or perhaps boring. But it led me to these photographs. And it&#8217;s these photographs that reignited the fire.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
