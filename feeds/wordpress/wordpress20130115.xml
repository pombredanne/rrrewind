<p>I am holding my future in my hands. </p>
<p>Trembling fingers can barely rip open the plastic casing containing the thin strip that will show me whether I’m pregnant, or have just thrown away a chunk of life savings and my soul on failed IVF.  </p>
<p>My mouth goes dry and my heart starts into erratic bat-wing thumps. I need to do this quickly before I start thinking too much, while I’m still groggy with sleep and this hazy dreamlike state is providing a buffer against reality. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m testing early, perhaps too early. Tomorrow (Monday, 14 days after embryo transfer) is the official testing date recommended by my fertility clinic but I know that I couldn’t face the second week of a new teaching job on the back of devastating news. Testing today will at least give me a few hours to try to come to terms with the result.</p>
<p>I’ve been hyper-sensitive to any bodily symptoms over the last two weeks. Most signs that herald early pregnancy can also be caused by the progesterone supplements taken after IVF, making it impossible to read too much into them. But yesterday my abdomen seemed alive with tweaks, spasms and pulls, which lasted all day. I began to wonder if my embryos were attaching to the womb lining or practising circus skills! Period-type pains, veiny breasts, ravenous hunger, heightened sense of smell and sore nipples also added to the series of promising signs. I couldn’t shake the belief I was pregnant. </p>
<p>The moment of truth… I dip the strip in urine and place it on my dressing table. I lie on my bed and let tears and prayers soak up the longest three minutes of my life.    </p>
<p>From a distance I see only the bold control line. Bitter bile rises to my throat, but when I bring the test closer and into focus I see a second line – faint but unquestionably there. <em>Positive!</em></p>
<p>The sobs flow freely. My legs buckle and I sink back down onto the bed. <em>Thank you, God. </em>I feel a wave of relief but fight the urge to get my hopes up just yet. I have a doctor’s appointment booked on Tuesday and will wait for the blood test results. I can’t relax until I’m sure this isn’t a false reading, or a chemical or ectopic pregnancy. And if I am pregnant, has only one embryo attached, or both? My mind is a tornado of questions and emotions, but the greatest of them all is hope. </p>
<p>It may be foolishly premature, but I order a &#8216;Baby on Board&#8217; badge from London Transport.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Morocco is&#8230;,&#8221; is a  statement I try to avoid making, because it is cumbersome, stereotypical, and leaves no room for the brilliance of our imagination and the diversity of reality. Frankly, I don&#8217;t know what  Morocco <em>is </em> at all. There are so many different Morocco&#8217;s, as each person lives and experiences this country in a different manner.</p>
<p>I live my life on what the French call &#8220;mi-chemin,&#8221; which literally translates to &#8220;mid path.&#8221; I love the idea of always being mi-chemin &#8212; on a journey &#8212; somewhere in the in between. But I also think that this word can translate  to an intersection or the crossing of two paths. In this case, I&#8217;m also living at an intersection; one of culture and identity, and more specifically, one of tradition and modernity.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve begun observing a fascinating juxtaposition between tradition and modernity. The more I think about it, the more aware I am of how these two worlds weave their way through the lives of those who call Morocco home. Tradition <em>versus</em> modernity? Not neccesarily. It&#8217;s not completely a versus &#8212; not black and white. Rather, it&#8217;s more of a mi-chemin. An intersection.</p>
<p>At this point I find myself with the necessity of defining modernity and tradition. This is a feat in itself, and one I do not wish to over simplify. Therefore, instead of defining it, I will give you examples of how I have experienced these these criss-crossing worlds.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizguerra.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/mi-chemin-at-the-intersection-of-tradition-and-modernity/rabat01/" rel="attachment wp-att-870"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870" alt="rabat01" src="http://lizguerra.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rabat01.jpeg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>1. A donkey on the tram</p>
<p>A friend recently told me he saw a man trying to bring his donkey onto the tram. The tram, which runs two lines across Rabat, is the very essence of modernity for this city. Not only does it look like a silvery gray spaceship, but for a minimal price you can conveniently commute across town. When he told me about what he saw, I laughed because it was simultaneously ridiculous and exactly the kind of thing that would happen here. The donkey, of course, is a symbol of tradition; it&#8217;s the very antithesis of rapid, convenient technology. And yet, these two worlds collided mi-chemin as this brilliant man attempted to coax his ass onto the tram. I don&#8217;t blame him for trying.</p>
<p>2. Micky D&#8217;s and conterfeits</p>
<p>Commercial colonization has penetrated itself into Morocco. That&#8217;s to say, those who can afford Western name brands, which include both fast food chains and clothing stores, are gung-ho. McDonald&#8217;s, for example, is one of the most adored restaurants in this city. It&#8217;s posh and American and oh-so-fantastically modern. It&#8217;s always chock-full of customers dressed to the nines. Right down Avenue Mohammed V, where McDonald&#8217;s and big stores flamboyantly boast their presence, there&#8217;s the medina &#8212; the old city. Where a westerner such as myself feels like they&#8217;ve stepped backwards in time. It&#8217;s bustling and chaotic and noisy and the informal economy reigns supreme. Vendors sell their goods from stalls or in the streets and anything is possible if your patient and willing to haggle. The informal aspect of the economy  is what I consider to be the keeper of tradition in the medina and throughout Morocco. Though McDonald&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t stamped its name in the Medina (yet), many other name brands can be informally purchased there. So friends, place your orders for the newest software and technology, because copyrights do not exist in Morocco. You can purchase the most expensive up-to-date products for a fraction of the cost in the Medina. A true (and amazing) intersection of tradition and modernity.</p>
<p>3. A Moroccan wedding</p>
<p>Last weekend I attended a &#8220;traditional&#8221; Moroccan wedding. I was a guest of the brother of the groom, and he advised that I wear the traditional costume, a takcheta. All the women would be wearing one, and I would stand out  if I wasn&#8217;t properly garbed. It was fun, and I felt a bit like my 7 year old self, as I dressed up in my princess gown for the ball. Upon arrival, it was clear that I had made the right decision to wear the takcheta. All the women were decked out. But as I looked around the room, there was one lone man wearing the traditional white jalaba. Every other man was wearing his nicest suit and tie. Again, an intermingling of old and new.  The fashion here in Morocco, is very much a melange of these two narratives. You see both men and women wearing traditional Moroccan clothes, as well as those who wear western name brands. They are not mutually exclusive, however, and many people mix it up depending on the day. I, myself, have been on the hunt for a jalaba and I just purchased my very first pair of babouche slippers. I have a feeling they will soon become a staple in my wardrobe.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://lizguerra.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/mi-chemin-at-the-intersection-of-tradition-and-modernity/297583_3916979293870_1136540551_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-869"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-869" alt="297583_3916979293870_1136540551_n" src="http://lizguerra.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/297583_3916979293870_1136540551_n.jpeg?w=420&#038;h=560" width="420" height="560" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel abnormal to me. In fact, I actually think that it&#8217;s really cool that Moroccans have found  so many ways to retain their heritage while simultaneously transitioning between the stark and contrasting worlds of tradition and modernity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest Post by Edward Ndopu</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 480px"><img alt="Azealia Banks" src="http://d3c1jucybpy4ua.cloudfront.net/data/10574/main_article/Azealia-Banks-2012.jpg?1349956359" width="470" height="290" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rapper Azealia Banks</p></div>
<p>Recently, the media has exploded with news of a Twitter battle between rapper <a href="http://youtu.be/i3Jv9fNPjgk">Azealia Banks</a> and gossip blogger Perez Hilton. After Hilton inserted himself in an altercation between Banks and fellow female rapper Angel Haze, taking Haze’s side, Banks denounced him as a “messy faggot”. She then went on to say that she used the word to describe “any male who acts like a female”. Rumours have since abounded that Banks is being dropped from her record label as a result of her speaking out against Hilton. Rather than taking sides, I believe it is most important for us to examine the context within which this media escalation has happened. Instead of writing off Azealia Banks, herself a queer woman, as homophobic, we should instead be exploring the<a href="http://www.sparksummit.com/2012/06/20/manvertisement-and-femmephobia/"> femmephobia</a> and racialized sexism at play in the public’s response to this debacle.</p>
<p>The public spat between Azealia Banks and Perez Hiton must be understood within a larger context, beyond the binary logic of right and wrong. It is profoundly problematic that much of the cultural criticism framing this fiasco is couched in the “two wrongs don’t make a right” argument. This  narrative rests on the flawed assumption that wrongful conduct on both sides of a conflict functions on an equal playing field. The lens through which we view wrongful conduct on either side (Azealia Banks vs Perez Hilton) must take into account the overarching power imbalances that frame interpersonal experiences of epistemic violence. We cannot dislocate public figures from their sociopolitical locations. The Azealia Banks/Perez Hilton debacle has absolutely nothing to do with right and everything to do with white gay cis male privilege.</p>
<p>White gay cis men have cultural access to the bodies of black women and black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_and_femme">femmes</a>, cultural access that black women and black femmes do not have in relation to white gay cis male bodies. This cultural access allows white gay cis men to caricature black femininities, through mannerisms and voice intonations, as rambunctiously depraved and outlandish. It is a form of ontological mockery that reinforces dehumanizing narratives and racist tropes about black femininities. Perez Hilton, who personifies a homonormative politic, has systematically tapped into the cultural access to which I refer at various points in his career. Indeed, the sassy lexicon he, and so many other upper middle class non-disabled white gay cis men like him, employs rests on the commodification and appropriation of black femme identities. Hilton interjecting himself in a social media dispute between two black women, Azealia Banks and Angel Haze, precipitated the Hilton/Banks altercation, which is emblematic of his (problematic) cultural access.</p>
<p>Because our society subscribes to an insidiously misogynistic sociocultural paradigm, to insult someone, notwithstanding gender, is to invoke the feminine. So what better way for Banks to cut Hilton down to size than to call his masculinity into question? The Banks/Hilton feud had absolutely nothing to do with sexual identity (read: homophobia), but rather, gender power dynamics (read: femmephobia). Azealia calling Perez a &#8220;messy faggot&#8221; suggests an attempt to assert her status as a no-nonsense, hard ass femcee in a largely masculine of center dominated hip-hop industry. Masculine of center queer men, notwithstanding race, appropriate the word bitch. Very often, they use it pejoratively, and with impunity. They&#8217;re seldom called out on the ubiquity of their misguided misogyny. Yet, when it comes to Azealia&#8217;s use of the word faggot, she&#8217;s quickly characterized as homophobic, reinforcing the dominant narrative that people of color are somehow inherently homophobic, to echo <a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/janet-mock-azealia-banks-perez-hilton">Janet Mock’s recent sentiments</a>. Although Azealia Banks is queer, she is not part of a population that would have this slur used against her. That being said, there are other words that are deeply entrenched manifestations of oppression that go unchecked each and every day. Ironically, many gay men who are up in arms over Azealia’s use of the word faggot are the same men who render femme-identified men invisible and undesirable.</p>
<p>Azealia Banks’ <a href="http://www.clickmusic.com/news/article/azealia-banks-loses-record-deal-after-calling-perez-hilton-a-faggot">career allegedly hangs in the balance</a> and Perez Hilton’s remains firmly intact. She’s now regarded as the ratchet, violently homophobic black woman. By virtue of his white gay cis male privilege, Hilton did not have to contend with the implications of calling will.i.am a faggot several months ago. This isn’t two wrongs make a right, but rather, one wrong is minimized, and the other, pathologized.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My relationship with my mom is difficult. She left me with my grandmother in Guyana when I was just three months old so that she could move to New York City, where the public hospital system was heavily recruiting foreign nurses in the early 1970s and through the 80s. True, she did leave so she could give me a better life. And I can&#8217;t imagine how she had to steel her heart to leave her newborn behind, an infant she wouldn&#8217;t see again except in photographs for nearly three years. It&#8217;s not really an unusual immigrant story. And it&#8217;s the story that has formed who I am as an artist&#8212;I am always excavating that loss, how it has informed every relationship I&#8217;ve had since, how it accounts for relationships I cannot seem to start or maintain. Even after four decades, I&#8217;m not sure my mother really understands quite how to love me, or even what to make of me. I&#8217;m sure I still seem like a foreign object to her. But sometimes, we do connect, and it is clear she is my mother and I am her daughter. When we&#8217;re talking about jewelry or perfume, when we&#8217;re being smart alecky and making each other laugh on the phone. She&#8217;s coming to stay with me for a few days after my surgery, and I&#8217;m somewhat anxious. Will this be one of our good times, or will I be counting down the days till she heads home? What follows is a piece I&#8217;ve been working on for several years now, about my mother and me in the wake of my hospitalization for pneumonia.</em></p>
<p>UNTITLED DRAFT</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw what a child must love/I saw what love might have done/had we loved in time.&#8221; &#8212; Mary Oliver</p>
<p>The comb moves in fits and starts through the tangled inches of hair, preceded by the moist shhh of detangler. I sit: my hands have forgotten how to weave braids and even the plastic comb&#8217;s weight is too much for the needle-bruised forearms. It is early February. I have been 36 for a month. I have been sick with pneumonia since Thanksgiving, falling from not feeling quite right to walking pneumonia to eight days of a ventilator doing the work my lungs forgot or were too tired or simply didn&#8217;t want to do. Even now, the nasal canula leaks oxygen slowly down my nasal cavities to the tender airways to the weary lungs.</p>
<p>After weeks of not eating and not moving, after weeks of lab tests that have bruised my arms the color of eggplant, after consultations by a clown car&#8217;s worth of doctors, my muscles no longer work. I can sit up only with the mechanical, imperfect help of the hospital bed. Despite this, the latest nurse has announced that if I don&#8217;t comb my hair, she will cut it off.</p>
<p>In a photo from early December, my face glazed with the happiness of my first published book of poetry, my hair hangs past my shoulders, blanketing my neck in loose, glossy ringlets. My mother has stayed out of my hair since I was in second grade, when she discovered that half a thick braid was gone, lopped off in a panic after my awkward attempts at coming my own hair like big girls had left it in what seemed an untamable knot.</p>
<p>My mother&#8217;s hands have always seemed to me the hands of a nurse, firm but distant. Now they rake the comb through my sloppy skein of hair, untangling, before weaving the weary strands into several small braids. I sit mutely, comforted by the insistent tugging and scraping. In my mother&#8217;s sure fingers there is an antidote to the callousness and carelessness of nurses and aides. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you walk?&#8221; they ask suspiciously, resentfully even, as I call for assistance in using the bedpan or need my diaper changed.</p>
<p>I have written about my mother and me and illness before, an essay about the cornea transplant in my left eye, a dear friend taking the role of mother. That time, everyone asked, &#8220;Is your mother coming for the surgery?&#8221; She did not offer, and I did not ask: I didn&#8217;t know how to ask those things.</p>
<p>But now, she is here.  As her nurse&#8217;s fingers have bathed me, rubbed lotion into my steroid-swollen fingers, we have relearned the clumsy language of need. We are back to the beginning&#8212;baby powder, sponge baths, a daughter literally reborn. That conversation continues even after I am moved to a rehabilitation center where the occupational therapist insists I comb my own hair to regain the strength in my arms, the dexterity in my fingers. I will roll from side to side, inching my sweat pants up my thickened legs. I will struggle to put on my shirt without getting tangled in the cord that still connects me to oxygen. I also will ask my mother to comb my hair every day, let her mow new paths into my scalp. My mother will braid my hair. I will relax into her hands. We will see what love might do, and we will love in time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The baseball writers have voted, and they&#8217;ve <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8828339/no-players-elected-baseball-hall-fame-writers">decided that no one should make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame this year</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.lhup.edu/camps/Baseball/baseball.jpg" width="265" height="213" />They didn&#8217;t vote for Barry Bonds, the all-time home run leader, or Sammy Sosa, who had memorable home run duels with Mark McGwire and is eighth on the career home run list, or Roger Clemens, easily one of the most dominant pitchers of the modern era.  All three fell far short of the 75 percent vote they needed to be elected in the first year they were eligible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://webnerhouse.com/2011/12/16/rock-and-roll-hall-of-lame/">bemoaned the &#8220;grade inflation&#8221; that has seen the incoming classes to the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and other halls of fame become increasingly mediocre</a>.  I&#8217;m glad the baseball writers didn&#8217;t feel the burning need to put a bunch of good players &#8212; but <em>not</em> Hall of Famers &#8212; into the shrine at Cooperstown this year.  In this case, though, no one would contend that a seven-time Cy Young Award winner or the man who hit more home runs than any other don&#8217;t have the stats to make it.  Instead, voters apparently struggled with whether players may have used performance-enhancing substances that helped to produce their great achievements and gave them an unfair advantage over others.</p>
<p>The steroid scandal has been an embarrassment for baseball, and I agree with the notion of waiting for the dust to settle before any leading player from the Steroid Era is honored with selection to the Hall of Fame.  Sometimes it takes a while for the truth to come out, one way or the other.  Players can be on the writers&#8217; ballot for 15 years, which should give us plenty of time to see what shoes may drop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-177" alt="Creme Anglaise" src="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>Creme Anglaise is not custard. It is french for ‘English Cream’ not ‘custard.’ Custard comes from a packet or jar and contains flavoured and coloured cornstarch, which is mixed with a little cold milk and poured into hot milk and stirred. Instant custard. Creme Anglaise is a difficult procedure of heating up cream or milk to boiling point, then reducing the heat, and tempering in a mix of egg yolks and sugar, with vanilla seeds. The mix has to then be monitored closely while stirring, as to not let it curdle (but cook the eggs), and finally refrigerated. If done with precision, you can heat up the mix so that when it cools it sets and becomes a pastry cream.</p>
<p>I have attempted this four times &#8211; and failed twice, although in my defence it happened in one day. We overcooked it and it became curdled beyond repair (by the time I found the antidote of putting the mix in ice, or adding a spoon or two of cold water, my creme anglaise looked like Moses had done his ‘parting the water’ act it had curdled so bad). We tossed it down the sink before the guests waiting in the lounge could see, and quickly tried again, this time with caution and a double boiler (the safer method). Of course, the result was now we undercooked it and it never materialized beyond a broth consistency.</p>
<p>Creme Anglaise is not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>There are some tricks of adding a touch of flour that can reduce the possibilities of everything going wrong. This helps. But I recently decided to ‘get over my fear’ when I got a new cookbook for Christmas. Beluga, a rather prim place in town, published a cookbook that revolved around their signature dishes. One of the recipes in desserts was ‘Blueberry Mille Feuille. According to Google Translate, this is French, for “Blueberry Mille Feuille.”</p>
<p><a href="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-178" alt="Creme Anglaise" src="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>In reality this is just shop-bought puff pastry smothered in Creme Anglaise, with blueberries, layered. In the book they layered it twice and had thinner helpings of the Creme Anglaise. They also baked the pastry with a tray above it so it wouldn’t ‘puff’ as much and be more controlled, and I guess professional. Personally I’m all about being excessive and decadent, which involves ladles of custard, puffing the pastry as much as possible and engorging with richness and delight. Not exactly the type of pudding you should be eating in front of the Queen, with globules of delicious yellow dripping and flakes of perfectly browned (with castor sugar) pastry flying everywhere. Then again, you know what? The Queen wasn’t invited. And I am sure if she had known what I was eating, she might have even been a bit jealous.</p>
<p>As we boiled up the milk and I started the process of separating the eggs, I came across an ingredient in Beluga’s recipe that I wasn’t expecting. Cornstarch. Let me write that again.</p>
<p>Cornstarch.</p>
<p>I was horrified. I did it, but I was horrified. Surely not? Cornstarch is custard, not Creme Anglaise. I know some of the recipes in my numerous books have flour in them, to help with the setting, but surely they wouldn’t go so far as to actually use the same ingredient as that ‘frowned upon’ powder the general public uses, in a recipe that relies on the delicateness of a temperamental egg yolk.</p>
<p><a href="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-179" alt="Creme Anglaise" src="http://mymothersfootsteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/custard3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>My face almost twisted in a snobbery culinary disgust. I’m no chef, but I knew this was somehow stepping over some line.  Did the master chefs at Beluga not have faith in the common household cook to make it the way the French intended, that they strayed so far away from the very essence of Creme Anglaise to make it idiot proof?</p>
<p>This led to some rather debatable discussion between me and my kitchen assistant, as the recipe was almost directly attacking my own, shall we say, custard ethics. If I wanted cornstarch custard I would use custard powder, but I didn’t want custard powder, I want a gorgeous vanilla flavoured filling to my pastry and blueberries.</p>
<p>But what I can’t deny is that it did work. It also set incredibly well. I was able to smother the pastry and it looked great. Should I dare to even confess? It tasted really good as well. The entire time while eating I was trying to find something in the consistency, or flavour to be able to say “I can taste a difference” but I couldn’t. Because the egg yolks were still present and the vanilla alive and fresh, the fact that it had cornstarch in it didn’t take anything away from the end product. It was just an easier recipe, something that the taster wouldn’t know, but the chef would be grateful for.</p>
<p>So does that saying “what they don’t know won’t kill them” and “ignorance is bliss” apply here? Perhaps someone with distinct taste buds like Gordon Ramsay might be able to spot the difference and announce it, if he were present at my dining room table, but otherwise no one else would know. I will say that I feel like I have somehow cheated, but then again it is not like I haven’t made the original and failed. I have made it twice with perfection. After proving I can make it as good as anybody else am I not allowed to use the easier method.</p>
<p>Maybe this one time. But if you catch me using tomato sauce (or ketchup) in my cooking, retire me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-style:italic;">I&#8217;m traveling a lot this month, so please enjoy this repost from 11/<span style="font-size:x-small;">17</span>/10.</span></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"><br />
</span></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<p><a style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://humaneeducation.org/IHEBlog2010/campfire.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://humaneeducation.org/IHEBlog2010/campfire.jpg" /></a>There’s a metaphor I like to use when talking to fellow activists. I ask them to imagine two fires. The first is a campfire in an opening in the woods. The fire is warm and bright and draws people toward it. They are eager to find a place around the fire, and their beautiful faces glow in the reflected light. They feel good. There is nowhere they’d rather be. The second is a forest fire. It blazes hot and out of control, everyone – people and animals alike – flees.</p>
<p>Each of us has a fire inside of us. It is the fire of our passions and our beliefs, and all of us who are activists know it well. It is the fire that spurs us to learn about what is happening on our planet &#8212; to people, animals, and the environment &#8212; and it is the fire that spurs us to action to solve the crises we face and challenge the atrocities that still pervade our world. It is often a blazing hot fire. And sometimes, when we have burned out, it is a barely glowing ember. (There is a reason for the term “burned out” after all.)</p>
<p>As change agents, we have a choice about what sort of fire we will be. Will we be the warm campfire that draws people towards us so that we can share what we know and inspire others to make a difference, or will we be the forest fire that rages too hot, causing people to run from us? This is one of the most important questions we can ask ourselves because the fire we cultivate makes an enormous difference in our effectiveness as changemakers.</p>
<p>But as we know, fire is not static, so whatever fire you have been or are today is subject to change. Fires die out if we don’t add fuel, and the sparks that fly off of them can ignite infernos if we add too much fuel too quickly. As change agents, we must seek that perfect balance, adding enough fuel in the form of knowledge and resources to burn just hot enough to ignite change without igniting a conflagration. We will know if our fire needs more fuel if we are not doing the work that must be done and aren&#8217;t inspiring others to join us, and we will know if we need to let up on the fuel if people avoid us. If we’ve been activists for a long time, we may have noticed that our fiery youth has diminished too much. If we are new to changemaking, we may need to take great care in cultivating our fire so it doesn’t burn too hot.</p>
<p>Tend your fire carefully. The world needs you to burn just right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1085.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4360" alt="IMG_1085" src="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1085.jpg?w=423&#038;h=529" width="423" height="529" /></a>Paprika is a savage red, and though it might sound strange, I like a bit of savagery. I went to the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown LA yesterday where there was a lot of visual angst on display, much of it headache-inducing. Cavernous warehouses full of ripped metal and brown swaddling, swirling red daubs and matted roadkill. The colours were rust and grey and dried blood. Nothing had a frame, the frame was no longer needed. The only room I liked was the one housing the permanent collection, the ones always there; Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns. But it was a small, angry picture, the first one I saw as I entered, that held my attention. It was by Dubuffet, and it was called Le Havre. It was a map of sorts and the colours were magnificently wild and fierce. There was little attempt at verisimilitude. The painter&#8217;s quote next to it caught my eye. It said: &#8220;Personally, I believe very much in values of savagery; I mean: instinct, passion, mood, violence, madness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cooking and food itself is nothing if not a passionate and instinctive endeavour, although it&#8217;s easy to get disconnected from this. Madness I can believe, if only through the sheer boredom and repetition of eating the same things (I am 75% avocado). Violence can be mined in the pummeling of garlic and herbs, the mashing of potatoes, the beating, the whipping, the disemboweling of cake batter*. You can feel as pent up as a boxer and as a zen as a yogi.</p>
<p><a href="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1107.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4395" alt="IMG_1107" src="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1107.jpg?w=423&#038;h=529" width="423" height="529" /></a></p>
<p>The paprika in the photo was in a bowl, powdery like pigment, along with other spices and teas in a stall at the farmers&#8217; market. You were allowed to lift up a spoon of it and smell, and this helped because the one above was smoky and the other paprika was not. But the colour was the reason I bought. It made me want to stick a finger in the middle. It was an angry red; savage, mad and violent. I&#8217;ll see you in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1023.jpg"><img class="aligncenter alignnone" alt="IMG_1023" src="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1023.jpg?w=423&#038;h=529" width="423" height="529" /></a></p>
<p>Jerusalem artichokes with paprika</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Paprika is the dried and ground flesh of peppers (cayenne pepper comes from dried and ground chillis &#8211; it&#8217;s easy to get confused). The peppers are dried from the oven, sun or smoke (the best over oak fires) and used mainly in Spanish and Hungarian dishes. Paprika can be sweet, smoky or hot with a huge variation both in flavour and colour. Try not to put the powder over direct heat or it will scorch and taste bitter. It has an affinity with coriander and cumin and potatoes, as well as chickpeas and dusted over halloumi. I tried it with Jerusalem artichokes to very good effect. The roasted almonds with paprika recipe is a Spanish one and smoked paprika is recommended.<a href="http://breakfastandotherstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1120.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><strong>Roast almonds with paprika and rosemary</strong></p>
<p><em>Adapted from Sam and Sam Clark, Moro</em></p>
<p>250g whole blanched almonds</p>
<p>2 tsps of olive oil</p>
<p>1 tsp of smoked sweet paprika</p>
<p>1½ tsps of flaky sea salt, like Maldon</p>
<p>2 sprigs of rosemary, chopped finely without any wood</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F. Place the almonds on a baking tray and dry-roast in the top of the oven for about 10 minutes or until starting to turn golden. Remove and stir in the olive oil, paprika, salt and rosemary. Return to the oven for around 10-15 minutes. Everything should be sizzling and fragrant. If you would like to crisp everything up a little more, give the nuts a shake in a dry frying pan/skillet at the end. Remove and cool before eating.</p>
<p><strong>Jerusalem artichokes with garlic and paprika</strong></p>
<p><em>Adapted from Nigel Slater, Real Cooking</em></p>
<p><em>Serves 2</em></p>
<p>500g Jerusalem artichokes (3 or 4 big handfuls)</p>
<p>Butter, about 75g</p>
<p>6-8 cloves of garlic</p>
<p>A couple of bay leaves</p>
<p>1 heaped tsp of paprika</p>
<p>Peel the artichokes and slice them into rounds. Melt the butter in a shallow pan, one which has a lid. Drop the garlic cloves, whole and unpeeled, the bay leaves and the paprika into the butter and whirl it around with a wooden spoon. Add the artichokes and cook over a moderate heat until the chokes and garlic are slightly golden. Take care not to let the butter burn. Pour in a small glug of olive oil if it looks that way. Turn the heat down so the butter is lightly bubbling, cover with a lid and cook for about ten minutes. Shake the pan as they cook. Remove the lid, turn up the heat and continue cooking until the artichokes are tender, golden and crusty. Eat with the smashed open garlic pearls.</p>
<p>*I know you can&#8217;t disembowel cake batter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">You can see more of my images at <a href="http://www.chrisboyd.ca" target="_blank">www.chrisboyd.ca</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It has been a long time since I blogged any of my international work. So this will be a bit of a catch up edition I guess. Some of the shooting I&#8217;ve done this last year has been very different then in previous years. I was also asked to do a lot of interviews, to get stories to go with the photos. I&#8217;d like to share some of them with you as well. This year I had the incredible fortune of working with Tearfund, an international humanitarian organization based out of London England.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">First set I would like to share are some images from some recent trips to the UK, the first was for field work. Collecting samples for my masters, the other was just for travel sake. I extended a photo trip and did some travel in North Ireland and England.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This next set is from my time in Malawi.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">9-I was on site shooting a group of kids and they sang and danced, as we were cluing up I noticed this woman passing by. Duane Codrington managed to get a shot of us. (below)<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1546" alt="Malawi 1" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-1.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">10- This incredibly strong young girl, just 15 years old, was a victim of repeated rape. She was continuously brought out to the fields by a known assailant. She is now a part of a growing support network, shown standing behind her all wearing the &#8220;silent no more&#8221; tee shirt. Silent no more is a campaign to speak out against violence against women.

<p style="text-align:center;">^If you for whatever reason feel compelled to steal any of my images, which I implore you not to do (I will take action take whatever action I can against you), please respect this image in particular and contact me before you duplicate/copy/manipulate or do anything with this image in particular.^</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">11- This young man prepares his food outside his house. It is very unusual to see a man preparing his own food. He is framed here by his cloths on the line. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1548" alt="Malawi 3" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-3.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">12- During a house visit a minister prays for a very ill woman while a volunteer sits with her.

<p style="text-align:center;">13- A young girl sits by her violently ill mother. Her father, who refused to take her and her mother to the hospital when they became ill, stole everything everything from the family leaving not even a bed mat for them to sleep on.

Mama Theresa and her organisation, Somebody Cares, after our house visit returned with some supplies and the funds needed to get Gilbert back in school. The woman in the background is a volunteer with Somebody Cares. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1550" alt="Malawi 5" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-5.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">14- An expectant mother waits at a field clinic for delivery of her second child. Women from surrounding villages go to field hospitals late in their pregnancy so as to not deliver in the bush.  <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1551" alt="Malawi 6" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-6.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">15- A lab worker at a field hospital checks a blood sample for malaria.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1552" alt="A scientist works on malaria tests." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-7.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">^The young women hears good news and wipes away a tear a relief.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prior to travelling to Malawi I was working for a week in Russia. I was shooting for a program for recovering addicts. They have an intense program that begins at a farm where the addicts detox and through counselling attempting to regain control of their lives. After graduating the program their are optional follow up programs. One of which involves a work placement of sorts. One in particular is a plastic recycling plant.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">20- Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant. This man cuts up and sorts medical plastics and rubber for recycling. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1558" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-1.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">21- This vat is used to break down the plastics into small chips which are sold to factories which can use the pellets to make new products.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1559" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-2.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">22- This man, throughout my whole time in Russia, would be very helpful, and cooperative with this project. It was also great that his work station was by a big window and came complete with billowing steam. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1560" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-3.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">23- Vladimir &#8211; After his new home burned down he tried to live with other people but that didn&#8217;t work out and he turned to the streets.. While homeless he struggled with alcohol. He joined the centre September 4 2011.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1561" alt="Russia 4" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-4.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">24-Nastya- She spent 6 years struggling with fast drugs/ heroin/ etc. and had several bad health issues related to that. After completing her own process, she came back as a volunteer to help other. She has been 2 years clean and in good health. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562" alt="Russia 5" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-5.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">25- Each person has assigned jobs at the centre. For some that involves caring for the livestock.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1563" alt="Asbest Russia, Salvation Center" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-6.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">26- The centre has a fully capable lumber mill which they use to process fell trees into lumber for their facilities.<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">27- A female volunteer prepares lunch for the patients and staff.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1565" alt="Asbest Russia, Salvation Center" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-8.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">28- An integral part of the program, and Russian culture as a whole, is the Banya or Sauna. My experience with the Banya, was certainly an interesting one. I should preface the story by saying, I was the only one who spoke English, so an explanation on the process, which would have been very helpful, was not given. You start in a room adjacent to the one shown below. It&#8217;s a small change room, with a kitchen table in the middle. On the table are some bottles of kvass, (a russian drink similar to root beer), tomatoes, lettuce, rolled ham and other finger foods. When I entered the building (the 3rd picture down) there were 6-8 men sitting and eating, and another just joining in. Everyone is of course naked. The few men I came in with disrobe as well exchanging pleasantries. Nothing teaches you to look a man in the eyes like a Russian Banya. After some snacks I go into the room shown below to see the small pool being filled with a hose and buckets of water laid out on the bench with ladles. When I walked into the small sauna (second image) I was assaulted by the heat. I looked at the thermometer that read 80+ degrees Celsius and then started a timer on my watch so I wouldn&#8217;t stay in any more then 5 mins. I would like to add sitting on 80 degree wood&#8230; straight up uncomfortable. After my first 5 mins I step back into the room with the pool and notice the men going up to buckets and ladling the water over their heads to cool off. So I do the same. The first was too hot, then next was a bit cooler and the next a bit cooler still. So, extrapolating, I go to the bucket and pour it over my head. I should add I was getting some odd looks whilst trying the other buckets. This is because each man took a bucket from the pile and some cold water from the tap and then warmed the water with the boiling water in the last bucket until it was a temperature they were comfortable with. Each man had a bucket to himself. I of course didn&#8217;t figure this out until after I poured the bucket of boiling water over my head. After recovering amidst the laughter I returned to the sauna for another 5 min session. Towards the end most of the men returned to the room with the snacks and took some outside where we sat to cool off while getting eaten by flies.<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">I&#8217;m brewing a blog of the effect a camera can have, how it changes things, and I don&#8217;t mean for the better. I&#8217;ve experienced it a lot in the past, people going after their photo without consideration for the effect on local peoples self worth. This can often have an ostracising effect, in particular when experienced repeatedly over a long time. I&#8217;m not sure exactly how I want to approach the issue, but hopefully it won&#8217;t be long before it&#8217;s in print form.</p>

<p><em>This opening story, like the last one I posted, is dangerous but instructive and essential. It is also, I hope, beautiful. Not beautiful in the conventional sense, but beautiful in its discord-leading-to-resolution. Before sharing, I want to explain that I’ve already passed it under the eyes of those implicated, and in their humility and loving-kindness they’re willing to have it shared publicly even if it&#8217;s not too terribly flattering at first. They want it told.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1356.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2419" alt="IMG_1356" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1356.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Two months into our new life in Munich, two months after burying our son in another country, and my parents have not contacted us yet.<br />
No phone calls. No emails. And I’m growing despondent.<br />
But do I call them?<br />
No.<br />
Why not?<br />
Because I’m overwhelmed with sadness, for one thing. I’m saturated with our three children’s sadness, with my husband’s sadness, which sad saturation is compounded, of course, by the demands of an international move managed under extreme physical and psychological impairment, and in the vacuum of no familiar support community, a vacuum that’s gaining suction with every week that passes.<br />
Why else am I not calling? As strange as it seems I am afraid.<br />
I am afraid that family and friends are now done. They’ve moved on to brighter things, lighter things.<br />
And then the trailing question to that thought strangles me: is that what they’re expecting me to do, too? Be <em>done?</em> Am I supposed to “get over it”? Get it behind me? Get to work? Get myself together, get a grip, get on with life, <em>get a life? </em><br />
I’ve never done this before, this incomprehensible and inescapable  pain, so I don&#8217;t know the rules. I do know, however, that I&#8217;m doing really well just <em>getting up. </em><br />
I’m afraid of other things, too. I’m afraid of what might happen as soon as I open my mouth, afraid of the inadequacies of language to transmit what I can barely understand myself, afraid of puncturing the thick and sacred walls I’ve built around this island of grief we’ve been shipwrecked on.<br />
Furthermore, I’m afraid that my call will be misperceived as a prompt for pity.<br />
But here’s the main thing: in spite of all of the above and far deeper than every other fear, I am afraid that if no one talks with me about my son he will begin to slip from my grasp. He will disappear into oblivion. I recoil at a quote I find from Russian author Alexander Pushkin, “Oblivion is the natural lot of anyone not present. It’s horrible, but true.”<br />
<em>So this,</em> fear instructs me, <em>is how I will lose my child a second time. </em><br />
Confused, overwhelmed and afraid, I go even deeper inside. I climb down into a crater I’ve dug with my nails in the middle of my grief island. And I crouch there. I go very, very quiet. And a wee bit crazy. Bereaved parents – even those in the very best of circumstances – often feel crazy. Just ask them. I get a bitter little swig of the crazees.<br />
I crouch. I wait. I watch. I wait. And wait.<br />
I wait more.<br />
&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1337.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2415" alt="IMG_1337" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1337.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Last week of October and a gunmetal gray day presses down on the Isar river outside our apartment window. The leaf-shedding trees I’ve been watching daily, hourly, are emaciated, stripped down to bark nakedness. I am in my robe. It is midafternoon. The phone rings. It is my parents. The call goes something like this:<br />
(They’re both addressing me on speakerphone. Their voices are slightly unnatural, and remind me of pastel taffy. Sugary softness wrapped in wax with tight twists at both ends.)<br />
“Our whole California trip was just wonderful, Melissa. Very enjoyable and relaxing.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“Yes. Mom and I thought the hotels were comfortable, and the weather, well, what did you think, Donna?”<br />
“Very comfortable. Unseasonably warm. . .even balmy. . .”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.<br />
Pause.<br />
“And then there was the hotel swimming pool. Kidney shaped. Too cold, but deep aqua tiles. Pretty to look at.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.”<br />
And so forth.<br />
When we hang up, I drop the phone on the bed. I&#8217;m immobile with exhaustion. I can’t lift my head. From one half-opened eye I see on the bedspread that I’ve left a dark blue tear-print as big as a tile-lined kidney-shaped swimming pool.<br />
Alone in this small, dim bedroom I feel all my cells collapsing and my bones turning to syrup and my torso cramping and my neck muscles tensing. Then I hear an animal in me yowling very quietly through gritted teeth and a clenched jaw.<br />
And I fall majorly apart.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13411.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2418" alt="IMG_1341" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13411.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a><br />
Who knows how long it lasts.<br />
At some point I pull myself together, gather my wits, blow my nose, pray out loud, cry a few words to Parker, and call back my parents. That conversation goes something like this:<br />
(My voice is also slightly unnatural, like I&#8217;m just coming out from under anesthesia.)<br />
“Mom?”<br />
“Oh, it’s you again, honey. Good, good! Did we forget something?”<br />
“I. . .I need. . .” I have been lying on my side, but now I sit up to assume my erect, well-planted persona. This way I can breathe and project better. “I am going to say something now. . .”<br />
“Melissa? Did we do something? You sound. . .Wha – did we say the wrong thing?&#8230; Sweetheart?”<br />
<em>(“David, come back. Hurry. She’s on the phone.”)</em><br />
“Mom?. . .I need. . .what I want is. . .” I close my eyes. “Can we just talk. . .talk about. . . about <em>what matters?</em>”<br />
By now my dad, who’s turned off the speakerphone, has the receiver close to his lips. His voice vibrates in its lowest register. I know this voice: panic-control mode.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1340.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2417" alt="IMG_1340" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1340.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a><br />
“Melissa? Now tell us please, honey. What do you need to talk to us about?”<br />
I try to speak, but it’s too physically demanding to push words ahead of the crying that is surging, it seems, upwards from the floor of my gut, so I make some incomprehensibly muffled sounds. My parents wait patiently on their end of the line as I begin filling up that kidney-shaped pool with the tears of a child.<br />
<em>Infantilized. I’m six years old again, needing my mommy and daddy,</em> I think while I keep fighting for breath between gasps and whimpers, scrambling to find my mind, find myself. How can this be happening? I don&#8217;t know how to control any of this. This forty-something someone, the one who just a short season ago was resourceful and commanding enough to referee several major international moves, plucky and outspoken enough to lecture before hundreds, a turbo-charged<em>joie de vivre</em> Type A type. . .That someone is replaced by a mucus-drooling amoeba, a formless heap of swollen-eyed sweaty-stale bathrobeness that can’t form a single pronounceable shape in her rubber-slobbery mouth.<br />
“Melissa?” My dad’s now whispering.<br />
“Oh, Melissa, dear, what did Dad and I do? Was it the <em>pool</em>, honey? Oh, darling&#8230;” my mother’s voice is cracking. “That’s it, David. I knew it. Oh, I. . .Should we, should we not have said the word <em>pool?</em>. . .David, you see? I just knew we&#8217;d say something wrong–”<br />
“No! NO, Mom.” I drill a fist into the mattress. “No! I. . .I just – I need to talk. . .But. . .I can <em>not</em> talk about just anything. I have to talk about <em>Parker.</em> About him. I need us to talk about <em>Par&#8212;</em>”<br />
The dam ruptures. The floodgates smash. Deluge. Tides of tears. From both sides of the Atlantic.<br />
Remorse.<br />
Apologies.<br />
Love.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1341.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2416" alt="IMG_1341" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1341.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Hurriedly, my parents explain that they’ve intentionally not called for so long to “give us room”. They didn’t want to “open any wounds”, they say. They didn’t want to “remind us of our loss.”<br />
“The longer we didn’t take contact,” my mom’s voice is twisted with pain, “the more awkward we felt about calling.”<br />
“You hadn’t been calling <em>us”</em>, my dad interjects softly, “so we reasoned that you must have been doing well. . . enough.”<br />
Which they knew was probably unlikely, they say, but they had at least hoped. . .And in the worst case scenario if in fact we weren’t doing well we probably wanted to be left alone. “Were we wrong?” my dad asks.<br />
“Besides all of that,&#8221; my mom cuts in, &#8220;we’ve been traveling, you know, and lecturing,” which I know was their way of finding a practical distraction from heavy things. My dad, during those days around the funeral, had been discreetly clenching his chest. I didn&#8217;t know how much of the weight of grief his aging heart could bear. He probably needed reprieve. &#8220;Death, like the sun,&#8221; wrote La Rochefoucauld, &#8220;are not to be looked at steadily.&#8221;<br />
They explain to me how hard it was to decide to finally call, that before they dared pick up the phone, they’d agreed on a game plan. No mention of anything even remotely associated with Parker. And by all means keep the tone upbeat and frothy – light, feathery talk – to divert attention from, you guessed it, the mammoth Isle of Grief I was sitting on, the one as big as the whole Atlantic ocean between us. The one getting bigger by the moment.<br />
I have no words. I wrap a moist, shredding tissue in and around my fingers, which are stone cold.<br />
“Melissa, sweet daughter,&#8221; my mom&#8217;s voice is loosening as if massaged with oil. &#8220;We love you, honey, and we’re so sad about Parker we can hardly. . .” There is silence. I hear the unfamiliar sound of my mom trying to talk through tears.<br />
“What your mother’s trying to say,&#8221; my dad adds, &#8220;is that we can hardly breathe.”<br />
Now it is the far more unfamiliar sound of my dad struggling through tears.<br />
“We are <em>sorry,</em> darling.” Mom has the voice of a young girl.<br />
“And,” Dad clears his throat, “we’re deeply, deeply sad. Mournful. You know,” he speaks so softly that if I close my eyes, I could swear he and my mom are sitting on the edge my bed, “this is all so new to us. We don’t know how to do this well. But let’s change this, can we? Can we change this and stay in this horrible thing together? Please?”<br />

<p>Every blessed day from that moment on and for months on end, at three a.m. Mountain Standard Time, my mom, unable to sleep for her own suffocating sorrow at losing her beloved oldest grandchild, called Munich.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13061.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2422" alt="IMG_1306" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13061.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>The newly bereaved are incapable of thinking of anything else but their loss and their past. Buttoning a collar, folding gym socks, stapling homework, putting a key in the ignition, sitting and staring and feeling their own heart beat–all of it is downright freighted, barnacled, throbbing with loss. If we as co-mourners think it is our job to fill our interactions with our grieving friends with empty chatter in order to not “remind” the bereaved of their loss, or if we feel things will be better if we never say a word, we are mistaken. If we think it&#8217;s better we all pretend nothing happened, and that we as friends are safer staying far away, we are also terribly mistaken.</p>
<p>Being thus mistaken, we might find ourselves returning to our broken friends much (too much) later saying the following. (I will protect the identity of the speakers, but know that these are not fiction. They are quotes with good people&#8217;s faces behind them):</p>
<p><em>“I couldn’t speak to you. Your story kind of intimidated me.”<br />
“I just didn’t know what to say, so I said nothing. I am so sorry.”<br />
“I was afraid I’d say something that would hurt you more.”<br />
“I didn’t want to get you worked up about the past.”<br />
“I figured you wanted space.”<br />
“I’ve never known loss, so I don’t know how to do this.”<br />
“I didn’t want to impose myself.”<br />
“Your pain frightened me. You looked too sad to approach”<br />
“I felt totally helpless. I kept trying to find something original to say. But I guess I never found that thing.”<br />
“You were so sad for so long, and I was worried. I thought the gospel was supposed to fix these things.”<br />
“We didn’t know how to help you find closure.”<br />
“I’ve been an awful friend. Honestly, I’ve been so distracted with other things in my life.”<br />
“We thought we’d wait a few weeks until you looked like you were over the worst part, until you were healed. Then it seems the weeks passed so quickly and, well. . .”<br />
“I know it’s been a few months since I last checked in. Can you catch me up?”<br />
“A parent’s worst nightmare. I hope you’ll forgive me, but I just didn’t dare get close to it, to you.”<br />
</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1291.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2412" alt="IMG_1291" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1291.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>The newly bereaved can become despondent and/or angry and/or resentful if we as co-mourners choose to avoid them. If fear, discomfort , self-absorption or self-consciousness drive us to silence or to a literal detour away from them (and down another aisle in the grocery store, for instance), the bereaved will probably interpret this as a tacit disregard of their loss. We needn’t ambush them with attention or crush them with affection. But if we disassociate ourselves from them while we wait at a distance for them to “get over it” , we not only lose the great blessing – for them <em>and</em> for us – to help them in their greatest hour of need which will offer us a chance for great spiritual bonding with them <em>and</em> with heaven, but we risk disappearing from that relationship definitively. The process of mourning is by nature constant, constantly changing and communal; it is not something distanced friends can later “catch up” on.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1261.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2409" alt="IMG_1261" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1261.jpg?w=363&#038;h=545" width="363" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>So we have a challenging dynamic here. We grief-stricken have to ask ourselves: is this harmful conspiracy of silence partially our own fault? I have a hard time admitting it myself, but I’ve concluded that yes, it’s partially been my fault. This conspiracy of silence was partially my fault because, as is typical and understandable of those battling with the huge physiological and psychological demands of acute grief, I simply did not have it in me to coach others on how to reach me.</p>
<p>And, as the story of the phone call illustrates, the very idea of coaching others – even the most intimate and lifelong confidantes – on how to grieve with me was loaded with traps and cul de sacs and second-guesses and frustration.<br />
I have reason to believe that in this respect, my story is not at all unique.<br />
From all that I have gathered in five years of studying this, most bereaved generally don’t want to force on anyone a conversation about their deceased loved one <em>although a continued conversation is exactly what they want and need. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1283.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2411" alt="IMG_1283" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1283.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Why are we bereaved so tentative, then, about initiating such conversations? There are as many reasons as there are grievers. But here are just a few possibilities. What if people stare back dully (as some will), or look at their watches (as some will), or grow jittery and awkward, stuttering with no response except maybe, “So. . . is it therapeutic for you to talk about your [son, sister, wife, father] like this?” (as some will.)<br />
What if they quickly change the subject?<br />
As many (most) undoubtedly will.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_12951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2413" alt="IMG_1295" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_12951.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Challenging dynamics, indeed.<br />
And <em>of course </em>they are challenging. They are challenging because there is little in life that is as intimate as the loss of it, little that is as delicate and multidimensional as the living&#8217;s personal response to it. And someone else&#8217;s loss puts my own mortality in boldface. And certain cultures are squeamish about touching on painful and unphotogenic issues. And, and, and. But all these And&#8217;s don&#8217;t absolve us from the charge to counter the old modes of response with something that is authentic and broken in ourselves. Because true religion (what happens between us human beings <em>in extremis</em>) is supposed to be challenging. How else are we to be brought to Christ but through challenging dynamics? Challenging relationships?</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1248.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2407" alt="IMG_1248" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1248.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>What will happen to us when we find ourselves not in a supporting role in a drama of <em>in extremis</em>, but when we are the lead figure? When the tragic loss is our own, not our neighbor&#8217;s? And then our parents don’t call and we feel the first heart-hardenings of despondency. And then church members appear incapable of engaging in our life so colored with mourning, and we feel the slightest simmer of resentment. When a sibling here or a sister-friend there disappears, it seems, from off the face of the earth, and we smell a small saucepan of outrage boiling on our frontal lobe.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1237.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2404" alt="IMG_1237" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1237.jpg?w=363&#038;h=545" width="363" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>When our heart begins feeling a bit dried out, then brittle, then crusty from anger, curling up around the edges under a low grade fuming, toasting under the grill of judgment, blistering beneath the scorch of our own expectations?</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>We might call to mind Job, who lost livelihood and life, family and friends, all his possible supporting actors: “He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintances are verily estranged from me./ My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.” (Job 20:13,14)</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1266.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2410" alt="IMG_1266" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1266.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>And in the final chapter of his book, this man who has literally nothing left to lose, offers up a precious intangible. He offers forgiveness.</p>
<p>Upon seeing God clearly for the first time, (“I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; <em>but now my eye seeth thee</em>”), Job feels compelled to repent “in dust and ashes.” When he does, God announces that Job will be acceptable when Job “prays for his friends.”</p>
<p>Job&#8217;s trial is not complete, his refinement not perfected until he forgives and prays for and on behalf of those who have added to his misery.</p>
<p>He has seen God. Now he is being asked to <em>be as God</em>. Stripped of all former glory, ground into the dust, mocked, misjudged, condemned, abandoned.</p>
<p>And still worthy to become the High Priest <em>only on condition of mercy and forgiveness</em>:</p>
<p>“And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends.”</p>
<p>What might that prayer have been, the one Job spoke on behalf of his friends? I suspect it would have prefigured another prayer uttered by the only true and great High Priest:</p>
<p>“Father, forgive us all for we know not what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1231.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2359" alt="IMG_1231" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1231.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>If you and I want to be free of the bitterness that estranges us from others and eats away at our own struggle to find joy again, we are going to have to forgive and pray for the friends who have let us down. They might not deserve it. In fact, they probably don’t. But then, we don’t forgive people because they deserve it; we forgive them because we’ve been forgiven so much by God and because we want to keep in close relationship with God.<br />
–Nancy Guthrie, <em>Holding on to Hope</em>, 68</p>
<p>Some say nothing because they find the topic too painful for themselves. They fear they will break down. So they put on a brave face and lid their feelings—never reflecting, I suppose, that this adds new pain to the sorrow of their suffering friends. Your tears are salve on our wound, your silence is salt.<br />
—N. Wolterstorff, <em>Lament for a Son</em>, 35</p>
<p>There’s only one thing worse than speaking ill of the dead—and that is not speaking of the dead at all.<br />
—Anonymus</p>
<p>It seems impossible to me to understand the cruelty of friends and family who desert parents at such a time. But in my research I found countless couples who had horror stories to relate, such as a brother, once close, who stopped calling his sister shortly after her child died, or friends who were never heard from again after the funeral.<br />
–H. Schiff, <em>The Bereaved Parent</em>, 102</p>
<p>Good friends are like angels. Our friends brought us God’s presence and love. They did not solve our problems, as if grief were a problem to be solved. They did not dispense pious phrases. Our closest friends allowed us to be in as much pain as we were in and did not trivialize it by trying to move us beyond it. The angel in the garden did not say to Jesus, ”There, there.” In fact, we no not know what the angel said, or if the angel said anything at all. We are quite comfortable with not having anything to say.<br />
–G. Floyd, <em>My Grief Unveiled</em></p>
<p>Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair.<br />
–Thomas Merton</p>
