<p>This post is long overdue.</p>
<p>Things have been pretty rough at work lately, so I haven&#8217;t had much time to update. After staring at a computer screen for 10+ hours a day, it&#8217;s the absolute LAST thing I feel like doing when I get home. But it&#8217;s all good. Deadlines were met, tears were shed, (LITERALLY) and all is well in the world once again. I have to keep reminding myself that in spite of it all, I&#8217;m still among the lucky ones. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Macchu Picchu was hands down one of the most awe-inspiring places I&#8217;ve ever traveled to IN. MY. LIFE. Before this trip, I thought I knew what it would be like. Once I arrived, it still managed to be 100 times more amazing than what my imagination created. It&#8217;s hard to believe that human hands could build something like this&#8230; not to mention before the age of modern technology. We could have easily spent days exploring the ruins, but it was just not possible with our travel schedule. This post is for people who are like us, and only have one day to see as much as they can.</p>
<p>Step 1: Successfully navigate your way to Aguas Calientes. Stay there for at least one night.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5030/5810112353_41accb26dd_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Me on the Vistadome" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5030/5810112353_41accb26dd_z.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/5810663326_a84159281f_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Me on the Vistadome" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/5810663326_a84159281f_z.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>From Cusco, we took the Vistadome train to Aguas Calientes, and the Backpacker Train when we returned a couple of days later. (<a title="Peru Rail" href="https://www.perurail.com/en/">https://www.perurail.com/en/</a>). I highly recommend the Vistadome. It&#8217;s comfortable, spacious, and they serve you a small meal. Also, cafe con leche was free on this train which was a double bonus for me. The Backpacker was not bad either, but they don&#8217;t serve you food. Or coffee. Or tea. If you want a full day at the ruins, it&#8217;s probably not possible unless you stay in Aguas Calientes the night before.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/5810303679_59aa4f91b9_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Girl Selling Lillies" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/5810303679_59aa4f91b9_z.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="201" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2577/5814268960_90b341f9f8_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Girl Selling Lillies" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2577/5814268960_90b341f9f8_z.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>There were some children selling flowers by the side of the tracks. This girl&#8217;s facial expressions made it heartbreaking to watch&#8230;</p>
<p>Step 2: Wake up EARLY the next day, and get on the bus to Macchu Picchu ASAP.</p>
<p>Decide on a reasonable time to wake up in order to function for a strenuous day of hiking. Now, set your alarm for 3:30 AM instead! Sleep is for slackers. Your hotel will probably offer breakfast before you head to the ruins, and I recommend you take advantage. I didn&#8217;t, and I completely regretted it later when I was STARVING during the hike to Huayna Picchu. If you can&#8217;t handle scrambled eggs at 4am I don&#8217;t blame you, but at least carbo-load on bread for the energy.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you&#8217;re down at the bus stop no later than 4:30am. We made it there closer to 5, and there was already a long line of people waiting. We got extremely lucky because one of the buses needed to fill two seats and everyone around us was in a group, so they let us on. The drive up the road to Macchu Picchu took about 30 minutes, and once we arrived there was a loooooooooong line outside the entrance gates. Once you get in, you have to climb up this huge hill and it&#8217;s pretty exhausting but totally rewarding once you see this:</p>

<p>During our first couple of hours at the ruins the fog was still lingering over everything. It felt like we were on another planet or something! It was really quiet and this was a great time to get pictures before the rest of the tourists arrived.</p>
<p>Step 3: Ditch the tour group and get your butt to Huayna Picchu.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re standing in line waiting to get inside the gates, there will be a few people walking around stamping entrance tickets. These stamps are for anyone wanting to take the hike up to the Huayna Picchu. They only allow a limited number of people per day to take the hike, so make sure you get a stamp! This is another reason why you want to get there as early as possible. Once they stamp a certain number of tickets, they stop and you&#8217;re out of luck.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/5834785630_23faabbf23_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Map to Huayna Picchu" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/5834785630_23faabbf23_z.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>Make no mistake, the climb to Huayna Picchu is pretty tough. If I was to do this trip all over again, I would prepare at least a month ahead of time and hit the stair climber HARD at the gym! The climb is &#8220;supposed&#8221; to take 1-2 hours, but if you&#8217;re totally out of shape I think it would take closer to 2.5 hours. I consider myself to be in &#8220;moderately good shape&#8221; and it took me about an hour and a half to get up there. I&#8217;ll be honest though, there were times when I was weighing the options of continuing vs. turning around and going back down the mountain.</p>
<p>Ilias and I made arrangements to join a tour, but we ditched it last-minute to take this hike. Initially, we were under the impression that as long as we have a stamp, we can go up whenever we felt like it. Not the case. At the base of the mountain, there is a &#8220;check-in&#8221; station, and they only allow two groups of 200(ish?) people to take the climb per day. When you get your stamp, it&#8217;s either for the 7am departure time or a later time (Noon? I think?). Ditch your tour group and take the earlier time! It&#8217;s much easier to climb when the sun is not completely out, and the harsh sunlight isn&#8217;t beating down on your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Climb" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/5834823320_f5824d96ac_b.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="691" /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3630/5834271507_541a34c9bd_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="The Climb" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3630/5834271507_541a34c9bd_b.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="691" /></a></p>
<p>My travel guides mentioned there was a portion of the hike that involved climbing a steep rock slab with nothing but a rope and a ladder. I remember reading that and thinking, &#8220;There is no way in Hell I am climbing a steep rock WITH. A. ROPE.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t snap a picture, but it wasn&#8217;t as death-defying as I imagined. (Unless there is some OTHER rope and ladder that I wasn&#8217;t aware of!) From what I remember it was quick and painless. So if anyone out there was thinking about skipping Huayna Picchu because of the infamous &#8220;rope and ladder&#8221;, I&#8217;m telling you right now that it&#8217;s not that big a deal. If it was, I would have a long-winded story about it, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>So once you arrive at Huayna Picchu, you are rewarded with a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the ruins below:</p>
<p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5834417645_659db6e998_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="View from Huayna Picchu" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5834417645_659db6e998_b.jpg" alt="" width="935" height="624" /></a></p>
<p>The zig zag road on the left is what the buses use to get from Aguas Calientes to Macchu Picchu.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5197/5834995550_03fccfd63f_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Tired Me" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5197/5834995550_03fccfd63f_z.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/5834432505_67b85bf64c_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Us" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/5834432505_67b85bf64c_z.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3477/5834453659_ee418cdf51_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Huayna Picchu" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3477/5834453659_ee418cdf51_b.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="691" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3428/5835006208_4799e6e2ac_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Macchu Picchu Below" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3428/5835006208_4799e6e2ac_b.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="691" /></a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the scariest part of this whole ordeal is COMING DOWN from the mountain. I feel like when you&#8217;re climbing UP you don&#8217;t really realize how steep things are getting. It&#8217;s only when you&#8217;re coming down that you realize how crazy that whole situation is. There was one point when I was basically on my back crab walking down the steps. This part trumped the scariness of the &#8220;rope and ladder&#8221; by a mile. But don&#8217;t let that discourage you&#8230;. it was still totally worth it! Just be careful, I guess.</p>
<p>Step 4: Get some lunch, explore the rest of Macchu Picchu</p>
<p>By the time you get back down from Huayna Picchu, it will probably be around noon. At this point, I&#8217;d say your day is half over. We decided to get food at the little food court near the entrance because we were told that outside food and drinks were not allowed inside the ruins. I know that&#8217;s what &#8220;they tell you&#8221; but I saw tons and tons of people eating during the hike to Huayna Picchu. I&#8217;m not TOTALLY advocating sneaking food in, but it seems like you can definitely get away with it. I think it goes without saying that if you choose to go this route, hold on to your garbage! How horrible would it be to see litter all over this amazing place?! I was pretty upset that we paid something like 15 USD for a burger and drink&#8230; knowing what I know now, I would probably try to sneak food in next time around. I think the hiking would have gone a lot smoother if I had a stash of cookies in my bag.</p>
<p>So after you have your lunch, you can spend the next 3-4 hours (OR MORE!) wandering the ruins. If there was any fog from the morning, chances are it&#8217;s cleared up by now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, the East coast is going to get hit by a hurricane this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weather.com/maps/news/atlstorm9/projectedpath_large.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1790" title="irene1" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irene1.jpg?w=510&#038;h=344" alt="" width="510" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>Totally awesome since this weekend was going to be my bridal shower.  I guess Irene wanted to crash the party but now it&#8217;ll probably be canceled (my mom and I wanted to wait until today so we could get a better grasp on the storm) so I&#8217;m sort of disappointed about not getting to see all my friends and family.  Thankfully, it was just going to be at my parents&#8217; house so we don&#8217;t have to deal with any cancellations.</p>
<p>Joe and I will still be at their house over the weekend, regardless of the party&#8217;s status.  Thankfully, my parents live in New Jersey so they won&#8217;t get hit as badly as we will.  Our apartment is in an Evacuation A zone, or as I like to call it &#8211; &#8220;get out of your house A.S.A.P.&#8221; zone.</p>
<p>It would&#8217;ve been nice if we still lived at our old apartment since we were on the 6th floor (no worries about flooding) but this also would&#8217;ve been the weekend we needed to move out.  I guess we&#8217;re lucky in some sense.</p>
<p>Last night, we finished our invitations and they are ready to go.  I debated putting them in the mail this morning so they would arrive at everyone&#8217;s homes on Monday, but God forbid there&#8217;s flooding &#8211; they could get lost or ruined.  What if they do get delivered but the house has already been evacuated?  They&#8217;d probably get ruined in the mailbox.  I&#8217;m not going to risk these invitations to the weather.  I just won&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s better for them to be sent out on Monday.  A day or so won&#8217;t make a difference.  Everyone already knows when it is (thanks to our <a title="Save the Date" href="http://popcornonthestove.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/save-the-date/" target="_blank">save the dates</a>) so it&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of them finished:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1795" title="invitedone" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/invitedone.jpg?w=510&#038;h=382" alt="" width="510" height="382" /></p>
<p>The stamps we used aren&#8217;t exactly <a title="A Calculated Postage Post" href="http://popcornonthestove.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/a-calculated-postage-post/" target="_blank">the stamps we picked out</a>.  The $0.75 stamps were nowhere to be found (and trust me, I called every post office in my area and on Staten Island and no one had them!  The nerve.  Joe and I spoke on the phone and there were a few options we could&#8217;ve done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use 4 $0.44 stamps (totaling $1.76)</li>
<li>Use 2 $0.84 stamps and a $0.03 stamp (totaling $1.71)</li>
<li>Use a $0.98 and $0.80 stamps (totaling $1.78)</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really want to load up our envelopes with stamps.  It&#8217;s sort of annoying.  Spending a bit extra worked out fine.  I bought 65 of the $0.98 and $0.80 stamps so it was $115.70 &#8211; and it turns out we still have stamps left over!  We can still invite 6 more people (although I don&#8217;t think we will).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.usps.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1798" title="stamps4" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stamps41.jpg?w=510&#038;h=169" alt="" width="510" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>Call me crazy &#8211; but I actually like the $0.80 stamp more than the $0.75 stamp.</p>
<p>Today, I will be working on prepping our apartment.  Since Joe&#8217;s sister and her husband live upstairs, we can probably drop a few things off that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to protect otherwise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1791" title="irene2" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irene2.jpg?w=510&#038;h=680" alt="" width="510" height="680" /></p>
<p>My first task is trying to remove everything from the floor.  I&#8217;ve been stashing so many things on the top shelf in our closets.  They&#8217;re not really organized but that&#8217;s not important.  As long as nothing is left on the floor, we&#8217;re good.  We&#8217;re going to take everything out of the bottom cabinets and stash them all elsewhere.    All of the rugs will be rolled up and placed on top of something else.  It&#8217;s just smart.  In case there is flooding, it&#8217;s better to just put everything up higher.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1792" title="irene3" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irene3.jpg?w=510&#038;h=382" alt="" width="510" height="382" /></p>
<p>Which explains why table now looks like this.  I&#8217;m actually going to pull the table into the kitchen area (so it&#8217;s not next to that window in case it breaks).  The task is literally to clear everything out.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1793" title="irene4" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irene4.jpg?w=510&#038;h=680" alt="" width="510" height="680" /></p>
<p>And, we&#8217;re removing all of our AC units.  We have only ever used the one in the bedroom so it&#8217;s not a major thing but it&#8217;s one less thing in the window.  Strong winds could blow them into the house and then we would have a huge window opening for all the rain to fill up.  Not ideal.</p>
<p>Oh, and we&#8217;re also going to unplug everything from the walls (including surge protectors) so there&#8217;s no water damage to our electrical stuff.  That&#8217;ll happen right before we leave.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1794" title="irene5" src="http://popcornonthestove.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irene5.jpg?w=510&#038;h=680" alt="" width="510" height="680" /></p>
<p>Joe also made an emergency kit.  There&#8217;s a lot of beans, tomato sauce, trail mix, granola bar type things, cookies, and chips.  He also bought 2 24-pack cases of water.  The food he stored in his closet while the water is in the kitchen.</p>
<p>He also turned out refrigerator to it&#8217;s coldest setting.  This way, if we do lose power, it&#8217;s that much cooler to help protect the food.  Last night and tonight, Joe and I worked on cleaning out the freezer.  A lot of my microwave meals are expensive since they&#8217;re vegan.  Rather than risk them to possibly losing power, I&#8217;ve been working on cleaning out the freezer.  No eating food from the pantry &#8211; just the refrigerator.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m more nervous about flooding.  My parents&#8217; basement has flooded on multiple occasions.  It&#8217;s the reasons we&#8217;ve replaced the furniture down there and why there&#8217;s no longer carpet or rugs.  Instead, the flooring consists of tile and faux wood.</p>
<p>When we go to their house, we&#8217;ll be taking <a title="Birthday Weekend" href="http://popcornonthestove.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/birthday-weekend/" target="_blank">our computer</a> (we just bought it so that would be silly to leave it here.  We&#8217;ll also have a bag with clothes (since we&#8217;ll probably be there all weekend), the wedding invitations and other misc wedding things I&#8217;ve been DIY-ing, food that we can use in case we lose power (basically, things that don&#8217;t need to be refrigerated), and bonus stuff like candles, flashlights and batteries.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t forget our fireproof box.  Yes, Joe and I have one and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s dumb to write about it on the internet, but it&#8217;s something everyone should have if they don&#8217;t already have a fireproof safe.  It holds our important documents like birth certificates and passports.  If something happens to our place, who knows when we could get back and to be honest &#8211; getting copies of these documents are a nightmare.  Better to play it safe.  I highly recommend everyone getting one.</p>
<p>Are any of you on Irene&#8217;s path?  Have you made any evacuation plans or done anything to get ready for the storm?  Are you contemplating moving further inland like we are?  Did Irene ruin any of your plans, too?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum is in McMinnville, about an hour south of Portland. It started out as modest at best, just a few vintage airplanes in a hangar, until it got a hold of Howard Hughes&#8217; H-4 Hercules flying boat, better known as the Spruce Goose. The Wald Disney Co. originally had wanted to build an attraction around the world&#8217;s largest flying boat, but thought better of it. The Evergreen folks happily took it off Disney&#8217;s hands and built their own museum around it. I have to say, the museum&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s not <em>Smithsonian</em> good, by any measure. None of the individual vehicles is necessarily historic. Most of the spacecraft are replicas. Still, Evergreen has assembled a hell of a collection of important aircraft, all of which are authentic. The museum is worth the trip. </p>
<p>That said, I didn&#8217;t go to McMinnville to see the museum. On Saturday, Christopher, Deidre, and I had an hour or so to kill before we attended our friends&#8217; 50 wedding anniversary party at a nearby winery. When I suggested that we hit the museum, Deidre at first agreed—then almost literally jumped out of the car in downtown McMinnville the minute she saw the first antique store. I guess the idea of listening to me go on and on about planes didn&#8217;t turn her on.</p>
<p>Her loss. Off we went. Again, our time was limited, so my impromptu visit turned into a 45 minute sprint with the iPhone, with Christopher gamely walking behind me going, &#8220;Yeah, Dad, you&#8217;re right, that is a cool plane.&#8221; Poor kid.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I saw:</p>
<p><a href="http://cpbsketchbook.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2173.jpg"><img src="http://cpbsketchbook.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2173.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="" title="IMG_2173" width="1024" height="764" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3400" /></a></p>
<p>This is a B-17 bomber. They were made by the thousands, which is fortunate because B-17&#8242;s got shot down by the hundreds while they did the dirty work of pounding the crap out of Nazi Germany. I had an opportunity to crawl around in one in Roseburg twenty years ago and couldn&#8217;t get out of it fast enough. I don&#8217;t understand how its crews were able to do their job. The interior was cramped and open to the elements. At 25,000 feet, the inside temperature was way, way below zero. Not a fun place to work when you&#8217;re fighting for your life. Another reminder that the war was won by men a thousand times tougher than me.<br />

<p>The Spruce Goose herself, with some random jet engines in the foreground. It is impossible to convey how huge this plane is. It was built to transport seven hundred soldiers and their to Europe for the war, or a Sherman tank. But Howard Hughes was such a perfectionist the plane wasn&#8217;t ready until two years after the war was over. It flew once and never again.<br />

<p>The SR-71 Blackbird, to me the most impressive item in the collection. (Why&#8217;s the photo blurry? That&#8217;s because the Blackbird is so fast <em>standing still.</em> Yeah.) The SR-71 flew at three times the speed of sound at an altitude of 80,000. That&#8217;s the edge of space at a half mile per second, which is a good speed when you&#8217;re flying over the Soviet Union taking pictures. I&#8217;ll let the good people at Wikipedia take it from here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the course of its service life, no SR-71 was shot down, despite more than 4,000 attempts to do so. It flew too fast and too high for surface-to-air missile systems to track and shoot down, and was much faster than the Soviet Union&#8217;s fastest aircraft of the time, the MiG-25, which had a top speed of Mach 3.2 at high altitude, however the engines would burn up at that speed. All the SR-71 pilot had to do was to accelerate.</p></blockquote>

<p>The museum has a number of Soviet fighters, as well. I like the way the Russians put their jets together. This thing just looks <em>mean</em>.<br />

<p>Replica of a two-man Gemini capsule. Even people who are vaguely aware of the space program&#8217;s history don&#8217;t know much about Gemini, which was a bridge between the first Mercury flights and the Apollo moon landings. I&#8217;d have been first in line to orbit the earth or fly to the moon (and would have been promptly rejected), but I think I&#8217;d pass on a Gemini flight. Two weeks stuck in capsule with another dude, no elbow room, and a plastic bag for a toilet? No thanks.</p>
<p>A personal Gemini note: Before Deidre and I were dating, one of her jobs at work was to bring the kids at school to my afternoon astronomy class. Usually, she&#8217;d stay for one of my boring lectures about the space program. A month or so after she started working, she came to a party at my apartment and brought me a bottle of craft beer. On the label was a Gemini capsule like the one in the picture. </p>
<p>We call these types of women &#8220;keepers.&#8221;<br />

<p>A Nazi V-2 rocket. Thank God those clowns didn&#8217;t get The Bomb.<br />

<p>&#8230; and then we won the war, after which many of the clowns in question became American citizens, started working for the good guys, and weren&#8217;t clowns anymore. Thanks for the moon landings, Werner Von Braun! </p>
<p>This a Lunar Module replica. Any time I see one, I&#8217;m amazed at how large it is. My boys&#8217; astronomy class is building a 1/72nd scale model, complete with gold(ish) foil around the legs. They&#8217;re doing a good job.<br />

<p>This photo is for comedian and moon-hoaxer Joe Rogan. Hey, Joe: We went to the moon. Deal with it. On top of that, we not only went to the moon, we went six times. And for the last three, we took a freaking <em>car.</em> Stick to smoking pot and cage fighting, and leave American history to the grownups.<br />

<p>Christopher next to a mockup of a Martian rover. We have two on Mars right now, and one of them still works, years after it was supposed to break down. We seem to be taking a pause on the whole &#8220;manned spaceflight thing,&#8221; which is a drag. Hope the robots continue do a good job while we figure out what we&#8217;re doing and get our act together.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well that was some excitement for the week. I&#8217;m talking about that little earthquake the entire east coast felt yesterday! It was fascinating to see the power of social media as my <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Steph321delish" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Twitter</span></a> feed was overloaded with messages about the tremors.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/earthquaketweets2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3355" title="earthquaketweets2" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/earthquaketweets2.jpg?w=510&#038;h=634" alt="" width="510" height="634" /></a></p>
<p>Yea, it was a bit crazy because earthquakes are something that the east coast so RARELY experiences. Thankfully, there wasn&#8217;t too much damage in my area! I hope you are all ok!</p>
<p>***<em>And now back to your regularly scheduled blog post.</em> ***</p>
<p>Since starting 321delish, Chloe and I have had a number of people tell us that they really want to get into triathlons. This is no surprise, with the ever-increasing popularity of the sport. <a title="Usat" href="http://www.usatriathlon.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">USA Triathlon</span></a> reports that participation in triathlon is at its all-time high. In 2010, an estimated 2.3 million individuals completed a triathlon, according to a report from the <a title="Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association" href="http://www.sgma.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">S</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">porting Goods Manufacturers Association</span></a>. This is a 55% increase in one year! 55%!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_1360.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3363" title="Transition" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_1360.jpg?w=510&#038;h=382" alt="" width="510" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the people we talk to are runners, some are cyclists, some are swimmers, and some are just normal, active people. Many of them say, &#8220;So I can (<span style="color:#339966;">fill in activity here</span>), and I want to get into tris. What do I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m not an expert at this, here are a few tips for people who are interested in getting into the sport.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Sign up for a race</strong></p>
<p>I say this as the first thing to do, because it gives you something to work towards. Putting a date on the calendar is that first kick to get you started, because you know that you need to be as ready as you can by that date.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/actriathlonregistration1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3359" title="ACTriathlonRegistration" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/actriathlonregistration1.jpg?w=510&#038;h=68" alt="" width="510" height="68" /></a><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/actriathlonregistration.jpg"><br />

<p>I would recommend signing up for a sprint triathlon as your first race, but you know your body and how hard you can/want to push it. Need some help finding a race? Check out <a title="Running/Triathlon Race Finder" href="http://321delish.com/2011/08/05/runningtriathlon-race-finder-guide/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Chloe&#8217;s post on race-finding tools</span></a>.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the number of races? Consider the following when picking your first race:</p>
<p>a) <em>Cost</em>-Triathlons are EXPENSIVE! I would suggest looking for local, small races. You won&#8217;t hurt your wallet too much and the smaller races aren&#8217;t as intimidating.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/slimmy-wallet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3364" title="slimmy-wallet" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/slimmy-wallet.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>b) <em>Location</em>- Where will you race? How long will it take to get there (and how much will it cost to get you and your bike there?) Will you need lodging? Again, I&#8217;m a fan of local races, or races in locations where I have a free place to crash. Yay races in <a title="Jersey Shore: By the Numbers" href="http://321delish.com/2011/08/16/jersey-shore-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">South Jersey</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_0295.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3214" title="IMG_0295" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_0295.jpg?w=510&#038;h=380" alt="" width="510" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>Or, if you&#8217;re up for it, make it a vacation that kicks off with a tri, and ends with you relaxing on the beach somewhere. <a title="Lauren's Tri Blog" href="http://www.laurenstriblog.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Lauren</span>&#8216;<span style="color:#0000ff;">s</span></a> doing Ironman Cozumel&#8230;I&#8217;d go to Cozumel but without the Ironman part;-)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mexico_cozumel_beach.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3360" title="mexico_cozumel_beach" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mexico_cozumel_beach.jpg?w=510&#038;h=286" alt="" width="510" height="286" /></a><a title="http://www.globeimages.net/data/media/212/mexico_cozumel_beach.jpg" href="http://www.globeimages.net/data/media/212/mexico_cozumel_beach.jpg" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>c) <em>Course</em>- If you aren&#8217;t a strong swimmer, consider doing a tri with a pool swim, instead of an open water swim for your first tri. If you excel at riding hills, find a race with a hilly course.</p>
<p>d) <em>Date/Time of year</em>-There is no one-size fits all time frame for how long it takes to train for a tri. It really depends on where you&#8217;re starting from athletically, and what distance your race will be. Then, you can backwards plan your training. Be aware that triathlons require a decent chunk of time to train, so plan around your life accordingly <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Also, think about when in the season you want to race- do you want a race in the spring, and train over the winter? Or do you want a late summer/fall race, and do the bulk of your training in the summer?</p>
<p>Whatever race you choose, just get one on the calendar. When you receive the &#8220;Thank you for registering&#8221; email, that&#8217;s when it becomes real.</p>
<p><strong>2) If you&#8217;re already working out regularly-keep doing it! If you&#8217;re not, get started!</strong></p>
<p>I personally <a title="Got Training Plans?" href="http://321delish.com/2011/02/17/got-training-plans/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">don&#8217;t follow a training plan,</span></a> but I did for my first tri, so I have a sense of how much running, biking and swimming I should be doing when I have a race coming up. I did my first tri with <a title="Team in Training" href="http://www.teamintraining.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Team In Training</span></a>, which provided me with coaching, a training plan, and of course training buddies! I highly recommend joining some kind of swimming, biking, running, or tri team if you thrive on training with others. Or, use the power of social media to find #triathletes in your area. They are great motivators.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/tidbits1-e1311857147118.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3007" title="tidbits" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/tidbits1-e1311857147118.jpg?w=510&#038;h=272" alt="" width="510" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>And margarita drinking buddies:</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/redgroup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3016" title="redgroup" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/redgroup.jpg?w=510&#038;h=382" alt="" width="510" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to go solo, do a little research and find a training plan. Here are some sites where you can download one:</p>
<p><a title="Beginner Triathlete" href="http://beginnertriathlete.com" target="_blank">Beginner Triathlete</a><br />
<a title="Active.com" href="http://www.active.com/triathlon/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Active.com</span></a><br />
<a title="Tri Newbies" href="http://www.trinewbies.com/tno_trainingprograms.asp" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Tri Newbies</span></a></p>
<p><strong>3) Make sure you have the basic gear</strong></p>
<p>You DON&#8217;T need to go out and spend a ridiculous amount of money on the lightest bike out there or the latest wetsuit design. All that stuff is expensive, and not necessary for beginners. Heck, its not even necessary for dedicated age-groupers. Just get the basics, and if you really get into triathlons (or win the lottery), you can get some of the fancy schmancy stuff that the pros use.</p>
<p><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/trek99leopard.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3365" title="Trek9.9Leopard" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/trek99leopard.png?w=510&#038;h=369" alt="" width="510" height="369" /></a></p>
<p>For me, here are the bare necessities:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Swim</em></span>:</p>
<p>Swim suit (train in this, but I don&#8217;t recommend it for your race)<br />
Cap (they usually provide you with one at the race site, but you&#8217;ll need one to train in if you&#8217;ve got long hair)<br />
Goggles<br />
Wet suit (Only if you plan on racing in cold water)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Bike</em></span>:</p>
<p>Bicycle<br />
Helmet<br />
Bike shorts (Again, for training, not for the race)</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Run</span>:</em></p>
<p>Running sneakers<br />
Workout clothes</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Triathlon Specific gear</em></span>:</p>
<p>I recommend getting tri shorts and a tri top. Not necessary for your first race, but you&#8217;ll be WAY more comfortable and have faster transitions than if you race in your swim suit and shorts!</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> <strong>Go have fun</strong>!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s your first race! Grab some <del>friends</del> early risers to come cheer you on. Enjoy participating in a competition with others who have dedicated just as many hours as you have. Feel that sense of accomplishment for doing something challenging, and persevere to the end! It will feel amazing to cross that finish line!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2571ea_1318.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3366" title="IMG_2571EA_1318" src="http://321delish.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2571ea_1318.jpg?w=357&#038;h=536" alt="" width="357" height="536" /></a>Philly, 2008: my first tri</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Question of the day:</span> Are you thinking of doing a triathlon? What&#8217;s holding you back? OR What suggestions do you have for newbie triathletes?</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 268px"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt="" width="258" height="284" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At least a dozen people have sent this XKCD cartoon to me over the years.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s plenty hard enough to get someone to listen to your arguments in a debate, given how attached people are naturally to their own ideas and ways of thinking. But it becomes even harder when you trigger someone&#8217;s emotional side, by making them feel like you&#8217;re attacking them and putting them automatically into &#8220;defend myself&#8221; mode (or worse, &#8220;lash out&#8221; mode), rather than &#8220;listen reasonably&#8221; mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, online debates are full of emotional tripwires, partly because tone isn&#8217;t always easy to detect in the written word, and even comments intended neutrally can come off as snide or snippy&#8230; and also because not having to say something to someone&#8217;s face seems to bring out the immature child inside grown adults.</p>
<p>But on the plus side, debating online at least has the benefit that you can take the time to think about your wording before you comment or email someone. Below, I walk you through my process of revising my wording to reduce the risk of making someone angry and defensive, and increase my chances that they&#8217;ll genuinely consider what I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>DRAFT 1</strong> (My first impulse is to say): &#8220;You idiot, you&#8217;re ignoring&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<em><br />
Duh. Get rid of the insult.</em></p>
<p><strong>DRAFT 2</strong>: &#8220;You&#8217;re ignoring&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<em><br />
I should make it clear I&#8217;m attacking an idea, not a person.</em></p>
<p><strong>DRAFT 3</strong>: &#8220;Your argument is ignoring&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This can still be depersonalized. By using the word &#8220;your,&#8221; I&#8217;m encouraging the person to identify the argument with himself, which can still trigger a defensive reaction when I attack the argument. That&#8217;s the exact opposite of what I want to do.<br />
</em><br />
<strong>DRAFT 4</strong>: &#8220;That argument is ignoring&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Almost perfect. The only remaining room for improvement is the word &#8220;ignoring,&#8221; which implies an intentional disregard, and sounds like an accusation. Better to use something neutral instead:</em></p>
<p><strong>DRAFT 5</strong>: &#8220;That argument isn&#8217;t taking into account&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<em><br />
Done.  Of course, chances are I still won&#8217;t persuade them, but at least I&#8217;ve given myself the best chance possible&#8230; and done my part to help keep the Internet civilized. Or at least a tiny bit less savage!  </em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our last day in Denmark, Alex and I split up for a few hours to pursue a few individual interests. I won&#8217;t give you any guesses as to how he spent his time, but you might not know that I have a strong interest in glass; so I was excited to learn about the <a href="http://www.cisternerne.dk/">Cisternerne</a>, which is a museum of modern glass art.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4545.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7035" title="AIMG_4545" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4545.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>Although the entrance fee seems high at 50 Danish Kroner, that&#8217;s just about £6, so  I figured even if it wasn&#8217;t the most amazing thing ever, I wasn&#8217;t out too much money. Luckily for me it turned out to be a pretty cool experience. In fact, I think I enjoyed the ambience more than the art (with a few exceptions!)</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4599.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7061" title="AIMG_4599" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4599.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>As you can probably guess from the name, the Cisternerne is located in an old water cistern. It&#8217;s essentially a huge cavern underground, and from the surface you would have no idea it&#8217;s down below. The entire space of this field represents the open area underneath.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4541.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7030" title="AIMG_4541" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4541.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>When we approached the location on the map, near Søndermarken Park, I was a little confused because I didn&#8217;t see any buildings, just a large field and a circular, manmade pond (I can&#8217;t think of the right word to describe it right now!).   In the distance I could make out two triangular glass buildings, and as Alex headed off to his trains, I made my way along a lovely route to the entrance.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4547.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7037" title="AIMG_4547" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4547.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>Once you enter the triangular glass buildings (which kind of reminded me of the capsule in which Superman was saved from the destruction of his home planet and traveled to Earth), you go down a very long and steep staircase into darkness.  You can immediately feel that the air is moist, and when you stop at the bottom you&#8217;re standing in a centimeter or two of water. No one warned me about that!</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4570.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7051" title="AIMG_4570" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4570.jpg?w=604&#038;h=805" alt="" width="604" height="805" /></a></p>
<p>There is very minimal lighting down there, which seems odd for a museum of glass. But then I realized that they weren&#8217;t joking when they said &#8220;modern&#8221; glass &#8211; because it was very cutting edge. There were quiet a few pieces I didn&#8217;t like, but the presentation alone was worth it.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4586.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7057" title="AIMG_4586" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4586.jpg?w=604&#038;h=805" alt="" width="604" height="805" /></a></p>
<p>The space was quite large (the website says it is 1400 meters square). There were arches and columns throughout, which made it hard do figure out where you were or what was around you. There were only a few lights, mostly mounted to shine from behind onto the glass, or as a spotlight down on a particular piece. There were also a lot of candles scattered around, in nooks and crannies and chandeliers. I mentioned the water, but I didn&#8217;t tell you that I had a hole in the botom of my shoe, and my sock got totally wet.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4571.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7053" title="AIMG_4571" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4571.jpg?w=604&#038;h=805" alt="" width="604" height="805" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the pieces can only be described as sculptures made out of glass &#8211; they were three dimensional, and most were opaque. If I didn&#8217;t know, I would have said it was pottery. But other pieces were more traditional stained glass, with very modern designs and colors. I liked these ones the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4568.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047" title="AIMG_4568" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4568.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>In the far section of the space was a series of carved people, life-sized.It was quite spooky being in that space, all alone (because no one else was visiting as far as  I could tell), with a room full of carved people. These were obviously not made of out of glass, but I couldn&#8217;t tell you what th material was.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4578.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7055" title="AIMG_4578" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4578.jpg?w=604&#038;h=805" alt="" width="604" height="805" /></a></p>
<p>There were maybe 100 of these figures, and all were dressed in historical clothing and were clearly identifiable as certain characters: a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, etc. I don&#8217;t know if they were all Danish, or came from all over the world, or what. I really wish they had more information down there!</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4564.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7045" title="AIMG_4564" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4564.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>I spent maybe 40 minutes in total at the Cisternerne, and I took quite a few photos although very few of them have turned out because of the lack of light.  I would definitely recommend this for a scary Halloween experience, but unless you really love modern art, it might be best to stay up in the sunshine.</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4563.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7042" title="AIMG_4563" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4563.jpg?w=604&#038;h=452" alt="" width="604" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>This image (above) was my least-favorite in the whole exhibition. I think it&#8217;s a group of dogs fighting, snarling, and attacking each other. It&#8217;s an amazing technical composition, I&#8217;m sure, but it gave me the creeps. But then again, who says that good art has make you feel good?</p>
<p><a href="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4592.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7058" title="AIMG_4592" src="http://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aimg_4592.jpg?w=604&#038;h=805" alt="" width="604" height="805" /></a></p>
<p>This image (above) was my favorite. I would buy this if I could. I did manage to find out that it by an artist name Lise Malinovsky, who was born in 1957.  I just love the colors and shapes &#8230; I wish I could hang it in my house!</p>

<p>Panna cotta and I have honestly never quite gotten along.</p>
<p>You see, just the mere mention of panna cotta has always conjured images of a rich, creamy and dense dessert- not quite the dessert I want to end a fantastic meal with.</p>
<p>But that all changed when I visited a friend&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tintine.com/" target="_blank">new restaurant</a> a couple months ago.</p>
<p>The restaurant pride itself on serving Indian-Italian fusion food. And while the mains- seafood marinara risotto, tandoori pasta and a trio of Indian curries and pasta- were fantastic as expected, I didn&#8217;t really expect to be blown away by was the dessert. By the panna cotta, in particular.</p>
<p>The panna cotta was smooth, creamy and utterly delicious, served with a side of berry sauce that cut through the richness of the dessert so perfectly.</p>
<p>All it took was one spoonful before I ordered a second serving of it.</p>
<p>So when I was watching a Masterclass episode of Junior Masterchef (cutest show ever, if you ask me) and Poh (of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/pohskitchen" target="_blank">Poh&#8217;s Kitchen</a> and Masterchef Australia season one) came on to show the kids how to make a yogurt panna cotta, I took it as a sign from the universe that it was time to make peace with panna cotta right in my very own kitchen.</p>
<p><a title="Vanilla Yogurt Pannacotta with Mixed Berries Jelly II by thecoffeesnob, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thecoffeesnob/5821263998/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/5821263998_162d33a8a4.jpg" alt="Vanilla Yogurt Pannacotta with Mixed Berries Jelly II" width="500" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, making peace with panna cotta really wasn&#8217;t so hard at all. Just a little heating, stirring, pouring and setting and viola, panna cotta.</p>
<p>The smooth, creaminess of the panna cotta melded perfectly with the slight firmness and sweetness of the mixed berries jelly, with the yogurt making for a slightly lighter but no less delicious panna cotta.</p>
<p>So now that panna cotta and I have got our friendship firmly on track, I foresee making and eating plenty of panna cotta in my future. Never too late like the present to make up for time, right?</p>
<p><strong>Vanilla Yogurt Panna Cotta with Mixed Berries Jelly</strong> [adapted from Junior Masterchef]</p>
<p><a title="Vanilla Yogurt Pannacotta with Mixed Berries Jelly III by thecoffeesnob, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thecoffeesnob/5820702559/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3370/5820702559_bf0f4a7855_t.jpg" alt="Vanilla Yogurt Pannacotta with Mixed Berries Jelly III" width="100" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em><br />
150g frozen mixed berries<br />
100ml water<br />
50g vanilla sugar<br />
3 gelatin leaves</p>
<p><em>Panna cotta</em><br />
300ml thin cream<br />
75g vanilla sugar<br />
225g natural-set yogurt<br />
1 vanilla bean, split into half<br />
1 tbsp honey</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To make the mixed berries jelly</strong> Heat the mixed berries, water and vanilla sugar in a saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Soak the gelatin leaves in a bowl of cold water for a couple of minutes until softened. Squeeze any excess water out of the leaves and add it to the mixed berries mixture. Stir gently to dissolve gelatin.</li>
<li>Divide the jelly mixture between six 125ml capacity moulds and place them in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until set.</li>
<li><em><strong>To make panna cotta</strong></em> Place the cream, vanilla sugar, vanilla bean and honey in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat until warmed, remove from heat and let it stand for 5 minutes to infuse. Scrap the vanilla bean into the cream and discard the vanilla bean.</li>
<li> Soak the gelatin leaves in a bowl of cold water for a couple of minutes until softened. Squeeze any excess water out of the leaves and add it to the warm cream.</li>
<li>Gently whisk the yogurt and vanilla extract into the cream mixture. Divide the cream mixture evenly among the prepared moulds. Chill the panna cotta in the fridge for at least four hours or until set.</li>
<li>Place the panna cottas in warm water for a few seconds. Carefully slide a butter knife around the inside edge of the mould then invert onto serving plates. <em>Serves 6</em></li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fifty-Year <a href="http://meanderingmatriarch.com/2009/09/10/high-school-reunions/">Reunion</a> looms.  I don&#8217;t know what to expect.  Will I know anyone?  Will anyone know me?  Fifty years is a looong time.  I wonder if I&#8217;m crazy to be traveling such a long way to attend a gathering of strangers.  I have had a few communications with some of the classmates, which is promising, but will they remember me on the day?  A surprising number of them still live in the area where we went to school, and no doubt many have kept in contact with one another.  But here I am, in Australia for over 32 years, totally out of touch. I really will be the &#8220;odd person out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If nothing else, at least I should be a strong contender for the prize for having traveled the farthest. Not that there really is such a prize, of course, but that&#8217;s pretty typical for me.  The only time I win anything is when there isn&#8217;t a prize.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to troll through my memory bank for anecdotes from high school, and I really can&#8217;t find many.  I&#8217;m pretty sure I was there, but there isn&#8217;t a lot of evidence. Certainly not in the form of academic performance.  I was a terrible student.  Fact is, I wasn&#8217;t a student at all.  I just attended classes regularly.  I never did any homework.  I was the sort of student that causes much grinding of teeth amongst faculty members. But I got my just desserts; both my sons were exactly the same kind of student as I was, except a lot smarter.</p>
<p>The Reunion coincides with the high school Homecoming Game, and we (the seriously senescent alumni) will have our own section at the game, AND we can either ride or walk in the Homecoming Parade.  Now I&#8217;m not expecting my classmates to be arriving with Zimmer frames, but I think in the eyes of the hormonal hordes of high school students, we will seem unimaginably old.</p>
<p>Perhaps our challenge will be to demonstrate to these callow youth that there is life after high school&#8230;long after,  however pathetic it might look to them now.  Do I yearn for the high school days?  Good heavens, no.  I&#8217;d like to have the fitness and energy, the seemingly endless expanse of time laid out in front of me, but to be a teenager again would be&#8230;well, pretty awful.  Admittedly, I am experiencing a certain amount of teenage-like angst at the moment, but at least I <em>do</em> know better.  Age does bring with it a certain amount of wisdom, which is probably just experience you don&#8217;t have to keep having over and over again.  I&#8217;m happy enough to <em>feel</em> like a teenager without having to <em>be</em> a teenager.</p>
<p>So, bring on the 50-year reunion. I think I&#8217;ll be up for a little trip through Memory Land.  As long as they&#8217;re someone else&#8217;s memories.  Mine are pretty bland.           MM</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://www.knitsinthecity.co.uk/graphics/ZM49Vision.jpg">Vision</a> top from Rowan Magazine 49 is finished! I&#8217;ve worn it a couple of times now and finally got the chance to take some early morning shots like I wanted. This top is made out of Kidsilk Haze and is a fairly easy knit. The lace is the most fun part, and as long as you don&#8217;t have to take any out, the Kidsilk Haze is wonderful to work with.</p>
<p><a href="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-676" title="Vision" src="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision.jpg?w=399&#038;h=600" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a shot of the back:<br />
<a href="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-678" title="Vision-2" src="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-21.jpg?w=399&#038;h=600" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>If I were to make this again, I think I would use a provisional cast on for the back, and use kitchener stitch to eliminate the back seam. It is helpful for lining up where to sew the other pieces to the body, but I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s totally necessary. I&#8217;m not sure I like how the seam looks. And yes, I am wearing a stitch marker in my ear.</p>
<p><a href="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-680" title="Vision-4" src="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-4.jpg?w=399&#038;h=600" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>I started this top last spring, and took a long hiatus as the weather grew too hot to think about touching mohair. It&#8217;s cooled significantly here in the South in the last few days as we finally got some rain and thunderstorms, and I&#8217;m so grateful. I&#8217;m not quite ready for fall weather yet, but a break from 106 degrees is more than welcome.</p>
<p><a href="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-679" title="Vision-3" src="http://knitthehellout.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vision-3.jpg?w=399&#038;h=600" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still working on <a href="http://store.cocoknits.com/products/liesl.html">Liesl</a>. It&#8217;s very easy with clever pocket construction. I had the wrong gauge and had to rip back almost 270 yards of Euroflax because I was reading the ROW gauge. Grrrr. I&#8217;m all caught up now and down to the last of three balls, so I&#8217;m hoping this one flys off the needles in time for school to start in about a week. I&#8217;ll be starting the 3rd year of my PhD program, and I want to look sharp.</p>
