				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven years ago I became very ill.</p>
<p>An inexperienced doctor jumped to conclusions and uttered words like Brain Tumor, Spinal Cord Damage, and Multiple Sclerosis.  Of course they had no idea, because no tests had been run at the time, but after hearing the possibilities, I thought I was dying.</p>
<p>Aside from being sick, I had two insurmountable problems.  I had no money and no health insurance.  I was young and healthy.  I never thought I would need MRI&#8217;s and specialists.</p>
<p>Like Jacob, I wrestled with God.</p>
<p>I knew God could heal me, but for some reason, He wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I was mad, upset, desperate, and nearly hopeless.  I did not want to die.</p>
<p>Although I had settled my eternal destiny, my baby just turned three years old and my son was only five.  My husband was about to enter ministry.  He need not do it a widow with two small kids.</p>
<p>I told God that. Over and over again.</p>
<p>I knew He cared, but I could not understand the purpose in all of it.  I wanted Him to heal me.</p>
<p>I pleaded and begged, bartered and bargained.  I promised everything from going to Africa to never getting mad again.  At anyone. For the rest of my life.</p>
<p>It all seemed silly, empty even.  God was not going to be moved by my temper tantrums.</p>
<p>One night I came to the end of myself.  I was doing battle with God when I realized I did not want to die, because I did not trust God with my kids.</p>
<p>I felt like I needed to be there to raise them, to love them, to nurture them.  I did not, for one minute, think they would grow up to be healthy, happy, stable adults if they lost me.</p>
<p>That is a lot of ego folks.</p>
<p>It was an &#8220;aha&#8221; moment.  All the light bulbs came on in my head and realization dawned.</p>
<p>I did not trust God.</p>
<p>That night I surrendered.  I gave my children to God and told Him that I trusted Him enough to take care of my kids.  I told Him if it was His will that I die, then I knew my husband and my children would be just fine without me.</p>
<p>After floods of tears and broken heart given to the one who created it, God said, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know I did not hear it audibly, but in my heart, in my mind, I heard it like someone was standing right next to me speaking.  There was no doubt it was God.</p>
<p>I did not get miraculously healed, but I am still here and I am perfectly well.  It was a long time coming though.  I struggled for more than a year and never knew what was wrong.  Oh, there was speculation and eventually I got health insurance and saw a good doctor who found a few things wrong, but that was many, many months later.</p>
<p>I had to remind myself, sometimes several times a day, this is not going to kill me.  God promised.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thedomesticfringe.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/me-a-dress-boots.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="me &amp; A dress &amp; boots" alt="My Daughter and I in a Photo Shoot" src="http://thedomesticfringe.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/me-a-dress-boots.jpg?w=467&#038;h=561" height="561" width="467" /></a></p>
<p>I do not know why I got sick.  I&#8217;m not even exactly sure what God was trying to teach me through it all.  I learned many lessons, trusting the Lord with my children was only one, but it was a big one.</p>
<p>Living by faith sometimes requires us to give up, surrender the thing (the person) we are holding on to the tightest.  Living by faith is trusting God even when it is really difficult.</p>

<p><em>By <a href="www.andrewlovgren.com">Andrew Lovgren</a></em></p>
<p>Plenty has been said about <i>Argo</i> as a quality, Oscar-worthy film.</p>
<p>Ben Affleck continues his rebirth in Hollywood, directing and starring in his first film since 2010’s surprising success, <i>The Town</i>.</p>
<p>Based on the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis, <i>Argo</i> focuses on CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) as he works to rescue six American embassy workers who escaped during a revolt.</p>
<p>Mendez works together with Oscar-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and Producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to construct fake movie credentials to sneak the six out of the country to safety.</p>
<p><i>Argo</i> was shot in a retro-style, matching the big glasses and ridiculous hairstyles to complete the feeling of a period piece. A strong script and the solid, scene-stealing performances from Arkin, Goodman and <i>Breaking Bad’s</i> Bryan Cranston place this film square in the middle of the Oscar talk.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most crucial part of the movie is being ignored. As President Obama and Mitt Romney square off in the final debate, foreign policy moves into the spotlight, something <i>Argo </i>brings up in the first scenes.</p>
<p>The revolution in Iran that sparked the revolts against the U.S. stemmed from a coup that was put in place by the U.S government to return oil fields to British and American companies. The movie also references the unrest in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion at the end of 1979, which the U.S. supplied the Afghan people (including one Osama Bin Laden) to suppress.</p>
<p><i>Argo </i>directly and indirectly brings into question many of the United States’ foreign policy decisions. The ‘number one’ mentality that Americans have held dear is no longer an illusion that can be kept up.</p>
<p>It’s not just about past or present wars. The current sanctions against Iran continue to cripple the Iranian economy and any hope of progression in their society or relationship with the West.</p>
<p>Right or wrong, many of the U.S. policies have caused damages to the many, punishing the many for the crimes of the few. The debate with a focus on foreign policy has a chance to bring more of these issues to light, including the struggles in the Middle East, the EU crisis and a continued embargo on Cuba.</p>
<p>Viewers are more likely to find positioning and rhetoric, but it should bring up questions, leading to an investigation of our positions in foreign politics. Whatever the resulting thoughts, it’s something that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Moviegoers may have just seen a quality film from one of the best up-and-coming directors in Hollywood, but <i>Argo </i>is far more. It’s a representation of the effects of foreign policy and a cautionary tale for the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>1. Remember to write thank-you notes.</strong> If you do not know when a thank-you note is appropriate, consult an etiquette book — the older and more hidebound the book, the better. When in doubt, write one anyway; better to err on the side of formality. An email is not sufficient thanks for a physical gift. Purchase stationery and stamps, set aside five minutes, and express your gratitude in writing. Failure to do so implies that you don&#8217;t care. This implication is a memorable one. Enough said.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do not invite yourself to stay with friends when you travel anymore.</strong> Presumably you have a job, and the means to procure yourself a hotel. If so, do so. If not, stay home. Mentioning that you plan a visit to another city may lead to an invitation to stay with a friend or family member, which you may of course accept; assuming that &#8220;it&#8217;s cool if you crash&#8221; is not. Wait for the invitation; if it is not forthcoming, this is what we call &#8220;a hint,&#8221; and you should take it and make other arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do not expect friends to help you move anymore.</strong> You may ask for help; you may not expect it, particularly if your move date is on a weekday. Your friends have jobs to go to, and you have accumulated a lot of heavy books by this point in your life. Hire a mover. If you cannot afford a mover, sell your books or put them in storage — or don&#8217;t move, but one way or another, you will have to cope.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop a physical awareness of your surroundings.</strong> As children, we live in our own heads, bonking into things, gnawing on twigs, emitting random squawks because we don&#8217;t know how to talk yet. Then, we enter nursery school. You, having graduated college or reached a similar age to that of the college graduate, need to learn to sense others and get out of their way. Walk single file. Don&#8217;t blather loudly in public spaces. Give up your seat to those with disabilities or who are struggling with small children. Take your headphones off while interacting with clerks and passersby. Do not walk along and then stop suddenly. It is not just you on the street; account for that fact.</p>
<p><strong>5. Be on time.</strong> The occasional public-transit snafu is forgivable, but consistent lateness is rude, annoying, and self-centered. If we didn&#8217;t care when you showed up, we&#8217;d have said &#8220;any old time&#8221;; if we said seven, get there at seven or within fifteen minutes. Do not ditz that you &#8220;lost track of time&#8221; as though time somehow slipped its leash and ran into traffic. It shows a basic lack of respect for others; flakiness is not cute anymore, primarily because it never was. Buy a watch, wind it up, and wear it everywhere you go.</p>
<p><span id="more-293"></span></p>
<p><strong>6. Have enough money.</strong> I do not mean &#8220;give up your scholarly dreams and join the world of corporate finance in order to keep up with the Joneses.&#8221; I mean that you should not become that girl or boy who is always a few dollars short, can only cover exactly his or her meal but no tip, or &#8220;forgot&#8221; to go to the ATM. Go to the ATM first, don&#8217;t order things you can&#8217;t afford, and…</p>
<p><strong>7. Know how to calculate the tip.</strong> Ten percent of the total; double it; done. You did not have to major in math to know how this works. You are not dumb, but your Barbie-math-is-hard flailing is agonizing and has outstayed its welcome. Ten percent times two. Learn it.</p>
<p><strong>8. Do not share the crazy dream you had last night with anyone but your mental wellness professional.</strong> Nobody cares. People who starred in the dream may care, but confine your synopsis to ten words or fewer.</p>
<p><strong>9. Learn to walk in heels.</strong> Gentlemen, you are at your leisure. Ladies: If you wear heels, know how to operate them. Clomping along and placing your foot down flat with each step gives the appearance of a ten-year-old playing dress-up, but a pair of heels is like a bicycle — you need momentum to stay up. Come down on the heel and carry forward through the toe, using your regular stride. If you feel wobbly, keep practicing, or get a pair that&#8217;s better suited to your style of walking. It isn&#8217;t a once-a-year prom thing anymore for a lot of you, so please learn to walk in them.</p>
<p><strong>10. Have at least one good dress-up outfit.</strong> A dress code, or suggested attire on an invitation, is not an instrument of The Man. Own one nice dress, or one reasonable suit, or one sharp pair of pants and chic sweater — something you can clean up nice in for a wedding or a semi-formal dinner. You don&#8217;t have to like it, but if the invitation requests it, put it on. Every night can&#8217;t be poker night. Which reminds me…</p>
<p><strong>11. Do as <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com/custom-invitations-multi.aspx" target="_blank">invitations</a> ask you.</strong> Don&#8217;t bring a guest when no such courtesy is extended. Don&#8217;t blow off an RSVP; it means &#8220;please respond,&#8221; and you should. &#8220;Regrets only&#8221; means you only answer if you <em>can&#8217;t</em>come. If the party starts at eight, show up at eight — not at seven-thirty so you can go a &#8220;better&#8221; party later, not at eleven when dinner is cold. Eight. Cocktail parties allow for leeway, of course, but pay attention and read instructions; your host furnished the details for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>12. Know how.</strong> Know how to drive. Know how to read a map. Know how to get around. Know how to change a tire, or whom to call if you can&#8217;t manage it, or how to get to a phone if you don&#8217;t have a cell phone. We will happily bail you out, until it becomes apparent that it&#8217;s what you always need. The possibility of a fingernail breaking or a hairstyle becoming compromised is not grounds for purposeful helplessness.</p>
<p><strong>13. Don&#8217;t use your friends.</strong> It&#8217;s soulless. It&#8217;s also obvious. If the only reason you continue to associate with a person is to borrow his or her car, might I remind you that you have now turned 25 and may rent your own.</p>
<p><strong>14. Have something to talk about besides college or your job.</strong> College is over. The war stories have their amusements, but not over and over and not at every gathering. Get a library card, go to the movies, participate in the world. Working is not living. Be interested so that you can be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>15. Give and receive favors graciously.</strong> If you have agreed to do a favor, you may not 1) remind the favoree ceaselessly about how great a pain it is for you, or 2) half-ass it because the favoree &#8220;owes you.&#8221; It is a favor; it is not required, and if you cannot do it, say so. If you can do it, pretend that nobody is watching, do it as best you can, and let that be the end of it. Conversely, if you ask for a favor and the askee cannot do it, do not get snappish. You can manage.</p>
<p><strong>16. Drinking until you throw up is no longer properly a point of pride.</strong> It happens to the best of us, but be properly ashamed the next day; work on your tolerance, or eat something first, but amateur hour ended several years ago.</p>
<p><strong>17. Have a real trash receptacle, real Kleenex, and, if you smoke, a real ashtray.</strong> No loose bags on the floor; no using a roll of toilet paper; no plates or empty soda cans. You are not a fierce warrior nomad of the Fratty Bubelatty tribe. Buy a wastebasket and grown-up paper products.</p>
<p><strong>18. Universal quiet hours do in fact apply to you.</strong> They are, generally, as follows — midnight to six AM on weekdays, 2 AM to 8 AM on weekends. Mine is a fairly generous interpretation, by the by, so bass practice should conclude, not start, at ten PM. Understand also that just because nobody has complained directly to you does not mean that a complaint is not justified, or pending. Further, get your speakers off the floor. Yes, &#8220;now.&#8221; Yes, a rug is still &#8220;the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>19. Take care of yourself.</strong> If you are sick, visit a doctor. If you are sad, visit a shrink or talk to a friend. If you are unhappy in love, break up. If you are fed up with how you look, buy a new shirt or stop eating cheese. If you have a problem, try to fix it. Many problems are knotty and need a lot of talking through, or time to resolve, but after a few months of all complaining and no fixing, those around you will begin to wonder if you don&#8217;t enjoy the problems for the attention they bring you. Venting is fine; inertia coupled with pouting is not. Bored? Read a magazine. Mad at someone? Say so — to them. Change is hard; that&#8217;s too bad. Effort counts. Make one. Your mommy&#8217;s shift is over.</p>
<p><strong>20. Rudeness is not a signifier of your importance.</strong> Rudeness is a signifier of itself, nothing more. We all have bad days; yours is not weightier than anyone else&#8217;s, comparatively, and does not excuse displays of poor breeding. Be civil or be elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>So true, and this list is from <a href="http://tomatonation.com/stories-true-and-otherwise/25-and-over/">here</a>.<br />
I should also give credit to <a href="http://captainawkward.com/">Captain Awkward</a> for bringing it to <a href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/05/31/261-i-keep-falling-for-fixer-uppers/#more-3163">my attention</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like most of the annoyances I experience in regards to the people I interact with have to do with them not acting like an adult. Oh well, such is life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;">When the rain is falling outside your window, it&#8217;s the perfect time to curl up in your bed, drink some hot chocolate, and get all sentimental as you listen to that CD full of mellow songs, pretending that you are in one of those sad movies where the weather is sympathizing with you in your most recent heartbreak. Either that, or you&#8217;re just curling up in your bed and snoring the afternoon away (good for you). I know, I know, you were busy the entire week and you deserve the nap. I wasn&#8217;t judging you; don&#8217;t feel all guilty. You can sleep as much as you want, and I&#8217;ll pretend that I&#8217;m not secretly judging you for that. It&#8217;s all good, okay?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://radialhq.com.au/rain%20for%20tank%20collection.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://radialhq.com.au/rain%20for%20tank%20collection.jpg" height="338" width="506" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Rainy days though are more than just the hot chocolate, the cool air, and the opportunity to grab a decent nap. When it&#8217;s raining and you&#8217;re indoors, there is always that relaxing feeling that makes you want to either smile or cry, depending on your level of sentimentality., as you reflect on your life and the world or as you become nostalgic all of a sudden. As you watch the raindrops fall on your window pane, you suddenly reflect on your life, what you love about life, what you used to enjoy doing, and what you have been missing out on lately. You also begin to question your worth and your place in this world, then you wonder about the justice system implemented in your country and about the inequality present in our world. You continue to question many things &#8211; discrimination, modern-day slavery, power struggles, poverty, and doomsday &#8211; and you tell yourself that you want to help change the world. Thing is, we reflect but we forget about what we reflect on when we&#8217;re thrown back to the &#8220;real world&#8221;. We become so immersed in our own work that we tend to forget how much we wanted to help make the world a more pleasant place to be in, especially for those who know only of suffering and pain since they were born. Rainy days are great times to reflect, but I hope our thoughts and our reflections don&#8217;t evaporate into thin air once they&#8217;re over, like the raindrops outside our windows.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQvJVDIlI73VSqeZWbIwJLt1qRbHv4qSbtGlpZUozF8_ySZ0_z3BLO7nw"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQvJVDIlI73VSqeZWbIwJLt1qRbHv4qSbtGlpZUozF8_ySZ0_z3BLO7nw" height="220" width="229" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Rainy days are also when nostalgia hits you hard in the face. As you watch the children play under the rain and as you stare at the falling rain, you remember your own childhood, your high school friends with whom you haven&#8217;t kept in touch in over 6 years, those good ol&#8217; college days that you&#8217;ve forgotten about because you were too busy making presentations and reports to please &#8211; not even impress &#8211; your boss, and those lunch dates you had with your ex. You remember, you recollect, and you feel sad because you realize how much you missed those people and those times you had with them &#8211; and you wish you could bring them back. But, since life loves to play with you, it only lets you remember  those moments but not to go back in time to relive them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You then cry and pull out old photos that are buried under your bed. You smile at the sight of your friends and their silly faces in the photos. Oh look, there&#8217;s George! He&#8217;s pouring beer all over himself again. (I wonder if he still does that now) And then, there&#8217;s Lisa in her favorite yellow dress. And Michelle, there she is, dancing like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. And Greg, always the charming man that he is, smiling shyly behind everyone. And then, you wonder where they all are now. Did they get the jobs that they have always dreamed of? Are they still around the neighborhood? How many of them are married now? I guess, if that&#8217;s how much you miss them, maybe you should give them a call or send them an e-mail &#8211; or fine, send them a Facebook message. It&#8217;s never too late to keep in touch with an old friend, and if that&#8217;s all you need to keep you sane in your crazy life right now, then why not? You miss them (although they may not necessarily miss you), so go do something about that. Forget about reciprocity and what they might say. Just send that damn e-mail already! You don&#8217;t want to wait for another rainy day to remember doing that.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTDv3AXRMX-u3TD1SpEmh9yXsF0n7k21d9ll1QwaVU5rtjy4TXEfrFUNg"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTDv3AXRMX-u3TD1SpEmh9yXsF0n7k21d9ll1QwaVU5rtjy4TXEfrFUNg" height="229" width="323" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Apart from nostalgia and the sudden urge to reflect, you know what else rainy days bring us? Well, rain. Okay, I&#8217;m not trying to insult your common sense here, so hear me out first before you start picking up those tomatoes to hit me in the face.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It&#8217;s a common thing to feel all philosophical as you reflect and all dramatic as you look back at old days, but what we don&#8217;t usually do is listen to the rain. Yeah sure, you hear it, but do you<em> listen</em> to it? Do you listen to the sound of the raindrops dripping, to the rain pouring down from the sky and hitting the floor? I bet most of you don&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t either, until a few weeks ago. And you know what? It&#8217;s actually nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The rain&#8217;s like this song that we never took the time to listen. A song that frees your mind. A song that makes you feel light and happy but lonely and scared at the same time. A song that touches your soul in a way that you&#8217;ll never get to explain (and probably won&#8217;t admit). A song that makes you feel at peace with yourself. A song that is made of various rhythms which are harmonized into one long melody. A song that reminds you of immortality and of endless possibilities. A song that tells us tales, whatever they may be &#8211; of dark winters, of  uncertainties, of cold winds and gloomy forests, of wild birds, of hibernating polar bears, of tigers in the wild, of death, of life, of newborn babies waiting to see the light of the day, of dreams waiting to be fulfilled, of the night sky, of good old times and beer, of friends and enemies, of waiting in vain, of war, of sacrifice, of selfless giving, of loving genuinely. It is a song that captures you and sings you a tune that is uniquely yours at precisely that moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It&#8217;s raining outside. Take a seat and close your eyes. Listen &#8211; listen to what it wants you to hear. There&#8217;s lots and lots of rain in this rainy day, and there&#8217;s a story somewhere in it for you. Listen to it speak to you and tell you about the day&#8217;s tales and the night&#8217;s secrets. Give yourself a break from the hustle and bustle of everything. You can reflect later. You can miss your old friends later. You can care about the worries of the world a little later.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But for now, pause. Take a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Let yourself be lost in this moment, in the song of the rain.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While some people grow older with grace and maintain their beauty, others age like a curse has been put upon them. But, eventually, we will all start to resemble rotting jack o&#8217; lanterns in both appearance and smell. Your pants start to slowly creep up your body and you become increasingly concerned about the state of your lawn. I may, technically, still be a young man but I can sense the passage of time starting to chip away at the best parts of me. I used to go on dates with gorgeous women but it’s probably just a matter of time before I’m sending them creepy anonymous emails instead, like so many of my friends’ dads.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/mposky/OLDstyle_EMAIL_zps73849e83.jpg" height="783" width="670" /></p>
<p>Getting older often means allowing novelty to be slowly superseded by nostalgia. You start talking about “the good old days” which was a time when music was better and people had their priorities in line. It was also a time that never existed. You’re suddenly afraid of new ideas and angry about things that don’t quite fit in with your loose dogmas. You’re worried about keeping a job that makes you unhappy so you can continue to afford living the lifestyle that you’ve grown accustomed to, while expecting the rest of the world to do the everything exactly the same way. This is how wealthy fifty-five year olds can complain about subtle tax increases from the bow of their yachts. It’s an incredible and mystical process.</p>
<p>This might not affect everyone on the planet, but it’ll happen to enough of us to really cause some serious problems. Voters and politicians everywhere fall victim to it every day. There are already a lot of people that are much more worried about their living room furniture than how they treat other people, let alone broad social issues or more complicated philosophical concepts. I know this because QVC and the Home Shopping Network have based their entire businesses model off it. For a lot of us, getting older means not worrying about changing the world anymore. New ideas will be a thing of the past and problem solving will become impossibility. If you know anyone’s parents that own a dog, go to their home and watch how they interact with it. They’ll just yell and yell and the dog will bark and bark. They’ll try absolutely nothing and spend zero hours thinking critically or problem solving. In fact, until a friend or the television offers new advice, they’ll actually claim to have <em>tried everything</em>. So often it seems like anytime someone tells me that they are getting older, they are really just telling me that they&#8217;ve decided to start giving up on things. There is no conciliable way that can end well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/mposky/biglots.jpg" height="799" width="516" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/mposky/biglots2.jpg" height="799" width="527" /></p>
<p>There is this culture of cannot that is at the heart of getting old. This is why there are millions of old people that never figured out how to use the internet. That’s sort of criminal because if there ever was a demographic that had a lot of free time and money to spend on online shopping and pornography, it’s the elderly. But they just couldn’t quite figure out that dag-nabbed computing machine. Chemically speaking, your brain actually does get worse and worse at handling dopamine as you age so you derive less pleasure from learning a new skill. But that doesn’t really excuse you entirely from becoming so out of touch that people mouth “wow” to each other behind your back every time you finish a thought.</p>
<p>Rest assured that tomorrow’s youth will always know more than your generation will. While you’re too focused on prime time television and work to bother educating yourself on anything new, they’ll be learning your history while simultaneously mastering the future. You’ll be reminiscing like crazy about how soft toilet paper used to be while the rest of the world is deciding upon which retirement home to put you in. If that isn’t a good reason to stay active, relevant and thoughtful, I don’t know what is. But the worst part about getting old isn’t having food perpetually trapped in the corners of your mouth or possessing a smell that is reminiscent of pee (which we all know probably is pee), it’s the potentially wasted life that leads up to that point.</p>
<p>Some of the best conversations that I’ve ever had have been with an old person over coffee. Sure, you have to deal with the occasional impressively racist sentence, but it&#8217;s worth it in the end. After retirement they reacquire the gift of having a real conversation about life, and they always give me the same advice about it. They say not to waste my time working for a big organization, not to let other people’s rules box me in, build quality relationships and consider all time as “my” time. This advice is in direct contrast to almost every single adult I knew as a child and most of the ones that I know now. Nobody has to be trapped in a job they hate, surrounded by mediocre people while their thoughts stagnate in a mental swamp. You don’t have a lot of time to be wasting. So you can take all of those little reminders that you’re getting older and use them to keep yourself motivated or you can use them as an excuse to move into that culture of cannot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided I didn’t want to live.</p>
<p>Things have been bad for a long time now.  My depression isn’t getting any better in spite of all the things I’ve been trying to do and all the changes in medications.  It’s been almost impossible to work.  I’ve complained for a while that there isn’t enough work to do to stay busy, but things finally picked up a couple of weeks ago.  But being so depressed it’s been all I can do to keep up with the bare minimum.  I just have no motivation and no energy.  I spend my day staring at the computer screen or out the window, waiting until it’s finally time to go home.  But it isn’t any better there.  As soon as I’m home I just wander around from room to room, checking email for the 100<sup>th</sup> time and watching reruns of shows I’ve recorded.  I have no appetite at all and trying to cook dinner for myself is out of the question.  Sometimes I can force myself to eat a frozen dinner, but many days I don’t eat at all.  I’ve lost so much weight I’ve had to start wearing jeans that I had to buy in the boys’ department as I can’t find a small enough size in men’s.  It’s absolutely miserable.  So I plod through each day, dreading the drive into work and hating being home when I’m done for the day.  So I start looking forward to the weekend.  At least I can sleep and not worry about trying to look busy at work.  But weekends are even harder than weeknights.  The solitude and isolation is almost more than I can bear.  Sometimes I am able to go out on Saturday night, and that’s a big help.  But it only lasts a short time, and Sundays are the worst days of all.  In spite of being so miserable at home, the weekend just flies by, and before I know it it’s back to work on Monday.  And so it starts again.  So let me put it into perspective… I struggle through the workday, I go home to nothing and I spend my weekends miserable and alone.  There’s nothing to look forward to and no relief anywhere.  It’s bad.</p>
<p>But no matter how bad things get, they can always get worse.  My biggest fear about work has come true.  I was told yesterday that my position has been eliminated and I my contract would be over the end of this month.  The ‘good’ news is, there’s another position available in a different department, but the pay is literally half as much as I’m making now.  It’s not quite as bad as being on unemployment, but damned close.  I could live on the lower pay, barely, but I won’t be able to get health insurance and I won’t be able to afford my medications out of pocket.  I know I need to stay on my medications, but it’s going to be a matter of spending the money for that, or paying rent and buying groceries.  Having my meds but living on the street isn’t an option, so I’m stuck.  There are no good options.</p>
<p>So I decided it was time.</p>
<p>Once I made the decision I felt at peace for the first time in years.  I wasn’t afraid; I’d been there before.  When I had my overdose the end of August I got an idea of what it’s like.  I took pills, and then there was nothingness.  For three days I just ceased to exist.  That time I eventually came back, but I knew what to expect.  I started putting together a plan.  As most bipolar people I have a medicine cabinet full of pills, so I started doing some research on the internet to find out which ones and which combinations I should use.  I decided that it should be a tranquilizer and my blood pressure medicine.  If I took enough of both I should just go to sleep and never wake up.  I started to write it all down; the misery and unhappiness that drove me to the decision, the plan on how to make it happen, and what I needed to do before I did to get and give closure to those that mattered.</p>
<p>That’s when I started to get scared.  Putting it down in black and white it was becoming real.  I’d come very close to dying with the last overdose and knew that this time it could be successful.  I started thinking about the real impact it would have on others.  The depression might tell me that the people I care about will be okay and eventually get over it, but my common sense told me that it would devastate those I love.  I have to believe that sooner or later my situation will get better.  If I can be patient I will eventually come out of my depression.  In spite of the pay cut, I do still have a job.  And the fact that my company wanted to hold on to me meant that even though I was struggling so hard to do my job I still had value.  There are other options for getting my medications, especially on such a low salary.  Insurance is another question, but even that has options.  I was afraid that no matter how bad I feel now, it would be a big mistake.</p>
<p>So I started to make a new plan.  I would take the new job and hope that the change in environment will make it easier to make it through my day.  I have a little bit of money in savings, and can get another month of medications until I can figure out another way.  And I had talked with my Therapist yesterday afternoon, and she suggested that I talked to the nurse-practitioner about cheaper alternatives to the meds I’m on.  I can look for a part time job after work and weekends to help bring in more money and limit my time alone.  And if I can carry enough hours, it may be possible to get benefits and take care of my insurance problem.  I might even make some new friends.</p>
<p>A drowning man will grab on to any flotsam and struggle to the very end to stay afloat.  If you’re starving you will eat unspeakable things to stay alive.  We have a built in survival mechanism that give us incredible strength to make it through the most deadly circumstances.  When faced with the ultimate decision to end it all, my will to survive kicked it and I pulled back from the abyss.  My life is hard, and is about to get harder, but it is life after all.  As hard as it may be, it’s still better than the alternative.  If I can only hold on I have to believe it will get better.  I’ve survived worse, and I can survive this.  I have to, for myself and for those I love.</p>
<p>I have decided I want to live.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Seven a.m.<br />
Sitting at my Mac,<br />
I check email,<br />
click on blog notices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Peter walks by.<br />
“What’s happening<br />
in the Blogosphere?”<br />
he says.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“Oh, <a href="http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/theres-something-about-mr-weebles/">Madame Weebles</a><br />
just got <a href="http://wordpress.com/#!/fresh/">Freshly Pressed</a>,<br />
<a href="http://clownonfire.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/a-clown-on-fire/">Le Clown</a> was featured<br />
on <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/profile-a-clown-on-fire/">The Daily Post</a>,<br />
<a href="http://clareflourish.wordpress.com">Clare</a> went to <a href="http://clareflourish.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/in-edinburgh/">Edinburgh</a>,<br />
<a href="http://brigittebanter.com">Brigitte</a> came back<br />
from <a href="http://brigittebanter.com/2012/10/08/monday-musings-motivations-part-twenty-five-home/">Woodstock</a>,<br />
and <a href="http://lameadventures.wordpress.com">LameAdventures</a><br />
is taking a <a href="http://lameadventures.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/lame-adventure-350-time-tales-at-the-grind/">break</a>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“That’s nice,” he says.<br />
Doesn&#8217;t know<br />
the details,<br />
but knows it’s<br />
important to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Each day starts<br />
with blogging.<br />
More than <i>writing</i> posts,<br />
I read,<br />
like,<br />
comment.<br />
reply.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sometimes, one comment,<br />
sometimes back and forth.<br />
It takes time<br />
for me and them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I don’t click “like”<br />
unless I’ve read the post.<br />
And I”d rather go<br />
to their website<br />
to click.<br />
It raises their hits.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I’ll write a poem,<br />
post a quote,<br />
compose an essay.<br />
Then go to my files.<br />
find the right shot,<br />
upload that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Or create a mandala<br />
on Painter,<br />
trying not<br />
to overload my readers<br />
with too many posts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I had no clue<br />
how much I’d enjoy a<br />
community of creatives.<br />
Writers,<br />
poets,<br />
artists,<br />
humorists,<br />
explorers<br />
of their inner<br />
and outer<br />
worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Social media?<br />
Yes,<br />
but not like Facebook<br />
and <em>not</em> like Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Blogging is people<br />
taking the time<br />
to write<br />
or photograph<br />
or paint<br />
their lives,<br />
their loves,<br />
their passions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It’s people<br />
finding others<br />
who share<br />
these lives,<br />
loves,<br />
passions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Or, learning<br />
about lives<br />
different<br />
from their own.<br />
My own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It’s richness<br />
in a<br />
smaller world.<br />
A world<br />
that will never<br />
be the same<br />
for me since<br />
I started my blog.</p>
<p>This poem and mandala are dedicated to all of you who share the blogosphere with me. To those who read and follow me and those who I read and follow. And to those who I have yet to meet. To all of you, thank you for this fabulous ride.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a blogger, why do you blog? What have you learned about yourself or others as a result of blogging? Is this experience what you thought it would be when you decided to start your blog? If not, how is it different?</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Cathy</p>
