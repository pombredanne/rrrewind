				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I grew up as a very adventurous person. My dad was a big time climber in our area and took me on many trips across California to some of the most well known climbing areas. Starting at a very young age my climbing shoes could fit in the palm of an adults hand. I was raised with a passion for granite and other form of rock and an even deeper passion for experiencing that rock from as high up as I could get! One of my dreams from childhood was to climb the face of El Capitan <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/el-capitan-57.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885 alignleft" alt="El-Capitan-57" src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/el-capitan-57.jpg?w=400&#038;h=266" width="400" height="266" /></a>in Yosemite Valley, CA. I was a seasoned Yosemite go-er as my family picked that location as our favorite vacation spot, spanning upward of 4 weeks a year in the valley. Each time I was there the daunting task of climbing the face, more particularly the nose, drew me closer and closer. My dad had climbed it multiple times before but he insisted on reminding me that he didn&#8217;t have an interest in doing it again, if I wanted to climb it then it was up to me to find a solid climbing partner who would take me up the approximated 3000 ft cliff.</p>
<p>Being head strong and already a BASE jumper at the age of 17 I agreed to the adventure and started to prepare for another dream come true with my boyfriend at the time Chris McNamara, who was a renowned big wall climber and had set the record for number of times up the face as well as the youngest team ascend at the age of 16 with his 14 year old brother.</p>
<p>With the ultimate amount of trust I jumped at the idea with no hesitation but with little idea as to what to expect. I had been a climber for about 13 years but about 10 of them I was just goofing off with my siblings and climbing whatever I could find with no regard to taking it seriously as a sport. The decision that was mutually made by Chris and I took way, starting me out practicing some techniques to help me through the climb which I had never tried before. With only a week and a half to prepare I decided to let go of most of my nervousness surrounding the climb and just trust that I knew what I was doing and that Chris, although our relationship was weak at the time, had both of our best interest in mind.</p>
<p>We arrived in the valley earlier than expected and decided to start the climb. My pack was almost heavier than I was and making my way up the short hike to the base of the climb was brutal. I just hoped the rest of the climb would be a little more fun filled. We started climbing and only made it about 400ft up before we had to set up our porta-ledge where we would be spending the night. Although starting early meant we added one additional night to the climb we were more than happy to embrace that.</p>
<p>The entire climbing experience was incredibly peaceful and some times too <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/10-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-881" alt="El Cap first stop " src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/10-1.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a>peaceful. Being a 2 person climbing group the majority of the trip was spent separated. Feeling a bit like isolation at times it really forced me to either quiet the voices in my head or let them take over and convince me to be scared. In the lower parts of the climb I was really petrified, shockingly so, that the thought of falling was constantly playing through myt head. As an experienced climber I was really bothered that the height was getting to me. But as I climbed further from the valley floor the less concerned I became about the height and the more blissful the entire experience was becoming. I remember at one point the only thing holding me to the rock were 2 bolts and nothing below me but my feet smeared to the rock and sheer granite all the way to the ground probably around 2,500 feet below. I remember thinking in that moment that I wanted to be scared at how exposed I was but instead I had this peaceful calm that said, if you fell here you would die so who cares.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/29.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-882" alt="sunset elcap " src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/29.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a>We spent 2 nights sleeping in our portable ledge, in our harnesses and anchored to the cliff. Both nights were spectacularly beautiful. Sunsets from a cliff can not be described, only felt. Like a burning sphere of beauty and hope preparing to rest in preparation for the next day. Once we neared the top there was one section where letting go of the safety of the rock and hanging above 3,000 feet of nothing was the next step. As directed by Chris I pushed off the wall as hard as I could and I saw myself separate from the wall by what seemed to be 30ft and I was sitting there, in mid air, nothing to my right or my left and nothing below me for what looked like ever. It took everything in my body to just relax and not <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-883" alt="20" src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a>tense up and hold my breath. It was terrifyingly awesome and I just sat there for a few minutes to admire the view, soak up the weird feeling of massive internal fulfillment but being surrounded by nothing. I made my way to the top and felt this massive form of respect for this life I had, for Chris helping me experience this and for my ability to just let go and fully experience it.</p>
<p>The hike down was less than exciting, it was incredibly painful having such a heavy pack and I heard my knees creek and grind with each downward step. On one small section rappelling down was one of the only ways and having a pack that weight almost as much as I did it took all of my core strength to not fall backwards and end up upside-down and as helpless as a turtle on its back. I remember the entire way down I couldn&#8217;t help but think, man it would be so much easier to just jump off now.</p>
<p>When we reached the bottom we were greeted by my mom whom had been watching us make the climb through binoculars at the bottom of the cliff along with one of her friends. We sat in the field directly below the cliff and I was just in awe that my dream had finally come true, and I was exhausted from the whole experience.</p>
<p>The entire adventure really helped me realize that each and every day there are a million small things that can stress me out or prevent me from staying true to my path and really going for it. But if I just let go of the control, trust myself and the people I surround myself with and focus 100% on enjoying the process but visualizing the end result, then not only will it all work out but it will exceed my expectations. It really opened my eyes to the possibilities of how we can have the choice, to decide what dictates our outcome. Our fears, limitations and the small stresses in life, or our drive, desire and zest for life. Making the conscious choice to rappel the negative and small things and soak up the positive and good in this life was one of the most critical choices I have ever made and has by far been the most impactful on all of my future experiences. I have encountered thousands of limiting factors in my life and hundreds of people who have tried to keep me from my dreams but understanding the simple fact that I have the power over my emotional response to them is what has helped aid me to get where I am today.</p>

<hr />
<h2><em>Guest post by Robin Wasserman</em></h2>
<p>I’ve never been the kind of person who believes in ghosts, and by the time I hit seventeen, I’d conquered or outgrown (or, in the case of the junior-high-school bully who mercifully dropped out after ninth grade, outlasted) most of the things that used to keep me awake at night: fear of fire, fear of kidnapping, fear of food fights (don’t ask)—I’d even managed to put the fear of loneliness at bay, after finally making a few for-real, for-life friends.</p>
<p>So most of what haunted my nightmares (and frequent schooltime naps) that year was the fear—okay, call it abject terror—that I wouldn’t get into the college I wanted, or wouldn’t get into any college at all, or would be a failure at life and end up living out my days in my parents&#8217; basement…you get the idea. A lot of time was spent studying for the SATs and pouring through “How to get into college” books and scribbling “Brown” and “Yale” in my notebooks the way other people scribbled the names of their beloved. There may have been little pink hearts involved, and a lot of creative visualization involving fat envelopes and mailboxes. None of it’s that interesting and I’ve already written more about it than anyone could ever want to read (including a whole vaguely autobiographical novel, <a href="http://www.robinwasserman.com/hackingharvard.html" target="_blank">if you find yourself that curious</a>). So I’m not going to write about that today.</p>
<p>I’m going to write about the other thing that haunted me, if by haunted you mean occupied my ever waking thoughts and tormented me with thoughts of what-might-have-been and terrors of what-could-become.</p>
<p>That thing is: My hair.</p>
<p>Anyone who talks to me for more than, say, twenty minutes, will notice that I’m extremely, some might say exceedingly, vain about my hair. Which is embarrassing. Not to mention weird, since I’m the kind of person who’s usually too lazy to wear makeup and has been known to occasionally forget she’s wearing pajamas when she leaves the apartment.</p>
<p>What you wouldn’t know, if you’ve only known me for twenty minutes (although give me the slightest opening and another couple hours and you’ll soon learn more than you ever wanted to know on the subject), is that my obsession with my hair has spanned thirty years and most of those were spent in such cringe-worthy, camera-breaking, Cousin-It-resembling hair hell that I don’t think you could blame me if I spent all my time now gazing in the mirror thanking the universe that I finally conquered my demons.</p>
<p>(You think I’m exaggerating. But wait, there will be pictures. )</p>
<p>I was blissfully unaware of the problem until age five, when, blithely wandering through an apartment building with my traditional summer bowl cut, I got the well-meaning compliment no girl wants to hear: “What an adorable little boy!”</p>
<p>So much for the bowl cut.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13783" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 1" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-1.jpg?w=265&#038;h=351" width="265" height="351" /></p>
<p>I spent the fourteen years after that growing out my hair into an indescribably hideous nest of curls, desperately trying to turn my hair into the kind of hair I saw on TV and, as far as I could tell, on the head of every single popular girl in the history of popular girls: long, silky, and (with a few impossibly un-frizzy exceptions) straight. I brought in magazine clippings for a long series of beleaguered hairdressers; I tried every anti-frizz product on the shelf. I poured over <i>Sassy</i> and <i>Seventeen</i> and <i>YM</i>, desperate for hair-straightening techniques, none of which worked. I sat for innumerable bad pictures and cringed every time I saw myself on the home video screen.</p>
<p>Then there was the hat phase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13784" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 2" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-2.jpg?w=223&#038;h=360" width="223" height="360" /></p>
<p>The less said about that, the better.</p>
<p>I got the obligatory junior high nickname (“afro girl”); I got jealous at every sleepover party while the other girls combed and crimped and French braided and I sat against a wall reading a book. I got knots. Lots of knots, and occasionally, I got them cut out.</p>
<div id="attachment_13785" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13785" alt="(This poor girl is about to face her first ever game of Spin the Bottle. Pray for her.)" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=576" width="300" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(This poor girl is about to face her first-ever game of Spin the Bottle. Pray for her.)</p></div>
<p>I got increasingly convinced that my hair was at the root of all my problems.</p>
<p>That if I could just make my hair better, make it <i>right</i>, everything else would follow. I’d get popular. I’d get a boyfriend. I’d get everything I wanted in life, everything that seemed to come so easily to everyone else.</p>
<p>I now think that everyone had something like this, some scapegoat for all their problems—<i>If only I were skinnier, If only I were taller, If only I had bigger boobs or a smaller nose or clearer skin or straighter teeth</i>—and we all conveniently ignore the fact that there are plenty of people with smaller boobs or bigger noses or more zits who are also making out with their boyfriends at every party in town. The only other girl in my school with hair precisely as crappy as mine had about a million friends and was a varsity athlete, but this is something I chose to ignore. Because I needed to believe there was <i>something</i> that would be an easy fix, even if—maybe especially if—it was something I couldn’t have. I needed to believe that all of the things I was miserable about made some logical sense.</p>
<p>If I was lonely and sad and bored and scared because I had terrible hair, then at least there was a <i>reason</i>. And at least there was a possibility that someday things would get better. That if I tried hard enough, I would eventually come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Which is maybe why, one spring day junior year, a couple days after I turned seventeen and ONE DAY before taking my official senior yearbook photo (the photo that would also end up in my college freshman facebook and thus follow me for BASICALLY THE REST OF MY LIFE), I made a drastic decision.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13786" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 4" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-4.jpg?w=400&#038;h=239" width="400" height="239" /></p>
<p>Yes, some girls would get a pixie cut.</p>
<p>I got a poodle cut.</p>
<p>This may be the only wild and crazy thing I did over the entire course of my teenage years. (And okay, I’m aware that it doesn’t even register on the wild and crazy scale, but it seemed pretty nuts at the time.)</p>
<p>It was a bad idea, and seventeen turned out to be a <i>really</i> bad hair year, but it was also the turning point. As if cutting it all off had managed to reboot the system, my hair grew back…different. Instead of the knotted, frizzy, dried-out mess that had been seventeen years in the making, I had a clean slate, untangled and for the most part, unbattered by the elements. (The elements being my incompetence and that of the fine folks at the Haircuttery.) Year by year, haircut by haircut (always, <i>always</i> a tiny, undramatic trim), it got better. Which I’m pretty sure would never have happened if I hadn’t made the stupidest, most reckless decision of my entire hair life.</p>
<p>There’s probably a metaphor in there somewhere, but I’m not groping at some kind of existential life lesson here. I’m talking hair, pure and simple. It’s probably true that a good hair day won’t change your life.</p>
<p>But trust me, when you’ve been waiting as long as I waited, that first one you ever have feels like it will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of &#8216;love refugees&#8217; in Norway.</p>
<p>When I meet other expat couples, particularly <a href="http://edgeofthearctic.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/unexpected-adventures-of-a-trailing-spouse/">trailing spouses like myself,</a> we usually ask eachother how we ended up in Norway. It always comes down to one thing: our partners. They are either Norwegian (who are great at falling in love overseas) or our partners aren’t natives but followed their careers here, bringing their families in tow.</p>
<p>There is an immediate camaraderie among expats. In leaving our comfort zones to see the world, we’ve all done something very brave.</p>
<p>Moving to Norway was a big decision for my husband and I. The opportunity popped up out of nowhere and it took a lot of research before we could make an informed decision to move to a place that we hadn’t even considered as a vacation spot.</p>
<blockquote class="pull alignright"><p>Once you’ve landed overseas, the strength of your relationship is put to the test and you find that you have to rely on eachother in ways that other couples don’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Autumn of 2011 was a tumultuous time for us. With each step that brought us closer to a life in Norway – putting our London flat on the rental market or giving notice at work – we wondered if we were making the right choice. If one of us became overwhelmed about what was ahead, the other would toughen up for the leap of faith that was taking us to Oslo.</p>
<p>One could say that it was faith in Norway that brought us here. Before we moved, we had a five-day reconnaissance trip during which we had to learn everything we could about the local lifestyle before the decision was official. We realized that there was no way to know whether it was going to work out unless we gave it a try, so that’s what we did.</p>
<p>That leap of faith was one that my husband and I also took in eachother. Although we factored quality of life and cost of living into our decision to leave a comfortable home in Britain, a big part of that decision was whether we, as a couple, could make this expat adventure a success.</p>
<p>When you move abroad with your partner, both of you are stripped of your network of family and friends and the safety of familiar surroundings. Once you’ve landed overseas, the strength of your relationship is put to the test and you find that you have to rely on eachother in ways that other couples don’t. Since moving to Norway, my husband is all I’ve got. When I had sinusitis last fall, we couldn’t count on my mom to come by with a big pot of food to help us get through the week. And when my husband was working 80-hour weeks last spring, I couldn’t pass the time by dropping by my brothers’ place to hang out with my nephews and gossip with my sister-in-law. All of those people are 4,109 miles away.</p>
<p>So while I’m in Oslo, my husband fills all of those roles for me. He plays Super Mario Brothers with me when I miss my nephews, and I in turn indulge him by watching the Batman movies for the third time around because he can’t watch them with his brother.</p>
<p>But if we’re all of the sudden getting on eachother’s nerves (like all healthy couples should, every so often), there’s really no escape. If one of us tried to get some space, the other would be left in the lurch, so we don’t do this often.</p>
<p><a href="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/norway_640.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1149" alt="Norway flag heart" src="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/norway_640.png?w=150&#038;h=112" width="150" height="112" /></a>It’s this precise aspect of expathood that people who are still in their comfort zones, surrounded by their usual support network, can’t understand. It’s the reason my husband and I don’t answer the phone when we’re watching a movie or exploring the rest of Europe, or when one of us is just having a bad day.</p>
<p>Only our fellow expats truly understand what it’s like to live in Norway, far from everything familiar (and warm). From this camaraderie a wonderful little community of has emerged. Newcomers seek the wisdom of those who came before them. Those of us who have lived here awhile are finally able to ‘pay it forward’ and help those that are fresh off the boat. And then there are expats who have been here for 10, 15 or even 20 years. These are our north stars.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://edgeofthearctic.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/a-love-letter-celebrating-my-first-year-in-oslo/">been in Oslo 16 months</a> and I feel that I’m at a turning point. Without realizing it I’ve become a part of a communit<span style="color:#000000;">y and have even been able to offer guidance to a few new arrivals. The most important advice isn&#8217;t anything I tell them, it&#8217;s simply that I&#8217;m still here and enjoying every day of it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Summer I wrote about a pair of <a title="Cute baby deer" href="http://theeffstop.com/2012/09/08/growing-up-at-the-elks-lodge/">whitetail fawns</a> growing up in the field beyond the local Elks Lodge. The Lodge sits on one side of a hollow at the base of Pine Mountain, my house is at the top of the mountain,  and my road meanders down the side opposite from the Lodge. There is a large whitetail herd and it&#8217;s not uncommon to see the same deer at any spot along the mountain.</p>
<div id="attachment_3530" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-124014.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3530" alt="This is a shot of the friendly fawn from last summer." src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-124014.jpg?w=584&#038;h=437" width="584" height="437" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is a shot of the friendly fawn from last summer.</p></div>
<p>Over the years I have photographed a doe that is easily recognized by a thin white strip on just above her black nose. She is friendly and curious about me and tolerates me approaching her to take photos. I respect her space and back off if she shows any sign of concern. Last year she had two fawns &#8211; one with a black nose and one with a white stripe that had a wide spot in the center. Like it&#8217;s momma, the one with the white stripe had no concern about my presence and was actually very curious.</p>
<div id="attachment_3527" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123957.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3527" alt="This shot gives a clearer picture of the marking in the fawn's nose." src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123957.jpg?w=584&#038;h=437" width="584" height="437" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This shot gives a clearer picture of the marking in the fawn&#8217;s nose.</p></div>
<p>That original doe was one of triplets and was the only one with the white mark. Her sister still stays close and is not at all friendly. She starts snorting almost as soon as I leave my jeep. That friendly doe has had two sets of twins and only one of those has a white stripe and only that one is really friendly like she is. The others have been very cautious and quick to run off. Last year I was lucky to get so close to the friendly fawn on several occasions.</p>
<div id="attachment_3521" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123924.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3521" alt="The tail tucked and low like this indicates no sense of alarm. Whitetails use their tails like flags when alarmed - the rest of the herd can spot them in the woods when the have it raised so the white hairs show." src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123924.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The tail tucked and low like this indicates no sense of alarm. Whitetail use their tails like flags when alarmed &#8211; the rest of the herd can spot them in the woods when the have it raised so the white hairs show.</p></div>
<p>I watched a documentary about the domestication of wolves &#8211; the forefathers of dogs. Humans and wolves have always interacted &#8211; wolves feeding off of livestock or the trash of people. In a pack of wolves there is usually one or two who are bolder around humans. These wolves are the ones who make friends with humans and by doing so they can secure food and comfort for the pack &#8211; they are like ambassadors. Scientists have found that these dogs share a genetic marker and they call it the friendliness gene. This marker is also found in domesticated dogs today.</p>
<p>Not that this has anything to do with whitetail deer, but it got me thinking about why some deer are curious and some are flighty. The deer have no need to befriend me for food. I do find it an interesting coincidence that all of the deer in our small herd who are comfortable and even curious about me and my camera seem to have a similar white stripe on their nose &#8211; is it nature or nurture? Does the original doe&#8217;s boldness embolden some of her fawns?</p>
<div id="attachment_3524" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123945.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3524" alt="Notice how the doe has no concern or alarm, she even turns her back on me when her fawn is nearby." src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-123945.jpg?w=584&#038;h=437" width="584" height="437" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Notice how the doe has no concern or alarm, she even turns her back on me when her fawn is nearby.</p></div>
<p>Of course winter comes and the whitetail move deep into the hollow. I put my thoughts about this friendly trait away for winter. The deer stay away from the field once hunting season opens and have yet to make an appearance there this year. I have seen a couple on the roadside running into the woods, so they are on the move.</p>
<p>A couple of days I saw a deer ahead of me on the road. It didn&#8217;t bolt &#8211; it just looked my way and walked leisurely into the woods. I pulled up along side and it looked over its shoulder at me&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_3515" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-121157.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3515" alt="Unconcerned with me or my noisy jeep, this yearling looked at me." src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-121157.jpg?w=584&#038;h=737" width="584" height="737" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Unconcerned with me or my noisy jeep, this yearling looked at me.</p></div>
<p>I stayed in the jeep &#8211; opened the passenger window and snapped a few shots. I was taken aback by how long the young whitetail looked at me and at its calm demeanor. And then I saw it&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-121924.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3518" alt="20130321-121924.jpg" src="http://theeffstop.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130321-121924.jpg?w=584&#038;h=601" width="584" height="601" /></a>This was not any yearling, this was my friendly fawn. No wonder it showed no concern for me, it knows me. It survived the winter in the hollow and is now roaming over the hills.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to catch up with old friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The following includes descriptions, photos, and video that may serve as a trigger for victims of sexual violence.<br />
Please be advised. </em></p>
<p>Someone asked me today, &#8220;What is &#8216;rape culture&#8217; anyway? I&#8217;m tired of hearing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I hear ya. I&#8217;m tired of talking about it. But I&#8217;m going to keep talking about it because people like you keep asking that question.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and though there are dozens of witnesses, no one says, &#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and though there are dozens of witnesses, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">they can&#8217;t get anyone to come forward</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and adults are informed of it, but no consequences are doled out because the boys &#8220;said nothing happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and we later find out that t<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/173387/verdict-steubenville-shows-bond-between-jock-culture-and-rape-culture#">heir coaches were &#8220;joking about it&#8221; and &#8220;took care of it.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and even though there is documentation of the coaching staff sweeping it under the rug,<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/18/meet_reno_saccoccia_steubenvilles_head_football_coach/"> they get to keep their jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and one of the coaches involved in the cover-up <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/01/inside-anonymous-hacking-file-steubenville-rape-crew/60502/">threatens a reporter </a>- saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to get yours. And if you don&#8217;t get yours, somebody close to you will.&#8221; &#8211; but the town is more worried about keeping their coaching talent than his integrity.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, take pictures of the process, and it becomes a source of ridicule along social networks, whitewashing the crime with hashtags.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>[Note: Initially, there was an image of two young men holding up an unconscious young girl by the arms and legs. The image has been widely circulated, and its inclusion here was an attempt to find a silver lining in this survivor's tragedy by prompting aversion and self-reflection in the reader, as well as to demonstrate the egregious nature of the crime. However, after measured conversations in the comments section and via email, I have chosen to take it down. It's not my choice to make.]</em></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and then joke about it on video &#8211; saying, &#8220;“She is so raped,” “They raped her quicker than Mike Tyson!”, “They raped her more than the Duke lacrosse team!”, and she was “deader than Trayvon Martin.” &#8211; while everyone else laughs. (Warning: this video will make you sick to your stomach.)</p>

<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/14749/the_problem_with_social_media_in_steubenville/">the town is more concerned with preserving their football program</a> than the fact that their children are attacking others without remorse.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and the mainstream media laments the fact that their &#8220;<a href="http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students">promising futures</a>&#8221; have been dashed by their crimes &#8211; as though THEY are the victims.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and even though she&#8217;s been through enough, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html?ir=Media">the 16 year old victim&#8217;s name is shared on national television.</a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, but because it happens at a party where both sexes were drinking, complete strangers on the internet argue ferociously that she is to blame for being attacked.<em></em></p>

<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and members of the community issue death threats against the victim.</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/death-threats.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-240" alt="death threats" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/death-threats.png?w=300&#038;h=168" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and it is documented across social media channels, and the media informs us that <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/14749/the_problem_with_social_media_in_steubenville/">the takeaway is to be more careful about what we post to social media</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and when a cover-up is exposed by a group of hackers, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/01/inside-anonymous-hacking-file-steubenville-rape-crew/60502/">we call them &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and the culpable &#8220;victims.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m talking about Steubenville. Tired of hearing about it? Ok, let&#8217;s talk about something else.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when the Steubenville is far from the first instance of athletic clubs covering up sexual violence allegations. See: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-01/ex-penn-state-president-charged-with-sandusky-cover-up">Sandusky</a>, <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/10/07/impunity-for-college-athletes-who-rape/">Michigan State 2010</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/jk-v-arizona-board-regents">Arizona State 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice-womens-rights/simpson-v-university-colorado">University of Colarado 2006</a>, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5027393/university-of-iowa-athletic-staff-conspired-to-cover-up-a-sexual-assault">University of Iowa 2008</a>, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8853980">Lincoln High School 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/sports/ncaafootball/handling-of-sexual-assault-claims-brings-new-scrutiny-to-montana.html?pagewanted=all">University of Montana 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-marquette-sex-cases-20111028,0,4057558.story">Marquette 2011</a>, plus <a href="http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/athletes.html">this research</a> (and there&#8217;s more to find if you dig)</p>
<p>Rape culture is when universities across the country do not report rape to the police, but handle the matter via &#8220;honor boards&#8221; - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/03/12/why-should-colleges-judge-rape-accusations/rape-is-a-crime-treat-it-as-such">ultimately shielding perpetrators from criminal consequences</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when universities threaten to expel a student for speaking out about her rape (without ever identifying her attacker) <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/unc-student-risks-expulsion-public-alleged-rape/story?id=18609150">because it&#8217;s harassment to talk about her suffering</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/daniel-toshs-rape-joke-defended-by-comedians-2012127">a comedian has a long history of making jokes about rape and sexual assault</a>, is defended from backlash by the comic community, and doesn&#8217;t lose his fan base.</p>
<p>Rape culture is <a href="http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/change-in-action-heather-l-barmore/2013/03/18/the-rape-culture-we-create/">when a journalist says this</a> &#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that the entire conversation is wrong. I don’t want anybody to be telling women anything. I don’t want men to be telling me what to wear and how to act, not to drink. And I don’t, honestly, want you to tell me that I needed a gun in order to prevent my rape. In my case, don’t tell me if I’d only had a gun, I wouldn’t have been raped. Don’t put it on me to prevent the rape.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ForAmerica">the public responds with this</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-238" alt="rape" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when politicians don&#8217;t understand how <a href="http://fatlip.leoweekly.com/2013/02/08/kathy-stein-highlights-the-exceptionally-sadistic-nature-of-kentuckys-ultrasound-bill/">requiring a transvaginal ultrasound of a rape victim seeking an abortion is like raping her all over again</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when political candidates say that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/richard-mourdock-rape-comment-puts-romney-defense/story?id=17552263">God sometimes intends rape</a>, and that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/roger-rivard-reelection-wisconsin-assembly_n_2089654.html">some girls just &#8220;rape easy,&#8221;</a> and that <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79864.html">&#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; does not result in pregnancy</a>&#8230; and do not lose the backing of their party or party leaders.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/03/cpac-where-ashley-judd-rape-jokes-happen">a speaker at a political convention makes a rape joke</a> about a sexual violence victim advocate, and he brings the house down with laughter.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when we <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/dating-blog/protect-yourself-from-rape">spend all our time telling women to avoid being raped by modifying their behavior</a>, inferring blame back onto the victim.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when stunning displays of privilege and willful ignorance combine to create this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONFUSION &#8211; NO, ALL MEN ARE NOT RAPISTS.<br />
THE FOLLOWING AD IS A REPREHENSIBLE ATTEMPT BY AN MRA GROUP TO UNDERMINE PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE ON RAPE CULTURE BY FALSELY ASSOCIATING IT WITH INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>WE GOOD? GOOD. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/voice-for-men.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-243" alt="voice for MEN" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/voice-for-men.jpg?w=294&#038;h=380" width="294" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/no-rape-culture.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-246" alt="no rape culture" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/no-rape-culture.png?w=490&#038;h=291" width="490" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a woman speaks out about rape culture, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-EvJkimRZyTT3pJcXBiVGRmdzQ/edit?pli=1">and gets subjected to this</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when we see ads like these on a far too frequent basis:</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belvedere-ad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-245" alt="belvedere ad" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belvedere-ad.jpg?w=490&#038;h=452" width="490" height="452" /></a> <a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape-jump.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-244" alt="rape jump" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape-jump.jpg?w=490&#038;h=275" width="490" height="275" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gross.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-247" alt="gross" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gross.jpg?w=490&#038;h=306" width="490" height="306" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/friendzonedrink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-248" alt="friendzonedrink" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/friendzonedrink.jpg?w=490&#038;h=490" width="490" height="490" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dominos.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-249" alt="dominos" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dominos.png?w=490&#038;h=305" width="490" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when you&#8217;re tired of hearing about &#8220;rape culture&#8221; because it makes you uncomfortable, as your attempt to silence discourse on the subject means we never raise enough awareness to combat it &#8211; <em><strong>and that&#8217;s part of why it sticks around.</strong></em></p>
<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re tired of hearing about it. But I wouldn&#8217;t expect us to shut up anytime soon. Nor should we.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> I will no longer be publishing comments which caveat the discussion of rape culture with false rape accusation concerns. There is a reason for this, <a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/why-i-wont-publish-your-comments-about-false-rape-accusations/">which you can read here</a>. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Lilah,</p>
<p>You are WAY past nine months old now. In fact, you are ten months old, as of yesterday. But, as you know, your mother is nothing if she isn’t a total slacker. It isn’t that I don’t enjoy writing letters to you. Really. It is that between you insisting on trying to pound away at my laptop while I am doing so, and the miniscule amount of time I have without you attached to me, I am unable to do a whole lot of anything these days.</p>
<p>You are getting so big. I was at one of my check-up appointments the other day and there was a woman there with a baby who she “claimed” was 8 weeks old and weighed 11 pounds and I could barely remember you being that tiny ( say “claimed” because I swear to Cheesus, that baby was so small. SO SMALL). You are so full of personality now and you really are a little person and not at all like that little meatloaf that you were when we brought you home from the hospital. It is so strange to think you have changed so much. And also to think that, in just a few months, we will have another meatloaf. And this time it will have a tiny penis. Weird. Anyway, you shouldn’t concern yourself with such things. You just concentrate on being super cute and deliberately spitting on everything in a 20 foot radius of you.</p>
<p>You are not a crawler. And not because you can’t, mind you, but because having to crawl to get somewhere really pisses you off. I wonder if I am the only mom out there scratching her head on this one. I have seen you do it and I know that you are capable, but yet, for some reason, you would rather get in baby plank pose, scoot yourself about a foot backwards and then get super angry and start to screech. I am not as worried that you are behind in development as that you are going to be lazy until your brother is born and then take giant leaps when I don’t have the time or the energy to pad the entire house for you to fall all over.</p>
<p>You say things like “mama” and “dada” but I am pretty sure you don’t yet know that you are saying our respective names. Your dad, however, insists that you say “duck” when it is bath time. (You do have a rubber duckie or two that we have in there with you when Daddy bathes you, but I am not sure that I buy that you are yet calling them ducks. Not because I think you are a dummy, but because I haven’t heard this and your dad has a hearing problem. Meaning he hears what he wants to. And this applies to everyone, not just you.)</p>
<p>You love eating. You are indiscriminate completely about food unless I try to give you peas. Peas and carrots? “Sure, Mom! Bring it!” Peas by themselves? “No way, Mom, get that shit out of my face.” You should know that peas are delicious and you should eat them. Don’t listen to your dad when he talks about how gross they are. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. You especially love strawberries, pears, and green grapes. All three of my favorite fruits. And we have them just about every day for a snack together and it is really amusing for me to watch you master your dexterity and pick up tiny pieces of slimy stuff. Half of the time, most of it ends up in your lap, but I enjoy watching you stuff your face on the off-chance that you make it in there. (You are totally getting good at it, though. At first, I doubted that you had gotten ANY fruit into your mouth, now I only find a couple of slivers in your lap and on the floor…Good work, my love.)</p>
<p>You are still a really weird sleeper. We attempted to do this thing called “sleep training” wherein your father and I would train you about when and how to sleep on your own. What ended up happening was that you ended up training me and your father on how to sleep with you wrapped around our faces. We are about to start this process again because it is really important to me to have you in your own bed/room before your brother gets here and keeps me up all night.  In fairness (to me), it would have been pointless to go full force with sleep training if we were just going to uproot you, which we just did when we moved to this new house. So…yeah. I don’t suck as much as it might seem.</p>
<p>You are also working on getting tooth number 7. And let me tell you, Lilah, teething is a total bitch and you OWE me for this. Like, when you turn 18, you are going to need to buy me a kitten for each tooth that you have. Okay, that’s not a good idea. But I will think of something for you to do. Because this shit is DUMB. (And also makes your sleeping WORSE. Yes. That is possible, it would appear.)</p>
<p>So, again, I am sorry that I was a slack ass during your ninth month, but we had a lot going on. I mean, be for real, we had to move so that we had room for your brother and so that you didn’t catch disobedience and general badness from your cousin. I’m just saying. By the time you read this, you will know exactly what I mean. No need to get too involved.  Either way, your father and I are very proud of you. You crack us up every day and you are so effing cute with your growing front teeth and your chubby, delicious cheeks. We can’t get enough of you. You are the love of my life. Duh.</p>
<p>Love always,</p>
<p>Mom</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rumors you&#8217;ve been hearing. They&#8217;re true.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Salad cancels out bacon. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2>The Salad-Cancels-Out-Bacon Rule</h2>
<p>This logic is derived from a spectrum of proven theories, derived as follows, in a highly scien-matical, derive-atory way:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. First, we establish that the <strong><em>ratio of bacon to salad</em></strong> is the same, that is:</p>
<p><strong><em>bacon:salad = true</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p>We can now proceed in applying the laws of cross-multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>2. In particular, we make use of the cross-cancellation laws, such that:<br />
<strong style="font-style:italic;">bacon/salad * salad/bacon = 1</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>3. Because we slash-ed-ed both the <strong><em>bacon </em></strong>and<em> </em><strong><em>salad </em></strong>factors like they&#8217;re imaginary, we&#8217;re obligated to multiply our remainder by <em><strong>i</strong></em> (the infamous &#8220;imaginary number&#8221;). Like this:</p>
<p><strong><em>      1 * i </em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>4. And <strong><em>i</em></strong>, being imaginary and all, stands for nothing tangible, therefore:<br />
<strong><em>i =</em></strong><em> <strong>0   </strong>carried through as<strong>   1 * 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>5. As everyone knows, anything multiplied by zero = 0  therefore expressed as,</p>
<p><i>      </i><em><strong>1 * i</strong><strong> = 0    </strong></em>or<em><strong>   1 * 0 = 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>6. To conclude and prove that</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;line-height:1.625;"><em>salad cancels out bacon</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">See Mr. Willet? I WAS paying attention in AP Calculus. </span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">And heck! You were right. I DID find a practical application for this math stuff.</span></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the cable car to take us to the top of Mount Korek, I’m stunned by the beauty that surrounds me. Bright white snow-capped mountains are all around. They glisten in the sunshine and despite the sub-zero temperatures give off a warm glow. And all is peaceful.  A sharp contrast, I imagine, to 20 years ago,  when gunfire must have echoed among these mountains and blood stained the snow.<a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignright" id="i-164" alt="Me at the top of Mount Korek" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg?w=244&#038;h=244" width="244" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>But this no longer the battleground of Iraqi Kurds and Saddam Hussein’s regime. Thanks in part to a no-fly zone put in place 21 years ago, during the first Iraq war, and the more recent US-led invasion of 2003, some tranquillity has returned. The fall of the former dictator has given a once-persecuted people the security to rebuild and develop this now semi-autonomous region.</p>
<p>Much safer than the south, northern Iraq has even become popular as a tourist destination for Iranians and Turks and those living in the South of he country. The cable car is just one of many new ventures.</p>
<p>As we ascend the steel cable, my guide Dr. Douglas Layton explains how the area has come to be called “the other Iraq”. “So much was demolished by Saddam Hussein” he says.  4.500 villages, 95% of the region. There were no eggs in the bazaar because the chickens had all been killed. Nothing. Nothing, but a little fuel, and a few cars. “</p>
<p>Now though, he says it’s <strong><em>emerging from the ashes.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-168" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg?w=273&#038;h=273" width="273" height="273" /></a>We are the first to try out the cable car and when we reach the top,  the technicians are revelling in their triumph. The generator thawed, the cable car worked and all is ready to receive the first group of tourists. Out comes the celebratory sweet tea to warm us up.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that anyone might choose to go to Iraq on their holidays, but last year the north of the country attracted 2 million visitors. The government hopes that will rise to 5 million this year.</p>
<p>Since it opened the doors to domestic and foreign investment in 2006, billions of dollars have been pouring into the region. A newly-built state of the art airport in the capital Erbil and around 500 hotels now await their visitors. From the viewing platform at Mount Korek, half-built ski chalets line the horizon.</p>
<p>But as Douglas tells me, the outside world is still not convinced it’s safe to come here.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 465px"><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg"><img class=" wp-image " id="i-171" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg?w=455&#038;h=303" width="455" height="303" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">© Ryan Youngblood</p></div>
<p>It is not surprising when you consider the continuing disputes over oil and borders. As we sip tea and admire the views,  200 km south in Kirkuk a building, belonging to a group of elderly Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, is blown to pieces by a suicide bomber.  Their armchairs were ripped apart by the blast, their playing cards stuck to the blood on the floor.</p>
<p>When such incidents make international news headlines, it does not help the tourist board trying to sell the rest of Kurdistan as a safe and beautiful part of the world. But our drive back towards Erbil IS beautiful. We pass sweet stalls, families barbequeing, couples cuddling beneath waterfalls and children throwing snowballs at each other. Huge icicles hang down from the rocky canyon above us.</p>
<p>Below us we can see the original Hamilton road, built by a New Zealand engineer in the 1920s. Winding its way through the mountains it’s a miracle the project  was ever finished. Before even beginning to chisel and dynamite his way through the rocks, Archibald Hamilton had to unite the feuding tribesmen who’d been recruited to work for him.</p>
<p>I wonder what he would make of the melting pot that is Iraqi Kurdistan now. A mixture of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen – Christians and Muslims – who for the most part tell me, they live peacefully side by side.</p>
<p>Ten years after the invasion, this region and its people are moving on.</p>
<div>
<p>Perhaps the mountains are not the Kurds&#8217; only friends.. as the proverb says. Perhaps they are making new ones. New friends from the south, in search of peace and friends from further afield &#8211; keen to hit the open Hamilton road and discover the place they call “the other Iraq”.</p>
