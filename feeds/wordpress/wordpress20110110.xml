			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was 8 years old my family moved across town in Kansas City and found a lovely house that sat above the first hole of an executive (shortened) 9 hole golf course. Â Like most kids that age, I was playing soccer, baseball, basketball, and tennis. Â Later I even tried football. I was doing way too much but my parents were just trying to test out what I enjoyed and fit me best. Â My grandparents that year bought me my first set of golf clubs to try out this new sport. Â Thankfully we had a tremendous local junior golf program and I began that journey.</p>
<p>I was truly Â hooked at 11 when I played my first golf tournament outside of that course. Â It was the United Commercial Travelers Junior Golf Tournament qualifier for the state of Missouri. Â It was a mere 9 hold qualifier and the night before the area received a lot of rain, which discouraged many players from even showing up. Â The field ended up being about a dozen golfers qualifying to go to the national tournament in Victoria, British Columbia. Â I can&#8217;t even remember what I scored that day but it was enough to earn the victory and get a free trip to Canada for the tournament. Â My dad accompanied me on that memorable trip.</p>
<p><strong>I remember thinking, &#8220;Wow, all golf tournaments must be like this. Â Winning is pretty awesome.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I remember not playing very well in Canada but what it did do is hook me into the game and I began quitting other sports. Â The person who taught me golf told me I had to either quit baseball or golf, my swing would be mess unless I did so. Â My summers became filled with traveling around Missouri and Kansas, playing in golf tournaments and spending endless hours practicing on the driving range and putting green. Â Golf to me was perfect for my personality at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Individual.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me versus the course. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Me versus the others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It thought it was perfect.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_257" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://davidmschroeder.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img0581.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-257" title="img058" src="http://davidmschroeder.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img0581.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My college days playing for The University of Evansville</p></div>
<p>When high school came along I played on the school team. Â For the first time in my life I was part of a team. Â A golf team? Â It is an individual sport, right? Â If you have seen The Ryder Cup or The President&#8217;s Cup you usually witness a spirit among those players that is unlike any other time in their individual tournaments. Â You will see high fives and cheers for each other in individual matches to succeed as well as select formats of two-man best ball and alternate shot. Â In team golf there are still individual awards for lowest score but the most important prize goes to the team that wins.</p>
<p><strong>I was hooked.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout high school and eventually in college golf I was a moderate success on an individual basis. Â There are 5-6 players that play in tournaments and I was usually the #3-#5 player. Â I don&#8217;t recall any major wins individually but I do remember every big win our team made. Â Even on a day I had a double-eagle in a high school tournament, what was more prominent is that our team, The Webster Groves High School &#8220;Statesmen&#8221; won that tournament and eventually went on to the state championship tournament. Â I was elected Captain of the team so it was my duty and pleasure to celebrate that feat. Â It felt amazing.</p>

<p>Life is individual. Â It is your life to live. Â But you can&#8217;t live it alone and you surely cannot succeed without others. Â Even most professional golfers have a team of people with them to motivate, teach, and even just listen to them. Â Most of us in our jobs today work on an individual basis. Â That mentality is wrong. Â Look at any successful person in life and you&#8217;ll discover their teams.</p>
<p>I love the teams I&#8217;m a part of today: Â <a href="http://www.ThomasNelson.com">Thomas Nelson Publishers</a> where I work, my church, <a href="http://www.stbs.net/">St. Bartholomews</a>, my men&#8217;s group, my close friends from Young Life, friends in Kansas City, St. Louis, Evansville, and Nashville, and I would be lost as can be without my family.</p>
<p>My last hole in my college golf was memorable. Â I duck-hooked my drive into a lake and ended up with double-bogey. Â I remember being mad at my self because I felt like I let the team down.</p>
<p>But you know what, I graduated a semester early and later the team won a big tournament that spring. That is what I remember most. Â I&#8217;ll take the Ryder Cup competition any day.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your teams. </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>PS I don&#8217;t know what it is but these lines from the crass movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/">Team America: World Police</a> always make me bust out laughing. Hope you do too.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358460/">Spottswoode</a></strong>: Remember, there is no &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;Team America&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1042825/">Intelligence</a></strong>: [<em>pause</em>] Yes, there is.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thirstyformilk.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dilemma_poster_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1323" title="dilemma_poster_1" src="http://thirstyformilk.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dilemma_poster_1.jpg?w=690&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="690" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>As I waited Â at a bus stop yesterday, the usual advert at the bus shelter caught my eye. It was an ad for the new Vince Vaughan movie &#8216;The Truth Hurts&#8217;.. or wait, is it called &#8216;The Dilemma&#8217;? Ok so I knew already the title of this movie was The Dilemma but it is soÂ ridiculously stupid looking I wanted to unhinge the plastic cover, take out the massive abomination and burn it right then and there.Â As someone who loves movies and art/design, it displeases me to see the abundance of ugly and lazy poster art for new movies.</p>
<p>Look at that poster, all the cast looking like waxworks, clearly not in the same room, photoshopped to within an inch of their lives. I understand an actors face sells a movie nowadays but come on! A bit of invention would be nice.</p>
<p>Do not think it is just this poster that falls into this category. Nearly every &#8216;Frat Pack&#8217; movie, heck, mostÂ comediesÂ nowadays Â uses this chunky font and blank look into the camera, although, in what must have been an epic epiphany, they&#8217;ve changed the colour from red to blue!</p>
<p>And look at just a few random posters from just last year that show that movie posters can still be beautiful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polled the team at <a href="http://www.ggvc.com/">GGV</a> for thoughts and insights from CES &#8211; below areÂ a few of our team&#8217;s thoughts/summaries of the show.<a href="http://13hrstothink.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ces-20111.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-174" title="CES 2011" src="http://13hrstothink.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ces-20111.jpg?w=150&#038;h=80" alt="" width="150" height="80" /></a><a href="http://13hrstothink.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ces-2011.jpg"></a></p>
<p>My personal view. I&#8217;ve been going to CES for many years now.Â  From my perspective, this year&#8217;s was the most disappointing.Â  Yes, there were some cool new tv&#8217;s, and lots of tablets, and lots of cool gadgets and attachments to Apple stuff (a lot, in fact) &#8211; but there was nothing that made you go &#8220;wow!&#8221;Â  OK, maybe the <a href="http://www.wired.com/video/ces-2011-audi-r8-etron-packs-hefty-features-for-an-ev/742202830001">Audi R8Â Etron</a>Â - an all-electric version of the R8 &#8211; which was pretty damn cool (<a href="http://www.wired.com/video/ces-2011-audi-r8-etron-packs-hefty-features-for-an-ev/742202830001">check out the Wired video here</a>).Â  In fact, with all of the announcements about <a href="http://newsgrange.com/why-your-next-car-will-have-an-ip-address/">Internet-connected cars</a>Â (including <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/ericsavitz/2011/01/08/ces-pandora-is-everywhere-you-want-to-be/?boxes=financechannelforbes">lots of cool stuff from GGV portfolio company Pandora</a>), one could argue that was the highlight.Â Â  Other than that, I wasn&#8217;t blown away.</p>
<p>Tablets were clearly &#8220;the big thing&#8221; this year.Â  One of my favorite quotes of the week: Friend of mine to rep at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkKRKpNA_z8">Motorola holding the new MotoÂ tablet (Xoom)</a>Â - &#8220;So&#8230;what&#8217;s the difference between this and the iPad?&#8221;Â  MotoÂ rep responds &#8220;You&#8217;re the 651st person who&#8217;s asked me that today.&#8221;Â  To be fair, the Xoom does have some cool new features, is going to run on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/06/googles-android-3-0-honeycomb-for-tablets-a-guided-tour-of-the/">Android Honeycomb</a>,Â and was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110108/ts_alt_afp/usitinternettelecommotorolaces">named &#8220;Best Gadget&#8221; at CES</a>.Â  However, one could not help feeling like many of the tablets at CESÂ are a day late and a dollar short &#8211; that&#8217;s the best we can come up with 9 months after the iPad launched?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ggvc.com/team/team-members/glenn-solomon">Glenn Solomon&#8217;s </a>take.Â  One interesting observation â even though Apple isnât present at the show, nearly half of all the exhibitors I saw were displaying direct or indirect linkages to Apple products.Â  Android was also quite prevalent.Â  Itâs really amazing how much of the consumer electronics ecosystem is now ultimately controlled by these two forces.Â  And there are many companies whose market power isÂ dwindling or goneÂ â Sony, Motorola, RIM, etc.Â  Also, perhaps riding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/01/08/video.games.ces/">the Kinect wave</a>, I saw a fair bit of 3-D and augmented reality.Â Â  This trend seems to be gaining a lot of steam.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ggvc.com/team/team-members/adam-altman">Adam Altman&#8217;s</a> take.Â  1) Lots of tablets, Samsung Galaxy appears to be only real competitor, we&#8217;re likely to see hundreds of Chinese knockoffs flood the market and bring down prices, 2) lots of wireless charging technology &#8211; why do I need it?, 3) TV&#8217;s are maxing out on core features, 3D still a big push but not clear consumers are biting, 4) on 3D TV&#8217;s, most manufacturers are pushing the active shutter glasses &#8211; an even harder bite for consumers when they&#8217;re $150 a pop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ggvc.com/team/team-members/scott-bonham">Scott Bonham&#8217;s</a> take.Â  Energy level was higher this year than last year.Â  Lots of cool but unnecessary gizmo&#8217;s flying off the shelves &#8211; see <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/25764-recon-shows-off-ski-goggles-with-android-gps/">$500 ski goggles with GPS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ggvc.com/team/team-members/kevin-chen">Kevin Chen&#8217;s</a> take.Â  1) Everybody has a tablet design, and the hardware / operating systems are already commoditized and easy to do.Â  However,Â most except Apple do not knowÂ how they want to position their offering.Â  Say what you want about Ciscoâs tab, at least they know where they want to go with it. Â Everybody just seems lost, which might favor the mass suppliers such as Nvidia and Marvell.Â  Commoditization of tablets will be here soon, and Iâm wondering if the tablet era will be just as short as the Netbook era.Â Â 2) I guess related to the point above, it is scary how many random Chinese and Korean companies Adam and I have never heard of that have these huge booths with full product lines.Â  The future is looking more crowded than ever for established American and European companies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<em>In reality there is perhaps not one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself&#8230;For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>- Benjamin Franklin</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>A chance encounter with a Vatican priest was to be my first lesson.</p>
<p>He happened to be in the seat next to me on a flight to Accra, Ghanaâs steamy and lively capital city. I was on my way there to work for a local newspaper as a reporter and he was on his way back to visit his family. He was Ghanaian and had moved to The Vatican a few years earlier to work for the Opera Romana Pellegrinaggi, a branch of the Vatican that organised pilgrimages.</p>
<p>He had this air of benevolence about him which I found very comforting as I was only just slightly anxious at the prospect of spending the next few months living in deepest, darkest Africa. He was extremely engaging and I was surprised at how approachable he was, even dressed in his long black cassock and clerical collar.</p>
<p>We started chatting almost immediately and didnât stop until we said goodbye outside the airport in Accra.</p>
<p>We discussed absolutely everything from God and religion to Ghanaian cuisine, and disagreed on many of these topics. One thing we agreed on and that has stayed with me since, was the importance humility.</p>
<p>It came up in conversation when I asked him why he wasnât flying first class as I spotted him earlier being whisked through the departure lounge, clearly not your average package-deal holiday maker.</p>
<p>He told me that he has never flown first class even though he is always automatically offered an upgrade whenever he checks in. He said that working in the Vatican, where you are elevated to this divine status and can live in a kind of bubble of sanctity, it is incredibly difficult to stay grounded and keep your feet firmly on terra firma. Otherwise he would be floating in the clouds with the angels.</p>
<p>He continued saying how easy it is to lose touch with what is real and important in life and how quickly you can get caught up in all the pomp and material benefits that surround you, not only in the Vatican but in all spheres of life.</p>
<p>I knew this already but admired how he had made a conscious decision to turn down something as seemingly meaningless as the offer of a large, reclining chair with plenty of leg room, to rather sit squashed with the masses in economy class in an attempt to stay humble. He told me it was much too comfortable in first class and sometimes we need to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This was just one small thing he did which he hoped would maintain some kind of humility within himself â something he told me that was very important.</p>
<p>My next lesson didnât teach me how to be humble, but rather humbled me so completely that I felt almost ashamed.</p>
<p>I was walking through the dusty streets of Accra, trying to find the bank and after a few wrong turns realised I was very lost. I approached a young man carrying a briefcase who seemed to be on his way to work and asked if he could point me in the right direction. Instead of giving me directions and then being on his way, he walked the entire way to the bank with me, 10 minutes in the opposite direction to where he was going, and only when I was safely at the entrance to the bank, said goodbye and went back on his way.</p>
<p>It was only later that day when I recalled this act of kindness, something he seemed to do without a second thought, that I felt so humbled.</p>
<p>Coming from a city like London, one of the worlds great cities, loaded with financial and material wealth, it can often be difficult to even get the time of day from a person in the street. Yet in Accra, a relatively destitute African city that can barely feed its people, I was offered help in such a generous way and without hesitation, which made me realise just how wrong weâve got it in our Western civilisation. Â This was not the only occasion someone helped me like this and there were many other selfless offerings of charity during my time in Ghana.</p>
<p>There was a small cafÃ© near the office I worked in and if one of my colleagues ever spotted me walking past while they were having lunch there, they would shout my name across the road and invite me to join them. I was a millionaire in comparison to them and in the three months I worked there, not once would they let me pay for my lunch. Even after much protest on my part, they simply kept reminding me that I was a guest in their country and they would never accept my money.</p>
<p>I cringe at the thought of one of them ever coming to London expecting to be treated with the same hospitality and instead get pushed and shoved out of the way on the tube and ignored when asking for help.</p>
<p>London is clearly rich in terms of money and material things, but Ghana is so much richer in spirit and in kindness and generosity. And which is more important?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t do resolutions in honor of any new year, and I am not about to start.  But on looking back at 2010, where you could consider &#8220;harried&#8221; the single best word to describe me, it occurred to me that I might wish to aim in a few directions away from what caused me to spend so much of 2010 in such an uncomfortable fashion.  (I should note that in addition to <a href="http://notfromaroundhere.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/new-year-new-blah-blah-blah/">all of the places I listed as having been for work in 2010</a>, I was also&#8211;for &#8220;fun&#8221;&#8211;in Brighton and Horsham UK, in Paris, and in Baltimore, Minneapolis and in the Outer Banks of North Carolina within the US.)  So clearly travelling too much is a problem, and I am working on that one.  Aside from a trip to Spain next week with my sister (come on, it&#8217;s an early celebration of my upcoming 35th birthday and involves Gaudi, my favorite architect ever) I have nothing planned until April, and after that trip nothing planned until the summer.  So one direction for 2011 is to stop travelling as much.  No jollies to Australasia unless something in December maybe comes good but that&#8217;s a long shot.  Fewer trips over to the continent.  Fewer nights away from home.  Or something like that.  Now that I have a shower in my flat I can no longer use travel as the excuse to get a good shower.  Ahhhh England.</p>
<p>
Twice in 2010 I nearly fainted because I let my blood sugar drop to dangerous lows when I skipped breakfast to get to work and had to do something that required a &#8220;performance&#8221; and thus energy.  I have never fainted, and I had never nearly fainted before.  I&#8217;ve been playing dangerous games with food for years; I&#8217;m a carbohydrate addict (thus my obsessions with American junk-food crackers like Cheez-its) and my distaste for sweet things means I sometimes struggle with eating healthy things like sweet fruits.  I also live alone and thus eat whatever I want, whenever I feel like it, which sounds fun but after awhile can build some rather undisciplined habits.  I will not confess what my typical breakfast was for much of this year but UK people will understand when I say the brand name on the packet was &#8220;Walkers&#8221;.  (Don&#8217;t judge me!)  So 2011 is the year I will take control of what passes across my lips and start eating better.
<p>
I don&#8217;t diet.  I could stand to lose some weight, but dieting is deprivation which leads to bingeing and eating disorders.  What I am going to do is two-fold: to adjust the blood sugar problem by watching the intake of high glycemic-index foods, and to try and follow the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darya-pino/is-it-real-food-flowchart_b_805406.html">&#8220;is it food&#8221;</a> rule when shopping and only buy actual food.   </p>
<p>
For part one I am cutting only two things out of my diet, but people who know me will get that these are two of the things that I eat muchly, so this will be interesting.  I will avoid white bread/flour and white potatoes.  Wheat or other nutty bread is fine and often tastes better anyways.  Corn chips are allowed, and they are great with hummus which has about the lowest glycemic index of any food around.  Sweet potatoes are fine, and I recently made a perfectly passable celeriac puree that was actually better than mashed potatoes (!)  And I can&#8217;t get good crackers here in the UK anyways.  So that&#8217;s thing one.</p>
<p>
Thing two is more interesting.  If you have not read <a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/">Michael Pollan&#8217;s &#8220;In defense of food</a>,&#8221; I highly recommend that you do.   I picked it up, ironically enough, in Singapore in the summer of 2009 and read it cover to cover in one sitting.  Living in hotels grants one that sort of time and freedom.  His argument was excellent, that much of what we eat is NOT actually food, but is chemically engineered and over-processed.  (While the natural white potato cannot claim that, refined white flour certainly can!)  I&#8217;ve spent the last year and a bit since reading the book growing increasingly influenced by it.  At the beach this year, when I cooked I started giving everything I made a &#8220;food score&#8221; from 0-10 where 0 was something highly processed and with lots of artificial ingredients and a 10 was something with only real natural food in it.  And it does not have to be just fresh veg to qualify: corn chips, which make it in my new guidelines as an acceptable snack food (especially with hummus!) contain, I kid you not, corn/maize, oil and salt.  That&#8217;s true of the Tostitos I had at the beach when I discovered this, and the generic Tesco chips I bought this weekend.  So coming in a package does not necessarily make something get a low &#8220;food&#8221; score, but having lots of ingredients that you can&#8217;t pronounce, does.  Now I run into slight trouble here as a former strict vegetarian, in that I have a taste for soya-based processed artificial meat products.  I&#8217;ve been eating less and less of them as (a) the availability in the UK is total crap (aside from if you visit lucky <a href="http://3bedroombungalow.blogspot.com/">Kat</a> on the base) and (b) I switched to being a pescetarian and eat fish now, which is real food.  So I&#8217;m working on it.</p>
<p>
Given the fact that I moved and now walk 2.3 miles to work, the combination of that, less travel (and thus less hotel room service and restaurant meals) and this set of new eating guidelines might be a positive step in terms of my weight, but that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m doing it and it&#8217;s not how I&#8217;m judging myself.  I spent some time quite by accident the other day reading some musings from <a href="http://blog.twowholecakes.com/">Lesley Kinzel</a> about focussing on weight loss versus on being healthy and I think she has a really good point.  The story about the overweight girl who the ER docs didn&#8217;t believe had an eating disorder was particularly poignant. </p>
<p>
But these are guidelines and guidelines only.  In a crisis, I&#8217;ll eat a crisp.  If I&#8217;m at a work dinner and a white bread roll is the only thing on offer, I&#8217;ll probably have a bite.  I&#8217;m quite pragmatic that way.  One of my group members at work keeps bringing up&#8211;in total disbelief&#8211;the fact that I ate some fois gras in early 2010 in a social situation in which rejecting it would have been very awkward.  But what I am not going to do any more is consider that coffee and Walkers is an appropriate breakfast, or that packaged food of any sort is an acceptable substitute for actual food.  And the food I eat is going to be tasty, and I&#8217;m going to be documenting it on my new <a href="http://chanceofcrabcakes.wordpress.com/">food blog</a> with my sister.  </p>
<p>
I&#8217;m also going to try to get myself better organized to go to the gym, or else quit my gym membership and rely on the walk.  I haven&#8217;t decided which is better, just that the need for regular exercise&#8211;again, for my sanity, not necessarily for my weight&#8211;is too important to keep ignoring.  My walks to work really allow me to clear my head and it&#8217;s about the only time I have to think without any distractions, these days.</p>
<p>
Watch this space and let&#8217;s hope for a less harried NFAH in 2011.  Because I don&#8217;t think I could survive another one like this one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Good thing one of my new year&#8217;s resolutions wasn&#8217;t to post more often; I&#8217;d have failed at that one early!</em></p>
<p>We had a very interesting article this weekend written by a Chinese American woman about <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">the so-called &#8220;Chinese mothering&#8221; method and why she says it&#8217;s superior to typical Western parenting methods</a>. The story has basically gone viralâI&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s up to almost 1 million page views now, and it&#8217;s got over 1,500 comments!âand has evoked a lot of emotion on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>The author, a Yale law professor, says that she disciplines her daughters hard. She won&#8217;t accept anything less than a B in their schooling. She won&#8217;t allow her kids to attend sleepovers, play on sports teams, watch TV or participate in school plays. She quizzes them and forces them to study for hours at a time. In her recounting of one incident, she won&#8217;t even let her 7-year-old daughter take a dinner or bathroom break while practicing the piano until she can get the piece down perfectly, even if that means it takes hours.</p>
<p>It seems a bit odd to me, and it&#8217;s certainly the total opposite of the parenting methods under which I was raised, but since I am in China, of course, I have many Chinese friends who say that the article, if not exactly spot-on, does hit close to home. Some even say they are thankful they weren&#8217;t coddled or spoiled by their parents and that Americans have become too soft. (But others, of course, think this lady is too extreme and will only hurt her children in the long run.) The kids I used to tutor in Beijing definitely had Chinese mothering, if not to this level. They had me, a private English tutor. They rarely watched TV. They didn&#8217;t play sports. When I asked them their plans for the weekend, their answers often involved reading and studying.</p>
<p>I suppose there&#8217;s no right answer when it comes to parenting (and sheesh, who am I to know!? I&#8217;m still a good ten years away from that one!). But I thought since it offers an interesting perspective on China and that&#8217;s what this blog is supposed to be about, it&#8217;s fair game for posting!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s snowing in Dixie again! AÂ couple ofÂ weeks ago when it did that I had to venture out to dig our vehicles out of the driveway. I was hard at work brushing the snow off and walked around to the back of the van and stepped on black ice. It is hard to maintain your dignity when you are over sixty and fall to your knees, then slide under the car. You just know the neighbors are watching and saying to themselves. &#8220;Well, there goes another senior falling down and it looks as if he can&#8217;t get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that point you have one of two options. You can stay under the vehicle until the spring thaw and pretend you were hibernating for the winter, or you can get up as gracefully as you can even though you know you&#8217;re probably going to need knee replacement surgery, and brush yourself off and act like you&#8217;re tough. I opted for number two, because I really wasn&#8217;t dressed for option one.</p>
<p>The point to all of this is that I was watching the snow fall and told myself I should go out and brush the snow off the cars, then I had a flashback and decided to hell with it, I&#8217;ll just stay inside where it&#8217;s warm and drink hot chocolate. Isn&#8217;t that what seniors are supposed to do?</p>
<p>The weather outside is frightful&#8230;Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow&#8230;damn, I burned my tongue again on the hot chocolate!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one year ends and a new one begins, people attempt positive changes in their lives.  One aspect of our lives that is receiving a lot of scrutiny has been the ubiquity of plastic products, and recently attention has been drawn to plastic and its relationship to food.  There are two main reasons why people try to avoid plastic; the idea of avoiding plastics because they might transfer toxins into ones food, and the idea of cutting down on ones use of disposable products that persist in the environment and do not biodegrade.  </p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img alt="" src="http://www.rachelleb.com/images/2006_02_20/fake_plastic_food.jpg" title="Fake Plastic Food" width="600" height="450" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image from http://www.rachelleb.com/2006/02/20/fake-plastic-food/</p></div>
<p>Ed Begley Jr. is a leader in the green movement, and last week he wrote âMake kitchen greener â and save money, tooâ (Dec 30, 2010 <a href="http://detnews.com/article/20101230/LIFESTYLE05/12300359/Make-kitchen-greener-â-and-save-money--too#ixzz1AVmn9XJ6">http://detnews.com/article/20101230/LIFESTYLE05/12300359/Make-kitchen-greener-â-and-save-money&#8211;too#ixzz1AVmn9XJ6</a>).  His fourth and final tip was âavoid single-use plastic whenever possible. Store your leftovers in reusable containers that last for many years and save some dough. Plastic bags cost a lot over time.â  This includes costs on the consumer and on the environment.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Plastic is ubiquitous in our lives because it is convenient and relatively inexpensive.  Its inexpensiveness is the result of a large portion of the costs associated with its life â production, use and disposal â being put onto society as a whole. This unsolicited financial burden on society manifests itself as increased taxes to finance municipal curbside recycling programs, landfill space, and incineration. It also increases health care and insurance costs as a result of its incineration polluting the air, water, and food.&#8221; (Get Plastic Out Of Your Diet, Paul Goettlich, Living Nutrition magazine v.15, Spring (April) 2004 <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm</a>)</p>
<p>This line of reasoning has caused a surge in the consideration and passage of laws banning plastic, most frequently bags used for carrying home ones groceries and BPA plastic in beverage and baby bottles.  In Brownsville Texas, âthe ordinance prohibits retailers from using thin plastic bags at checkout counters â bags that are said to contribute significantly to the local litter problem.â  More than local litter, the locals want to show off their greener lifestyle as part of a larger reimagining for the city. âOfficials called the ban a huge step for the city â a move that will help put Brownsville in front of larger cities like Austin and San Antonio in efforts to protect the environment.â  (Plastic bag ban begins in Brownsville, Jazmine Ulloa Jan 05, 2011 <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/articles/brownsville-45984-plastic-bag.html">http://www.themonitor.com/articles/brownsville-45984-plastic-bag.html</a>)</p>
<p>Yet these laws have not always garnered widespread support.   Not everyone is so excited to wear the greener crown.  Take âItaly&#8217;s Plastic Bag Ban Fails in Consumer Mindsâ (Meaghan Clark, Jan 7, 2011. <a href="http://www.energydigital.com/sectors/recycling/italys-plastic-bag-ban-fails-consumer-minds">http://www.energydigital.com/sectors/recycling/italys-plastic-bag-ban-fails-consumer-minds</a>) âThis ban, though consumers continue to oppose, will eventually change Italiansâ overall environmental outlook. Undoubtedly, there will be a learning curve in this process, but if Italy wants to step up to its economic competitors like green cities Portland, Oregon; Curitiba, Brazil; and Vancouver; Canada the plastic bag has got to go. âThis marks a key step forward in the fight against pollution and it makes us all more responsible in terms of recycling,â said Environment Minister Stefania Prestigiacomo.â</p>
<p>However, the plastics companies have not been lying down on this debate.  âParts of Los Angeles County, Long Beach, and San Jose have all recently enacted bag bans. But the most recent ban attempt in Marin County, C.A., was stalled this week due to plastic industry pressure and threats of a lawsuit against the county.â (Marin County Bag Ban Threatened by Lawsuit from Plastic Industry, Jessica Belsky January 08, 2011. <a href="http://food.change.org/blog/view/marin_county_bag_ban_threatened_by_lawsuit_from_plastic_industry">http://food.change.org/blog/view/marin_county_bag_ban_threatened_by_lawsuit_from_plastic_industry</a>)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Plastics News blog is blogging about how some other bloggers are blogging about going plastic free (Another blogger avoiding plastic, Don Loepp, July 15, 2010 <a href="http://plasticsnews.com/blog/2010/07/another_blogger_avoiding_plast.html">http://plasticsnews.com/blog/2010/07/another_blogger_avoiding_plast.html</a>). They had a blog post about Mark and Melanie Rummel, who say they&#8217;re trying to live a plastics-free lifestyle. âThe newlywed couple from Texas has a goal of buying nothing made of plastic for the next year, and they&#8217;ve set up a blog, <a href="nonewplastic.com">nonewplastic.com</a>, to share their story.â The blog then quoted the other blog, where Melanie narrates the adventure of buying cheese that was not wrapped in plastic.  </p>
<p>More insightful than the blog post was this comment: âI would like to tour their home and see what they use for refrigeration, how do they wash their clothing, etc. Right now, it&#8217;s popular in the mainstream press to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m living a plastic-free life!&#8221; and it&#8217;s obviously a great way to draw media attention, especially from local stations. It&#8217;s the latest, greatest &#8220;feel-good&#8221; topic. Makes Joe and Jane Q. Public all warm and fuzzy, until they realize that even their heat and air conditioning are conveyed in machines and systems that rely on plastic.â (Posted by Angie DeRosa on July 19, 2010).  The point is clear that plastic are everywhere in our modern world, and one cannot avoid plastic completely without sacrificing many amenities. </p>
<p>What about the health effects of eating food that has lived a large portion of its shelf life wrapped in plastic bags, cellophane, or plastic storage containers? How harmful is plastic when it surrounds our food and enters our mouths? Think about all the plastic drinking straws, silverware, cups, plates, sandwich baggies, and soda bottles that have ever touched you or your food.  âThese plastics are called &#8220;Food Contact Substances&#8221; by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but until April 2002, they were called &#8220;Indirect Food Additives.&#8221;[2] The new name is cleansed of the implication that plastic gets into your food. In spite of this semantic deception, migration is a key assumption of the FDA.  (Get Plastic Out Of Your Diet, Paul Goettlich, Living Nutrition magazine, v.15, Spring (April) 2004 <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm</a>) </p>
<p>âPlastic is used in contact with nearly all packaged foods. Most cardboard milk containers are now coated with plastic [4] rather than wax. It is sprayed on both commercial and organic produce to preserve its freshness. Plastic is even used to irrigate, mulch, wrap, and transport organic food.â  âEvidence of the negative health effects of plastics already exists in sufficient quantity to halt the use of it in contact with food.â (Get Plastic Out Of Your Diet, Paul Goettlich, Living Nutrition magazine v.15, Spring (April) 2004 <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Exposure to BPA can cause numerous problems including âaneuploidy, a chromosome abnormality found in more than 5% of pregnancies. Most aneuploid fetuses die in utero. About one-third of all miscarriages are aneuploid, making it the leading known cause of pregnancy loss. Among conceptions that survive to term, aneuploidy is the leading genetic cause of developmental disabilities and mental retardation. About 1 in 300 liveborn infants and 1 in 3 miscarriages are aneuploid. It is associated with Down syndrome, [28] Patau syndrome, [29] Edwards syndrome, [30] Klinefelter syndrome, [31] Turner syndrome, [32] Cri du chat syndrome, [33] and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. [34]. (Get Plastic Out Of Your Diet, Paul Goettlich, Living Nutrition magazine v.15, Spring (April) 2004 <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm</a>)</p>
<p>And thatâs not all. âBPA is about 10,000-fold less potent than 17Ã-estradiol, a potent estrogen that is synthesized primarily in the ovary, but also in the placenta, testis and possibly adrenal cortex. Because of the disparity, industry representatives claim it causes no harm at the levels that the majority of people are exposed to. However, a study in 2001 showed that even at such low potency, when combined with other xenoestrogens (estrogens from outside the body), they act together additively, effectively raising the body load of estrogen to dangerous levels.[41]â (Get Plastic Out Of Your Diet, Paul Goettlich. Living Nutrition magazine v.15, Spring (April) 2004 <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/Out-Of-Diet-PG5nov03.htm</a>)</p>
<p>So how far should one go to remove plastic from our lives?  Are halfway measures enough or is a complete lifestyle change necessary to protect us from harm?  Should we shun this miraculous freshness-saving technology?  Perhaps there is a better way than total plastic paranoia.  </p>
<p>âWith Health Canada set to ban polycarbonate baby bottles, which contain the estrogen-mimicking chemical bisphenol A, many Canadians are seeing all the plastics around them in a newly unflattering light and scrambling for alternatives.â (The anti-plastic backlash, Tralee Pearce, May 20, 2008, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece</a>) âFor consumers concerned about the makeup of their plastic containers, websites such as <a href="http://www.toxicnation.ca/"> http://www.toxicnation.ca/</a>, run by the advocacy group Environmental Defense, outline the meanings of various plastic recycling logos. Bottles labeled number 7 or 3 may leach BPA, while those marked with number 5, 4 and 2 seem safer.â  </p>
<p>âExperts agree that rethinking plastic in the kitchen should be a priority, especially among families with pregnant women and small children.  &#8220;Children are uniquely vulnerable to these chemicals,&#8221; says Aaron Freeman, policy director at Environmental Defense.â (The anti-plastic backlash, Tralee Pearce, May, 20, 2008, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece</a>)</p>
<p>However, even activism needs some moderation.  âWith BPA also lurking in the linings of most canned goods, many Canadians are saying goodbye to their favorite convenience foods, too. &#8220;It&#8217;s a drag,&#8221; Ms. Gough says. &#8220;Lately, I&#8217;ve been soaking beans.&#8221;  Yet, even the most staunch anti-plastic folks say eliminating all risks is impossible. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much in the environment, you can&#8217;t be radical about it or you&#8217;d go nuts,&#8221; Mr. Sinha says.â (The anti-plastic backlash, Tralee Pearce, May 20, 2008,<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece"> http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article686742.ece</a>)</p>
<p>In the case of plastic, perhaps realism is the both a blessing and a curse.  Luckily, the greenest solution is also the closest.  âExperience tells us that the most sustainable way to manage solid waste is at the local levelâas close to home as we can get. Reduce, reuse and recycle.   (Why Pinoys need green lifestyle, Annie P. Guerrero, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Jan 1, 2011, <a href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20110101-312064/Why-Pinoys-need-green-lifestyle">http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20110101-312064/Why-Pinoys-need-green-lifestyle</a>)</p>
<p>People need to look at their food choices, and at their &#8220;garbage bin in a new perspective. I hope that it will make them ask these questions the next time they shop: âWhere does this product come from? Is it made or grown locally? How far has it traveled? Who made it? Will it last? Can I recycle it? Is it toxic? Is there a better alternative? Where will it eventually end up? Is it at the dump?â  (Why Pinoys need green lifestyle, Annie P. Guerrero, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Jan 1, 2011 <a href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20110101-312064/Why-Pinoys-need-green-lifestyle">http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20110101-312064/Why-Pinoys-need-green-lifestyle</a>)</p>
<p>As consumers, the best we can do is be informed, ask these questions, make smart choices, and share our awareness with others.  We need to know and care about our food and everything that touches it before it gets to our tables, because our food choices affect our health and the health of our environment.  </p>
