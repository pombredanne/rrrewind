			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I went to a contest in North Carolina.  I ran into a bunch of old riding buddies.   Many of them were close to or had just turned 40.  We were talking about how life has changed with kids, work, getting older and balancing life without giving up riding.  We came up on the topic of when we started riding.  I just usually make a stupid joke when that subject comes up to avoid sounding like a pompous ass but as these were good friends who would understand, I told them the truth.</p>
<p>A few years ago I asked my mom &#8220;When did I start jumping my bike?  Actually putting a board on a cinderblock and making a ramp&#8221;.  She thought about it for a minute and then said &#8220;1972&#8243;.  Now this has been sticking in my side for a few years and I have tried to keep it low key.  It just seems ridiculous to me.  After talking with my best friend, a guy I have ridden with for about 30 years, I came to some conclusions.  My riding can be broken into distinct decade size chunks that are all different chapters in my experience.  I thought I&#8217;d share them here.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>1972-1982- Discovery</strong></em></span></p>
<p>I learned to jump by realizing that if I went fast enough on the sidewalk in front of my house my front wheel would pop up where the blocks had been pushed up by the enormous tree roots.  With a little more speed, I could get both wheels in the air.  Then came the small ramps.  Then I saw Evel Knievel on TV and I realized I was actually doing what he did.  Of course I was doing it on an age appropriate level but it was the same thing.  I figured out curb cuts, how to launch down staircases and find dirt jumps.  I came home from school every day in first grade and jumped my ramps.  The older kids in the neighborhood noticed me and encouraged me.  Mostly for their entertainment I guess.  This decade can be summed up as <strong>Discovery</strong>.  I was learning what I could do and what was possible.  I mastered wheelies, made drag chutes to slow me down, did stunt shows for the other kids with me jumping over big wheels while wearing a cape that my mom gave me that she had from a tap dancing recital she had done in 1951.  I didn&#8217;t know there were other kids jumping or doing this stuff on their bikes.  It was just something I wanted to do for me.  It was just fun.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>1982-1992- Innovation</strong></em></span></p>
<p>This decade marked my entry into BMX.  I had moved to York and seen other kids with real BMX bikes.  I could out jump them on my department store Huffy I had been riding since 1975.  Then one day Dave Wineka gave me a box of BMX magazines instead of throwing them out like his father had told him to do.  I had about 2 years worth of BMX Action, BMX Plus and Super BMX magazines.  I spent the weekend in my basement and read every word in each issue.  I learned BMX in one weekend.  That was when I realized jumping my bike was bigger than me and that there were thousands of people that did what I was doing.  I started meeting more BMX riders and realized I needed to upgrade my bike.  One of the riders I met was Mike Daily.  He was a racer and a total BMX geek.  Through Mike, I met more riders and eventually we started a trick team.  Freestyle riding was blowing up and I knew that racing wouldn&#8217;t be my thing.  I spent the decade learning how to freestyle.  Those of you that know the Plywood Hoods trick team know what we did.  It was all new and we (the Plywood Hoods and our peers) were I<strong>nnovating</strong>.  We were making up the sport.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>1992-2002- Progression</strong></em></span></p>
<p>In January 1993, Kevin and I went to NYC to shoot a music video.  We rode a sound stage the size of a bedroom and while I could do a few tricks in the small area, Kevin could do them all.  I realized that his riding brought him cool opportunities and that was where I wanted to be.  I got really into flatland, moved away from jumping and street riding and spend countless hours in a parking lot by myself learning advanced bike control.  I started entering contests, traveling and doing shows.  This decade was all about <strong>Progression</strong>.  I wanted to keep moving forward and pushing my riding.  I even got 4th for the year in the amateur class.  I planned on getting in the top three the next year so I could feel that I was legitimately ready to compete in the Pro class.  That dream and my leg were shattered at the same time.  I knew I couldn&#8217;t properly prepare for the next year&#8217;s contest series.  I&#8217;d have to spend a year trying to get back to my dream of turning Pro.</p>
<div id="attachment_304" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://brettdownsconspiracy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/331928_10150444770736342_709521341_8590058_304394612_o1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-304" title="331928_10150444770736342_709521341_8590058_304394612_o" src="http://brettdownsconspiracy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/331928_10150444770736342_709521341_8590058_304394612_o1.jpg?w=1024&h=744" alt="" width="1024" height="744" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Working on a great Loco route in 1997 at Genaurdi's. I still ride there.</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>2002-2012- Maintenance</strong></em></span></p>
<p>By the summer of 2002, my first son was 2 years old.  My riding time was pushed aside for him.  As he got a little older whenever I told my wife I was going riding, Henry would ask if he could go with me.  My solo flatland sessions turned into riding around the neighborhood with a stop at the playground or 7-11.  Then the twins were born and I was the stay at home mom for the first two years.  Then my marriage started blowing up and I lost the mental edge needed to ride on the rare times I got out.  My riding went from progression to <strong>Maintenance</strong>.  I was just trying to keep the tricks I had learned, jump often enough to not be scared and hold onto my riding.</p>
<div id="attachment_302" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://brettdownsconspiracy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/howellnjhellonwheelsshow-003.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-302" title="howellnjhellonwheelsshow 003" src="http://brettdownsconspiracy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/howellnjhellonwheelsshow-003.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="712" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Riding a friend's bike, 2008. Thanks Budz!</p></div>
<p>Now I find myself divorced with 50/50 custody which offers me time to ride and the dread of a bad marriage is behind me.  I&#8217;m riding more than I have in a decade.  I&#8217;m still pushing myself but in a different way.  Riding brings a new smile to my face.  I can go out and work on new tricks or something from 1987 and get the same enjoyment.  I have such a personal history of my riding to tap into it feels fresh again.  I doubt I will ever get to the progression stage again but I&#8217;m also not in the maintenance stage either.  The mastery of Freestyle I started in the 80&#8242;s is complete.  These days I ride and just have fun and soak up the experiences just like I did in the 70&#8242;s.  I come home dirty, sweaty and skinned up and wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>
<p>I realize I&#8217;m pushing boundaries in BMX.  There are only a few of us who have been riding consistantly and hard since the 1970&#8242;s.  I have spent decades being aware and/or a part of the BMX scene.  At this point, I don&#8217;t have much in common with the current state of BMX when it comes to my own riding.  I&#8217;m fine with that.  I don&#8217;t care about innovation, progression or maintenance in my riding.  I&#8217;m still a huge fan of current riding but I know it&#8217;s not what I need to do.  I have nothing to prove to anyone except myself.  Thirty years after I spent a solitary weekend opening my eyes to BMX outside myself, I&#8217;m now back to where I started.  Some of my older friends get bummed thinking their best days are behind them.  When I look back at my 40 years of jumping my bike, I can&#8217;t pick out the best days.  They were all good and I know as long as I keep riding, there are still plenty of great days ahead of me.</p>

<p>The Unser Racing Museum is a wonderful treat for anyone interested in engines,  fast cars, high-speed thrills and marvelous  race cars of every kind.  The excitement jumps out at you. I&#8217;m not a race fan, yet  I  found it to be a  fabulous experience. The museum is not the history of racing, but the history of a family of racers, the Unsers.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_09231.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16995" title="IMG_0923" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_09231.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="259" /></a></p>
<p>You know rather quickly from looking at and hearing about these cars, it takes a lot of money to develop a body and engine  that can compete in the Indianapolis 500. A lot of money. The Unsers did not start out rich. Swiss immigrants, Louie Unser was a butcher but he had a knack for tinkering with engines. Mechanics was what he loved. They settled near Pikes Peak in Colorado and his sons Louis, Joe and Jerry began building race cars and tried to get a car up to the top of Pikes Peak.   Joe was always promising himself he was going to build a car that would make it to the top. The road at the time was dirt. And, he did.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0968.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16996" title="IMG_0968" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0968.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Jerry Unser Sr. inherited his father&#8217;s knack for mechanics and opened up a garage in Albuquerque because it was on Route 66, where he knew he could make money.  His kids, his brother&#8217;s kids, they were all into racing. at a young age. When they qualified for a race, they competed against each other, or each others records more than the other racers in the game.  Jerry Sr. was constantly putting race cars together from parts he&#8217;d acquire. He&#8217;d modify and customize them for speed and endurance. When the Indianapolis 500 speedway opened up, big money began funding development of the expensive race cars that are on the track today.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0924.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16997" title="Front engine, heavy, never won a race." src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0924.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="494" /></a></p>
<p>This car was one of the last of the front engine racers. Now all race cars have engines in the back. This one never won a race. And, in racing, it is all about winning because winning brings in the big money. The Unsers, were big winners.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0912.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16998" title="IMG_0912" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0912.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Al Unser pictured with his son, Al Jr. got his big break through a fluke. He was hanging around the track, basically fired when someone got pulled from the race and they needed a driver. He got the shot and won the Indy for the first time. His son, Little Al, like most of the Unsers, started out on go-karts and raced as long as they could keep up their grades. He&#8217;d bring his son to the track and they&#8217;d refuse to let him in because he was too young. He&#8217;d have to prove that Little Al was on the racing ticket to get him through the gates.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0929.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16999" title="IMG_0929" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0929.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>The four brothers, Al, Bobby, Louis and Jerry Jr. were successful competitors in racing circles. Jerry died in a fiery crash in his second attempt at the Indy 500.  Now, their kids are racing.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0908.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17000" title="IMG_0908" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0908.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Another Jeri Unser has put herself at risk on the track. Not the first female, but one of the few women in the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0915.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17001" title="IMG_0915" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0915.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>And 800 pound car you can pull around with one hand, so perfectly balanced and easy to handle. The floor in the museum, by the way, is made of ground up tires.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0920.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17002" title="IMG_0920" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0920.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but notice the difference in tires, and they make a big difference in the race. The rubber is as thin as a credit card. The driver wants those tires to heat up to about 200 degrees to make them sticky so they grip the road. It seems to me it would also slow them down, but, what do I know?  Our docent was knowledgeable and told us many stories about the cars development and racing experiences. This was very much a family museum.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0967.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17003" title="IMG_0967" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0967.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>This pace car was driven by five different drivers that each won their race in it. It was like a mystery. No one could figure out why this car always won races.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0966.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17004" title="IMG_0966" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0966.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Could it have been the tires?</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0932.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17005" title="IMG_0932" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0932.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t pretend to know anything about mechanics, but I found it fascinating. These &#8220;spokes&#8221; or maybe they are shocks, resemble airplane wheels. Some cars have fins which is designed to keep the car from sliding sideways.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0940.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17006" title="IMG_0940" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0940.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>I saw only one rear-view mirror on a race car, mounted so close to the tire it didn&#8217;t look like it belonged there.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0959.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17007" title="IMG_0959" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0959.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>One section of the museum has a small collection of old cars like this Phaeton, and a room full of trophys. These trophies and qualifying rings, shirts, racing uniforms et al.  Another salute to the generations of Unsers who raced to the top and the big money.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0950.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17008" title="IMG_0950" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0950.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="474" /></a></p>
<p>Jerry Unser Jr.  once hit this wall and during the Indy 500 remodel, they gave a section of the old wall to the Museum. It is called the Milliion Dollar wall.  I enjoyed the  fabulous story and a fabulous museum.</p>
<p><a href="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0987.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17009" title="IMG_0987" src="http://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0987.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>On the way home we stopped at the Chauma River brewery for cool one. I like dark stouts and porters and when I go to a microbrewery, I like to hoist one  to Ken and Laurie.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Drinken van kokosmelk / Drinking coconut milk by Nationaal Archief, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/4901590913/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4137/4901590913_849133eede.jpg" alt="Drinken van kokosmelk / Drinking coconut milk" width="500" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>A friend of mine is offering eleven drink boxes of coconut water to anyone who might like them.  (If you live in the Kansas City area, look her up.)  &#8221;Most ridiculous impulse buy I&#8217;ve made to date,&#8221; she proclaims.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty great one, I think.  Just say the words <em>coconut water </em>out loud (or imagine doing it, if you&#8217;re reading this on the bus or something).  It sounds luxurious, cool, relaxing, refreshing.  Lovely.</p>
<p>Unless you don&#8217;t like coconut.  Then it probably just sounds gross.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing about impulse buys.  They can be wonderful, or . . . something you try to get rid of on the Internet.</p>
<p>J&#8217;s post got me thinking about my own impulse purchases and trying to decide: what is my most ridiculous impulse buy?</p>
<p><a title="Katy's Hat Shop, Grainger Market by Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/6520989801/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7032/6520989801_5c08706f6d.jpg" alt="Katy's Hat Shop, Grainger Market" width="478" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, my impulse purchases are actually wholesome (you may remember my <a title="Sunday Night Shopping: the Awful Truth" href="http://neverthatway.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/sunday-night-shopping-the-awful-truth/" target="_blank">impulse Brussels sprouts</a> a few months ago).</p>
<p>Sometimes, they involve in-store coupons (Bel Vita breakfast biscuits, which turned out to be kind of a hit in the Cumings house, although Zoe now demands &#8220;real cookies&#8221; instead of what I&#8217;ve billed as &#8220;breakfast cookies&#8221; most of the time).</p>
<p>And sometimes, they are handmade pottery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true.  When I lived in Milwaukee, there was a wonderful little pottery store.  I loved browsing and chatting with the owner, and I would sometimes buy gifts there.</p>
<p>One day, I saw it.  A simple, beautiful cream serving bowl.  I had to have it, so I bought it.</p>
<p>My roommate Katie was horrified.  Not by the bowl&#8211;it is really very pretty&#8211;but by the price: sixty dollars.</p>
<p>In the years right after LVC, sixty dollars was a substantial amount of money.  (Honestly, it&#8217;s not peanuts <em>this</em> year, either.)  But at a time when we had only recently realized <a title="Because You’re Worth It" href="http://neverthatway.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/because-youre-worth-it/" target="_blank">we could spend more than a dollar on pasta sauce</a>, spending sixty dollars on a lovely but slightly wobbly serving bowl was just bananas.</p>
<p>Nine years later, I still have the bowl.  I almost never use it&#8211;it&#8217;s been superseded by also lovely but also sturdier wedding presents&#8211;but I just can&#8217;t seem to part with it.  (<em>Pro Tip: There&#8217;s a fine line between being sentimental and being a pack rat.  Probably</em>.)</p>
<p>We <em>are </em>having a garage sale next weekend, so there&#8217;s a chance my Impulse Bowl might find its way out of the basement as someone else&#8217;s impulse buy.</p>
<p>And if that does happen, it will cost a lot less than sixty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your most ridiculous, or most wonderful, or most embarrassing impulse buy?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday Feb 18, I biked from my house across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito and back again. Why? For funsies. Why didn&#8217;t I take the ferry back like almost everyone else? Because <del>I&#8217;m crazy</del> I love exercise.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound too bad and probably isn&#8217;t for a few people or most people visiting my blog, but I&#8217;ll get a few things straight. I was dehydrated and I don&#8217;t bike regularly (yet). In fact, since moving here, I&#8217;ve biked more than I have in the last 10-15 years of my life. If I had biked just once since moving here, that would still be more biking than I&#8217;ve done in the last 10-15 years of my life. Oh wait, I lied about that second part. I used Capital Bike Share twice in DC. I&#8217;ve gone on a few rides here. My longest being 15 miles, but that was broken up between mile 10 and mile 11 by a 2 hour stint laying on the beach. This ride was straight through. Not even a stop in Sausalito!</p>
<p>Here is a map of my general route:</p>
<div id="attachment_681" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paperballpotluck.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/to-saus.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-681" title="to saus" src="http://paperballpotluck.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/to-saus.png?w=300&h=252" alt="" width="300" height="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is only one way. I biked back too.</p></div>
<p>Again, this is only showing the to part of my adventure and I didn&#8217;t take this exact route. This map says 9.6 miles from my address to &#8220;Sausalito, CA&#8221;. My route was actually a bit longer.  I missed a turn when I went through the park, so I added probably another 1/2 mile there. One of the roads was closed to the bridge so I had to go around. On my way back, I went a different way adding another 1/2 mile. And I went past the middle of the town where most people generally turn around. So I think in total my trip was about 21-23 miles. Its biking, not running, so I don&#8217;t think the few miles that were added made much of a difference.</p>
<p>The way back was the worst. My legs hated me. They were screaming for water, calories, and rest. Every hill I had to go up was pure torture. On top of that, the wind really picked up. It blew me toward a few cars which I managed to narrowly avoid. I hope a few bystanders had a good laugh.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. I mean, I ended up getting really sick a few days later and I definitely think that my bike trip in my physical state didn&#8217;t help. Physically, I felt great the few days afterward before I got sick! My legs hated me the next day which doesn&#8217;t normally happen unless I run hills. I had some issues walking up stairs at the movie theater later that night which was comical to my cousin and her friends. Exercise sore is the best sore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the bike now has a flat back tire which I need to learn how to fix soon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this post to be me complaining or about my ride and what I did. I&#8217;ll start with that, but really I want to talk about pain. Not really in the physical sense, but in the mental and emotional sense.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I have never been to Sausalito before. I think that really the only word I can use to describe it is adorable. That is a lie. Wow I&#8217;m just lying left and right in this one. There are other words to use too, but that is what comes to mind right now. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have any photos to share because of my camera situation, so Google it. I plan on making my way back over there some time this summer and taking photos and spending more than 5 minutes there.</p>
<p>Now to the real part  &#8211; the main reason for this post.</p>
<p>I was taking a break mid-hill on the way up from Sausalito to the bridge when I received a text from my friend giving me an update on the score of the Penguins game. I replied telling him that the hills were slowly killing me and his response was &#8220;No pain, no gain&#8221;. I&#8217;ve heard this phrase many times before &#8211; generally for physical activity related things like sports practice, training for things like Iron Man, or even when I was at skating and we talked about falling. I never really considered how it related to other aspects of your life &#8211; the mental and emotional downs you hit as your grow. I spent the rest of my ride thinking about how this little phrase can mean so much when considering your own character.</p>
<p>From the moment your born and your lungs yearn for their first taste of air to your very last breath, pain and gain are part of your life. Though, at birth, your mom is probably in way more pain than you are, but she gets a little person at the end of it, so I think that is fair. As you grow, you learn from your bad experiences. You learn what is and what isn&#8217;t appropriate at school. You learn to fail and how hard work pays off. You learn from feeling disappointed, angry, sad.</p>
<p>Each time you&#8217;re tested mentally, and I don&#8217;t mean through a school exam, you learn how to cope. You gain a greater understanding of the world and how you deal with issues and bad experiences. Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal about myself as a person and what I&#8217;m capable of. What I need. What I want. All of the bad experiences I&#8217;ve had either through work or in relationships &#8211; it has made me stronger.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, actually maybe starting once I graduated, there have been a lot of down moments for me. Dealing with dating someone who was emotionally abusive, moving three times, living in a city that I was not ready for nor did I actually enjoy, being away from my close friends, being homeless for a solid 3 months, dealing with student loan debt, dating, and one of my best friends being hospitalized twice in 3 months for a very serious health issue &#8211; and not being able to do anything about it. I learned how much I can deal with before that mental and emotional stress manifests physically. I&#8217;ll touch on that another time, though.</p>
<p>The point is, I&#8217;ve grown. I&#8217;ve learned. Each and every downfall or hard time I&#8217;ve had over the past few years has made me a much stronger person. Has helped me decide what I want, what I need, and more importantly, what I deserve in a relationship. It has helped me see how to be a good role model or mentor, how to deal with issues at work, and how to grow as a good manager. I&#8217;ve learned to actually be picky when it comes to making friends. Having the wrong people around you affects your life in negative ways.</p>
<p>If I had the choice to make every pain or every hardship go away for the rest of my life, would I take it? No. If there was a way to make sure that every moment I came upon an obstacle, I could just bypass it and get to where I wanted to be, would I use it? No.</p>
<p>That would take the fun out of living and I would be a pretty boring, spoiled person if you ask me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project started out as an attempt to preserve spring herbs.<a href="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mint.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1671" title="mint" src="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mint.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>When I first started my garden, years ago, I was working with this bare hillside covered with brush and weeds.  I didn&#8217;t really have any experience with garden planning and made some strange choices, once of which was to plant a whole bunch of mint.  I liked the idea of mint growing around my garden without me having to do anything, and since it would spread I figured it would take over the space from all the weeds.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>That was about the dumbest idea I&#8217;ve ever had.  Now we have mint <em>everywhere</em>.  Don&#8217;t plant mint in your garden.  Put it in a container, not the ground.  The roots are so invasive, and even when you think you&#8217;ve dug them all up, they come right back.  God forbid you run a rototiller through it &#8212; then all of the roots split into little pieces and sprout new plants, and instead of having a million little mint plants you have ten trillion of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to think of a way to use this ridiculous amount of mint, to turn it into something that would actually make it worth the space in the garden.  Later in the summer, it shoots up pretty purple flower spikes and I put it in our bouquets for the farmers market.  I wanted to find a culinary use for it, though, so I figured I&#8217;d make a mint simple syrup since mojitos are a staple around here during the summer. <a href="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mintsyrup.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1672" title="mint syrup" src="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mintsyrup.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>Oh yeah, that beautiful shade of baby poo green? That&#8217;s why most people put green food coloring in their minty canned goods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never made anything like this before, so I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would turn out.  It&#8217;s good, but if you&#8217;re using it for mojitos I think it works better <em>in addition</em> to the fresh mint than it does as a substitution for the fresh stuff.  The flavor in the cooked syrup is definitely very minty but loses some of that fresh brightness that the leaves originally had.</p>
<p>So while that whole project was going on, I was also working on rhubarb things and finally made <a href="http://hungrytigress.com/2010/05/rhubeena/">the Tigress&#8217;s recipe for Rhubeena</a>, (rhubarb syrup), which is something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for ages now.  It came out perfectly &#8211; it&#8217;s everything that the mint syrup isn&#8217;t, actually.  It tastes tart and bright and turns a stunning shade of hot pink. <a href="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rhubeena.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1673" title="rhubeena" src="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rhubeena.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>At this point, my mediocre herb-preservation project joined forces with the power of rhubarb to make some absolutely stellar cocktails.  You don&#8217;t necessarily have to use rhubeena to make these- any rhubarb product you have around will work.  I even made a couple using some rhubarb pulp leftover from a totally different project.  Rhubarb jam would work.  Technically&#8230; you don&#8217;t even need to use rhubarb as the fruit flavor.  You could substitute any fruit product that makes you happy:  blueberry jam, apricot butter, chopped fresh strawberries&#8230; whatever you want.  The rhubarb is amazing, though, and I highly recommend it. <a href="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rhubarbmojito.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1674" title="rhubarb mojito" src="http://growitcookitcanitdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rhubarbmojito.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>It seems like everyone always looks forward to summer for fun stuff like grilling and fizzy cocktails and eating outdoors.  Spring has always seemed like a some kind of preparatory period leading up to summer, but recently I&#8217;ve been thinking that, you know, the weather <em>right now</em> is totally beautiful, the garden has plenty of nice things going on, and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; late July and August on a farm tend to be so busy that there&#8217;s not much time to stop and enjoy everything.  I&#8217;m embracing spring as the time to celebrate.  The sun is back out.  Make a cocktail and clean the grill off, no reason to wait.</p>
<p>(I know, I know, it might still frost/snow/sleet etc., I&#8217;m starting the party early anyway).</p>
<p><strong>Mint Simple Syrup</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Cindy from <a href="http://www.sbcanning.com/" target="_blank">SB Canning</a> for helping me make sure that this project would be safe to can (she&#8217;s pretty smart about that stuff).  Lots of recipes on the internet for mint syrup that goes in the fridge, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be shelf stable.  This recipe should work for other culinary herbs as well.</p>
<p>cook time: oh&#8230;. 40 minutes including processing time?</p>
<p>makes: a little over 3 half pint jars</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 c. water</li>
<li>3 c. sugar</li>
<li>1 huge bunch of fresh mint, washed thoroughly: I don&#8217;t mean the little teeny bunches that they sell at the grocery store- I mean a big huge handful!</li>
</ul>
<p>This recipe comes together pretty quickly, so you might as well start by bringing the boiling water canner up to a boil right off the bat.</p>
<p>In a nonreactive pot, combine the sugar and water.  Cook on high heat, stirring for a minute or two, to dissolve the sugar.  Add the mint into the pot and cook for 15 minutes on medium heat.  Remove from heat and strain through several layers of cheesecloth or a jelly bag.   Pour into clean half pint jars leaving 1/4&#8243; headspace and process for 10 minutes in a boiling water canner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rhubarb Mojitos</strong></p>
<p>cook time: 5 minutes</p>
<p>makes: 1 cocktail</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>ice &amp; seltzer water</li>
<li>2 ounces rhubeena</li>
<li>1 ounce mint simple syrup*</li>
<li>6 or 7 fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>3/4 of a lime</li>
<li>1 ounce rum</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut the lime into wedges.  In a pint glass, combine the rhubeena, mint syrup, and rum.  Squeeze the lime wedges into the glass to release the juice and then throw them right in there with everything.  Add the mint leaves.  Add some ice.  Top with seltzer water.  Mix well.</p>
<p>*In the past I haven&#8217;t bothered making mint syrup for mojitos, but I think it actually made a significant improvement in the cocktail to do it this way.  If you don&#8217;t want to can a big batch, you could just infuse a small batch of simple syrup with some mint leaves and put leftovers in the fridge.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seth Godin&#8217;s <em>Poke The Box</em> is a quick, easy read.  Unfortunately, I felt after reading it exactly as I did after finishing <em>Tribes: </em>unimpressed.  Though <em>Poke The Box</em> has many rave reviews on sites like Amazon, I think the better medium for the short 83-pager would have been a blog post&#8230; or two.</p>
<p>I also feel the message in Godin&#8217;s <em>Linchpin</em> is overall much stronger and better written.  For example, the lizard brain concept is explained and detailed so well in <em>Linchpin</em> that I felt the short paragraph on page 18 didn&#8217;t do the idea justice.</p>
<p>While I do understand the need for a short read, <em>Poke The Box</em>, for me, was forgettable. What did I just read?  It was meant to be uplifting and inspiring, but for those of us who already have that &#8220;Go!&#8221; drive and Type-A personality, there wasn&#8217;t much new content or material to actually learn from.  Again, this is disappointing because I learned so much from <em>Linchpin.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://alexrister1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5463085970_6abe2de884_o.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2556 aligncenter" title="5463085970_6abe2de884_o" src="http://alexrister1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5463085970_6abe2de884_o.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="578" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/moriartys/5463085970/sizes/o/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Image Credit</a></p>
<p>My favorite reviews of the book come from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/154885277" target="_blank">Brian of GoodReads</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RER6T6JDXF7X7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1936719002&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books" target="_blank">Guy at Amazon.com</a>.  To be fair, there are many more positive comments about <em>Poke The Box</em> than negative.  For example: &#8220;If <em>Poke the Box</em> communicates nothing else, it presents this one message with a megaphone voice: &#8216;Go!&#8217; &#8216;Start now.&#8217; &#8216;The worst thing you can do is nothing.&#8217; Already, I find myself arguing, since I know that just doing things without careful planning first has led to many disasters. But I keep reading because Seth is so insistent, and he has such a large tribe following him, telling me that maybe he&#8217;s worth listening to&#8221; (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R16FVVZERGZWPL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004J4XG0O&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text" target="_blank">Source</a>).  If you lack motivation, as many people do, this may be the book that gets you up and moving.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already satisfied with life and your domination of it, I&#8217;d suggest, especially if you are a diehard Godin fan, that you check out <em>Poke The Box</em> from the library.  Save your $5 to purchase <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-You-Indispensable-ebook/dp/B00354Y9ZU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336579351&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Linchpin</a> </em>instead<em>.</em></p>

<p>Ryan took a few pictures of my new work outfit (with his new Canon 5D Mark II baby &#8211; Thanks Ry)!  I&#8217;m really loving bright pant colours (I now own cobalt, mustard and red pants), and Gap has lots of great options right now (including a beautiful emerald green coloured legging jean)!  It&#8217;s starting to feel a lot more like spring, the bulbs are blooming, its getting warmer outside and we decided to walk along the Park and up Robson to grab a quick (and always delicious) snack at the <a href="http://roamingdragon.com/" target="_blank">Roaming Dragon</a> (<a title="The Roaming Dragon!" href="http://theinspiredbiologist.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/the-roaming-dragon/" target="_blank">again</a>), and this time we snacked on the fried rice balls (of course) and tried the Tuna Tataki Sammys! Deeeelish!  Hop over to Ryan&#8217;s blog to <a href="http://www.thehungryarchitect.com/?p=1059" target="_blank">read his review</a>!</p>
