				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And we&#8217;re back with a new edition &#8211; this time, it&#8217;s Victoria&#8217;s Secret that&#8217;s getting the fire for selling this:</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Victoria's Secret 1" src="http://abcnews.go.com/images/News/ht_victoria_geisha_cc_120925_wblog.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="269" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So Geisha&#8221;, right? Easily the best way VS could have come up with to pay tribute to Japanese motifs and styles, right? Though I doubt that in their minds they actually made the difference between Japan and the rest of Asia &#8211; must have gone something like &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do something <em>exotic</em> for a change!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Well, what about something to do with Asia? That&#8217;s really exotic! They use chopsticks there!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Don&#8217;t they have geishas there too, like super hot fighting foxy ladies?&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Hey, yeah, let&#8217;s use that!&#8221; And of course the model is a white-skinned, blonde woman. <span id="more-181"></span></h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">It gets worse with the description on the right-hand side: &#8220;Your ticket to an exotic adventure: a sexy mesh teddy with flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals. Sexy little fantasies, there’s one for every sexy you.&#8221; Once again, a very diverse set of cultures (Asian ones) is reduced to an exotic stereotype and appropriated for the benefit of white Anglo culture. Not to mention it reeks of sexual fetishizing, insofar as the &#8216;geisha&#8217; identity has been appropriated and reconstructed to match a white sexual fantasy &#8211; that of the mysterious, sexualized Oriental woman. You can&#8217;t understand her culture, so you rip that culture apart and assert your dominance by making the woman a fetishistic stereotype. (It also seems nowadays that <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2009/05/13/geishas-and-whores/">white people would know more about what it takes to make a geisha</a> than people with, you know, <em>actual Japanese roots and knowledge of Japanese culture</em>.)</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And of course there have been tons of people to say this is going too far, that there&#8217;s nothing wrong or racist with this, sometimes citing Japan&#8217;s own geisha culture. Must we be so blind to the reality of power relations that we fail to see how white bastardization of other cultures truly works &#8211; by innocently taking over these cultures and reducing them to trends and cute fashion for white ladies? VS isn&#8217;t promoting here the beauty of Japanese culture and floral patterns; it is instrumentalizing it in the realization of a sexy costume, therefore objectifying the women it attaches to this &#8216;geisha culture&#8217;. People comparing this to a French maid outfit need to get their heads readjusted: the French maid is of course an objectifying costume, but nowhere does it carry the racist overtones the &#8216;geisha&#8217; one does, simply because the white relationship to other white cultures can&#8217;t be put on the same level as its relationship to non-white cultures.We can go back to the movie <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em> to remember this: beyond the movie&#8217;s accuracy in its depiction of &#8216;geisha culture&#8217;, what we see at work there is the taking over by Americans of Japan after WW2, and the often brutal dismissal by Americans of Japanese traditions, replaced with American fantasies about Japan.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And please don&#8217;t come up to me with the argument &#8220;<em>Hey my best Asian</em> (because as we all know, Asian is a nationality, right?) <em>friend has seen this and doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s racist at all</em>!&#8221;. It. Doesn&#8217;t. Work. Having an Asian/Black/any non-white friend gives you no legitimacy whatsoever to consider that something isn&#8217;t racist and to treat it as if it were not problematic for other people because, by doing so, you&#8217;re dismissing the legitimate perceptions of non-white people who feel offended by the act of racism. How difficult is it to get that?</h6>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nfl-logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-267" title="nfl-logo" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nfl-logo.jpg?w=370&h=245" alt="" width="370" height="245" /></a>I&#8217;m as big a football fan as the next guy, but I&#8217;m having a very difficult time generating any real empathy for the position of the &#8220;regular&#8221; NFL officials who are still essentially out on strike.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all in favor of people being properly compensated for their work, but I also believe that the free market economy should have a significant role in establishing what <em>is</em> a fair and equitable rate of compensation for any job.</p>
<p>NOTE: I&#8217;m going to leave out post-season play for the purposes of the following comparisons.</p>
<p>Do you know what NFL officials earn now?  Under the current agreement, NFL officials earn an average salary of $149,000 per year.  This is for a season that runs from August until December; a 5 month work year.  NFL officials are, and always have been, considered to be part-time employees.  By the way, a brand new first-year NFL official earns $78,000 per year.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, Major League Baseball umpires earn an average of $200-300,000 per year.  Now before you scream &#8220;foul&#8221; in favor of the downtrodden NFL referees, let&#8217;s remember that the MLB umpire work year stretches from March (spring training) through October, 8 months.  The MLB umpires are also considered full-time, professional employees.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s compare.  A part-time job which pays $149,000 per year versus a full-time job which pays $200-300,000 per year.  That sounds like a fair balance, particularly considering that in the case of both positions, the league in question pays all of their travel and hotel expenses.</p>
<p>How many of you who are reading this would turn down a part-time job paying $149,000 per year?</p>
<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/goodell1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258" title="Goodell" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/goodell1.jpeg" alt="" width="252" height="200" /></a>Another sticking point in the current negotiations between the NFL and the officials is the league&#8217;s desire to eliminate the current NFL official&#8217;s pension and replace it with a 401k plan.  I have to ask, what other part-time job comes complete with a pension plan in the first place?  The NFL&#8217;s position is that most corporations are doing the exact same thing for their employees.  In fact, Roger Goodell, the Commissioner of the NFL, is not covered by a pension plan.</p>
<p>The officials are apparently okay with this proposal in principle, but in practice they want the NFL to fund their individual 401k plans to the tune of  approximately $38,000 per year.</p>
<p>$38,000 per year.  Did you know that $38,000 per year is <em>more</em> than the current annual median income in the United States?  I worked in the corporate world for over 30 years and I can assure you that I never received a 401k matching contribution anywhere close to $38,000 from my employer.</p>
<p>So where are we?  $149,000 per year annual salary, a part-time job with a 5 month work year, all travel expenses covered, and the company wants to kick in a 401k plan.</p>
<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ref.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-265" title="Ref" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ref.jpg?w=197&h=220" alt="" width="197" height="220" /></a>I have to tell you; that&#8217;s sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me.  And I&#8217;m sure it does to the hundreds of thousands of folks across this country who currently find themselves under- and unemployed.</p>
<p>My advice to the NFL officials who continue to hold out for more:  Either get back to work or tender your resignations so somebody else can take your place.</p>
<p>Time to get on with it, gentlemen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/katong-windows21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="windows" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/katong-windows21.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="338" /></a>Conservation of our heritage is very important in Singapore, perhaps this is one of the few ways to remember the past. Shophouses, both residential and commercial, are important building types in Singapore&#8217;s architectural heritage. Shophouses were designed traditionally a business and dwelling unit with a narrow frontage. My journey on foot took me to places I&#8217;ve never knew they existed in Singapore. Shophouses are pretty much located everywhere here. Emerald Hill, Tanjong Pagar Road, Chinatown, Beach Road, Joo Chiat Road, Club Street, Kitchener Road, Katong, etc. Do you know that shophouses from say, Katong are very much different from shophouses situated in Club Street? There are many architectural styles influencing the design of shophouses, to name a few; Early, First Transitional, Late, Art Deco, Rococo, Edwardian, Neoclassical and Modern. Here&#8217;s a quick guide to identify shophouses.</p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84" title="shophouse blueprint" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85" title="shophouse blueprint 2" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Even windows belong to different types of style period. The Katong Shophouses clearly have a strong Peranakan influence while Club Street Shophouses have an electric mixture of Modern, Art Deco and Transitional styles. Each walkway (around 5-foot width), windows, tiles and colours have a story to tell. Below shows shophouses of the same area in different period of time. Pastel colours were used with little differentiation of individual houses (not to forget huge shop names were craved onto the pillars for easy identification). Now, shophouses are given a new lease of life with fresh coats of vibrant colours, the intensity that somehow reflects their importance, unwilling to let passers-by forget their existence.</p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tanjong-pagar-before-after.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89" title="tanjong pagar before after" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tanjong-pagar-before-after.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="186" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a few interesting dwellings that are hidden along the streets of Katong. The Rococo-styled shophouses along East Coast, built well into 1930s, are very much similar in style from those in Little India. From the facade, they are highly decorative and vibrant in colours. Of course, Rococo was a highly decorative style in the 18th century architecture where a lot of motifs like coral and foliage were used along window frames. Turning into a small road along East Coast Road lies a row of single-storey terraces known as &#8216;barrack houses&#8217;. A flight of stairs leads to the main living floor, a typical style seen in Anglo-Malay bungalows. If you peep under the stairs, you can see that there are spacious living spaces at the basement.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Colours in Chinese architecture are meaningful. While red, blue and green are considered auspicious, the Peranakan Chinese grew fond of green for their porcelain and architecture. Today&#8217;s shophouses have been transformed, serving many purposes such as clan associations, coffeeshops, living spaces, boutique hotels and temples. Took a lot of pictures while walking around. The architecture is simply breathtaking. There are a few good reads about Singapore&#8217;s shophouses in the library which I highly recommend to those who are interested in learning more about our heritage. If you have time, also check out the tours organised by The Original Singapore Walks. (http://www.journeys.com.sg/singaporewalks/index.asp). Personally, I have never been on their tours but their itinerary sounds interesting and  I would love to go for one. The world of shophouses is limitless, be sure to look out for one when you walk around Singapore. <strong>STSG</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://humorinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/googles_14th_birthday-2012-2-hp.gif"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3691" style="margin:5px;" title="Googles_14th_Birthday-2012-2-hp" src="http://humorinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/googles_14th_birthday-2012-2-hp.gif?w=150&h=96" alt="" width="150" height="96" /></a>Today, September 27th, 2012 marks the fourteenth birthday of<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"> Google</a>. (I googled it.) <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> (according to itself) celebrated its eleventh birthday last January 15th. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone </a>(according to a news item in the<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/29/business/la-fi-tn-iphone-turns-5-20120629" target="_blank"> LA Times</a> I used mine to pull up) had its fifth birthday last June 29th. Each of these innovations have changed our world in their own right, but the three of them together have had a kick that reminds me of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon becoming nitroglycerin.<span style="color:#ff0000;">*</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;"><em><span style="color:#ff0000;">*Upon reading, this my husband, who is a walking encyclopedia, (see below) said I forgot to mention hydrogen in the nitroglycerin compound. Rather than throw out the analogy, let&#8217;s pretend hydrogen atoms are the people using the technology.</span></em></p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve been learning to reach for our iPhones to Google Wikipedia,  our humor has become increasingly referential as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane" target="_blank">Seth MacFarlane</a> for example, leads us down ever-more-elaborate halls of mirrors in his hit show <a href="http://www.fox.com/familyguy/" target="_blank">Family Guy.</a></p>
<p>Of course neuroscientists, psychologists and sociologists are studying the myriad ways this ubiquitous digital technology affects us. Some of their findings are surprising, others . . . <em>not so much </em>to those of us old enough to have been firmly entrenched in adult life in the slower, more deliberate, analogue days.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that there&#8217;s less social currency in<em> being</em> a walking encyclopedia in a world where everyone walks around with access to an encyclopedia. But I&#8217;ve noticed something else as well: The more these tools are available, the less I trust my own memory. (<em>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; you say after the nitroglycerin debacle</em>.) Regardless, the less I trust my own memory, the more I double check. The more I double check, the less I <em>commit</em> to memory. . .  and so on.</p>
<p>When it comes to facts at our fingertips, there is a thin line between usefulness and compulsion. Once we cross that line, we become like the guidebook-happy tourist whose <em>every</em> experience either confirms what he read, or <em>will be confirmed</em> by what he is about to read.</p>
<p><strong>We are the last generation</strong> to remember digging through our pockets for change to buy a hamburger instead of swiping a card. <strong>And we are the last generation</strong> to remember searching our <em>minds</em> for facts instead of searching the <em>internet</em>. With that thought, I bring you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Collins">Billy Collins&#8217;</a> 1999 poem <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/forgetfulness/">Forgetfulness</a>.</p>

<p><em>Grounded.  And still so far away from where I want to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Forever longing.  Is this the state of human nature?</em></p>
<p><em>Touching down on solid ground.  Become a part of the elements.  Return to soil.</em></p>
<p>Autumn. Falling into place.  As if I intended it this way.</p>
<p>Dealing with the empty nest by filling it with six laying hens and a rooster just learning to crow.</p>
<p>The scratch and clang of yet another pack rat captured in the have-a-heart trap set under the front deck.  The season of rodents is winding down.   They all want to come in. How plentiful this year has been.  Attracting the added bonus of hawks that have come to heed the call of this bountiful crop, fed full by the warmest, driest longest summer we remember.  Or are our memories always painted more lush than reality was?</p>
<p>And now the coyote, mother and two pups, crossing out on pasture, undisturbed by the running horses.  Mother drops below the horizon, while children linger, distracted by a tall patch of dried grass and the stirring within.  They stop, arch, spring load, and pounce.  Then scamper off to catch up with mother.</p>
<p><em>Mother, mentor, magician or priest.  Someone show me the way when I am a little lost.</em></p>
<p>I write a friend and look for answers and only find more questions:  I tell her there is some darkness that comes over me every fall. Perhaps the change of light. Not a real sadness for the loss of summer, for with that means the arrival of winter and the departure of many things I could do without, and that’s all good stuff. I don’t understand what it could be.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; human nature&#8230; reflective&#8230; wanting more&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Falling.  Down.  Chilling, clearing, washing away…</em></p>
<p>I do my best to fill the emptiness inside, lighten the inevitable darkening.  I keep busy.  There are always things to do.  Laundry, bake, feed the horses, walk the dog, split wood, paper work.  I want more.</p>
<p>Falling leaves.  How quickly the trees let loose of their brilliant display, the grande finale, the dramatic completion.</p>
<p>To be replaced by what?  Barren trees.  Still hillside and silent winds.  Dormancy and hibernation.  The season of turning within.</p>
<p>I find myself sitting here doing nothing.  There is nothing I have to do.  I have never thought that was a healthy state.  I prefer to keep busy, have a full plate, have things that have to be done, deadlines, a little bit of pressure, point and purpose, you know?</p>
<p>How lucky I am to be able to have nothing, you might say.  But those are foolish words.  For who is lucky who is not employed, not doing enough, not with direction and meaning to each day.  I have never wanted ennui, abhor sloth, and fight them and the ensuing poverty that they carry with them as an added burden.</p>
<p>Get out and enjoy it, you say.  The rain holds me back. I’ll find other excuses.  One can’t keep going out “enjoying.”  At some point, responsibilities and realities ruin the fun.  I want to be productive, do something positive.  Yes, even make the world a better place.  Why not?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“I do not have a mansion,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I haven’t any land,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Not one paper dollar</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>To crinkle in my hand</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>But I can show you morning</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>From a thousand hills</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And kiss you</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And give you seven daffodils&#8230;”</em></p>
<p><em>(from an old folk song I once heard beautifully sung around a campfire I never was brave enough to sit near enough to warm my soul)</em></p>
<p><em>How simple can we be</em></p>
<p><em>Forever needing point and purpose</em></p>
<p><em>In this ever changing world</em></p>
<p><em>When some days change does not  come when and where we look for it</em></p>
<p><em>The gears are stuck</em></p>
<p><em>We are left waiting</em></p>
<p><em>The jolt, release, exhilaration of letting go</em></p>
<p>Now what?  We’ve fulfilled our calling in life of providing vacations, searching for something deeper, more meaningful.</p>
<p>Where is the yellow brick road hiding, or how far am I from finding the way?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we say down south, I’m right put out with Paula Dean. Her family, too, especially Uncle Bubba. Diabetes is a terrible thing, I know, and having several family members with the disease, and having the propensity for the affliction myself, I have compassion for the woman on that account. But, diabetes is no call for the wrongs committed against me, my wife, and several friends this past weekend. In fact, given the notoriety and reputation of Ms. Dean, her sons, and her brother, and in the name of all that is Southern, no satisfactory explanation exists for their transgressions.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I attended the International Conference on Information Literacy in Savannah, Georgia. Sounds high-brow, doesn’t it? Well, get this, I, along with two colleagues, gave a presentation at said high-brow, academic conference. Given my red clay roots, after a day of heady, academic discourse and discovery in such a town, low-brow libations and culinary delights were in order. So, we loaded up the crew and headed out for the evening meal. And libations, can’t forget the libations.</p>
<p>Savannah is known for many things, southern, low-country cuisine being at the top of that list. My favorite dinner spot is the <a href="http://www.boarsheadgrillandtavern.com/">Boars Head Restaurant and Tavern</a> on the Riverfront, but we’d eaten there the first night of the conference. Between all of us, we’d eaten at most of the spots in the historic district and the Riverfront, and, as I mentioned, I needed something more down-to-earth to offset the day’s activities. I’d spotted what I thought was a fish camp on a ride down Hwy 80 to Tybee Island, so I suggested we try that, and all agreed.</p>
<p>Now, most of y’all know, I occasionally lag just a tad behind on current events—a phenomenon complicated by the fact that Terri and I don’t have cable or satellite TV. I learn about Snooki, or Honey Boo Boo, or <em>Diners, Dives, and Drive-ins</em> vicariously and then track them down on-line. So, when I saw a sign on the rustic, moss-draped building perched on the banks of a salt water marsh, that read “Uncle Bubba’s,” I thought I’d found southern culinary nirvana. I had no idea whose uncle Bubba was, and didn’t care. All the “Bubbas” I know are the kind of people you can trust, the kind of people who’ll be straight with you, the kind who’ll humbly wipe the rim of the mason jar as they offer you a sip of their moonshine. What could go wrong?</p>
<div id="attachment_108" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://kevinwinchester.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/uncle-bubbas.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-108" title="Uncle Bubba's" src="http://kevinwinchester.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/uncle-bubbas.jpg?w=150&h=112" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sure, it <em>looks</em> Southern&#8230;</p></div>
<p>First, I failed to interpret properly the situation in the parking lot. A majority of vehicles sporting rental tags, New York and Jersey plates. Saw a lady in five-inch velveteen heels, a sequined gown, and more paint on her aging face than Kesey slung on the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Furthur_05.jpg/220px-Furthur_05.jpg">Pranksters’ bus</a>. Not indicative of a down-home, grease-laden fish camp we Southerners know and love. Maybe the line out the door fooled me. Any decent fish camp’ll have that on a Saturday night, and the forty-five minute wait for the table was no shock. Put us on the list, we told them.</p>
<p>During the wait to be seated, I looked over the menu, which had a page or two explaining exactly who Uncle Bubba was, and the family connections and namesakes of several of the “specialty” dishes, all festooned with the Paula Dean cult propaganda. That produced my first twinge of concern… We had somehow landed at <a href="http://www.unclebubbas.com/">Uncle Bubba’s Oyster House</a>, which I now realized carried some level of fame (depending, of course, on one’s definition of fame). Not to worry, I thought, it’s Paula Dean, there’ll be plenty of the usual fish camp fried choices: flounder, salt and pepper catfish, perch, and hush puppies, lots of deep-fried hush puppies. At the standard fish camp, they bring out a bowl as soon as you’re seated, and keep ‘em coming until the food arrives. Surely, the Cholesterol Queen and her brother understood this basic tenet.</p>
<p>But sadly, no.</p>
<p>We placed our orders and waited. And waited. A couple arrived at the table next to ours, but no hush puppies. Their food looked great. They skipped dessert and instead went outside to listen to the band. The hostess led a group of ten Japanese tourists to a large table across from us. They snapped pictures of the menu, the waiter, the driftwood art on the walls, the food when it came, the huge pile of discarded crab leg carcasses, their desserts, and yes, the band playing on the patio. But no hush puppies. And still we waited. And waited.</p>
<p>Finally, the food arrived, accompanied by a mumbled apology that would’ve been much better received with at least a comped dessert or two, and heaping bowls of hush puppies. But no…</p>
<p>Yes, I could turn this into one of those foodie blogs where I review the restaurant and my dining experience, but I won’t. I will say this, what I had, what we had, was not southern cuisine, it was not low-country cuisine, and it certainly was not fish camp cuisine. I ordered my fish fried, of course, but the menu didn’t specify what <em>kind</em> of fish. I asked the waiter, but didn’t recognize the name as any respectable, southern fried fish. I soon realized the only hush puppies you could find in the place belonged to the guy in the polyester pants and Ban-lon bowling shirt. They were on his feet. And the cole slaw? I’ve had relish in Chicago that tasted more southern than what Uncle Bubba threw in my bowl. I even sampled the shrimp and grits Terri ordered—a low-country staple that even the local service stations can prepare to perfection. I’ve fixed better grits at home… from a package… in the microwave.</p>
<p>It was bad on all accounts. And Terri and I dropped fifty bucks on the meal. With no doggie bag, drinks, or dessert, either. Worse yet, I ate as much of what Uncle Bubba (remember, he’s Paula “Roll-me-in-lard-and-Fry-me-in-butter” Dean’s <em>brother</em>) called southern fried fish fare as possible, and there was not one smudge of grease on my plate, my fingers, my napkin, or my lap. The audacity, the sheer, unmitigated gall they had to call this place and its cuisine <em>southern</em>. Blasphemy…<em>blasphemy</em>, I tell you. Maybe it had something to do with Paula’s recent diabetes diagnosis, but that’s no reason to punish the rest of us. Somebody’s gotta say it: Uncle Bubba’s a poseur.</p>
<p>Listen, if you’re headed to Savannah, especially if you’re driving, and you want real southern cuisine, take the Walterboro exit from I-95, just before you reach Savannah. Turn left, go about a mile. On the left, you’ll find <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54486-d1172137-Reviews-Duke_s_Barbeque-Walterboro_South_Carolina.html">Duke’s Barbecue</a>. The parking lot features pickup trucks and late-model beaters with local plates. You’ll see overalls and shift dresses, not a gown in sight. Inside, it’s the instant service of a buffet, and a good thirty or forty feet long, at that. The sweet tea comes from a fifteen-gallon yellow cooler at the end of the line. It’s ten bucks, as many trips as you want. Plenty of fried options, even fatback. You want southern cuisine, this is your spot, not some fancy-smancy poseur place. This place will harden your arteries they way Rhett and Scarlett intended.</p>
<p>And their hush puppies? Southern fried crack, redneck heroin, Xanax for the soul—one taste and you are hopelessly, shamelessly, wiping-greasy-fingers-on-your-Sunday-pants addicted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://carryingthegun.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/chemical_weapon1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944" title="Trench" src="http://carryingthegun.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/chemical_weapon1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="401" /></a></p>
<p>Clarissa Ward: <em>&#8220;When you look back at all the lessons that were learned from Rwanda, from Bosnia in the mid &#8217;90s, and yet here we are in 2012 in Syria, and it feels like we&#8217;re back to square one?&#8221;<br />
</em>Kofi Annan: &#8220;<em>Yeah, says something about us human beings, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Annan replied. &#8220;Do we ever learn? Is it in our DNA to keep fighting each other</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is how an interview concluded with former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on CBS Sunday Morning a few weeks ago. The <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57509058/kofi-annan-the-man-in-the-middle/?tag=mncol;lst;1" target="_blank">entire interview</a> is worth watching. Annan&#8217;s thoughts on diplomacy, the failure of mediation, and the international community are bared raw, and they might surprise you.</p>
<p>This interview and the violence that is flaring up in the Middle East started me thinking about why we fight.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The Army guidance counselor sat in front of his computer, quickly scanning my biographical information and test results. He was hispanic, probably in his late thirties. A Master Sergeant. In good shape and seemingly out of place and uncomfortable at the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) at Fort Hamilton, New York. I remember staring at a pin he wore on his Class B shirt. It was a <a href="http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Badges/expert_infantryman.aspx" target="_blank">long silver rifle on a blue background</a>. I didn&#8217;t know what it meant at the time, but from posters in the recruiting office, I knew it had something to do with the infantry.</p>
<p>He turned to face me in his chair, hands folded in his lap, and like he has done hundreds of times before, said &#8220;So, what do you want to do in the Army?&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied, emphasizing my choice with a firm nod, &#8220;Infantry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held back a smirk and asked me, with apparent slight disappointment, why I wanted to go infantry. I scored well enough on the ASVAB and could have chosen anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t imagine joining the Army and doing anything else&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>I joined the infantry over ten years ago for a number of reasons which vary in degree of intensity. Teenage angst, lack of direction, unfulfilled patriotism, romantic notions of military service, fantasy, college money. If I had to boil it down though to a single thing, I joined for the adventure. A 19 year old kid looking to be a part of something.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. I&#8217;ve seen the white elephant. Most of it&#8217;s pretty terrible. After getting out, my time in college afforded me the opportunity to reflect on my military service. What did it all mean? Was it worth it?</p>
<p>I never figured it out. After five years of sitting on the sidelines the only conclusions I came up with was that I was proud of my military service and I believed in the &#8220;system&#8221; &#8211; for all its flaws &#8211; that sends men and women to war. I knew that I missed the Army and I missed being a part of it. That <a href="http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2012/02/answering-the-silent-call-joining-the-army-twice/" target="_blank">longing</a> was enough to bring me back. And back to the infantry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what it all means. &#8220;It&#8221; being one&#8217;s own service and the way it intertwines with and legitimizes violence. I spend a lot of time in my own mind thinking about it. I&#8217;m sure others do to. To not think about it is to ignore what makes military service unique; the legal authority for and the application of violence. Individuals carry out that violence, so it only makes sense that individuals grapple with that notion and (hopefully) come to a personal solution as to why they can do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why we fight&#8221; is a question that has no ultimate answer. Social scientists can offer a number of reasons as to why &#8220;we&#8221; fight on a macro level, but what about the individual who analyzes the intelligence, fuels the Predator, or pulls the trigger?</p>
<p>That &#8220;why&#8221; can only be answered by the individual. Everyone is going to have a different reason. God, country, family, money, glory, anger. It&#8217;s probably not that simple for most, but rather a mix of things that makes it acceptable. As for me, some days I think I have it nailed down and I can proudly go about my day. Other days I tumble with different thoughts and ideas and have to patch together a jumble of reasons to reach an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the interview with Kofi Annan held my attention. I was completely drawn in by Annan&#8217;s conclusion that maybe we as a species just aren&#8217;t ready to be peaceful. It&#8217;s a sad thought, but it&#8217;s grounded in history, experience, and reality. In his interview, he suggests that there are times when violence might be the only way to reach a solution. It&#8217;s a conclusion that he has reached from decades of experience trying to untangle some of the world&#8217;s most troublesome conflicts.</p>
<p>That interview coupled with the flaring violence across the Middle East seems to indicate that there is absolutely a time for violence. It&#8217;s terrible and not preferred, but it is the status quo. It&#8217;s the way things are. To completely accept violence as the best way to problem solve, though, doesn&#8217;t work for me (that&#8217;s why we have Marines). And to ignore violence or to self-righteously abstain because it is terrible doesn&#8217;t work for me either. I know it does for others, and I respect that decision and I&#8217;m glad that the abstainers exist &#8211; when there are more of them than the rest of us, we&#8217;ll probably be in a better place.</p>
<p>But for the time being the world is as it is, not as we imagine it or hope it to be.</p>
