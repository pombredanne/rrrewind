<p><em>F in Exams</em> by Richard Benson, Chronicle Books, 2011, ISBN: 978-081-187-8319</p>
<p><strong>Plot Summary</strong></p>
<p><em>F in Exams</em> compiles the very best of the very worst student answers on a variety of exams given in middle and high school classes.  The book is divided into examples from the various disciplines, including: Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Math, Business and Technology, Psychology, History and Geography, and English.  A few examples of the type of questions and answers you’ll find are provided here:</p>
<p><a href="http://lahslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/e903_f_in_exams_page.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219" title="e903_f_in_exams_page" src="http://lahslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/e903_f_in_exams_page.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="724" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://lahslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/041211_f_in_exams_book_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220" title="041211_f_in_exams_book_3" src="http://lahslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/041211_f_in_exams_book_3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="490" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Critical Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><em>F in Exams </em>should be available in every middle school and high school library.  It is a hilarious book of wrong answers that students can browse in between classes.  The examples provided here are amazing not just in their wrongness but also in the students’ creativity and sense of humor.  Even when the answer isn’t intentionally funny, it provides an interesting insight into how young people try to logically answer a question without the necessary facts or information.</p>
<p>This may be a stretch, but I think the book also provides a way for students to understand that everyone makes mistakes and that failure is a part of the learning process.  People love this book because on some level they can relate to being in the situation of staring at an exam question and having no clue how to answer it.  We spend all our time celebrating success in school and we need to devote more time celebrating failure.  As Thomas Edison once said, “I have not failed.  I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</p>
<p><strong>Reader’s Annotation</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all been there.  The teacher hands out the quiz or exam and we stare at the first question and have no idea how to answer it.  We can either leave it blank or…<em>F in Exams</em> compiles the very best of the very worst answers students give on tests in Math, Science, English, Social Studies and other classes.</p>
<p><strong>Information about the author</strong></p>
<p>From the author’s page on Amazon.com, we learn that “Richard Benson is the author of several humor books. He lives in London.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://talleygilly.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/early-august-2012-019.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1282" title="early august 2012 019" src="http://talleygilly.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/early-august-2012-019.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>One of my  inverse superpowers is that I am notoriously bad at games.  Did you ever see the movie <a title="The Cooler" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318374/" target="_blank">The Cooler? </a>  It&#8217;s about a guy who is such a jinx that the casino bosses  hire him to &#8220;cool&#8221; down game tables where guests are winning too much money.  This might well be a good future career for me.</p>
<p>Give me Candyland, Old Maid or Go Fish, and I can keep up with the other four- and five-year-olds.  But once you get into normal games that require any skill or strategy&#8211;poker, gin, bridge, Euchre,  I&#8217;m toast.</p>
<p>Before they have played a game with me, most people assume I&#8217;m just being self-deprecating or modest.  I say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t <span style="text-decoration:underline;">play</span> games&#8221; and they hear, &#8220;I&#8217;m not an ace at games.&#8221;   Then they have the experience of a game with me (or worse, are stuck being my game partner) and then the truth shows its ugly head.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to research this, but I was born with the sort of brain that retains useless data such as which actor is doing the voiceover on that luxury car commercial, but has amnesia when it comes to rules or strategy.   You can teach me a game like bridge or Euchre, and I might be able to play a few hands, (badly, of course).  But when you flash forward a month, or a year, and ask me to play again, I will look at you blankly as if you never taught me&#8211;the information has vanished from my consciousness as quickly as chocolate disappears from our kitchen cupboard.</p>
<p>My friend S. is still tramautized by the experience of playing multiple games of Euchre during our trip to Portugal many years ago.  Card games were a great way to pass the time in our pension during the rainy days (of which there were many).   With bottles of red wine and chocolate cookies by our side, we played day after day with our other two friends, and still I kept making errors.  &#8220;You&#8217;re cheating,&#8221; S. would sputter, turning over the previous trick when I had failed to follow suit or performed other illegal infraction.  &#8220;This is RIDICULOUS!  How can you still be doing this?&#8221;   I pointed out that I didn&#8217;t understand enough about the game to be smart enough to cheat.</p>
<p>My husband&#8217;s extended family members are big game players, and I still remember the feeling of dread when I accompanied him to the first family reunion and his mother mentioned all the fun games we would play together.   So I begged off the games and watched from the sidelines.</p>
<p>For people who do not suffer from my disability, games are a great equalizer.  When family members have run out of conversation topics, and need to avoid hot subjects like politics or religion, a game is a fun social activity for older and younger family members alike.</p>
<p>Last weekend, my husband&#8217;s family had their annual family reunion&#8211;a group of about 22 people altogether.  Since my in-laws are well aware of my game disability, I assumed there would be no pressure for me to play in the long-awaited Euchre tournament.   My niece had printed out an elaborate multi-tiered bracket for winners and losers, and I felt a sense of relief knowing I would not be dragging anyone to the Loser&#8217;s Circle.</p>
<p>So when the paper bag of numbers came around for me to select partners, I begged off.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law urged me to pick one.  &#8220;It&#8217;s just for fun,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you understand,&#8221; I said gently, realizing she had never played a game with me.    &#8220;I&#8217;m <em>terrible</em> at games,&#8221; and shared with her my checkered history with Euchre and other card games.</p>
<p>She assured me that there were other &#8220;non-experts&#8221; in the family, and that we&#8217;d review the rules before the tournament.  I protested.  She would not take &#8216;No&#8217; for an answer, and so I picked a number, already worried which family member I would shame.</p>
<p>When everyone compared notes, I saw my sister-in-law&#8217;s eyes grow wide and then she laughed out loud.   She was my partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize in advance for what is about to happen,&#8221; I told her.   &#8220;Just know whatever I&#8217;m doing out there, it&#8217;s not intentional.    I hope we can still be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>We ended up playing my husband and his cousin in our first game.  My sister-in-law was unfailingly patient through a practice hand, despite my many mistakes.  Buoyed by her encouragement, I felt my a strange popping sensation in my brain as neurons began to fire and I began to follow along.  I got into the flow of the game and before I could realize what was happening, we had won.  How could this be?</p>
<p>My sister-in-law and I exchanged high fives and my husband and his cousin drank their beers, shaking their heads in disgust.</p>
<p>At the next level, we were paired with my mother-in-law and one of my nieces.   My nerves got to me, and I fumbled several moves, forgetting the whole concept of &#8220;bower&#8221; and blew the game.   Remembering the verbal smackdown from S. all those years ago,   I expected my sister-in-law to show at least a little irritation at my dismal performance.</p>
<p>But she remained cheery and upbeat, as if it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>And then it hit me.  It <em>didn</em>&#8216;t really matter.  This was a . . . game.  It was supposed to be fun, not torture.  So what if we lost?  No one was going to yell at me or shun me from the family because of my incompetence.</p>
<p>And just like that, I got my mojo back.</p>
<p>After our loss, we were paired again with my husband and his cousin, who rolled their eyes and protested, &#8220;Not again!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the pressure relieved, we played even better in this third game.   In one hand, we got all five tricks, while our opponents watched in horror.   We won again, and my partner and I did victory dances in our seats and high-fived each other after every move.</p>
<p>We ran out of time that day to make it all the way through the tournament, but I could feel the buzz of victory fizzing through me all evening.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy for me to look at myself, at the advanced age of 43, and think that everything is set in stone&#8211;my strengths, my foibles, and the path ahead of me.   But my unusual performance in the Euchre game reminds me that my own story still has so many unknowns, so many angles that I might not expect.   The limits I place on myself, from past experiences, may not be real after all.     My sister-in-law&#8217;s unfailing encouragement and cheerful acceptance of any outcome spurred me on.</p>
<p>It reminds me of that quote, <em>&#8220;What would you do if you knew you could not fail?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This old dog can apparently still learn some new tricks&#8211;at least when it comes to Euchre.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a character arc? </strong></p>
<p>A Character Arc could also be described as the journey.  Remember, every protagonist must have a journey that they experience throughout the storyline.  Sometimes, it can be seen in the development of their character or personality they experience.  Some examples of this are frequently seen in the aspects of their persona—emotional, physical or psychological.</p>
<p><strong>Why does a character need an arc?</strong></p>
<p>A character arc helps to create believable characters that will always have universal appeal.  Without an arc, the character might not be convincing or interesting and could loose the audience.  The lead character must go on some kind of transformational journey.  If you want your audience to identify with your protagonist, create a complex journey for them to take.  Make him or her human.  Ask and answer questions like:  What is the their goal?  Define if it’s emotional or physical.  What do they want (want/desire births action) and how will they change (transform) throughout the story?</p>
<p>Examples:  Luke Skywalker in the First Star Wars film.  He begins his journey as a naïve farm boy with dreams of exploring the solar system. Luke struggles with authority, responsibility and “The Force,” but as the story progresses, obstacles are thrown his way that he has to overcome.   By the end of the film, Skywalker is living the dream.  He’s fighting villains and saving a princess.  How about Elle Woods in Legally Blonde?  She begins her journey on a quest to become Warner&#8217;s wife, a goal that is never met, but interrupted by her journey to FULL TRANSFORMATION, which takes place at Harvard Law School.  Elle ends up at the top of her class, fully realized, with the promise of a job with a top law firm in Boston and the better guy.  What more could a &#8220;not-so-dumb&#8221; blonde girl ask for, right?</p>
<p>*Note:  Character arcs are for the main characters.  Very often the antagonist will have an arc too.  They need to have their own life journey—even if it’s evil, which makes them seem more real-to-life.</p>
<p><strong>How to Figure Out Your Character’s Arc</strong></p>
<p>Many a story begins with a great character. That flash of inspiration that says <em>I have to write a story about this person</em>. Yet, so many stories stall out just short of that all-important finish line. Why is that?</p>
<p>The answer can often be traced to misplaced focus. So much attention is placed on fleshing out the character and providing them with greater and greater sources of escalating conflict, which the basic logic of their actual arc breaks down. In fact, sometimes it’s not even there at all.</p>
<p>Structure your character arcs by asking three pivotal questions:</p>
<p>1) What do they WANT? This is a tangible, attainable goal. Admittedly, it gets interrupted by the antagonist repeatedly, but it is attained in the end.</p>
<p>2) What do they NEED? This is the underlying motivation driving their main want?  The complexity of human psychology often reveals that our outer wants are inversely related to our inner needs. For example, Elle Woods believes that there&#8217;s no other man for her in the world, EXCEPT Warner, however, when she shows up at Harvard Law School, she&#8217;s in for a rude awakening.  Not only does she experience the reality check of her life, she is suddenly aware of how Warren is NOT the guy she thought he was.  She inwardly wants a boyfriend/serious relationship, but it&#8217;s not really with Warren.</p>
<p>3) What&#8217;s the issue with this character?  In other words&#8230;what&#8217;s the FLAW? A flawed character is always going to be more compelling and easier to relate to than someone who appears to be perfect.  That&#8217;s simply not realistic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:  There is a simple dynamic that exists within all Main Characters, defined by the chasm between a problem and a solution.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty-seven years ago on August 6th, the city of Hiroshima, Japan, woke up to a day that seemed like any other. By 8:15am, however, the unthinkable had occurred and Hiroshima&#8217;s residents became the victims of the world&#8217;s first atomic bombing.</p>
<p><span id="more-421"></span></p>
<p>Whatever your beliefs on the motive behind the bombing (was it necessary? was it overkill? did it really change the course of the war?), the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum doesn&#8217;t try to change them. It merely sets out to present a picture of what happened to the city on that fateful day and to that end, it does an absolutely stellar job.</p>
<div id="attachment_422" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 590px"><img class="size-full wp-image-422" title="hiroshima1" src="http://uncoverjapan.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn2531.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A model of the center of Hiroshima before the atomic bomb fell</p></div>
<p>The practical nature of the exhibits is thorough and well-presented &#8211; you learn what led Japan on a path to war, how and why Hiroshima was chosen as a bomb site and the groups of people who were in Hiroshima on the day the bomb was dropped. And then you see the results &#8211; shadows on the steps where a human once sat, an intact lunch box with blackened rice inside, a pocket watch stopped forever at 8:15am. The piles of children’s school uniforms are perhaps the most emotional. Of the A-bombs victims, over 10,000 were middle schoolers who were on work duty in the city center that morning.</p>
<div id="attachment_423" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 590px"><img class="size-full wp-image-423" title="hiroshima2" src="http://uncoverjapan.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn2532.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A model of the center of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb fell</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of information and emotion to process, but when it becomes too much, the best thing to do is wander the Peace Park. On an island in the city center &#8211; the virtual hypocenter of the blast &#8211; a now serene swathe of green covers the once-decimated quarter. Monuments to the victims dot the tree-lined paths. Leukemia victim Sadako Sasaki’s statue, with its surrounding thousands of colorful cranes, beckons you closer to read the messages of peace amongst the origami. Nearby, the flame of Peace flickers brightly, to be extinguished only when the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed. And at the far end of the park, the skeleton of the A-bomb dome, formerly known as the Industrial Promotion Hall, keeps silent watch over the scene.</p>
<div id="attachment_424" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 590px"><img class="size-full wp-image-424" title="hiroshima3" src="http://uncoverjapan.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn2504.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiroshima&#8217;s A Bomb Dome</p></div>
<p>Hiroshima is a loaded word. You can’t say it or hear it without calling forth some image of what happened here on August 6th, 1945. It’s a subject we sort of tiptoe around with our Japanese friends and acquaintances. Yet while Hiroshima could have harbored bitter resentment in her post-bomb years, what greeted me on my last trip instead was a city intent on leading the way down the path to peace and a world free of nuclear weapons. This city may not have the cultural clout of Kyoto or Tokyo, but it&#8217;s worth checking out on a week-long or two-week trip to Japan.</p>
<p>The <a title="Hiroshima Peace Site" href="http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/index_e2.html" target="_blank">Hiroshima Peace Site</a> has loads of information on the museum itself as well as the park.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a photo of me from when I was small, standing in front of a closet door posing in a long cuddly nightgown.  The funny part about the picture is that you can see I’m not even tall enough to hit my head on the doorknob. It’s just amazing to me that I was ever that small.</p>
<p>My parents kept a little tally of my and my brother’s heights on the wall in our basement.  We would stand straight, back flush against the wall, trying to make ourselves as tall as we could manage, as my dad made the little pencil mark above our heads, adding our names and the date.  My brother, three years younger than me, was always inches shorter, until one year, when he was about 11, he shot right past me and never looked back.  When my parents moved from the house I grew up in about 9 years ago, our little measuring keepsake was left behind.  I’m sure the new owners have long since painted over it, since I’m guessing they don’t really care how tall “Kelly” was in 1986.</p>
<p>Now that I have a baby girl growing taller and taller every day, I wanted a place to record all of her precious inches and feet.  Having left behind my own measuring keepsake, I wanted Annabelle’s to be portable and not simply on a stationary wall in our house.</p>
<p>First I thought I would buy one, but after searching in stores and online, I couldn’t find one that I loved.  So, I decided to make one for her.</p>
<p>This is a little sketch of my plan, which was to draw measurements on a board and then paint on some flowers and a large letter A.  As always my crafting is very loosey-goosey.  I have a general idea and then, for better or for worse, I just dive in…</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/keepsake-sketch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1653" title="Keepsake Sketch" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/keepsake-sketch.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>First, I went to Home Depot and bought a piece of wooden molding.  Then Mike and I cut the molding down to 6 feet.  My plan was to hang the piece one foot off the ground, and start the measuring at 12 inches.</p>
<p>Next I drilled a hole in the top of the molding, that I could later fit a nail through to hang the piece.  (I wanted to drill the hole first because my biggest fear was that I would spend all this time painting and decorating the piece, only to have it split right now the middle when I tried to hang it up.)  Then, I sanded the drill hole and the end of the molding where it had been cut.  The below picture shows the lovely floor in our garage, where I did some night painting once The Belle was asleep&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/getting-ready-to-paint.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1654" title="Getting Ready To Paint" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/getting-ready-to-paint.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>Then I painted the wood white.  It took three coats to really cover it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painting-keepsake1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1656" title="Painting Keepsake" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painting-keepsake1.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>When I went to Michael’s to buy the paint to decorate the board, I found this little wooden “A” for $1.99 that I thought would be perfect for the “A” I was envisioning at the top.  When I was painting the board, I also painted the “A” blue.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unpainted-letter-a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1628" title="Unpainted Letter A" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unpainted-letter-a.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painted-a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1632" title="Painted A" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painted-a.jpg?w=441&h=293" alt="" width="441" height="293" /></a></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:left;">After letting the board dry, I used a tape measure to carefully measure out all the inches and feet on the board, which I drew on using a thin-point black sharpie.  (I taped the tape measure to the board using painter’s tape so it wouldn’t move while I was drawing.) As you can see I started the measurements at 1 foot and put in etch marks for every half an inch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/taping-down-tape-measure2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1636" title="Taping Down Tape Measure" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/taping-down-tape-measure2.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>Once I was done, I realized that I wanted the numbers to be a bit bigger, so I traced over each using a regular point black sharpie.  Then using my notes I put in all of Annabelle’s measurements starting with the day she was born.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/measurements-on-keepsake1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1639" title="Measurements on Keepsake" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/measurements-on-keepsake1.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>Then it was time for the fun part…decorating it.  Using two different color blues, I painted some flowers on the board, followed by some swirly green vines and leaves.</p>
<p><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painting-flowers-on-keepsake.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1640" title="Painting Flowers On Keepsake" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/painting-flowers-on-keepsake.jpg?w=490&h=325" alt="" width="490" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>Once all was dry I went back and added a little more detail to each flower.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/close-up-of-flowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1644" title="Close-up Of Flowers" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/close-up-of-flowers.jpg?w=485&h=322" alt="" width="485" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, I put the “A” on using glue dots (I knew glue dots would be enough since the “A” was super light).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/finished-close-up.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1646" title="Finished Close-Up" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/finished-close-up.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>The room that Annabelle is in right now has a chair rail, so I knew I wouldn’t be able to hang it in there.  So we put it in one of the guest rooms.  If we have another little one, Annabelle will move to this room and the new baby will go in the nursery.  We’re kind of envisioning her in this room one day, so we thought it was the best place to hang it.  When we redo this room for her (somewhere down the line) I plan to redo it in shades of blue and white, hence the colors I chose for the keepsake.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/measuring-keepsake-hanging1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1649" title="Measuring Keepsake Hanging" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/measuring-keepsake-hanging1.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>When we showed it to Annabelle, she was so excited.  We taught her how to stand with her back up against it so we could measure her.  Now whenever we go into the room where it’s hanging, she immediately backs up and stands straight, ready to be measured.  It’s pretty adorable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/annabelle-getting-measured.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1651" title="Annabelle Getting Measured" src="http://cobwebscupcakesandcrayons.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/annabelle-getting-measured.jpg?w=343&h=516" alt="" width="343" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>It’s already amazing to see just how small she was when she was first born, versus now.  I can only imagine how incredible it’s going to be as the marks continue to climb higher and higher with every precious inch she grows.</p>
<p>How do you record your child’s sweet inches and feet?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/7734fe625931e9c6799766d377f3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1598" title="norma jean." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/7734fe625931e9c6799766d377f3.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="498" /></a></p>
<p>August 5th 2012 marked 50 years since the passing of Marilyn Monroe. 50 years on and people still adore her. For me, the fascination lies in the unknown&#8230; in not understanding what was really going on behind her doe eyes. Fame is fickle and it feels strange to me that someone I have never met, nor even seen in the flesh, can be so hypnotising. Because of people like me, there&#8217;s a market to tell Monroe&#8217;s story, along with the stories of other Hollywood personas who reached dizzying infamy.</p>
<p><em>My Week With Marilyn</em> was a recent cinematic release based on the book <em>The Prince, The Showgirl and Me </em>by Colin Clark. These are Clark&#8217;s true recounts of events from a week on set with Marilyn during which he had varying interactions with her. While this movie is not Monroe&#8217;s biography, it told her story perfectly. Perhaps this was because Michelle Williams did the role such justice. I’ll be honest, no matter how well written the script, as a fan of Monroe I probably wouldn’t have been able to enjoy this movie if I didn’t believe or enjoy the work of the actress cast in her part. I have always found Michelle Williams to be a captivating and meticulous actress but I was admittedly skeptical. However, she knocked this one out of the park Joe DiMaggio style! It helped that she had incredible support on-screen, including Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Dougray Scott (pictured with Williams below) flawlessly filling the thick rimmed glasses of Arthur Miller.</p>
<p>It was heart wrenching to witness the obvious emotion and longing shown by Williams, blanketed by the false confidence provided when assuming the role of &#8217;Marilyn&#8217;. In honour of Monroe and Williams’ stellar portrayal of her, I have listed my five favourite Hollywood actors/actresses playing other famous personalities. Williams is obviously my number 1.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" title="williams and scott in my week with marilyn." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2011_my_week_with_marilyn_004.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="876" /></p>
<p><span id="more-1597"></span>So that brings me to number 2. Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Elvis Presley in the TV movie <em>Elvis.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/elvis-une-etoile-est-nee_portrait_w858.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602" title="meyers as presley." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/elvis-une-etoile-est-nee_portrait_w858.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="758" /></a></p>
<p>Elvis, like Monroe, has had and will continue to have his story told time and time again. Big names have portrayed Presley such as Kurt Russell (who I also adore) but it was the curled upper lip of Meyers who truly convinced me he could be the King.</p>
<p>Number 3. Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in <em>Walk the Line.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1606" title="walk the line." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/5.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>And for that matter, Reese Witherspoon as June Carter-Cash as well. I&#8217;m not the biggest Cash fan but I do think Phoenix and Witherspoon told their story beautifully. Phoenix was such a spot on casting move.</p>
<p>Number 4. James Franco as James Dean in the TV movie <em>James Dean.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james-dean-and-james-franco.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1607" title="franco as dean." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james-dean-and-james-franco.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="851" /></a></p>
<p>These two heart-throbs certainly share more than just the first name. Franco plays the rebel without a cause with such ease, that you don&#8217;t for one second doubt he could actually be James Dean.</p>
<p>Number 5. Greg Kinnear as John F. Kennedy in <em>The Kennedys.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tv_the_kennedys_147600581.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1609" title="kinnear as JFK." src="http://frannielovesmarie.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tv_the_kennedys_147600581.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="583" /></a></p>
<p>I remember seeing the shorts for this TV miniseries and being blown away by the resemblance between JFK and Kinnear. Kinnear is a charming actor and fit the bill for this role perfectly.</p>
<p>Okay so I said my top 5 but I do have to list Cate Blanchett here. Anyone as fair and ethereal as her who can pull off both the strong and glamorous Katharine Hepburn (in <em>The Aviator</em>) and grungy Bob Dylan (in <em>I&#8217;m Not There</em>) has to get special mention.</p>

<p>In preparation for our attempt to climb a 20,000&#8242; Bolivian peak, <a href="http://jennybennett.net/2012/07/23/high-altitude-golf-and-other-oddities/">we had acclimatized for six days at elevations around 12,000 feet.</a> The next step was a two-day trek in the Condoriri, a mountain range located not far from La Paz. The name comes from the resemblance of the central peaks to the head and shoulders of a condor&#8212;a likeness you have to squint quite a bit to see in the photo above.</p>
<p>We would camp at Lake Chiarkota, elev. 15,252&#8242;, and climb over a pass at around 16,000&#8242; beside a peak called the Mirador. The trek was organized by La Paz-based guide Hugo Berrios. Tents and gear were carried by donkeys that would ferry these items back out the second morning, while Hugo continued on with us.</p>
<p>We started at Lago Tuni, a lake at 13,775&#8242;. The area seemed bleak and monochromatic, but snowy peaks beckoned on the horizon. Steve, Bob, and I kept a close eye on our altimeters, looking out for the point at which we would climb higher than our previous lifetime high point, the summit of Mt. Whitney (14,505&#8242;). We passed this momentous point at an inconspicuous stretch along the valley. The llamas and alpacas watched us curiously.</p>

<p>We arrived at Lake Chiarkota in the late afternoon. Already a chill had touched the air, and we were glad to have plenty of warm layers for this July trek. The lake was a beautiful glacier-tinted shade of blue.</p>

<p>The next morning we climbed a steep grassy slope above the lake.</p>
<div id="attachment_499" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://jennybennettdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bolivia-lake-chiarkota.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-499 " title="Bolivia - Lake Chiarkota" src="http://jennybennettdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bolivia-lake-chiarkota.jpg?w=448&h=307" alt="" width="448" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Climbing above the lake</p></div>
<p>I was pleased to find that the altitude wasn&#8217;t bothering me. We crossed some steep scree fields.</p>

<p>Hugo was a great guy to have with us, very friendly and helpful. He&#8217;s done a lot of technical climbing in the Condoriri.</p>
<div id="attachment_501" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://jennybennettdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/condoriri4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-501 " title="Condoriri4" src="http://jennybennettdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/condoriri4.jpg?w=448&h=678" alt="" width="448" height="678" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hugo Berrios, our guide</p></div>
<p>The scenery was almost beyond description.</p>

<p>As we returned toward Lago Tuni, we encountered some small farms. Life in this cold, severe world of the Altiplano can&#8217;t be easy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just rounded on the big 5-0. Sure feels good!</p>
<p>No, I’m not celebrating my  age – that’s a few years off – it’s my goal of reading 75 books in one year. In seven full months I’ve read 50 books and if all goes well I should clear my New Year’s goal and perhaps then some.</p>
<p><a href="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/book-geek.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-91" title="book geek" src="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/book-geek.jpg?w=150&h=97" alt="" width="150" height="97" /></a>In looking at the list of books that I’ve thus far got under my belt – or at least filtered into my brain – it’s quite an eclectic list. But then it would be, considering that I was challenging myself to read the many books that I’ve got in bookcases around the house that I’ve been meaning to read. Along the way, though, I picked up a couple from the used bookstore, from the new books store, through my audio book collection and from friends who have kindly given me some of their favorites.</p>
<p>Here how the books stack up thus far:</p>
<p>30 fiction</p>
<p>20 non-fiction</p>
<p>Nine of the books deal with Nevada and the West because I am admittedly a genealogy nut and several of the books on hand are those that have been given to me or purchased by me to learn more about the land my two sets of great-great grandparents emigrated to in the 1860s. Those titles include:</p>
<p>Comstock Women: The Making of a Mining Community Edited by Ron James and Liz Raymond; Saucer Eyes by Eulah Croson Lauckes; The Deep Blue Memory by Monique Urza (Laxalt); The Money &amp; the Power by Sally Denton &amp; Roger Morris; <a href="http://playfulmeanderings.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/muir-enchantments/" target="_blank">The Mountains of California</a> by John Muir; Where Are All the Magpies? By Patty A. Melton; William Morris Stewart (various authors- Nevada Historical Society); The Ox Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark; Sun Mountain by Richard S. Wheeler.</p>
<p>Thirteen of the 50 I consider literary classics. Though an English major many moons ago in college, the emphasis was on writing, not literature, so these remained unread until this reading binge came on. In alpha order they are:</p>
<p><a href="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/book.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-92" title="book" src="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/book.jpg?w=150&h=112" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>Candide (Voltaire)</p>
<p>Emma (Jane Austen)</p>
<p>Fairy Tales (Hans Christian Andersen)</p>
<p>O! Pioneers (Willa Cather)</p>
<p>One of Ours (Willa Cather)</p>
<p>Roughing It (Mark Twain)</p>
<p>Short Stories (F. Scott Fitzgerald)</p>
<p>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (unk)</p>
<p>The Age of Innocence (Edith Wharton)</p>
<p>The Legend of Sleepy Hallow (Washington Irving)</p>
<p>The Odyssey (Homer)</p>
<p>The Red Badge of Courage (Stephen Crane)</p>
<p>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin (Harriett Beacher Stowe)</p>
<p>OK, I admit, I did read the Odyssey back in the day, but it is very much worth the re-read.</p>
<p>A few spiritual ones – or at least books that explore other religions &#8212; sped on my reading bender: Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller, The Year of Living Biblically by A.J. Jacobs, and Postville by Stephen Bloom. Bloom’s book is not actually spiritual, or religious, but is a study in Orthodox Jewish-Midwest Iowa relations. Still, educational in terms of orthodox beliefs. One other self-help book to add to the melting pot was The Majesty of Calmness by William George Jordan.</p>
<p>Biographies. Oh, I’ve read a few. Eight people who probably seldom if ever met – Steve Jobs (by Walter Issacson); Memories of a Holocaust Rescuer (Irene Gut); Then Again (by Diane Keaton); Chronicles I (by Bob Dylan); <a href="http://playfulmeanderings.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/chasing-dreams-achieving-a-life-with-ingenuity/" target="_blank">Killing Bono: I was Bonno&#8217;s Doppelgänger</a> (Neil McCormick) and the three bios from my Nevada list. Now, tell me, should I have Walden by Henry David Thoreau in with biographies or under classics? Maybe that one can be termed classically autobiographical. But by that standard, so then would be Roughing It, by Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Along the way, I read a few “juvenile” books that our daughters have wanted me to check out. The Indian in the Cupboard (by Lynne Reid Banks), The Book Thief (by Marcus Zusek) and the Secret Dragon Society (by Adeline Yeri Mah).</p>
<p>I like my historical novels by the wheelbarrow load. So far, besides those mentioned above,  my list includes Brighton Beach Boys in the Radio Service about World War I, The <a href="http://playfulmeanderings.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/constant-companions-friends-and-books/" target="_blank">Dovekeepers</a> set in the first century in Israel, The Other Boleyn Girl occurring in 16<sup>th</sup> century England, Mary Barton set in 19<sup>th</sup> century England’s Industrial Age, and I Heard the Owl Call My Name about Canadian Native life. One further book that is actually non-fiction, but reads like a novel because it’s knitted together so well, was <a title="Manhunt" href="http://playfulmeanderings.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/when-it-comes-to-reading-its-our-thing/" target="_blank">Manhunt</a>, about the quest to track down John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p><a href="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/holmes.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-94" title="holmes" src="http://playfulmeanderings.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/holmes.jpg?w=148&h=150" alt="" width="148" height="150" /></a>I threw in two Arthur Connan Doyle Sherlock Holmes books: A Study in Scarlett and The Hound of the Baskervilles. And one science fiction – the Invisible Man by H.G. Wells.</p>
<p>Human beings need their comedy – though these are plainly outdated,  I do enjoy PG Wodehouse and therefore read My Man Jeeves and the Adventures of Sally.</p>
<p>Two disappointments (and this is why I avoid a lot of best sellers) were The Mermaid’s Chair by Sue Monk Kidd (so sad, because The Secret Life of Bees was exceptional) and Wicked by Gregory Maguire. Truly insipid.</p>
<p>Rounding the 50 out were two books on economics that I do so highly recommend: Boomerang by Michael Lewis and Nickeled and Dimed: On Not Getting By in America by Barbara Ehrenreich.</p>
<p>Do I have a favorite? I cannot choose from one of my “children,” though a couple will be relegated to the attic and some of the others may get a further review on this blog. So far, it’s been a fun and rewarding book journey. I’m proud of myself for setting this goal for 2012 and honestly looking forward to augmenting this list with oodles of titles in the next five months of the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://confederacyofspinsters.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mysterydategameboard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-663" title="MysteryDateGameboard" src="http://confederacyofspinsters.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mysterydategameboard.jpg?w=300&h=207" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a>My paranoia runs deep. I doubt this comes as any surprise to you, kittens. A girl who is afraid of <em>Australia</em>, for Christ’s sake, is bound to have some issues. I also won’t go camping without skewers (oleander poisoning), don’t like the swing rides at amusement parks (dangling wires cutting off unsuspecting extremities), and have single-handedly ruined my friends’ love of mushrooms (carcinogens). What I didn’t realize until recently is that my paranoia invades my love life, as well.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s be real. It’s not paranoia, is it? It’s fear. Fear of this, fear of that. Fear that actually comes off as charmingly well-informed and idiosyncratic in most cases. Once I explain the existence of a deadly fish that looks like a freaking <em>rock</em>, don’t you have some reservations about that Down Under vacation? I can logic the hell out of any emotion. It’s the scientist in me.</p>
<p>Relationships weren’t covered in Biology 201, however. There are no rules, no logic, when it comes to being interested in another person. Even my Interpersonal Comm classes are no help. Do you know how hard it is to actually tell if a guy’s pupils have dilated? Bloody impossible, especially if you’re also trying to gauge body mirroring <em>and</em> keep up witty banter. Cut to last week, when I ended up in the hometown of Professor McGregor, who—holy vampire babies!—wanted to know if I could meet up.</p>
<p>So, we met up. He gave me a tour of the house he just bought, he took me to dinner at a great Tex-Mex place, and we swapped stories of our misspent undergrad careers. Then, he kissed me.</p>
<p>Y’all, he <em>kissed </em>me.</p>
<p>Like, up against a wall, straight-out-of-my-literary-fantasies kissed me. The next hour after that is kind of hazy, but I can definitely say pulses were elevated. His eyes were probably dilated too, but I was too busy melting every time I looked into them to notice. Also, I have a whole post on beards coming soon, because<em> that</em> was a revelation.</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Grace meets a boy. Boy thinks Grace is neat. Boy and Grace go all Wesley &amp; Buttercup in the Fire Swamp on their first date. Awesome. Another word for it, however? Terrifying. I am so damn terrified.</p>
<p>I left the professor’s house all giddy and arrived home two hours later scared out of my mind. What the hell just happened? What’s going to happen next? What if, while I’m gone for the next two weeks of West Coast shenanigans, he meets someone else? What if he thinks I’m an awful kisser and never wants to see me again? What if my makeupless face terrified him and he is presently still having nightmares, because did you know that making out with a bearded man results in the disappearing of one’s Laura Mercier armor?</p>
<p>So much fear. What it all comes down to is this: I’m so damn scared that I’m going to like him more than he likes me. Sure, that goes against every feminist fiber of my being that shouts <em>“Grace! If he doesn’t like you, he isn’t worth it!” </em>but it remains the truth. Because, y’all, I really like him. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been this into someone, especially not so quickly. I’ve had great conversations and I’ve had really great make-outs in my time, but Professor McGregor…</p>
<p>He’s something else entirely. People talk about relationships like they’re games, something we win or lose. If only it were that simple. I <em>rock</em> at board games. This, however, doesn’t feel like a competition. This feels like I just jumped out of a plane (something else I will never, not ever do) and am starting to question that parachute. Worse, there are no ladders to balance out this potentially malfunctioning chute. I need a map legend; I need some game instructions. What I’d really like is a time machine, so I could fast forward a few months and see if all this worrying is worth it. I’d settle for some words of wisdom, even if it’s just: <em>Calm the hell down, Grace</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">- Grace</p>
