				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://figuringoutfulfillment.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reed_broadcast-test.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1758" title="Emergency Broadcast System" src="http://figuringoutfulfillment.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reed_broadcast-test.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be the announcer for the Emergency Broadcast System.  I was fascinated with the periodic tests of the EBS that aired on local television stations.  The dire sound of the two-tone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emergency_Alert_System_Attention_Signal_20s.ogg" target="_blank">Attention Signal </a>&#8211; purposely designed to feel uncomfortable to the human ear &#8212; the button-down seriousness of the announcer assuring us that this was &#8220;only a test&#8221; (even as an eight-year-old I could hear the implied &#8220;. . . this time!&#8221;) &#8212; every time I heard these, I stopped whatever I was doing and focused on the TV.  Even when I was too young to understand the implications of &#8220;a national emergency,&#8221; I sensed grave danger in the message.  Once I had learned about ICBMs and instant vaporization, mushroom clouds and fallout, the images I could then attach to the &#8220;test&#8221; made it all the more threatening, like the click of the hammer on an empty chamber in a game of Russian Roulette.</p>
<p>Two or three times while changing channels, I happened to turn to a station in the middle of broadcasting the test, so I missed the opening &#8220;only a test&#8221; voiceover and sat through twenty-five horrifyingly anxious seconds of the Attention Signal, wondering if this time it was the real thing and we were all going to die in a burst of nuclear fire.  It was like reading a Stephen King novel while riding a roller coaster, all in less than half a minute.  And then the announcer&#8217;s voice came on, and he let us all know that this had been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System, and we could get on with our lives.  For now.</p>
<p>Before I was even out of grade school, I <strong>wanted</strong> that announcer&#8217;s job.  I learned his script by heart, and said it out loud along with him during the test.  I can still repeat the message, and when I do I feel that same sense of authority and guidance that I associated with that announcement when I was a kid: <a href="http://figuringoutfulfillment.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/this-is-a-test1.docx">Click Here To Hear</a></p>
<p>Yes, that Attention Signal gave me a frisson of terror every time I heard it, but the announcer was always there to assure us that it was only a test, that we would get through this.  In fact, even if worse turned to worst, then, while he couldn&#8217;t do anything to prevent the cataclysm, he would be there to tell us where to go for news and official information.  But it never came to that, and really, what the announcer did every time was tell me that there was nothing to be scared of.</p>
<p>For almost as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be that person, in a way that seems almost irrationally disconnected from anything I actually did that was career-oriented.  Pre-med in college; teaching and marketing in Japan; practicing as a lawyer &#8212; none of that had anything to do with broadcasting or voiceover work.</p>
<p>But this week, a new class of students has entered school, and they&#8217;ve come to our career services office in varying degrees of good-hearted panic.  They&#8217;ve shared with me their hopes of finding the right job and career and their fears that they won&#8217;t, that they don&#8217;t have the right resume or connections or can&#8217;t network or don&#8217;t even know in which direction they should be moving.  And as I sat with them and spoke to them and assured them that they will get through this just fine, that the world is not coming to an end, and, here, let me pass along this news and official information &#8212; I realized that maybe, in a way, I have become the Emergency Broadcast System announcer I always wanted to be.  Relax, everyone.  This is just life.  This is only a test.</p>

Professional. Authoritative. Presidential. Safe.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama&#8217;s acceptance speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte was&#8230;okay.</p>
<p>I expected more.  I expected passion.  I expected fire.  Or did I?  Things have changed a lot since that day in Denver 4 years ago.  Gone was the intensity.  Make no mistake, last night the President made a quality speech.  About the issues that speak to me.  He&#8217;s my President. I will likely vote for him again.  It&#8217;s just that&#8230;there was something missing.</p>
<p>I tossed and turned in bed last night and continued to try to put my finger on what it was about the speech that let me down.  At the end of the day, for me, the speech lacked the heart and soul, the immediacy of speeches I&#8217;ve seen this President give in the past.  That Bill Clinton set the bar perhaps too high the day before is inconsequential.  Obama just didn&#8217;t bring it last night.  In fact, I haven&#8217;t seen him bring it in a while.</p>
<p>Obviously I don&#8217;t know the man personally.  But every fiber of my being is certain he is a good, decent, caring and compassionate man.  I am very glad he is our President and hope he gets reelected.  What disturbs me is the lack of passion.  This is not the same man I voted for.  Why?</p>
<p>I want to believe it is because the gravity of being the leader of the free world has sobered Obama.  Whereas Bush forty-three blindly fumbled through his presidency, I really believe Barack Obama gives a damn about what he is doing and how it affects people around the world.  That he reads 10 letters from citizens a night speaks volumes.  I think politician Obama passed away sometime in the last four years and President Obama was born.  I want to believe that the incomprehensible weight of the decisions the man has to make on a daily business has tempered his enthusiasm for hyperbole and rhetoric.  Look at his face in that famous picture where he and his staff are monitoring the Bin Laden mission.  Compare that face to the one of Bush 43 being told the World Trade Center was attacked.</p>
<p>I wanted to see the guy I saw in Denver last night.  That guy didn&#8217;t show.  I hope the guy that showed last night continues to grind away at what he cares about for the next four years.  I&#8217;m afraid the reality of the responsibilities, of the bitter political in-fighting, of the often frightening daily security briefings, have taken their toll on the man who inspired a nation 4 years ago.  I hope President Obama can reach down, for his own sake, and rekindle some of the fire that he once had.  I hope he can believe in himself again&#8230;as so many of us have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As if you could not guess, gentle reader, I am something of a bibliophile.  By this I do not mean that I collect beautiful, leather-bound volumes of first editions, nice as those are.  I mean that I love and collect books in many different subject areas, fiction and non-fiction, all of which I actually read AND display.  I am the sort of person who winces when he reads of decorators purchasing bulk lots of books by the yard from secondhand bookshops, graded by size, to fill up the shelves of someone whose taste in literature is generally limited to the airport newsstand variety of novel.  And more often than not my books have come to me via someone else&#8217;s previous collection.</p>
<p>On the British sitcom &#8220;Black Books&#8221;, bookshop owner Bernard Black is generally in an impenetrably foul mood.  He hates his customers interrupting his reading, smoking, and drinking, usually getting rid of these interlopers as quickly as possible.  And he has only two friends to speak of: his long-suffering shop assistant and flatmate Manny Bianco, and their mutual friend and fellow alcoholic/chainsmoker, Fran Katzenjammer.  If you have never seen the series, it is a wonderful mix of black comedy, misanthropy, and surrealism.  It is also about the love of books.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why Bernard gets so fed up with the people who paradoxically both allow him to continue to have books to read, while at the same time they stop him from reading so he can serve them.  Many people in secondhand bookshops are more interested in browsing than buying, and if they do buy they rarely pick up anything more than one book at a time.  The amount of effort required for the shop owner to realize a sale is so much greater than the actual reward, that Bernard does not really care.  In one episode for example, when Manny has successfully managed to shift a large quantity of the stock through good salesmanship, Bernard becomes despondent since he will now have to contact a book supplier to send more books, something which he hates doing and, thanks to his customer handling technique, he almost never has to do.</p>
<p>I know of a bookshop in Barcelona with a proprietor not unlike Bernard in his way, where a few years ago I managed to purchase a book by my great-great-grandfather.  It is probably my most valued book in a rather extensive library (a collection still split between my current residence and my childhood home), since my ancestor inscribed it and gave it as a gift to a friend of his.  The following year I returned to see whether they had any more of his books, but instead of dealing with a pleasant and helpful young shop assistant as I had the previous visit, this time the old man himself quite literally shooed me out of the shop and refused to see whether he had anything: he was too busy smoking his pipe and talking with another elderly fellow.  Needless to say I have never returned there, as tantalizing as their stock is.</p>
<p>Another secondhand bookshop I know here in Washington is somewhat different in its view of its stock, for if you purchase four books you may take a fifth, free &#8211; lowest value, of course.  As it is run by a non-profit with a fairly high rate of book turnover, it does a reasonably brisk trade, and there are always new finds being placed on the shelves by the elderly ladies that work there.  I am particularly fond of tracking down rather technical history and architectural/artistic theory books, or English translations of lesser-kn0wn works by Balzac, and often have success at this shop.  Yet here again, one of the women behind the desk strikes me as a bit suspicious of her patrons, and a bit slow to serve, more interested in what she is reading than in serving.</p>
<p>Perhaps this has to do with the sort of person who would be attracted to working in a bookshop in the first place, or more particularly to working in a used bookshop.  People who love books often are only understood by other people who love books.  One can imagine that the scriptorium of a medieval monastery must have been somewhat similar to a secondhand bookshop in this respect, with some of the monks lingering lovingly over the words they were copying, or the librarian himself keeping choice books back for his own, private enjoyment.  In fact, one of the reasons Umberto Eco&#8217;s &#8220;The Name of the Rose&#8221; was such an engagingly-written tale was that it tried to capture that love &#8211; albeit an obsessive, unhealthy love &#8211; of the accumulation of more and more books, which has not really changed over the centuries.</p>
<p>At the moment back at the manse I have a stack of books which I have not yet read, and which I know I need to tackle, and I will definitely take the sensible option of getting through all of them before I even think of accumulating any more.  Yet even as I do so I cannot help but think about what books I want to read which are missing from my collection, or what wonderful discoveries of books or authors I have never heard of might be waiting for me at a secondhand book shop, charity shop, yard sale, or the like.  Unlike most addictions, the love of good books does not make one less, but rather more, of who you already are &#8211; provided, of course, that you try your best to be polite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="aligncenter"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7943818100_6b13326908.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter">This week, for the first time since he died almost 20 months ago, I&#8217;ve experienced sadness, disappointment and loneliness <em>independent</em> from the mourning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Usually, all of my moods have been a cocktail of emotions with the primary ingredient being sadness over his death. To put it more specifically (and to continue the awful metaphor &#8212; oh god, I&#8217;m laughing it&#8217;s such a bad metaphor) his absence sits like ice cubes, always, in every single drink: taking up space, dominating, clunking up against my lips, making noise against the sides of the glass, excruciating to swallow, melting into and diluting all the other elements.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But this week was different. I realized I was feeling shitty all on my own. 100% Ruth&#8217;s Life Crap. That&#8217;s progress, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A part of the ice cubes is that I haven&#8217;t noticed myself feeling as much empathy as I did in years past. I see painful things happening, just like we all do, but it&#8217;s like my emotional quota is full &#8212; like I&#8217;ve been maxed out.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Today, this began changing, as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A family I&#8217;m acquainted with is experiencing events which I&#8217;ve read about through Facebook and the dad&#8217;s blog. I haven&#8217;t asked for permission to link to his site; so, I apologize for being vague. Also, since language is powerful, I&#8217;m hesitant to assign labels to what is going on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What I can say is, reading his words this morning struck me deeply.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For the first time in a long time, my tears are for someone besides myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Sometimes I think: stop. Just stop. Breathe. Something sacred is happening right now. Be quiet. Pay attention. But the autopilot (sheep) in me continues scrolling down the Facebook feed viewing image after image until, before I know it, I&#8217;m clicking the &#8220;like&#8221; button under some photo of a puppy. And so &amp; so&#8217;s swim team are season champions&#8212;&#8211;wait, what happened to stopping? Sacred moments pass (acknowledged or not). The treadmill keeps going.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think in whispers: <em>I don&#8217;t know what to do</em>. I don&#8217;t know why we die. I don&#8217;t know how some people are taken in a flash while others endure long, slow-motion battles for every moment of comfort, for any fraction of hope.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think in aches rather than words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>The father I mentioned above closed his post today with this, &#8220;For now, our mantra is as always: enjoy each other while we can.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m in awe.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly reminded of how grateful I am for the fun I had with my friend. We did enjoy each other, while we still could.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And here are my ice cubes again. I&#8217;m tiny in a giant glass, clinging to a frozen chunk, it&#8217;s the only thing keeping my head above the surface. I ignore the freezing burns on my arms and chin, and hold more tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I see the treadmill. I see the people crying. I see the puppies and the swim teams. I hear the speeches. I hear the ice cubes. I hear the prayers and the tweets.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That staircase in the photo, see it? The music before you go up is awfully good. But no one comes down from there. People will tell you they have the inside scoop, they have <em>signs</em>, they have Jesus(!), they have <em>conviction </em>that what&#8217;s at the top of those stairs is &#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Sometimes my thoughts come as shouts: STOP. YOU KNOW DON&#8217;T KNOW.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, let&#8217;s just breathe for a minute.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Let&#8217;s enjoy each other while we can.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://iheartchange.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/love-story.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1201" title="Love-Story" src="http://iheartchange.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/love-story.jpg?w=300&h=235" alt="" width="300" height="235" /></a>Girls of every age and marital status have been told to make a list of characteristics and traits that are important in their future spouses. The list is meant to help weed out those that don&#8217;t fit the trajectory of the woman&#8217;s life and open her eyes to seeing more clearly. Somehow I missed this memo or put off this assignment, or maybe the dog at my paper, because I don&#8217;t have a list anywhere.</p>
<p>Part of the (real) reason this list doesn&#8217;t exist is because I don&#8217;t like dating, so I don&#8217;t do it, so I never have needed to answer the question <em>What are you looking for</em>? before.</p>
<p>I went years and years without dating at all. After two pretty serious relationships in my late teens/early twenties, I gave it up and never looked back. I lived my life, opened doors to the world around me, traveled, wrote, achieved, failed, moved, grew, survived and experienced all on my own. Happily. Completely. With Zeal. The question never came up because I was always on the move and ready for the next adventure, with or without someone in the plane seat next to me.</p>
<p>If there was one thing I always fell back on that would talk me out of relationships, it was the travel. I knew I wanted to keep going, keep stepping in new countries, fill another passport and never stop that part of my story. It was key. It was me. I used it as my deal-breaker; if I was being offered a life that was less nomadic, I didn&#8217;t even start the relationship. At least for a while this worked out for me and I remained happy and single.</p>
<p>But, being in Portland these days has changed my dating life &#8211; as in I now have one and am realizing that this jet-setting life might not be the priority I once held it to.</p>
<p>I went on a blind date this last weekend. As I sat on the beach with this random guy and his guitar (yeah, cheesy, I don&#8217;t mind) he asked me two questions (among many), &#8220;What makes you a great girlfriend?&#8221; and &#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no idea how to answer these questions. People tell me I am easy to get along with, always happy and smiling, supportive and encouraging, but I have never had to be that in a relationship before. Maybe I would be different. If I started listing that I could cook, clean and take care of babies, I might give off the wrong impression. How do you explain what you are like in a deep, committed relationship to someone you barely know, if you don&#8217;t really know?</p>
<p>The question about what I am looking for went just as unanswered. I have realized that even a couple dates here and there really help open my eyes to what I like and don&#8217;t like, what I am willing to deal with and what I am not.</p>
<p>As my mom put it this week, &#8220;Everyone is a little crazy. It is just a matter of figuring out which crazy you are willing to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few flopped dates and attempts at dating, here is what I know I want so far:</p>
<p>A Man.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Not a boy, not a guys guy, not a narcissist, not a chump. A Man. Someone who has <strong>conviction</strong> and will stand by it, who believes in other people, who controls his emotions and knows how to have a conversation about tough stuff without being aggressive or passive aggressive. A<strong> steady, strong, passionate</strong> man of <strong>peace</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no dark hair, or blue eyes on my list; nothing about an un-checkered past or even a perfect job. I just want character.</p>
<p>Character shouldn&#8217;t be limited to the few in this world. It shouldn&#8217;t be such a mysterious trait to find, but it has proven rather elusive as of late.</p>
<p>Over the last few months I have had dates with people that made fun of me (Dear Guys, Don&#8217;t make fun of ladies on your first date. Especially things they cannot change like their height, or their feet, or the size of their behind); with guys that criticized my clothes, my apartment, and/or my car (Dear Guys, Criticism is not a turn on. Please reign it in.); and with guys that seem to be way more interested in their own stories than any I might have to share. (Dear Guys, Listening and supporting is like a magical spell that helps a girl want to fall for you.)</p>
<p>I wish I could just shake some of the men I have met and get some of the insecurity off them, or unload some of the baggage.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying this is a one way street. Any of the men I am thinking of now would probably have a list of things I could have done differently. I have been told that I am hard to read, shy, and intimidating depending on the situation. I try so hard not to be controlling or manipulative that it sometimes comes across like I don&#8217;t care. Words get stuck in my throat if I don&#8217;t have time to process what I really think. I have a hard time keeping boundaries, so I can get a guy into trouble . . .</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll cover all my womanly faults some other time.</p>
<p>Which brings me back: Do you have a list? What are some of the things on it? What are your absolute deal-breakers?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not original in any sense, but lately I&#8217;ve been in a fall mood.  This is clearly no surprise as it is now the very early beginning of September and Halloween decorations, sweaters and pumpkin paraphernalia already decorate all venues of mass consumption meant to make you think you discovered the season including Halloween and Thanksgiving on your own when really it is fully by design.  Fall does not necessarily need to be associated with a change in the weather.  If stores decided to start selling fall clothes in May while toting pumpkin everything, I&#8217;m fairly confident the season could take place in the middle of summer.</p>
<p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 574px"><a href="http://www.hm.com/us/life#comp_0000005fad"><img class=" " src="http://lp.hm.com/hmprod?set=source[/josh/media/sys_master/9126461571102/hm_life_interview_LDR_01.png]&amp;call=url[file:/life/largeArticle]" alt="" width="564" height="356" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: H&amp;M Lana Del Rey</p></div>September is an awkward month.  A few leaves may be on the ground, but the sun is still in a crispy state when you&#8217;re walking around town during the day, much too warm to wear a sweater, but you&#8217;ve already bought some new fall clothes and decide to wear it anyway, no matter the cost.  So, the dying embers of summer, still capable of burning you despite it being &#8220;fall&#8221; and despite the atmosphere starting to look like fall too, seep through the cotton, cashmere or wool and start to warm your soul a little as you perspire- even if you try so hard to be &#8220;original&#8221; in the face of a fake season brought on by the consumerist society in which you live.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 315px"><a href="http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/pumpkin-spice-latte"><img class=" " src="http://assets.starbucks.com/assets/a6f392e9c6ae4527b712bb86e88be6f4.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Spice Latte" width="305" height="363" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte</p></div>
<p>What put me into the fall mood?  Well, it was actually a journey to Waffle House last Saturday morning with my boyfriend.  In order to survive the mass caloric intake without gaining weight in one solitary meal, we decided to walk to the Waffle House around the corner instead of driving there.  The simple act of walking brought us back to our collegiate days in which we walked to the dining hall, up Freshman hill or to the football games this time of year.  Already nostalgic, we were further reminded of school when everyone at Waffle House seemed to don their college football tees and discuss the schematics of upcoming games at the counter (you know it&#8217;s almost like watching TV at Waffle House because the people at the counter are right there in the middle of everything and seem to talk as if they are on stage anyway).</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7.jpg?w=137&h=137" alt="" width="137" height="137" /></a>But, there&#8217;s something about Waffle House itself, maybe the colors, maybe the comfort food, maybe the yellow <a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_71.jpg"><br />
<img class="alignright" title="fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_71.jpg?w=115&h=115" alt="" width="115" height="115" /></a>dangling teeth in the sky bearing its name, calling you inside that brings about a fall feeling.  The hanging bulbous lights against an off-white tile, the laminate wood tables and the atmosphere that makes you think of Friday Night Lights before and or after a football game inspires a scholastically-fall feeling.  Everyone eating breakfast with us that morning seemed to be &#8220;in it,&#8221; with us even though none of us knew each other.  There was just this swell of college football pride and a feeling that we were all in this changing season together.</p>
<p>Music also seems to set the mood and lately there have been several artists on my mind.  I&#8217;ll start with The Black Keys because their music reminds me of school.  Particularly, of Mississippi and perhaps that is because I discovered them while I was teaching in Clarksdale, MS.  When I hear <a href="http://www.theblackkeys.com/">The Black Keys</a>, I think of <a href="http://www.groundzerobluesclub.com/">Ground Zero</a>, the blues club co-owned by Morgan Freeman and Bill Luckett in Clarksdale where you can hear really great bands, you can scrawl in Sharpie on the wall and get a fried catfish sandwich.  The Black Keys have never played there, but I get that same sort of rustic feeling, that fall feeling when I listen to them.</p>
<p><a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ground0d.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-567" title="ground0d" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ground0d.jpg?w=175&h=108" alt="" width="175" height="108" /></a>  <a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/8f0f7534f80911e1adc122000a1c91be_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-554" title="8f0f7534f80911e1adc122000a1c91be_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/8f0f7534f80911e1adc122000a1c91be_7.jpg?w=108&h=108" alt="" width="108" height="108" /></a>  <a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/989866b4f80a11e18dfe22000a1cfdcd_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-560" title="989866b4f80a11e18dfe22000a1cfdcd_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/989866b4f80a11e18dfe22000a1cfdcd_7.jpg?w=109&h=109" alt="" width="109" height="109" /></a></p>
<p>Lana Del Rey, Mumford and Sons and also the Avett Brothers are also on my fall soundtrack this season. While I&#8217;ve been observing the small details of fall and writing away at a new short story, my graphic novel and various poems, these details find their way into the plot lines.  The music on my Pandora playlist could very easily be playing in the background of any of my settings.  Stories could take place in venues like Ground Zero or in the crispy sun of early fall.  I can&#8217;t seem to shake it.</p>

On the docket for this weekend: taking the GRE, reading more C.K. Williams, perhaps wearing a sweater at a coffee shop somewhere and listening to Lana Del Rey listlessly staring out a window, watching college football with family and friends, and baking something pumpkin-y or nutmeg-y.  <strong>What are your &#8220;original&#8221; fall plans? What&#8217;s your &#8220;original&#8221; mood as of late?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Springs State Park, where we camped this past Labor Day weekend, has much beauty to offer. Our morning walk was peaceful. The breeze was cool, the sky was blue and the sun was bright. Though its name is Blue Springs, we were immersed in vivid greens along the boardwalk trail leading to the spring head.</p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/071-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2242" title="071 (1280x853)" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/071-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/075-1280x722.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2243" title="075 (1280x722)" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/075-1280x722.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a>This area was home to Native Americans until 1856 when it was settled by Louis Thursby and his family. Their house, built in 1872, still stands on the park grounds.<a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/076-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2244" title="076 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/076-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2260" title="03" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="655" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/078-853x1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245" title="078 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/078-853x1280.jpg" alt="" width="854" height="1282" /></a>Blue Springs is the largest spring on the St. Johns River. Swimming and diving, which are the main attractions in the summer, are not allowed during the winter months (November to March), because as the river&#8217;s temperature drops, manatees seek refuge in the spring&#8217;s warm (relatively speaking) waters.</p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2261" title="04" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/04.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>

For those who rather stay dry, there&#8217;s canoeing and boating. Fishing can also be enjoyed off the pier which is found at the point where the spring run meets the river. <a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/083-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2248" title="083 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/083-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1026" height="683" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/084-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2249" title="084 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/084-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a>Before our afternoon walk and swim, we enjoyed a delicious barbecue chicken sandwich at the concession stand near the picnic area, where we also found a gift shop with rafts and floats available to rent. <a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/089-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2250" title="089 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/089-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/091-1280x725.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2251" title="091" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/091-1280x725.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" /></a>While walking along the boardwalk, the clear waters of the spring run sparkled and shimmered as the sun shined through the trees.  <a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/092-1280x833.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2252" title="092 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/092-1280x833.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/103-853x1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2253" title="103 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/103-853x1280.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="1280" /></a></p>
<p>In the afternoon the air temperature was in the 90&#8242;s. It was hot and humid and the spring water was enticing (that is, until I dipped my feet in). The water temperature in the springs remains at 72 degrees throughout the year. Though warm to the manatees, it felt very cold to me! One park ranger suggested we put our feet in first, so we could &#8220;acclimate&#8221;  and our body temperature could drop. This, however, didn&#8217;t help. There are no two ways about it, either you jump in or you don&#8217;t go in at all.</p>
<p>I was ready to take the second choice &#8211; I hate cold water! But, threatened to be thrown in, I decided to jump in on my own. After the initial shock, we swam up river to the spring head, where we found our biggest surprise yet &#8211; a manatee which was swimming among the visitors (see pictures <a title="Under Water" href="http://justmyecho.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/under-water/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/07.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2265" title="07" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/07.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a>After this incredible experience, we happily and lazily floated to the end of the run. Our bodies were numb as we climbed out of the water. The hot air which previously was so uncomfortable embraced us in welcomed warmth. And though I did not initially want to get in the water, I&#8217;m very glad I did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not an apron kind of girl. I don&#8217;t do bows, frills, flounces, or flowers.</p>
<p>But, I do like to cook. And if I am making something messy like <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/11/03/beautiful-biscuits-cream-no-shortening-and-a-gentle-hand/" target="_blank">buttermilk biscuits</a>, <a href="http://madteaparty.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/sunday-brunch-gobhi-parantha/" target="_blank">paranthas</a>, or <a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/2009/03/30/how-to-make-homemade-alfajores/" target="_blank">alfajores</a>&#8211;basically anything that involves working with dough and flinging clouds of flour around&#8211;I like to wear my grandmother&#8217;s apron.</p>
<p><a href="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1247_crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-968" title="IMG_1247_crop" src="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1247_crop.jpg?w=212&h=300" alt="Apron hanging on a kitchen door" width="212" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In a way, I never knew my &#8216;real&#8217; grandmother. When I was 3, she and my grandfather were driving home from a livestock auction on a rainy winter night when their white pickup truck was slammed into by a tractor-trailer. They both survived, but my grandmother&#8217;s injuries were serious. She moved from intensive care to a regular ward to a nursing home. When she finally did come home, she was, as my mom would say, &#8220;not the same person.&#8221; She was listless, petulant, distant. After the accident, she mostly sat still in her chair in the front room of their log cabin, beside the Franklin stove.</p>
<p>A look through family photo albums shows the lost woman my mom was missing. Grandma in a man&#8217;s winter coat and rubber boots, carrying a rifle, heading off squirrel hunting with her sister. On vacation, waist-deep in the Chesapeake Bay. Leading my 5-year-old mom around the barnyard on the back of a Holstein calf. Her white hair tucked under a hunting cap, riding on her Saddlebred mare, Sugar. She was a Yankees fan, a backyard geneticist (chickens!), and she eloped with my grandfather&#8211;a German sailor who had jumped ship in New Orleans and made his way north&#8211;and for months didn&#8217;t tell anyone in the family that she was married, just kept bringing her beau to Sunday suppers with the family. I don&#8217;t remember a single photo of her wearing a skirt or dress &#8211; quite an accomplishment for a woman born in 1910.</p>
<p>Pauline was the second youngest of nine children born on a farm. The boys worked in the fields and the girls worked in the house. That&#8217;s just the way it was. She was a good country cook, and she cooked for her German sailor, too: fried chicken, chipped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, fruit cake, peach pie.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time with my grandparents, especially after the accident, when we moved next door to help take care of them. I was always happy to visit&#8211; My grandparents were glad to see me, and they ate food that we didn&#8217;t have at home. There were packages of Nutter Butter cookies for my grandfather, and bags of chalky pink peppermints. There were cold slices of squirrel and rabbit refrigerated in margarine tubs, that we ate with Blue Ribbon margarine on Roman Meal bread. There was Braunschweiger and sliced genoa salami. Their dirt-floored cellar was a treasure house of canned peaches, pears, and fruit cocktail, jars of cinnamon-sugar applesauce, and big cans of Hi-C from the canning factory where they used to work.</p>
<p>And down behind the white Westinghouse fridge, where they kept six-pack glass returnable bottles of Coke (for Grandma) and Pepsi (for Pop-pop), was a flowered vinyl shopping bag, and two aprons &#8211; one red, one blue, hung on a hook.</p>
<p><a href="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/71103443_1323546286521.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-970" title="71103443_132354628652" src="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/71103443_1323546286521.jpeg?w=300&h=225" alt="Pauline Schroll tombstone, 1910-1981" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like sports. I&#8217;ve never been hunting&#8211;I&#8217;ve been a vegetarian since I was fifteen. But, I, too, ran off and married my husband &#8211;another foreigner&#8211;and called my mom to tell her the news after the fact. I learned to ride before I can remember, and the feel of a horse under me is as natural as walking.</p>
<p>The cooking thing skipped a generation. My mom didn&#8217;t learn to cook until her husband taught her, and when he died when I was eight, I took over the cooking. It wasn&#8217;t until I had grown up and moved out and was visiting my mom, digging for some cobwebbed necessity when trying to make Christmas dinner in her neglected kitchen that I came across my grandmother&#8217;s apron.</p>
<p>It all came back to me. My whole childhood. My grandfather&#8217;s bolo ties, and his snoring in his armchair in front of the Orioles game. Eating squirrel sandwiches at the claw-foot table in the kitchen. Feeding the chickens, and stroking the feathers of the pale gold spring peeps. Sledding down the mountain lane in winter, and scrambling barefoot up trees in the summer, gathering black raspberries by the bucketful and spooning them with sugar over vanilla ice cream. Riding my Shetland pony, and falling under her feet when the girth slipped on her grass-fat belly. Crawling through barbed-wire fences, watching out for copperheads, playing tag with my cousins. Eating sassafras leaves, birch bark, and teaberries, and &#8216;cooking&#8217; grass and acorns in a beat-up old saucepot on the tar-paper roof of the springhouse.</p>
<p>My mom didn&#8217;t need the apron, and I took it with me. When I wear it, I know the Pauline who I never knew. When I wear it, I continue the best of the women in my family. Women who know the Appalachian woods from the inside, who ride horses without fear, who marry the men they love, and ask permission later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One-eyed aliens, giant butterflies, flying dragons, mermaids, superheroes, self-portraits and other masterpieces mask our aged refrigerator. Without that in my life, even my morning coffee wouldn&#8217;t make me happy.</p>
<p>All parents believe their child is the next Picasso or <a class="zem_slink" title="Frida Kahlo" href="http://www.biography.com/people/frida-kahlo-9359496" rel="biographycom" target="_blank">Frida Kahlo</a>, but we also recognize the need to connect with our child. Their art connects to a part of the soul where words can&#8217;t. At least, that&#8217;s what I find when I reach for the refrigerator door.</p>
<div id="attachment_177" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 189px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/famlaugh.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-177 " title="Famlaugh" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/famlaugh.jpg?w=179&h=240" alt="" width="179" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Family</p></div>
<p>The first time my daughter handed me a drawing a surge of pride and euphoria swept through me. I rushed to the refrigerator as if it were a wall in an art gallery, quickly selected a worthy magnet, and surveyed its magnificence on the refrigerator door. She has come to see the refrigerator as a showcase for her talent and superior abilities, a confirmation that she is the best.</p>
<p>Now, she snatches a piece of typing paper from the printer, grabs a pen or crayon and waits to see where I will display her next masterpiece.</p>
<p>There are moments when I silently grumble that we never have paper in the printer when we need to print, but all I have to do is reach for the refrigerator door and those words never materialize.</p>
<div id="attachment_178" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momday.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" title="MomDay" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momday.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mom&#8217;s Day</p></div>
<p>Over the years, this refrigerator art gallery has boasted various works of art that expressed her momentary whims and our family’s unique attributes, always with a positive spin. At one point it displayed a portrait of myself accentuating my ultra-curly hair in an afro-like halo with rays of light spraying from my head. When I asked why she added the light, my daughter explained that I looked like the sun in the morning.</p>
<p>My whole perspective changed. I went from being a giant, frizzy-headed mess to the sun. The day I couldn’t find that drawing was the day I realized how much I couldn’t live without my children’s art. I began to value it and make sure that, when it came time to replace old art with new art, the old art had a place to stay. I created a scrapbook where I could slip the ones that meant the most to me.</p>
<p>The depth of meaning has grown over the years. Early one morning, still holding a grudge over an unresolved problem, I made my coffee then reached for milk from the refrigerator. I looked up and stopped. Strange creatures jumped from the door with their disproportionate necks and misshapen lips, kissing each other, flying and floating. Despite all the masterpieces I’ve seen in museums and galleries, I finally fully grasped the value of art. Art exists to remind us of the beauty we forget about while attempting to maneuver through the difficulties in life. Even if the art stands as a testament of our bad behaviors, it still magnifies the beauty we’ve disregarded.</p>
<div id="attachment_179" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momdad.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-179" title="Mom&amp;Dad" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momdad.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Colorful</p></div>
<p>Once my son arrived, the art collection filled our house. The refrigerator art migrated to our walls and doors. One evening after a shower, I found his refrigerator art carefully taped to the hallway walls and bedroom doors. He proclaimed that the house was too boring and it needed some color. He placed each one at his eye-level—so I learned to look down for inspiration.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/butterfly.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-190" title="Butterfly" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/butterfly.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Butterfly Go</p></div>
<p>Eventually, I myself moved some of the artwork to my little nook in the corner of the dining room where I work. A brightly dressed ninja reminds me of the power to fight but to be careful about wardrobe choices. Two flowing girls, outlined in blue and red, tell me to overcome differences. A butterfly splashed with color spreads its wings across my magnetic bulletin board. I hear its voice say, “Open your wings Mama. You’re still a child inside.” And a turtle calls out, “Slow down!” So, I do. Each piece expresses a new discovery, a silent insight, and an imperceptible moment that I would’ve rushed past had it not been my own child who handed it to me.</p>
<p>Living without that, wouldn’t be living at all.</p>
