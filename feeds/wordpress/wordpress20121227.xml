				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://veggiezest.com/2012/12/19/sticky-tahini-buns/sticky-tahini-buns-01/" rel="attachment wp-att-1575"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1575" alt="sticky tahini  buns " src="http://veggiezestdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/sticky-tahini-buns-01.jpg?w=647&#038;h=1024" width="647" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>This recipe is a variation of cinnamon rolls. You might think why do I need to make a variation of a classic recipe &#8211; the answer is because you must always try new things and new combinations. These buns are delicious and are a wonderful combination of tahini, dates and brown sugar.</p>
<p>I have mostly used tahini in savory combination but these buns are really delicious. The sticky topping adds oodles of flavor to these buns. It takes a little time and a little prep work to make these but the result is totally worth it. These buns are perfect for the holiday season &#8211; wrap them in a festive colors and shapes and gift them to your loved ones. Or warm up an individual bun and enjoy it with a warm cup of coffee for breakfast or in the evening.  Try something different this season!</p>

<p><em>Serving 8 buns</em></p>
<p><em>Cooking time 1 hour plus rising time</em> for the dough</p>
<p><strong>Things you will need:</strong></p>
<p><em>For the dough</em></p>
<p>3 1/4 cups all purpose flour</p>
<p>2 tsp active dry yeast</p>
<p>2 tbsp sugar</p>
<p>1  egg, slightly beaten</p>
<p>1 cup milk</p>
<p>2 tbsp warm water (to dissolve the yeast)</p>
<p>2 tbsp butter, melted</p>
<ol>
<li>Activate dry yeast by dissolving it in warm water. Keep aside for 10  minutes till it starts getting bubbly.</li>
<li>In a large bow mix 3 cups flour and sugar.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl mix together milk, egg and butter.</li>
<li>Add dissolved and activated yeast to the flour mixture and start mixing with the help of a fork.</li>
<li>Slowly add the milk mixture to the flour. Switch to a wooden spoon or your hands and start mixing the flour and milk mixture to form a dough.</li>
<li>If you feel the dough is too sticky, add the reserved 1/4 cup flour and knead to form a clean dough. The dough should bounce back when you push it slightly with your finger.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough into a lightly oiled bowl (large enough for the dough to rise). Cover with a kitchen towel and place in a warm spot. Let the dough rest for 1 1/2 hours or till it doubles in size.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>For the filling</em></p>
<p>1/2 cup white sesame seeds</p>
<p>1/2 cup brown sesame seeds &#8211; (double the quantity of white sesame seeds if you cant find the dark ones)</p>
<p>1/3 cup sugar</p>
<p>Add all the ingredients in a blender and pulse till it turns into a coarse powder. Keep aside.</p>
<p><em>For the topping</em></p>
<p>1/2 cup chopped dates</p>
<p>1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted</p>
<p>3/4 cup brown sugar</p>
<p>2 tbsp milk</p>
<p>vanilla extract</p>
<p>pinch of sea salt</p>
<ol>
<li>In a saucepan melt sugar on medium heat.</li>
<li>When the sugar caramelizes, turn the heat off.</li>
<li>Add milk and stir till it blends in.</li>
<li>Add all the other ingredients and mix to form a stick sauce. Keep aside.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To put the buns together</em></p>
<p>1/4 cup tahini</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll out the dough into a 1/2 inch thick square &#8211; I used a floured square tray to guide me with shape.</li>
<li>Smear tahini evenly on the dough &#8211; this acts almost like a glue in keeping the filling together.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the ground sesame &amp; sugar mixture generously on the dough square leaving 1/2 inch on the corners.</li>
<li>Roll up tightly to form a log, pinch a seal the seam on the long side.</li>
<li>Cut into eight 1 1/2 inch thick slices. Place these slices on a baking sheet, cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for another hour.</li>
<li>Preheat the over at 375 F.</li>
<li>Smear the pre-baked buns generously with the sticky date mixture forcing some of the mixture to go between the buns. Reserve a few tablespoons of this mixture.</li>
<li>Bake the buns in the oven for about 50 minutes or till they turn golden.</li>
<li>Smear the reserved sticky topping as soon as you pull the buns out of the oven.</li>
<li>Cool on the grill, serve warm.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Suggestions:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>As an option you can chop up some pistachios and mix it in the sticky sauce.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds and a pinch of sea salt before serving.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere in Portland, there&#8217;s a very old building, and that very old building has a very, very old basement. An incredible basement, a video-game-level basement, a set-decorator&#8217;s dream basement.</p>
<p>And when you walk past the janitors office, with the wonderfully decked halls&#8230;</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-562" alt="basement40" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement40.jpg?w=740&#038;h=986" width="740" height="986" /></div>
<p>And tromp down a sunken hallway&#8230;</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-531" alt="basement09" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement09.jpg?w=740&#038;h=555" width="740" height="555" /></div>
<p>You find a old room. Mostly empty, dusty, and dead quiet.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-535" alt="basement13" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement13.jpg?w=740&#038;h=555" width="740" height="555" /></div>
<p>And then you start to look closer at the walls.</p>
<p>And you start to see things.</p>
<div class="photofull">
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-617" alt="basement43" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement43.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-533" alt="basement11" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement11.jpg?w=740&#038;h=986" width="740" height="986" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-537" alt="basement15" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement15.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-536" alt="basement14" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement14.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
</div>
<p>(You see that Brown didn&#8217;t often pay his dime for coffee.)</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-576" alt="P1020151" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/p1020151.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>(You see that a lot of calculation was done right on the wall.)</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-534" alt="basement12" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement12.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>(You see that World War I was front and center on everyone&#8217;s mind.)</p>
<div class="photofull">
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-549" alt="basement27" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement27.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
</div>
<p>(You wonder what was being tallied, and if it was better to win or lose.)</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-546" alt="basement24" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement24.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>(And you learn the tongue-in-check &#8220;rules&#8221; of the room.)</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-530" alt="basement08" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement08.jpg?w=740&#038;h=987" width="740" height="987" /></div>
<p>And eventually, you crawl behind a corner, and discover a bundle of conduit.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-538" alt="basement16" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement16.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>Conduit for every major internet carrier you&#8217;ve ever heard of.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-544" alt="basement22" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement22.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>Oh, right. You had almost forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>This building, this basement, is the major internet hub for the entire region.</strong></p>
<p>And a wall, where all this data enters the basement just as you did, you see them.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-525" alt="basement03" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement03.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>Somehow, still surrounding these cutting-edge, fiber-optic links that burst through the wall, they&#8217;re frozen in time, looking at you.</p>
<p>How are they still there? My god, 2012. Could they even imagine?</p>
<div class="photofull">
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-559" alt="basement37" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement37.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-550" alt="basement28" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement28.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-557" alt="basement35" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement35.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-556" alt="basement34" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement34.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-554" alt="basement32" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement32.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-548" alt="basement26" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement26.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-547" alt="basement25" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement25.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-527" alt="basement05" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement05.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-526" alt="basement04" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement04.jpg?w=740&#038;h=987" width="740" height="987" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-558" alt="basement36" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement36.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></p>
</div>
<p>On the way out, you chat up a worker in the building.</p>
<p>And his story clicks it all into place.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-553" alt="basement31" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement31.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>Turns out, he claims, <strong>&#8220;they used to print The Oregonian down here, way back.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The pressmen, one imagines, worked day and night down here, working the lumbering machines, spitting out another edition of the day&#8217;s business.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-552" alt="basement30" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement30.jpg?w=740&#038;h=556" width="740" height="556" /></div>
<p>And when something caught their eye? <strong>Out came the scissors and the paste.</strong></p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-612" alt="basement42" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement42.jpg?w=740&#038;h=986" width="740" height="986" /></div>
<p>It&#8217;s almost too perfect.</p>
<p>The roar of the presses that ruled these rooms has been replaced, just as we all suspected, with the calculated silence of the conduit that carries our data. This data, in fact. These very photos.</p>
<p>100 years from now, when another one of you goes spelunking around this basement, that data, those bits, today&#8217;s moments, will likely be long, long gone.</p>
<p>But the women on the wall might still be waiting.</p>
<div class="photofull"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-543" alt="basement21" src="http://cabeldotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/basement21.jpg?w=740&#038;h=986" width="740" height="986" /></div>

<p><strong>IV. The Real Boy</strong></p>
<p>In this my last entry in a series of commentary on abortion, I want to keep things somewhat more open-ended. I have spent time thus far in sub-issues within the debate which, while important, are mostly peripheral: the selection of terms, the coherence of compromise, and our approach to interlocutors. I have also suggested the utter necessity, for any traction, that the debate return to its center: the ontological fact of what the unborn being truly is. If I have lingered long at the outskirts while entreating a journey inward, it was with the aim of first clearing what pernicious overgrowth has too often obscured our path. Working through these concerns, I hope to have shown, does not require any profound agreement on the ultimate question: it takes merely a reflective pause, a critical eye to the mechanisms of another&#8217;s belief and one&#8217;s own, to sweep off the mounting detritus that tends to clog our gears and, for it, our vision.</p>
<p>The primacy of that final question, however, cannot be ignored. But while a shift (or perhaps simply a refinement) of concentration is crucial for the debate at large, I have come near the end of what I little I hoped to accomplish in these writings. To advance a positive argument from the roots up with anywhere near the appropriate rigor would be a task much desired, but fit for a space different from this. So instead I will offer one last thought experiment for parting consideration:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There is a humble old woodcarver whose friend generously gifts her a small supply of timber for Easter. In gracious spirits, she uses the material to craft two wooden dolls. One day not long after, a man comes by his shop claiming to be a magician. He notices the dolls and tells the carver that he will return at the end of the year, and if the carver has decided to keep them until then, they will be turned into real boys. Lest the poor shopkeeper have any doubts, the magician speaks a soft word to a wooden dove perched on the workbench nearby; the bird twitches its rigid wings, morphs and softens into feathery white, and flies out the window. &#8220;Year&#8217;s end,&#8221; says the magician, and he leaves.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The carver is stunned. She had always wanted a child of his own, as it turns out. Though bewildered, she has been shown reason enough to believe that this magic is real, the magician&#8217;s word firm and certain. After the shock subsides she regathers her senses, however, and falls deep into thought. Blessing and wish-come-true though a child would be, having two would be a true challenge for a woman of her age and means. After many days of deliberation she decides that she will keep one doll. Having no preference, and wishing to effect none unwittingly, she chooses one at random and has the other destroyed. On Christmas Day the magician returns, casts a silent nod to the carver, and the doll comes to life. The old woman has a son, and the stranger departs.</p>
<p>Has the carver done something blameworthy? Immoral? Some days watching her son play she may wonder whether she should have given him the chance of a sibling. But surely she knew best the nature of her circumstances, and though by her decision another boy undoubtedly would have been, what was lost was, in effect, merely a dream; in substance, a block of wood.</p>
<p>I offer this story as a way to frame another, this one true to life. In August of last year a piece appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> called &#8220;The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy.&#8221; I encourage any who has not read it to do so <a title="The Two-Minus One Pregnancy" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">here</a> because it is a jolting read and I will not be able to recap it sufficiently. It follows the growing phenomenon of a practice self-described as &#8220;pregnancy reduction.&#8221; Women undergo this procedure to reduce their twin pregnancy to a &#8220;singleton.&#8221; In plain terms, a woman bearing twins decides to abort one and keep the other. Again, I recommend the full read because it has several details worth absorbing: the condition of anonymity on which these women give their testimonials (for fear of the &#8220;stigma&#8221;), <em>in vitro</em> mothers getting more than they bargained for, and decisions to reduce on the basis of sex.*</p>
<p>There are many things I could say about this story but of all those that struck me I would like to draw particular attention to one. As I read reactions to this piece (in the site comments and elsewhere) I began to notice a common preface: many commenters (though by no means all) would begin their remarks will something to the effect of &#8220;I am pro-choice, but . . . &#8221; and proceeded to register their unease or repulsion toward what they had read.</p>
<p>This response reminded me of another. In 2008 at my alma mater, a story broke that a student had been artificially inseminating herself, inducing abortions, and collecting the resultant blood to put on display for her senior art project. You can read more about it <a title="Aliza Shvarts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_student_abortion_art_controversy" target="_blank">here</a>. The news ignited the campus with a firestorm of several weeks, and though the student was not without her defenders her project drew harsh criticism from both sides of the aisle. In the aftermath as conflicting reports arose it became increasingly less clear whether her claims were fact or performance-art fiction (she maintained their truth to the end). But whatever the case it matters not for my point, which is that many pro-choice people found her acts, or at least the idea of them, disturbing.</p>
<p>There are enough differences between these two stories that I do not mean to compare them beyond this shared moral instinct, which exists not only in an intended public spectacle like the abortion art project (which might be objected to merely for its inflammatory provocation of those who <em>do</em> believe lives are at stake), but even in response to a guarded private choice like pregnancy reduction. What accounts for this instinctive discomfort, or in some, even disgust?</p>
<p>With this I turn back to the tale of the carver. How you do feel about her decision? To those who find something deeply unsettling in the recounted stories of &#8220;pregnancy reduction&#8221;: Whether right or wrong, does the carver&#8217;s choice elicit the same response? If wrong, is it wrong in the same way?</p>
<p>Though I don&#8217;t want to presume, my expectation is that few who identify as pro-choice will find serious moral qualm in the carver&#8217;s decision, though a greater number will take issue with some form of pregnancy reduction. My question is why this should be the case. I imagine it might be objected that in attempting to set up this analogy I have hardly brought into equivalence many striking factors and have constructed a poor analogy for the experience of pregnancy. The old carver never carries her child, after all; the physical, mental, and emotional labors of pregnancy are never felt. Neither is there any period of natural gestation in which the dolls develop—the one she chooses to keep passes from wood to human child, fully formed, by instantaneous dint of magic. And the old carver had no ownership in establishing the initial potentiality of the children: though she was fully entitled to an out clause (so to speak), the conditions of the magician—in which mere inaction would result in two children—were put in place by no act of her will.</p>
<p>But imagine if her experience were (in some rough way) more like real pregnancy. The magician tells the carver if she wants the dolls to become children, she not only has to keep them for the next nine months, but keep them well polished. This begins with light touch-ups here and there, but the carver soon notices that the polish has begun to wear off more and more quickly. As time passes this rate of dissolution increases at a surprising rate until she can no longer afford to leave the dolls at the shop for any extended period of time and is forced to carry them wherever she goes. A few times in her care the dolls have even, strangely, burned her hand to the touch. In short, the process is more demanding, restricting, and time-consuming—occasionally painful. After some time under these conditions, or even presented upfront with the knowledge of what would be, would it be anything but <em>more</em> understandable if she should choose to keep only one, for all the same reasons she decided before, but here with the added hope of alleviating her current experience in whatever small way?</p>
<p>What is curious is that it is not the carver&#8217;s choice (in the tale&#8217;s original formation) that draws our discomfort—she who faces the easier path to her end and nevertheless &#8220;reduces&#8221; the potential outcome—but precisely the woman who <em>does</em> go through the pains of pregnancy, who has, in the I.V.F. cases especially, authored the situation in which she finds herself (even if she is surprised by the news of twins). Why then should any pro-choice advocate feel anything but utter sympathy with the woman&#8217;s decision to alleviate her pains and align her condition to her wishes? Why be opposed, when there is no moral content to the choice—when the unborn thing is no more a person than a block of wood? Less, even, for at least the carver&#8217;s doll was wanted property, a work of her hands and an object of care; Fetus No. 2 is an unwanted intrusion, a tumor in the strictest sense.</p>
<p>So whence comes this rejecting instinct? Does it balk at removing the <em>potentiality</em> of a sibling for the lasting child? Then our two responses should be the same. Is it because reducing the biological twin pregnancy is especially &#8220;unnatural&#8221; (more so than an ordinary abortion, at least) when all nature has to do is take it&#8217;s course—and the mother clearly <em>wants</em> children to some degree—while the carver&#8217;s whole operation rests on some mysterious magic? But what is the standard pro-choice account of respected human life but precisely some inscrutable magic—the passing at some mysterious stage from fetus to person, from termination being a thorough non-issue to suddenly and unquestionably a moral wrong the moment after? The &#8220;magic&#8221; of the magician is, in my invention, no less certain its potency, reliability, or finality; it is merely an alternative mechanism for the same outcome.</p>
<p>Does the mother bear some obligation to <em>both</em> potential children since her choices are responsible for their being in the first place (surprise though the number be)? Is it an insult to mothers who desperately wish for children to be blessed with the potential for two and to throw one away? Is it abusing a right whose victory was so hard-fought? Is it senseless when the woman will still be going through pregnancy anyway, and whatever physical alleviation the reduction might provide could only be a matter of degree and not of kind?</p>
<p>A perfect distillation of the operating principle appears in a telling quotation from the article itself (emphasis mine):</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Other doctors refuse to reduce below twins unless the pregnancy presents unusual medical concerns. Among them is Dr. Ronald Wapner, director of reproductive genetics at Columbia and another reduction pioneer. Sometime in the late 1990s, when Wapner practiced in Philadelphia, he received his first two-to-one request. “She said, ‘Either reduce me to a singleton, or I’ll end the pregnancy.’ ” He consulted his staff, all women, <span style="color:#000080;"><em>and they concluded that if a woman can choose to end a pregnancy, she can reduce from two to one</em></span></span>.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Besides, in this case, the team would be saving a fetus that would otherwise be aborted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>You could hardly put it more succinctly. So in response to the above questions: Why? Is not that the very beauty of the freedom of choice? Why should there be any obligation, or even suggestion of an obligation, when it is a protected private choice, respected by its mere status <em>as</em> choice, regardless of what one chooses—because there are no victims at stake, and the outcome simply does not matter?</p>
<p>If you happen to find nothing objectionable in &#8220;The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy&#8221; I have not been speaking to you, and there is more we disagree with than I can account for in this course of this blog. If you feel something wrong about it, I ask why that might be. To be fair, it might be that case that one really does attach him- or herself to any of the speculative reasons stated above. I simply wonder whether those reasons can be defended in the full pro-choice context as anything more than mere sentimentality, resting as they do upon prejudices either irrational or extrinsic to the logic of autonomous choice. And I wonder also whether, in those who do experience that strong and immediate sense of retraction, the strength and immediacy of that sense is likely to be the product of some reasoned-out respect for a sympathetic party like the barren mother, or whether it is strong and immediate, and indeed a prejudice, precisely because it strikes a chord at the very heart of the issue.</p>
<p>I can not identify with the experience of holding in combination these two perspectives—a thoroughly pro-choice outlook on the one hand and a repulsion to the abortion of one of two twins on the other—because that is not me. As should be evident from this series I am pro-life, though I hope my meditations have been fair in their treatment of all and have offered as much for the consideration of pro-choicers as they have for those who share my beliefs.</p>
<p>Yet observing this phenomenon from the outside as I do, I cannot say I am surprised that this immediate instinct persists, for it sounds something to me like the sharp but quiet notes of conscience. Perhaps we feel it because it refers to something real. Perhaps it strikes us before we can explain it away because beneath whatever artifices we have put up there lies dormant but present a whisper of the moral truth. Perhaps we have become so numb to it through years of normalized abortion and hallowed choice that it takes drastic stories like the two-minus-one or the senior art project to stir us momentarily out of our slumber. Perhaps we feel differently about the reducer and the carver because one had a baby and the other did not.</p>
<p>I cannot say. This curious sensation is not mine to feel, as I know how I stand. But it would not surprise me. And with that I&#8217;ll close. Thanks for reading if you did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://slightlyignorant.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/how-i-deal-with-things/1418049401_7d1548794d/" rel="attachment wp-att-1970"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1970" alt="1418049401_7d1548794d" src="http://slightlyignorant.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1418049401_7d1548794d.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>It sounded like fireworks, first. I thought it was maybe fireworks, like maybe one of the big kids brought them to school when they wasn&#8217;t supposed to. We&#8217;re not allowed to bring things like that to school. We&#8217;re not even supposed to have fireworks at all, but one time me and Adam and Jake and Hamed, we all had fireworks and we tried to light them but they were bust because they were wet. Adam got them from his big brother, but his big brother musta wet them before giving them to us. I bet he thought it was really funny.</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t know why there was fireworks at school. But it didn&#8217;t sound exactly like fireworks because there wasn&#8217;t that after bit. And there was a bit of other noise, like kids yelling and stuff. But I don&#8217;t know if I really heard that or not because Mom and Dad said that I might be imagining some stuff. I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t really get it.<br />
Anyway, Miss Anna, that&#8217;s our teacher, she got really angry when she heard the firework sounds. Popping noises, that&#8217;s how I heard other people talk about it. Popping sounds. So when she heard them, she got angry. And she told us all to be very quiet, but she didn&#8217;t yell it, like she sometimes does. I don&#8217;t know why, but we all did. We got quiet. I was kinda scared of her, I think. Because she looked seriouser than she did other times. I guess she wasn&#8217;t angry, I guess she was worried. I asked Mom about that and Mom said she wasn&#8217;t angry. Just worried. Everyone was worried. We were so worried, that&#8217;s what everyone keeps saying. Mom and Dad were outside when we ran out after everything, and they both hugged me and said we were so worried. I still didn&#8217;t understand why but the sirens hurt my eyes so I put my head into Dad&#8217;s stomach and he thought I was crying. I&#8217;m not crying, I told him, but I know he didn&#8217;t believe me and that&#8217;s when I got real mad and didn&#8217;t talk to him for a while. He always thinks I&#8217;m crying when I&#8217;m not. Just cause he cries all the time. I don&#8217;t have to cry all the time too.<br />
Miss Anna first told us to get under our desks after the popping noises and then she did something she tells us never to do. She answered her phone. It was buzzing, not ringing, but we could all hear it, just like she can hear it if we try to play games with the sound off. She always says she has really sensy tev ears, I don&#8217;t know what she means, but I guess it means she knows when you&#8217;re using your phone even when you shouldn&#8217;t be.<br />
She whispered into the phone instead of talking into to and I didn&#8217;t know how anyone could hear her on the other side because when I try to whisper to Mom on the phone she always says speak up. Then Miss Ann got down on the floor with us and I started to giggle a little because, well, it was funny. And Adam laughed too because he was next to me and he saw it was funny too. Mom told me after that it was okay that I laughed because I didn&#8217;t know what was happening and then it&#8217;s okay to laugh. But I still don&#8217;t really now so maybe it&#8217;s still okay to laugh.<br />
But I guess it&#8217;s not okay to laugh because when I tried to laugh with some woman who had really nice red hair and was standing near Mom at the meeting where we saw the President, Mom told me to hush up. Sometimes she tells me to speak up and sometimes she tells me to hush up. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m supposed to do then. Dad hugged me tightly when we saw the President speak. I know there&#8217;s a big P in President because Miss Anna taught us that last week in school.<br />
There isn&#8217;t any school now. I just stay at home with Mom who isn&#8217;t going to work and Dad comes home from the shop for lunch and we all eat together. Which is really nice. But Mom keeps rubbing my hair a lot and she doesn&#8217;t let me watch anything on tv except for DVDs. And I want to watch something on the Disney channel but she keeps saying no, because she can&#8217;t see the news again. And then she cries. I still don&#8217;t really get why. I asked if it was about the fireworks at school and she looked confused, and so I said that popping noises and she asked where I heard about that. I didn&#8217;t want to tell her that I can&#8217;t sleep so good and that I hear her and Dad watching the news late at night, so I didn&#8217;t tell her. I said I just heard it somewhere. She said yes baby, it&#8217;s about that. And then she said thank god and she hugged me again. Parents are weird sometimes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of economic commentary and analysis around two things lately: (1) is, naturally, the negotiations surrounding the &#8220;fiscal cliff,&#8221; and (2) is Prof. Anas Admati&#8217;s <a href="https://gsbapps.stanford.edu/researchpapers/library/BankEquityNotExpensive.pdf">argument</a> that the best financial reform we could undertake would be to require banks to have a higher equity ratio (that is, to finance more of their assets through stock and less through debt, reducing their leverage). I hope to write at greater length about (2) in the future, but, for now, suffice it to say that both of these things center on the &#8220;debt bias&#8221; in the U.S. tax-code, a bias which piqued my interest and so which, after a little research, I should like to tell you about.</p>
<p>Let me start out with some econ for poets. Suppose you&#8217;re a business and you want to make a big expansion&#8211;setting up lots of new stores, opening a new R&amp;D facility, etc.&#8211;that will cost you $1 billion.  Unless you have a lot of cash on hand (which you probably shouldn&#8217;t&#8211;it would have been wasteful to have just accumulated it) there are two ways you could fund this expansion. One, you could issue more shares in your company (that is, sell more stock to the public)&#8211;this is equity. Or, two, you could get a loan from a bank to do this&#8211;this is debt. Which option should you choose? Well, naturally, you should choose whichever one is cheaper&#8211;technically, whichever funding option&#8217;s obligations have a lower net present discounted value (the debt&#8217;s obligations being interest and principle, and the equity&#8217;s obligation being a share of profits and ownership). In reality, which one will be cheaper? Well, theoretically, since these two instruments are both providing the same good&#8211;financing&#8211;they should be about equally expensive. Think about it: if interest rates were relatively high, meaning that debt was more expensive than equity, firms would rush to issue more shares, which would reduce stock prices by increasing their supply, and eschew bank loans, which would force banks to lower their &#8216;prices&#8217; (their interest rates), until the two became equally expensive. So in a perfect market, equity and debt should be about equally expensive for companies, and companies would make their financing decisions as follows:  they would fund their activities through equity if they thought that their shares were slightly overpriced, and through debt if they thought their shares were relatively underpriced.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;ve just done some typical Econ 101 theory above, about an ideal market. But in the real world corporate financing decisions are distorted. One major distortion is the U.S. tax code, which includes a deduction for interest payments on debt. The tax code does not include a deduction from dividend payments to shareholders. To the contrary, corporate profits returned to shareholders are taxed twice: once as corporate profits (just before they have been returned to shareholders), and again as capital gains (once they are in the shareholders&#8217; hands). What does this do? Well, it gives companies a strong &#8220;debt bias&#8221; relative to the ideal market we laid out above. Because the obligations they incur from debt-financing in fact reduce their tax burdens, corporations are incentivized to rely relatively more heavily on debt, and less on equity.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem? Well, it isn&#8217;t always, necessarily, a problem for everyone. Indeed, if you&#8217;re a shareholder of a firm that has really great growth prospects for the future, you should be happy with debt-financing&#8211;this &#8220;leverage&#8221; means that you will get a higher share of whatever is left over once debt-obligations are paid off, than if your share had been diluted by the issuance of more equity. But the problems are twofold. First, in general, we as a society want companies to devote their analysis to trying figure out, and their energies to trying to meet, our needs as we express them in the marketplace&#8211;not make their decisions based on how best to game the tax code.  But, second, debt becomes a very big, very tangible problem during an economic downturn, when it can cause a credit crunch, a massive financial crisis, and thence a recession/depression, as you may have heard. We often hear debt analogized to &#8220;leverage,&#8221; because it makes the good times better for companies&#8217; owners (shareholders) and the bad times worse. Consider this super simplified model of a firm buying one asset in one year, with a 2% interest rate: If you&#8217;ve financed a $100 million asset through $50m of equity and $50m of debt (a debt-equity ratio of 1 to 1), if the value of that asset suddenly declines to $85m, you&#8217;re still easily okay&#8211;you can pay back your creditors their $51m, and still have $34m left, which is now the value of your shareholders&#8217; stake, a loss of $16m for them. But if you financed that through $10m of equity and $90m of debt (a debt-equity ratio/leverage of 9 to 1), the same decline in the asset&#8217;s value will bankrupt you: You owe creditors more than you have, and so your shares are worth less than nothing, and you have to enter bankruptcy. If you get the conceptual gist here, you can probably also see how, in good times, when firms are making high profits, &#8220;leverage&#8221; (a high debt-equity ratio) can increase the profits that are returned to shareholders. (But, and this is a bit technical, it does not technically increase shareholder <em>value</em>, because the leverage makes the expected return-on-equity <em>riskier</em>.) It also makes it much easier for firms to slip into bankruptcy when the times are not as good as they had predicted.</p>
<p>So what, then, is the problem with leverage if it just helps shareholders on the upside, and hurts them or causes bankruptcy on the downside? Why should I care if I&#8217;m not a major shareholder, or involved in any way with a highly-levered firm? Or if I am a shareholder, shouldn&#8217;t I be okay with this as long as I have a diversified portfolio that is collectively non-risky? The problem is that, during a credit crunch and financial crisis, bankruptcy is contagious. That is, when a highly-levered firm (which could itself be a bank&#8211;see my upcoming post on Admati) can no longer meet its obligations and enters bankruptcy, it is failing to pay out a cash flow that a bank had been depending on to finance its own activities. So that can send that bank into bankruptcy, or leave it unable to roll over the debt of another firm, sending <em>that</em> firm into bankruptcy. This is basically what a &#8220;credit crunch&#8221; is&#8211;everybody being so indebted to everyone else, that a small economic downturn can cause a string of interlocking insolvencies&#8211;and this is pretty much the story of what has happened in the economy from 2007-present. If companies had had less debt, and financed more of their activities with equity, an economic downturn would have caused their shareholders to take an unpleasant hit, but it would not cause this contagious domino-effect of insolvency.</p>
<p>A lot of what I&#8217;ve written about firms is also true of people, except for the fact that we people don&#8217;t really have the option (yet) of getting outside equity-financing (though some are proposing to equity-finance college loans&#8211;more on this later). For example, we humans have a mortgage-interest deduction, which provides us an incentive to take out relatively larger mortgages on our homes. There are a couple of problems with this. First, since the real-estate market is in reality largely an arms-race to get into the best school district possible, people generally buy the most expensive house they can afford, and so, according to many economists, the economic value of the mortgage-interest deduction is simply capitalized in higher home prices&#8211;i.e., in the aggregate, it doesn&#8217;t provide any easing of financial burdens to homeowners at all. Second, it distorts the market for buying vs. renting property&#8211;and there&#8217;s no particularly compelling reason to do that. And third, and most importantly, as we, again, saw in the financial crisis, more debt makes it easier for you to get wiped out by even small changes in the value of your assets. Suppose bad employment prospects have made it difficult for you to make your mortgage payments&#8211;if, in addition, the value of your house has declined, leaving you &#8220;underwater,&#8221; you won&#8217;t be able to refinance your house, and so you&#8217;ll default. That will reduce the cash flow to the bank that is entitled to them which, in turn, can cause Lehman&#8230; You get the picture. So personal bankruptcies, just like company bankruptcies, are contagious, and they become likelier and more harmful the more debt we all have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I hope that you, gentle reader, do not spend as much time reading economics commentary as I do (because then what use would I be to you?), but one thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that almost all econ-theory minded people want to get rid of all of these distortions. Everyone seems to agree that the ideal tax reform involve lower rates, while getting rid of loopholes and deductions, such that we can actually raise more revenue, while imposing fewer distortions on the marketplace. There&#8217;s a consensus among them. But if there&#8217;s a consensus, why can&#8217;t we get some policy and legal changes done? The answer, of course, is &#8220;vested interests.&#8221; But that term sounds mean, and derogatory, and, more importantly, it understates the difficulty of our challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Because, in this case, the term &#8216;vested interests&#8217; doesn&#8217;t just mean super-rich super-evil tobacco lobbyists, or some such fun-to-hate villain, but actually literally means your mom and dad. Even if your mom and dad have already finished paying off the mortgage on your house, getting rid of the mortgage-interest deduction would hurt them, because it would reduce the sale-value of their house, because it would hurt the real-estate market as a whole (since new buyers won&#8217;t get such large mortgages if they can&#8217;t write them off). And the same goes for the corporate interest deduction&#8211;if we eliminated it, a lot of medium-size firms would  lose a lot of money when they can no longer write off the interest on bonds they issued a decade or two ago. And the same goes for a lot of other loopholes:  if we get rid of the federal deduction of state income taxes, medium-high-income people in high-tax states are going to get badly hurt. All of these people were, when they made these decisions, responding rationally to the incentives our public polices had put in place. They formed rational expectations for the future based off of those expectations. They were good people doing the right thing, in the circumstances and policy landscape that they were presented with, and now the policy changes that we are proposing are going to hurt them and disrupt the life path that the old policies had led them to expect. These people are, quite justly, going to be very upset if their representatives do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>This is why reform is hard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Nonetheless, I&#8217;ll reiterate that we really should do the right thing and eliminate these distortions and tax loopholes if we can. It would obviously be wrong to leave bad policies in place forever. But the longer we leave them in place, the more and more good, rational, reasonable people build their lives around those policies, making them even more costly to be rid of in the future. So the very best time to take the plunge is right away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2779" alt="Santas both" src="http://logosconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/santas-both.png?w=590"   /><span style="color:#000000;">Having <a style="color:#ff0000;" title="Santa Claus: Fact or Fiction?" href="http://logosconcarne.com/2012/12/16/santa-claus-fact-or-fiction/" target="_blank">previously established</a> that Santa <em>has</em> to be magical (because the laws of physics prohibit a real Santa accomplishing successful toy delivery), we can turn to the question of Santa&#8217;s gender. One might question this on the grounds of Santa&#8217;s apparent historic maleness, but in counter I offer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sand" target="_blank">George Sand</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan" target="_blank"><em>Mulan</em></a> and any number of Shakespeare plays.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">One might also question this on the grounds of gender perhaps not applying to magical creatures, to which I reply that Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves seem pretty clear on the matter (although one can never really tell with Dwarves—all that hair and battle armor are quite concealing, and it&#8217;s poor form to actually <em>ask</em>).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In any event, like all &#8220;news&#8221; programs these days, I give you now, two opposing views on the matter of Santa&#8217;s gender. You decide.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-2764"></span></p>
<h3>Santa is a man!</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2758" alt="Santa making toys" src="http://logosconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/santa-2.png?w=590"   /><span style="color:#000000;">It is precisely because Christmas is an <em>&#8220;organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal&#8221;</em> that Santa has to be a man. Delegation… that&#8217;s the key. Just imagine if a woman was trying to delegate all of those tasks and obligations to her underlings. Christmas would be as ambiguous as the spring equinox. Nobody would know what day of the year we were going to celebrate it on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It takes a man to organize a commercial event as huge as Christmas. What with the ads, the parades, the football, and the basketball, the sheer immensity of the task would overwhelm most females. We&#8217;d have to plan football schedules around lunch instead of the other way around. Or worse yet… there might not be any football at all.  [<em>shudder</em>] That&#8217;s a scary thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If Santa was a female, the toys might never be delivered. It would take a she Santa until New Year&#8217;s Eve to get dressed (for the third time) and out of the bathroom. And just try harnessing those reindeer with freshly painted nails. Never happen. Once she got underway, she&#8217;d be too busy talking on the cell phone to her girl friends to get all the way around the world to every girl and boy&#8217;s house in a single year, let alone a single night.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2757" alt="Santa has a secret!" src="http://logosconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/santa-1.png?w=590"   /><span style="color:#000000;">If Santa was female, the whole idea of gift giving would be unrecognizable. Everybody would get socks, or ties, or aftershave, or fuzzy slippers every year. There would be none of the noise-making, shoot &#8216;em up, battery-operated windfalls that kids love. Bicycles would all come complete with helmets and knee pads. And training wheels so nobody could get hurt. Toy soldiers would be replaced by books on improving one&#8217;s self-esteem. Christmas just wouldn&#8217;t be the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I&#8217;ll tell you another reason why Santa has to be a man (<em>and</em> a football fan). Look at the names of his reindeer: Dasher, Comet, <em>Blitzen</em>… If those aren&#8217;t male names for football players, then I&#8217;m an elf!</span></p>
<hr style="color:#ff0000;height:1px;" />
<h3>Santa is a Woman!</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2781" alt="Ms Santa 1" src="http://logosconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/ms-santa-1.png?w=590"   /><span style="color:#000000;">I think Santa Claus is a woman… I hate to be the one to defy a sacred myth, but I believe he&#8217;s a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For starters, the vast majority of men don&#8217;t even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves. On this count alone, I&#8217;m convinced Santa is a woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting there. First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted and strapped to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen&#8217;s rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2782" alt="Ms Santa 2" src="http://logosconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/ms-santa-2.png?w=590"   /><span style="color:#000000;">Even if the male Santa <em>did</em> have reindeer, he&#8217;d still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Other reasons why Santa can&#8217;t possibly be a man:</span></p>
<ul style="color:#000000;">
<li>Men can&#8217;t pack a bag.</li>
<li>Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red</li>
<li>Men would feel their masculinity is threatened having to be seen with all those elves.</li>
<li>Men don&#8217;t answer their mail.</li>
<li>Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a &#8220;bowlful of jelly.&#8221;</li>
<li>Men aren&#8217;t interested in stockings unless somebody&#8217;s wearing them.</li>
<li>Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women.</li>
<li>Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> I can buy the fact that other mythical holiday characters are men:</span></p>
<ul style="color:#000000;">
<li>Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous; definite guy.</li>
<li>Cupid flies around carrying weapons.</li>
<li>Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point fingers.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Any one of these individuals could pass the testosterone screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance.</span></p>
<hr style="color:#ff0000;height:1px;" />
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As with the <a style="color:#ff0000;" title="Santa Claus: Fact or Fiction?" href="http://logosconcarne.com/2012/12/16/santa-claus-fact-or-fiction/" target="_blank">previous attempt</a> to bind Santa to mere physics, I think the attempt to bind Santa to mere gender is doomed to fail.  Santa is more likely quantum and therefore both (and neither) man <em>and</em> woman!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And more importantly… isn&#8217;t there a little Santa in all of us?  Well, there should be. Embrace your inner Santa and be a Santa!  We&#8217;re not turning Japanese; we&#8217;re turning Santa Claus!</span><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_614" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6751/" rel="attachment wp-att-614"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6751.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Pacman vs Tetris, by BauBô.

Dec 12, 2012.</p></div>
<p>Sadly, I am leaving Paris tomorrow, and I very much doubt I&#8217;ll have time today for one of my street art seeking walks, so this will be my last post showing pictures on the subject &#8211; at least until I come back, whenever that may be. (In the meantime I may do posts on the art in general, or on the artists I&#8217;m most interested in, but it&#8217;s less fun if I&#8217;m not taking the pictures, and it&#8217;s less fun if the pictures are dated.)</p>
<p>The news today is that, as noted in the opening ETA section of my last post, I&#8217;ve discovered &#8211; to my great delight &#8211; the artist behind the elaborate masks gracing the 11ème (after she graciously answered a query I put out about it on facebook). The artist in question is <a href="http://humanbaubo.blogspot.fr/">BauBô</a>, whose very interesting website (which incorporates essays and slam poetry among photos of her visual work) seems to indicate that she intends through her work to explore the feminine &#8211; or perhaps, more precisely, perceptions of the feminine, the tyranny of gender roles, et cetera. She&#8217;s got a particularly interesting project going on right now called <a href="http://humanbaubo.blogspot.fr/2012/11/street-art-pacman-vs-feminin-tetris.html">Pacman vs Tetris</a>, an example of which I came across in the 11ème a week or so ago (pictured above).</p>
<p>I only wish I had come across more of these, as, judging by the one pictured above and the photos on her website, they are really awesome. For one thing, from what I understand based on the site, the idea seems to be to comment on the ways girls are socialized to play &#8211; or not to play. As a life-long (female) lover of video games, I am a big, big fan of commentary along these lines (don&#8217;t get me started on the way girls in the West have been discouraged from playing video/computer games). </p>
<p>In any case, BauBô&#8217;s masks series also continues in the general vicinity of my soon-to-be-ex apartment:</p>
<div id="attachment_615" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6707/" rel="attachment wp-att-615"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6707.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Masks arrangement by BauBô. Passage Saint Bernard, 11ème. Dec 11, 2012." width="1024" height="764" class="size-large wp-image-615" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Masks arrangement by BauBô. Passage Saint Bernard, 11ème. Dec 11, 2012.</p></div>
<p>As you can see, by the time I came across and photographed this grouping, it had clearly lost some of its masks in a way similar to the loss (or removal) of masks from the mandala I discussed <a href="https://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/street-art-lacunae/">in my last post</a>. As of this afternoon it had lost yet a few more&#8230; I&#8217;ll forego putting up a picture, as I have nothing particularly new to say (or ask) on the subject, though I continue being fascinated by the ephemeral quality present here (as in all street art), the role of lack / removal, etc. I find it interesting, as well, that despite my great curiosity on the subject of what exactly is going on with the removal of these masks, I&#8217;ve avoided asking the artist what she thinks on the subject. So perhaps the mystery, the opening up of possibilities, is part of the appeal?</p>
<p>Speaking of la Rue de la Main D&#8217;Or (the place where I found the Pacman vs Tetris), I only discovered last week that it, and the neighboring Passage de la Main D&#8217;Or (former home of the &#8220;place au peuple&#8221; grouping I&#8217;ve talked about so often now) are goldmines of street art&#8230; and only a couple of blocks from my house. I <i>would</i> figure this out immediately before leaving and despite having found &#8220;place au peuple&#8221; in it *facepalm*. In any case it yielded a bunch of interesting stuff. Today, for instance, I found 3 &#8220;new&#8221; <a href="http://www.missticinparis.com/">miss.tic</a> oeuvres, all at street level and thus easy to miss:</p>
<div id="attachment_617" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6982/" rel="attachment wp-att-617"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6982.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;Par quel bout le prendre,&quot; miss.tic.

<div id="attachment_618" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6985/" rel="attachment wp-att-618"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6985.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;La nuit tous les chants sont cris,&quot; miss.tic [&quot;at night all songs are screams&quot;].

<div id="attachment_619" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_7033/" rel="attachment wp-att-619"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_7033.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="&quot;Bricole moi un été,&quot; miss.tic. [&quot;Bricoler&quot; is very hard to translate. Sentence roughly means &quot;Build me a summer.&quot;] Passage de la Main D&#039;Or, 11ème. Dec 18 2012." width="764" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-619" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Bricole moi un été,&#8221; miss.tic. ["Bricoler" is very hard to translate. Sentence roughly means "Build me a summer."] Passage de la Main D&#8217;Or, 11ème. Dec 18 2012.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the fact that every miss.tic piece I&#8217;ve seen has been at or very near street level &#8211; I had to kneel to take all three of those photos. Why? A fair bit of street art is very low down (and even more is very high up), but the stuff I see low to the ground isn&#8217;t usually this elaborate. Miss.tic&#8217;s pieces also seem to always be sprayed on the walls of businesses &#8211; nearly always under the front windows &#8211; and I have a hunch a few are there with the owners&#8217; permission; certainly I have a sense of their being more permanent in some way than most of the street art I see. What&#8217;s the story here? Miss.tic has been around since the mid-80s; is it a form of respectability?</p>
<p>The Passage is currently sporting a massive mash-up by many artists &#8211; it&#8217;s clearly a place, like the little square on my street, where this is commonly the case. The mash-up (which has changed since last week) was impossible to photograph all at once, but here&#8217;re my best attempts. First, the east wall, which seems to consist largely of one (&#8220;one&#8221;) work with multiple authors, &#8220;Mustafukaz tribute&#8221;:</p>
<div id="attachment_622" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6759/" rel="attachment wp-att-622"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6759.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;Mustafukaz tribute,&quot; as was written to the left (and is called as much on multiple sites with photos of this).

<p><a href="http://www.mutafukaz.com/"><i>Mustafukaz</i></a> seems to be a bande déssinée, but I&#8217;m not familiar with it and thus don&#8217;t understand the references. I do know that the diamond-shaped pieces up at the top (the alien for instance) are signature <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bastek.Artist">Bastek</a> works (check out that link for, among other things, pictures of the tribute new and in better shape). <a href="http://codexurbanus.tumblr.com/">Codex Urbanus</a> seems to do a lot of animal figures and is, I assume, responsible for the cockroaches. (On a side note, my appalling cockroach phobia, normally set off even by depictions of them, is not triggered if they&#8217;re multicolored. Who knew?)</p>
<p>I was pleased to find, inside the tribute, the remains of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/toctoc.streetart">toctoc</a>&#8216;s Frankenstein figure, created in honor of Hallowe&#8217;en along with his Chucky figure and the figure from Scream that I&#8217;ve already posted:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hogreman/">Hogre</a> (who it turns out is mostly based in Rome) had weighed in at some point, turning the tribute into a mash-up:</p>
<div id="attachment_625" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6803/" rel="attachment wp-att-625"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6803.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="&quot;In music we trust.&quot; Hogre.

Passage de la Main D&#8217;Or. Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>High up on the wall was (and still is) a figure by a mosaicist (I don&#8217;t know who it is &#8211; yet) who has put up several very cool works of this kind in that intersection:</p>
<div id="attachment_627" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6813/" rel="attachment wp-att-627"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6813.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="Mosaic figure, artist unknown. Passage de la Main D&#039;Or. Dec 12 &#039;12." width="764" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-627" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mosaic figure, artist unknown. Passage de la Main D&#8217;Or. Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>Other figures by the same artist are scattered nearby, often difficult to see because they&#8217;re fairly small and usually high up:</p>
<p><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6824/" rel="attachment wp-att-628"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6824.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="IMG_6824" width="764" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-628" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_629" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6992/" rel="attachment wp-att-629"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6992.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="Mosaic figure, artist unknown.

<div id="attachment_630" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6999/" rel="attachment wp-att-630"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6999.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="Another mosaic figure, this one either more abstract or partially destroyed, artist unknown.

Rue de la Main D&#8217;Or. Dec 18 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the south wall of the tiny square, which is, if possible, even more covered in graffiti/art, some of it reaching all the way up the building (I&#8217;m always impressed when they manage to cover such broad surfaces so high up). Space Invader and a Gzup octopus feature in the mash-up:</p>
<div id="attachment_631" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6773/" rel="attachment wp-att-631"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6773.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="Space Invader; crowned octopus by Gzup; rest by unknown artist(s).

Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>On the 12th, sign language was featured underneath the above mash-up (I have no idea who the artist is for this either, or what the message is, if there is one):</p>
<div id="attachment_632" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6777/" rel="attachment wp-att-632"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6777.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Artist unknown.

Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>There was also this rather unusual artifact (gone as of the 18th), painted on a piece of newspaper glued to a torn-off piece of cardboard attached to a pole:</p>
<p><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6821/" rel="attachment wp-att-633"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6821.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="IMG_6821" width="764" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-633" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also discovered, thanks to his papering of the square near my apartment, the graffitist <a href="http://jpmgraffiti.e-monsite.com/">JPM</a> (JP Morvan), whose work seems to be concentrated around celebrating graffiti itself. As a huge comics geek I was delighted to see this tribute (unfortunately already gone) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becassine">Becassine,</a> the first female comic strip heroine (of one of the first comic strips):</p>
<div id="attachment_634" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6562/" rel="attachment wp-att-634"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6562.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="&quot;Bk&#039;sin la graffeuse,&quot; JPM (who to my delight has included a shout-out to Pinchon, her creator).

<p>Other JPM works gracing the wall, some of which are still there:</p>
<div id="attachment_635" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6647/" rel="attachment wp-att-635"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6647.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;Les couleurs explosent sur les murs&quot; [colors explode on the walls], JPM.

Rue de la Forge Royale, Dec 11 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_636" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 774px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6651/" rel="attachment wp-att-636"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6651.jpg?w=764&#038;h=1024" alt="&quot;Coutellier,&quot; JPM (a play on someone&#039;s name and the word for &quot;knife-grinder&quot;).

<p>(The above is rather confusing &#8211; it appears to be a reference to someone named Philippe Coutellier, who appears to be a friend of JPM&#8217;s but may or may not be a street artist himself. The internet is not always very helpful, is it?)</p>
<p>Then there was a really rather awesome, if quite busy, mash-up on the same wall, some of which has been taken down in the week since:</p>
<div id="attachment_638" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6642/" rel="attachment wp-att-638"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6642.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Mash-up by Paddy, JPM, toctoc, Lomozano, and the unknown exclamation point artist.

Rue de la Forge Royale, Dec 11 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>Here I give Paddy props for the woman with the machine gun; I may not be a fan of his figures taking selfies, but this image kinda rocks. And something about the mash-up, busy as it is, works for me. It&#8217;s vibrant. I do wish I knew who was putting up all the cartoons featuring exclamation points &#8211; the internet isn&#8217;t helping me with that either.</p>
<p>[ETA 12/22/12: The "Exclamation point artist" has turned out to be <a href="http://www.onewalltoanother.com/index.php?p=thumbs&amp;cat=maxime-aum">Maxime Aum</a>. Hooray for the internet after all!]</p>
<p>Here we have two of the six or seven of the Maxime Aum works on my block hanging out with the pink bear by K I mentioned in <a href="https://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/paris-street-art-nouveautes-new-stuff/">my last smorgasbord post</a>:</p>
<div id="attachment_639" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6675/" rel="attachment wp-att-639"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6675.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Two exclamation points hanging out with one of K&#039;s teddy bears.

<p>[edited 12/21/12] (I won&#8217;t post now all the pictures I have of the exclamation points cartoons, which I see more and more, but I may do later posts on specific artists, including Maxime Aum.) [/edited]</p>
<p>Back to Passage Saint-Bernard. Currently there&#8217;s this, unsigned. It&#8217;s one of 2-3 pieces I&#8217;ve spotted lately that look like miss.tic&#8217;s style but which I either can tell (due to the signature) or strongly suspect are not by her:</p>
<div id="attachment_641" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6693/" rel="attachment wp-att-641"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6693.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;Vendez moi du rêve!&quot; [sell me dreams!] Artist unknown, Passage Saint Bernard, Dec 11 &#039;12." width="1024" height="764" class="size-large wp-image-641" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Vendez moi du rêve!&#8221; [sell me dreams!] Artist unknown, Passage Saint Bernard, Dec 11 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also this small tile installation up on one wall, which seems to have been written on by several different people and which I can&#8217;t make heads or tails of:</p>
<div id="attachment_642" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6697/" rel="attachment wp-att-642"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6697.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="Colored tiles, artist unknown. Passage Saint Bernard, Dec 11 &#039;12." width="1024" height="764" class="size-large wp-image-642" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Colored tiles, artist unknown. Passage Saint Bernard, Dec 11 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>In other news, a feminist (and apparently lesbian) graffitist likes to spray-paint political statements on the sidewalk Rue de Charonne. For example:</p>
<div id="attachment_643" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6737/" rel="attachment wp-att-643"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6737.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;Gouine banale,&quot; graffitist unknown. Rue de Charonne. Dec 12 &#039;12." width="1024" height="764" class="size-large wp-image-643" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Gouine banale,&#8221; graffitist unknown. Rue de Charonne. Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that fits into the category of street art &#8211; whatever &#8220;street art&#8221; means &#8211; but I rather like seeing these around.</p>
<p>Finally, for now (as I said, I may post on this again even once I&#8217;m back in the states), I&#8217;ll end with FatCat, whose whimsical little drawings/tags cheer me up (though they never seem to last more than a couple of days):</p>
<div id="attachment_644" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maratinage.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/paris-street-art-a-final-round-up-un-assortiment-finale/img_6731/" rel="attachment wp-att-644"><img src="http://maratinage.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_6731.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="&quot;FatCat wishes you a good day,&quot; signed ACBS. Rue de Charonne, Dec 12 &#039;12." width="1024" height="764" class="size-large wp-image-644" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;FatCat wishes you a good day,&#8221; signed ACBS. Rue de Charonne, Dec 12 &#8217;12.</p></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s it (again, at least for now). I leave Paris in less than 36 hours, to go back to a place with no street art beyond some tagging (and tagging tends to profoundly bore me). I have to admit that losing the street art scene &#8211; its ever-changing-ness, its providing jolts of interest or joy in otherwise tiring or dull days, its freshness, its changing the face of the city day to day &#8211; losing it, I was saying, is a major part of my current distress around leaving. I just discovered that I love this stuff, and I live on a street with galleries devoted to street art that I never even had time to check out (I just found out I missed a showing this very Saturday)&#8230; eh, I suppose c&#8217;est la vie. I am a French citizen; I can come back, if I find a way to live. And maybe there&#8217;s a way to stay involved in the scene from afar, if only by enviously trolling other websites. But still&#8230; I&#8217;ll miss taking my walks and spotting new Space Invaders and toctocs and Gzups and miss.tics and BauBôs and Ks and Soldats Inconnus and all the work by all the amazing artists combing this city. Goodbye for now, Paris street art.</p>
