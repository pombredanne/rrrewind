			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever seen someone who looks exactly like someone you know?</p>
<p>I was one hundred percent convinced today that I saw my old friend, Anna, in the bank. Five years ago Anna moved to Paris with her husband and I haven&#8217;t seen her in the flesh since (although, obviously, I&#8217;ve spoken to her on the phone, emailed her etc.) but I thought she might have come back to Sydney to surprise me because she is the kind of person who does things like that. So I was excited when I saw her in the bank.</p>
<p>It was uncanny how much the person I thought was Anna looked like her. Anna is a beautiful brunette with long hair and even longer limbs. She is willowy and ethereal looking. Not many people look like her so it would be difficult to mistake someone else for her.</p>
<p>When I saw Anna in the bank I actually gave a little yelp. Sort of like a cowboy going <strong>ay-ay-yippy-yippy-ay.</strong> It was an involuntary response. The people in the bank looked at me, wondering if they should alert security, so I sort of adopted the cowboy theme I&#8217;d set up with the ay-ay-yippy and swaggered over to Anna as if I&#8217;d just lassooed a few cows and eaten a pot full of beans.</p>
<p>Except that <em>Anna</em> wasn&#8217;t Anna. When she spoke I knew it wasn&#8217;t her, but until that point I was convinced it was my old friend &#8211; even up close.</p>
<p>Seeing the pseudo Anna unsettled me a bit because I am pretty good with faces. I usually don&#8217;t get people I know mixed up with complete strangers. The only conclusion I can come to is that today I encountered Anna&#8217;s doppelganger.</p>
<p>They say we all have a double somewhere in the world. A doppelganger. The problem with a doppelganger is that even though it might look exactly like us it is supposedly representative of evil. Our evil side come to life, perhaps. However, I don&#8217;t think the woman in the bank was the evil Anna. In fact, she seemed quite nice.</p>
<p>I know several people who have had a doppelganger interlude, including my friend Jules. She saw a woman she thought was me when she was on holiday in Sweden about ten years ago. The funny thing is that she was still convinced it was me even after striking up a conversation with the woman. She thought it was me putting on an accent. To this day she will bring it up occasionally, saying : &#8216;Are you sure it wasn&#8217;t you?&#8217;  I laugh about it in a slightly nervous way while Jules says (pointing at me): &#8216;She looked exactly like you. <strong>Exactly</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://selmainthecity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo-booth4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4729" title="Photo Booth4" src="http://selmainthecity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo-booth4.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><strong>{ Me and my doppelganger}</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the frequency of genetic variation in the general population with regard to facial characteristics is but it is probably fair to say there are a finite number of combinations when it comes to the composition of facial features. Chances are there is someone out there somewhere who looks just like me. Or you.</p>
<p>In some traditions seeing the doppelganger of a friend or relative means illness or danger while seeing a doppelganger of yourself is an omen of death.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope that any cases of doppelganger spotting we encounter are just a trick of the light or a case of mistaken identity. But if you are convinced it is in fact another person&#8217;s double my advice to you is to run. <strong>RUN.</strong></p>
<p>Run and don&#8217;t look back.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a few days shooting some branded short film content in San Francisco and Monterey, California, Jen and I decided to do some exploring down one of the most dramatic coastlines in America &#8211; Big Sur. A place of a counter-cultural revolution in the 1960&#8242;s and still home to the mind-expanding <a href="www.esalen.org/">Esalen Institute</a>, this coastline is as beautifully eccentric as the people who call it home. I had done a little research on the area and discovered a one of a kind accommodation &#8211; The Human Nest at <a href="www.treebonesresort.com/">Treebones Resort</a>. This artistic creation is half driftwood sculpture, half nomadic treehouse and presents the human inhabitants an unforgettable, gnarled wood-framed view of the Pacific ocean, complete with elephant seal choir and enough moonlight to read Kerouac, Miller or any other literary Big-Sur enthusiast. Enjoy these moonlit shots of the nest and the rugged Big Sur coast.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When visiting the famous Versailles on our trip to France a year ago, I was faced with a contradiction I have rarely met in my short photography life : as beautiful and rich in details and history as the place was, I found it almost impossible to photograph.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Château de Versailles" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/chteau2.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>Not because of the crowd &#8211; which was, let&#8217;s say it, an attraction in itself. You could hardly take a picture without having another tourist standing in the way. If photographs really do capture your soul, certainly no one left Versailles with theirs still intact.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Crowd" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/chteau1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>Not because the place lacks in the aesthetics department, either : the place is, indeed, beautiful, and was in the process of being restored to its former glory when we visited.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Old versus The New versus The Old" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/chteau3.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>No, the <em>Château de Versailles</em> is, indeed, a stunning place, where it seems you could take a picture every second from morning to night and still not have photographed it all. From its imposing exterior to its dazzling gardens, the place is filled with &#8220;oohs&#8221; and &#8220;aahs&#8221; moments waiting to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Oohs and Aahs" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/chteau4.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>But you see, the thing is, Versailles has been photographed so many times before, I felt like I already kind of knew the place. On magazines, in books, in movies, Versailles is an illustrious piece or architecture and history that is impossible to ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Garden of Versailles" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/jardin1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>As a result, I was left wondering : how could I photograph it in a new, different way? How could I make sure that the pictures I took would bring back my memories of this beautiful sunny day, without looking like pale imitations of all the similar ones before? How could I make these souvenirs as personal as the experience was?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Sculpture in the Gardens" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/jardin5small.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>Because our memories are unique, most of us want our pictures to reflect that. We don&#8217;t want to look through our albums, solid or virtual, and feel it&#8217;s the same as our next door neighbor&#8217;s, who went there with his wife 15 years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Gardens of Versailles" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/jardin4.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>One of my photography teachers used to say : &#8220;If you take 1000 photographers, and place them all on the same spot in the same conditions, and ask them all to take a picture of the same thing, you&#8217;ll still end up with a thousand of different pictures, even if your eye can&#8217;t always perceive the difference.&#8221; I get what he meant; but it&#8217;s still a challenge, when I point my lenses at things, to make sure that at least I, can see the difference when going through my pictures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Sculpture in the Gardens" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/jardin6small.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>In the end though, I had to step back and simply &#8220;enjoy the ride&#8221;, as they say. Sure, tons of my pictures (if not all) would look similar to all the other ones out there. But I didn&#8217;t want to live my experience solely through the lens, either. To use another commonplace, I had to &#8220;live in the moment&#8221;, and worry about the rest later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Gardens of Versailles" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v121/Zvaella/Paris%202010/jardin3.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly hard to do when you&#8217;ve spend so much time photographing everything. You look at stunning architecture and think &#8220;That would make such a great picture!&#8221; But I don&#8217;t regret it for one second : I still managed to take an amazing amount of pictures, and they are filled with memories I couldn&#8217;t have otherwise. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Day 1 &#8211; 5.2 miles with 470 metres ascent</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5602" title="Day 1" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=287" alt="" width="300" height="287" /></a></p>
<p>I did a couple of circuits of Ravenstonedale looking for a spot where I would be happy to leave the van for two nights.  By the time I actually parked up I had no idea how my location actually related to the map.  I feel a bit ashamed to admit that I powered up the mapping on my iPhone to determine my exact location.</p>
<p>It was early afternoon and I had arranged to meet Martin and Terry at a high level camp later on that evening.  I had previously backpacked with Martin and we had got along well, I had yet to meet or speak to Terry.  However after reading his blog and watching his videos for a while now I had a firm image in my mind what he would be like.  He lived up to those expectations in the flesh!</p>
<p>With my map now following the reality of what was on the ground I located my first footpath with ease and crossed a field.  I was immediately surrounded by the friendliest lambs I have ever come across.  They all crowded around me, pushing and shoving to see who could get the closest.  One even nuzzled my knee and was up for a good stroke.  This put a big smile on my face as I made my way along lanes to the A863.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030736.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5543" title="P1030736" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030736.jpg?w=546&#038;h=610" alt="" width="546" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>The weather however soon removed my smile as I fully kitted up in waterproofs whilst watching the clouds get lower and lower on Wild Boar Fell ahead.  A steady drizzle soon gave way to a downpour on my climb up the bridleway that eventually leads to Mallerstang.  I found temporary shelter under a band of trees and stood watching the cows as I loaded up on fuel for the long climb ahead.  From the Limestone pastures of Stennerskeugh Clouds I looked towards where Sand Tarn was located, hidden from view by the mist.  I took a bearing to a cairn on the horizon and descended across marshy ground before ascending the grassy hillside.  The clouds were lifting by the time I reached the tarn, ragged tendrils drifting across its surface.  It looked a dark and foreboding place the shifting mist providing a gloomy atmosphere.  I located a spot for the tent, pitched up and laid down for a while.  My empty thoughts were soon disturbed by a brightening though the nylon and I peered outside to see the sun weakly piercing the clouds.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030748.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5544" title="P1030748" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030748.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>With a change in the weather came a change in atmosphere around my high wild camp, it went from dark and brooding to bright and friendly in less than an hour.  I sat and cooked my dinner and and ate it on a rock overlooking my ascent route.  In the distance I spotted two figures slowly make their way toward me, disappearing from sight every now and then as the moorland dipped.  Finally Martin and Terry appeared over the final rise and wandered over to say hello.  Tents and shelters were erected and we spent the evening in awe at the spectacle that nature laid on for us.  The ever-changing light was magical as the sun made its slow progress towards the horizon.  Sand tarn soon became a very inviting spot indeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030754.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5545" title="P1030754" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030754.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030756.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5546" title="P1030756" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030756.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>I think that we must have taken hundreds of photos between us that evening, it was hard to resist snapping away constantly.  We wandered around camp for hours chatting about days in the hills and kit, pulling on more and more layers as the air chilled around us.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030764.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5547" title="P1030764" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030764.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030765.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5548" title="P1030765" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030765.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030772.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5550" title="P1030772" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030772.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030786.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5551" title="P1030786" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030786.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030788.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5552" title="P1030788" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030788.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>

<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/backpacking-bloggers-in-the-howgills/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/7qEaKTfAWB8/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Just before the sun finally disappeared from sight we started guessing what the temperature was.  It felt cold, far colder than I have ever experienced in June.  My watch left in my tent said that it was 3 degrees celsius.  We were all glad we had brought along warm down bags that night.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2 &#8211; 11.1 miles with 870 metres ascent</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5603" title="Day 2" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=177" alt="" width="300" height="177" /></a></p>
<p>We had hoped, almost expected to wake to a spectacular inversion.  Mist had started to form in the valley the evening before and the air had been clear and totally still.  The inner of my tent was soaked with condensation, in some conditions this is totally unavoidable.  The climb to the trig point on Wild Boar fell was steep but short.  A great spot but the best of the views are hidden by its extensive plateau.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030795.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5554" title="P1030795" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030795.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>However a couple of minutes walk away the ground plunges steeply into the valley of Mallerstang.  An outcrop of rock called the Nab is the perfect spot to stand and linger whilst taking in the views.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030796.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5555" title="P1030796" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030796.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030799.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5556" title="P1030799" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030799.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>The eastern escarpment stretches for roughly a kilometre, bringing a bit of drama to the usual soft folds of the Pennines.  Tall slender cairns look like people standing by the edge from a distance.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030798.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5557" title="P1030798" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030798.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5558" title="P1030801" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030801.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>It was a relaxed walk towards Swarth fell, easy chatter about the stuff that backpackers find interesting, common interests shared.  Lots of time to take in the wild and deserted landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030806.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5559" title="P1030806" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030806.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>The original plan had been to ascend Baugh fell but we were all tempted to explore the hidden delights of Uldale, a world of gorges and waterfalls, hardly hinted at by the map.  An easy grassy descent led to a crossing of the infant river, it was a case of ignore the map and seek out the best line down the valley.  Terry had come this way before so took the lead.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030808.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5560" title="P1030808" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030808.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>We contoured steep slopes high above the river hidden below.  It was hard slow going, the calling then sighting of a Red Kite adding to the experience.  Suddenly we were on the edge of a large sheer drop, the sound of a hidden waterfall below us.  A steep descent and a bit of muddy scrambling brought us into a secret oasis, a deep pool surrounded by luxurious vegetation.  A small cascade fell into the pool whilst behind, partially hidden from view a large waterfall plunged into a rocky amphitheatre.  A truly lovely spot.  Terry was the only one to brave a slippery traverse of the rocks above the pool to get a closer look.  Food was eaten in the sun until a heavy shower got us packing and on our way.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030809.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5561" title="P1030809" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030809.jpg?w=458&#038;h=610" alt="" width="458" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>We stuck to the valley bottom as best as we could until a wide grassy bridleway lead us high above the Rawthey valley, the view towards the steep grassy Howgills becoming more dominant with every step.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030812.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5563" title="P1030812" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030812.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030813.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5564" title="P1030813" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030813.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030814.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5565" title="P1030814" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030814.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>There was talk of food and ice-cold cokes on the descent to the road and it was suggested that we see if the Cross Keys Temperance Inn was open.  Thankfully it was and we were soon sitting on the back patio with pints of coke and bowls of chips.  We were aware of the steep climb ahead of us to the summit of Yarlside, a hill that has a bit of a reputation for its exceptionally steep grassy slopes.  It can sometimes be difficult getting back up and backpacking after a good feed and sit down but we were soon making swift progress up the path towards Bowderdale Head.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030816.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5566" title="P1030816" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030816.jpg?w=458&#038;h=610" alt="" width="458" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>Cautley crags and the surrounding hills looked like they were covered in green velvet, the greenness of summer must surely have been at its peak?</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5567" title="P1030817" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030817.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>A group was passed at Bowderdale head and a guy made a comment that we must be sponsored by Rab.  I have to admit that we were all pretty much dressed head to toe in the stuff!  By the way I am not sponsored by Rab but if they would like to sponsor me&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>It was steep and slow going as we climbed Yarlside.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030818.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5568" title="P1030818" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030818.jpg?w=458&#038;h=610" alt="" width="458" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>The summit gave amazing views of line after line of hills spreading into the distance.  Looking west there was no suggestion of the hand of man, walls and fences being absent from this cracking little range of hills.  The sky was moody and broody and we watched showers as they tracked their way across the landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030819.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5569" title="P1030819" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030819.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030823.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5570" title="P1030823" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030823.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>Terry made the suggestion of a camp high on the summit, to sit in our tents and stare at the views would be a great way to pass away the evening.  There may even be another sunset treat.  The wind however would have made it unpleasant and myself and Martin persuaded him that a sheltered camp would be a better idea, even if we lost the views.  The descent to the saddle between Yarlside and Kensgriff is exceptionally steep.  A slip in wet weather here could potentially be serious, you would slide down the cropped grass with speed.  We descended in a row just in case someone did slip, that way they would not take anyone else down with them.</p>
<p>The flat spot that we identified was not as flat as it looked from higher up the hill.  Once the tents were up it started to rain which it continued to so on and off for the rest of the evening.  Once again it was cold and I felt like I was dressed for winter.  Terry had brought a special beer dispensing rucksack with him on this trip, a ready supply of cans being produced each evening.  I am sure that the taste of beer on a wild camp would have been very pleasant, but I never found out <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Day 3 &#8211; 4.9 miles with 270 metres ascent</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5604" title="Day 3" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=288" alt="" width="300" height="288" /></a></p>
<p>We were up and out of our tents by 6.00am.  The cold and rain of the night before being replaced by a bright sunny morning, the warmth already being felt.  A time to appreciate our camp spot, something we had not been able to do before.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030833.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5571" title="P1030833" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030833.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030837.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5572" title="P1030837" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030837.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>We were walking by 7.00am, something that I rarely do.  The light soft and clear bringing out the textures of the surrounding hills.  It was worth getting up early for.</p>

<p>Various sheep trods helped us as we contoured along the steep slopes of Kensgriff.  It was a steep pull in the increasing warmth to the col below Randygill Top.</p>

<p>The ascent was best summed up by Terry.</p>

<p>Once up high the walking along a good path to the trig point on Green Bell was easy.  A last chance to take in this unique range of hills.  I mapped out some future routes in my mind and we talked about the possibility of a backpack that took in all the summits.  That would be a challenge, not so much in distance but in all the steep ascents and descents that would be necessary.  I think that would make a cracking long weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030847.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5576" title="P1030847" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030847.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030848.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5577" title="P1030848" src="http://backpackingbongos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1030848.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>We left the path at Knoutberry and made our way down easy pathless slopes to Ravenstonedale.  It was still early morning when we arrived at the village shop to buy cold drinks.  The village looked idyllic in the summer sunshine.  We were lucky to get such a perfect weather window that morning as on the drive home it tipped it down.</p>
<p>All in all an enjoyable and relaxed backpack with good company.  You can read Martin&#8217;s account of the trip <a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/07/bloggers-in-howgills.html"><strong>here</strong></a>, and Terry&#8217;s <a href="http://terrybnd.blogspot.com/2011/06/wild-camping-howgills-dales-boar-fell.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama1_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" alt="" width="646" height="433" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Reesan from <a href="http://loneleeplanet.com/">loneleeplanet</a> has started up a new blogging festival called <a href="http://japingu.com/j-festa/">J-Festa</a> to showcase the best of Japan, and <a href="http://japingu.com/2011/07/01/j-festa-july-2011-theme/">this month’s theme</a> is “Places in Japan.” I thought I would use the opportunity to feature a place that I visited last summer. At the time, I was taking advanced Japanese classes at the <a href="http://ogp.columbia.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&amp;Program_ID=10320&amp;Type=O&amp;sType=O">Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies</a>, and as part of the <a href="http://clscholarship.org/">Critical Language Scholarship</a> (CLS), I was given a free one-week <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html">Japan Rail Pass</a>. Those of you who have been to Japan know that this is an *amazing* opportunity. With a Japan Rail Pass, you can go pretty much anywhere in the country, and you can even ride the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen">shinkansen bullet trains</a> (though not the very fastest class). The only catch?</p>
<p>I only had 36 hours to make my trip.</p>
<p>You see, CLS had already planned a packed itinerary for us that included mainstays such as Hiroshima, Miyajima, Tokyo, and Kamakura, so we only had a little bit of free time with which to use our rail passes.</p>
<p>So, I decided to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takayama,_Gifu">Takayama</a>, one of Japan’s best preserved “traditional” towns and a place I had been wanting to see for quite some time. Takayama was established in the late 16th century as the castle town of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanamori_clan">Kanamori clan</a> and came under the control of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1692. The current town still retains the layout from the Kanamori period, and it has over a dozen museums featuring elements of traditional life, as well as a number of sake breweries, markets, and other interesting sights. Although Takayama is a pretty small place, and I was only there for a day, I saw so many interesting things that I could easily fill a half a dozen posts with my photos and stories. So, I’ll try to hit the highlights and give you an overview of what this great place has to offer.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama2.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama2" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama2_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama2" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After a quick trip from Kyoto to Nagoya, I connected to the JR Takayama limited express line. The train ride through the mountains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifu_Prefecture">Gifu</a> was simply gorgeous (although fast trains and low light don’t make for particularly good photographs.) Much of our journey took place along the river, and we got to see a number of pretty dams and waterfalls.</p>
<p>I arrived in Takayama after nightfall and made my way to my accommodations for the evening. Instead of staying in a typical hotel, I decided to stay at the <a href="http://takayamahostelzenkoji.com/index.html">Zenkoji Temple Inn</a>, a real, functioning branch of <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6001.html">Nagano’s famous Zenko-ji temple</a> that had been converted to include hostel style accommodations.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama3.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama3" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama3_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama3" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>When I arrived, I was escorted through a long hallway surrounding a courtyard garden to a very cute Japanese-style private room. My favorite thing about the room was the shapes of the various windows—the one on the wall to the right (not visible) was shaped like a crescent moon. When I woke up in the morning and the room was dark except for these windows flooded with white light, it made for quite the atmosphere.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama4.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama4" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama4_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama4" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, if you’re looking for a reasonably priced and atmospheric place to stay (and don’t mind communal bathrooms and the like), I’d recommend this place.</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, I went straight out to explore the town. I was particularly keep to visit some of the <em>asa-ichi</em> (<a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5907.html">morning markets</a>) that take place every day from 7 am until noon. I went to the Miyagawa Morning Market along the east bank of the Miyagawa river. Local farmers sold produce and other handmade items, and there were also a number of shops selling local souvenirs.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama5.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama5" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama5_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama5" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The most interesting of the souvenirs was the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarubobo">saru-bobo</a></em> (literally, “baby monkeys”), dolls of colored (typically red) fabric with pointy limbs and featureless faces. In earlier days, grandmothers in this then-impoverished town used to make these kinds of dolls for children. Since they hoped for the happiness and good health of the children, local vendors tell you that you too can be happy, if you have one of these dolls.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama6.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama6" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama6_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama6" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>One of the key highlights of Takayama is just walking down its streets, which are still lined with traditional low-roofed buildings. You can look at the homes of former merchants, many of which have been restored, or you can wander into museums featuring a wide variety of work by local craftspeople. The two shots below were taken at the Hirata Folk Art Museum, a restored house filled with everything from carvings to pottery to antique hair decorations.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama7.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama7" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama7_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama7" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama8.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama8" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama8_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama8" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Being the museum enthusiast that I am, I also visited two more museums, the <a href="http://www.hida-hachiman.org/en/05_yataikaikan/index.html">Takayama Matsuri Yataikaikan</a> and the <a href="http://www.hida-hachiman.org/en/06_nikkokan/index.html">Nikko-kan</a>, both of which reside on the grounds of a hillside shrine called <a href="http://www.hida-hachiman.org/en/index.html">Sakurayama Hachimangu</a>. The Takayama Matsuri Yataikaikan displays a rotating selection of the <em>yatai</em> (floats) used in the annual Takayama Matsuri (Festival). Some of these floats date back to the 17th century and feature incredibly ornate carvings, lacquer, and metalwork. Some also feature mechanical puppets that perform complicated tricks and routines.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama9.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama9" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama9_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama9" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama10.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="takayama10" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama10_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama10" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I have to say that I found the Nikko-kan incredibly impressive. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikk%C5%8D,_Tochigi">Nikko</a> is a very famous Japanese city located about 140 km north of Tokyo, home to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikk%C5%8D_T%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D-g%C5%AB">Nikko Tosho-gu</a>, a Shinto shrine that houses the remains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. Takayama’s Nikko-kan houses a <em>one-tenth scale replica</em> of this incredibly ornate 28-building temple complex. It took 15 years and 33 carpenters to create this replica during the Taisho era (1912-1925). The replica was shown in various parts of the United States after World War II and at the Aoi Exposition in Okazaki in 1987. After that, the replica was designated to be stored at the Sakurayama Hachimangu shrine “eternally” by the owner’s will.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama11.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama11" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama11_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama11" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And just to take things one step further, the Nikko-kan has a computerized lighting system that reproduces the day from sunrise to sunset at Nikko. It’s almost like really being there!</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama12.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama12" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama12_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama12" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Having made a pretty good attempt at seeing things in Takayama proper, I then caught a bus out of town to Hida-no-Sato—also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hida_Minzoku_Mura_Folk_Village">Hida Minzoku Mura Folk Village</a>—a huge open-air museum of almost 30 traditional farmhouses built in the unique architectural style of Japan’s mountainous areas.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama13.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama13" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama13_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama13" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This area’s signature architectural style is the thatch-roofed <em>gassho-zukuri</em>, which look utterly unlike the structures you see most other places in Japan.  <em>Gassho-zukuri </em>means “clasped hands,” and these buildings have very steep roofs designed to allow rain and snow to fall straight off, preventing water from getting through and preventing the thatch from getting too wet and beginning to rot. The buildings that now reside in the Hida Folk Village used to be separated by miles and miles—they were transferred from their original locations to the open-air museum for preservation, so they reflect a number of different styles. Visitors can actually go inside most of the buildings, which are filled with displays of traditional tools or crafts.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama14.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama14" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama14_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama14" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama15.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama15" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama15_thumb.jpg?w=317&#038;h=421" alt="takayama15" width="317" height="421" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After a couple of hours wandering around the open-air museum, I took the bus back to town and concluded my time in Takayama by sampling one of its famous foods: Hida-gyu (Hida beef). You’ve heard of the wonderfully delicious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef">Kobe beef</a>, right? Well, Kobe beef is just one type of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagy%C5%AB">wagyu</a></em>, several breeds of Japanese cattle genetically predisposed to intense marbling and a high percentage of unsaturated fat. There are five different areas that are home to the major breeds of <em>wagyu</em>, and Hida is one of them. I’m a huge fan of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakiniku">yakiniku</a> </em>(bite-size pieces of meat grilled meat, or “Japanese barbeque”), so I decided to have my Hida-gyu yakiniku-style. Here’s a shot of my dinner, pre-grilling:</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama16.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="takayama16" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/takayama16_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=486" alt="takayama16" width="646" height="486" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Makes me hungry just looking at it!</p>
<p>And with that, you have the story of my very quick, very productive, and very fun 36-hour excursion to Takayama. If you’re looking for a bit of the traditional, and you’d like to see something a little less common (or if it’s really hot and you’re looking for someplace a few degrees cooler than the Kansai region), I’d really recommend this place. It’s small, but it’s packed with quaint and interesting things to see and do. I was really impressed with how tourist-friendly it was—even if you don’t speak any Japanese, you’ll be fine. Things are well marked, and even if the locals don’t speak English, they’re incredibly friendly and seem to genuinely want all of their tourist to have a good time. (You can imagine how important tourism is to this area.) If I had more time, I would have spent more time in the museums, checked out a couple of the sake breweries, and maybe gone out to surrounding places like <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5950.html">Shirakawa-go</a>.</p>
<p>Or, if you’re on the other side of Honshu, <a href="http://amoderngirl.wordpress.com/2005/11/28/kanazawa-weekend/">Kanazawa</a> is another traditional town that really gives you a feel for “old” Japan.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1018" title="Business Kids" src="http://dmtartistry.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dmt-042811-business-kids.jpg?w=293&#038;h=193" alt="Respect as a Marketing Tool" width="293" height="193" />It&#8217;s a funny thing being a graphic designer&#8230; or a photographer, or a retail manager, or a plumber, or a real estate agent, or just about any professional. The majority of humanity assumes that what you do isn&#8217;t really all that difficult.</p>
<p>In the course of business, I&#8217;ve had several conversations that went something like this:</p>
<p>THEM: &#8220;So, what business are you in?&#8221;</p>
<p>ME: &#8220;I operate a successful graphic design firm.&#8221;<em></em></p>
<p>THEM: &#8220;No kidding. My 12-year-old niece is really good at designing stuff on the computer.&#8221;<em></em></p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What on earth just happened? I introduced myself as a professional in my field, and my hard-earned skills were insta-compared to the playful stylings of a 12-year-old child. Assuming said child is not some graphic design prodigy, my abilities have just been utterly and depressingly &#8220;dissed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hard to swallow, but typically true, is that most people don&#8217;t realize what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s not abject cruelty. It&#8217;s simply ignorance.</p>
<p>They will likely never equate the trials and tribulations they&#8217;ve faced to become what they are today, with the equally enormous amounts of effort required to become what you are today. Why? Because, as empathetic as we might wish to be, it&#8217;s still remarkably difficult to put ourselves in someone else&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the deal. You are a business person. You have a skill set that was acquired through long hours, years of toil, mistakes, missed sleep and mind-numbing quantities of heavy thought. And now you know something that most people don&#8217;t &#8211; that every individual not only needs to FEEL like their skills are special and important, they ARE special and important.</p>
<p>USE THAT INFORMATION. Sincere respect and recognition go a LONG way toward making you and your business stand out.</p>
<p>Look at it as a marketing tool; look at it as common courtesy. Either way, offering reaffirmation of something that plays such an important role in your customers&#8217; lives is the key to launching a mutually respectful relationship.</p>
<p><strong>This Week&#8217;s DMT Challenge:</strong> Think of someone whose work you know very little about &#8211; your house-cleaner, your mailman, your child&#8217;s teacher, your lawn mower tech. Ask them when and how they got into their industry. Ask them what their workday entails. Ask them what skills and knowledge are needed to do what they do. Ask them how long it took them to become an expert in their field. Ask them what sorts of challenges they had to overcome along the way.</p>
<p>You may not be the only one surprised by the answers. They might be, too, once they stop and think about everything they had to do and learn to get where they are today!</p>
<p><em>We know you&#8217;ve worked hard to get where you are. That&#8217;s why we always give you our best.</em></p>

I'm not gonna write you a love song, but I might just be about to write you a love letter.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&amp;blog=256907&amp;post=2811&amp;subd=freshlypressed&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://theoohlalalife.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/sarabareilles.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2812" title="Sara+Bareilles" src="http://theoohlalalife.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/sarabareilles.png?w=300&#038;h=285" alt="" width="300" height="285" /></a>Dear Sara Bareilles,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not gonna write you a love song, but I might just be about to write you a love letter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been hungry for words, a reader, a writer, a lyric aficionado.  I adore metaphors.  Counting Crows, for instance, they just kill me with the genius of the pictures they paint, the emotions they evoke with words.  Not a lot of artists can put their thumb into the hole in my heart and either make it throb almost unbearably or make it stop hurting for a while.  You are one of those who has power over my emotions.</p>
<p>Madly in love was I with every single song on your first record, and I hoped so much for a strong second.  I wanted more of what was in your head, the same as before, but different.  How scary it is to download the new one upon release and know that listening to it that first time, it will be a stranger to me.  Blessedly, by now it&#8217;s another close friend.  Not one who has seen me through a lot yet, but one who I am confident will be there for me through some <em>stuff</em>.</p>
<p>It would be pointless of me to list favorites, as I might as well type most of every song, but I&#8217;ll reference just a bit.  To be able to sing along with &#8220;Maybe nobody loved you when you were young&#8221; in Machine Gun is so empowering.  The juxtaposition of such a lyric to an upbeat melody&#8230; the recipient won&#8217;t even know what hit him/her!  Reminds me of &#8220;There was never a moment, now you know, you ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul&#8221; from Patty Griffin.  Ouch, right?!</p>
<p>Every word in &#8220;Gonna Get Over You&#8221; and &#8220;Basket Case&#8221;, which is more like poetry, are perfection.  Some days just what I need and some days, like today, too close to home.  Every time I listen, something new jumps out and settles or stirs the dust in my mind.  I&#8217;ll close with the latest to do so:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This pair of wing&#8217;s worn and rusted<br />
From too many years by my side<br />
They can carry me, swear to be sturdy and strong<br />
But see, turning them on still means goodbye&#8221;</p></blockquote>
