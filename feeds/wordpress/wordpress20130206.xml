				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking back over their press releases, it&#8217;s interesting to see how Apple has described itself over the years. When the text only changes a little, I&#8217;ve italicised additions:</p>
<h4>April 1995</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4013" alt="press-release-1995" src="http://alex4d.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/press-release-1995.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Computer, Inc., a recognized pioneer and innovator in the information industry, creates powerful solutions based on easy to use personal computers, servers peripherals, software, online services and personal digital assistants. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) develops, manufactures, licenses, and markets products, technologies, and services for the business, education, consumer, scientific &amp; engineering and government markets in over 140 countries.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-4004"></span></p>
<h4><strong>January 1996</strong></h4>
<p>In 1996, Apple defined QuickTime as one of its major assets:</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Computer, Inc., a recognized innovator in the information industry <em>and leader in multimedia technologies</em>, creates powerful solutions based on easy-to-use personal computers, servers, peripherals, software, online services, and personal digital assistants. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) develops, manufactures, licenses and markets solutions, products, technologies and services for business, education, consumer, entertainment, scientific &amp; engineering and government customers in over 140 countries.&#8221;</p>
<h4><strong>April 1997</strong></h4>
<p>As less complex PDAs started to gain market share, &#8216;online services, and personal digital assistants&#8217; became &#8216;handheld computers and Internet content<em>&#8216;:<br />
</em></p>
<div>&#8220;Apple Computer, Inc., a recognized innovator in the information industry and leader in multimedia technologies, creates powerful solutions based on easy-to-use personal computers, servers, peripherals, software, <em>handheld computers and Internet content.</em> Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple develops, manufactures, licenses and markets solutions, products, technologies and services for business, education, consumer, entertainment, scientific and engineering and government customers in more than 140 countries.&#8221;</div>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;line-height:14px;"><strong>September 1997</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4014" alt="press-release-1997" src="http://alex4d.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/press-release-1997.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p>10 months after Steve Jobs returned to Apple, four days before <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010816130723/http://product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q4/970916.pr.rel.jobs.html" target="_blank">his appointment as Interim CEO</a>, the definition <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010816130723/http://product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q4/970912.pr.rel.quicktime.html" target="_blank">almost completely changed</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II, and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh. Apple is now recommitted to its original mission-to bring the best personal computing products and support to students, educators, designers, scientists, engineers, businesspersons and consumers in over 140 countries around the world.&#8221;</p>
<h4><strong>July 2004</strong></h4>
<p>It took almost seven years for the definition to <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/07/07Apple-iPod-mini-International-Availability-Set-for-July-24.html" target="_blank">change again</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh. <em>Today, Apple continues to lead the industry in innovation with its award-winning desktop and notebook computers, OS X operating system, and iLife and professional applications. Apple is also spearheading the digital music revolution with its iPod portable music players and iTunes online music store.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h4><strong>March 2007</strong></h4>
<p>Almost three years later, the distinction between desktop and notebook computers was dropped and <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/03/21Apple-TV-Now-Shipping.html" target="_blank">the iPhone was included</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh. Today, Apple continues to lead the industry in innovation with its award-winning computers, OS X operating system and iLife and professional applications. Apple is also spearheading the digital media revolution with its iPod portable music and video players and iTunes online store,<em> and will enter the mobile phone market this year with its revolutionary iPhone.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h4><strong>April 2010</strong></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4015" alt="press-release-2010" src="http://alex4d.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/press-release-2010.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p>A small <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05Apple-Sells-Over-300-000-iPads-First-Day.html" target="_blank">addition for the iPad</a>: <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05Apple-Sells-Over-300-000-iPads-First-Day.html" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Apple ignited the personal computer revolution with the Apple II, then reinvented the personal computer with the Macintosh. Apple continues to lead the industry with its award-winning computers, OS X operating system, and iLife, iWork and professional applications. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store, has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store,<em> and has recently introduced its magical iPad which is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h4><strong>June 2010</strong></h4>
<p>The Apple II is dropped and the amount of text on the Mac <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/06/28iPhone-4-Sales-Top-1-7-Million.html" target="_blank">is reduced</a>: <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05Apple-Sells-Over-300-000-iPads-First-Day.html" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with</em> OS X, iLife, iWork, and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and has recently introduced its magical iPad which is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices.&#8221;</p>
<h4>January 2012</h4>
<h6><a href="http://alex4d.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/who-needs-hype-when-youre-no-1/">My next post</a> compares how many press releases Apple and Microsoft have released since 1995.</h6>
<p>The current definition <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/01/19Apple-Unveils-All-New-iTunes-U-App-for-iPad-iPhone-iPod-touch.html" target="_blank">is a year old</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.&#8221;</p>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;font-weight:normal;line-height:18px;">Writing as a long-term user of Apple&#8217;s professional software, I find it interesting that despite predictions of Apple abandoning pro users, pro software has been part of the way Apple identifies since July 2004. However given that iLife and iWork haven&#8217;t changed very often over the last few years, they&#8217;ll either be updated soon, or dropped from Apple&#8217;s corporate definition.</span></h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">An engaging recent <em>New Yorker</em> article* describes the constructed language Ithkuil, which aims to be “maximally precise” by “eliminating the ambiguity, vagueness, illogic, redundancy, polysemy (multiple meanings) and overall arbitrariness that [are] seemingly ubiquitous in natural human language.”</p>
<p>Our first response was that the creator of this constructed language had likely not seen <a title="the Unbearable Lightness of Meaning" href="http://lexiconblog.com/2013/01/03/the-unbearable-lightness-of-meaning/" target="_blank">our recent blog post</a> about connotation vs. denotation in brand names. The post notes that connotation is often more important than denotation in brand names. An example is <em>gazelle</em>. For the many who have never actually seen one of these animals, the literal meaning may be a bit blurry, yet to them the gazelle is still likely to connote swiftness and grace.</p>
<p>Our second reaction to Ithkuil was to ask why, as its creator noted, overall arbitrariness is so widespread in human language. The answer’s pretty easy if we picture what occurs in ordinary conversation: as communicators, we incline more toward verbal artistry than toward explicit programming. We <strong>launch</strong> plans as if they were rockets, <strong>face</strong> problems as if they were adversaries, and <strong>target</strong> opportunities as if&#8211;well, no need to flog a metaphorical horse.</p>
<p>Consider what language would be like without metaphor. Rather than launching plans, we’d simply make them, or start them. Metaphor is so intrinsic to the way we use words, it’s even difficult to find literal verbs to substitute for <em>face</em> in “face problems” or <em>target</em> in “target opportunities.” It’s much easier to find other metaphors: <em>attack problems</em>, <em>meet problems head on</em>, <em>embrace change</em>, <em>aim for opportunities</em>…</p>
<p>That gives good reason to suppose that even if a precise language&#8211;be it Ithkuil or C++&#8211;should ever be spoken, it wouldn’t take a day for a ninja band of metaphors to start creeping in.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that metaphor should be a staple of brand names. Metaphor helps us to see something new in everyday objects. It enables brands like <strong>Tide</strong>, <strong>BlackBerry</strong>, and <strong>Volt</strong> to stand out from the competition by endowing them with a unique, attractive message.</p>
<p>Metaphors do lose their force over time. Our verb <em>reveal</em> goes back to a Latin verb meaning ‘pull back the veil,’ yet that image no longer pops up when we encounter the word. Metaphor weakening explains how we get unwitting blends of metaphor like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Over all, many experts conclude, advanced climate research in the United States is fragmented among an alphabet soup of agencies, strained by inadequate computing power and starved for the basic measurements of real-world conditions that are needed to improve simulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:360px;"><em>New York Times</em>, June 11, 2001</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">The images in brand names subside over time as well. While the newcomer <strong>Volt</strong> immediately brings to mind an electric charge, the <strong>BlackBerry</strong>, introduced in 1999, now offers models&#8211;the Porsche and the Pearl&#8211;in colors other than black. <strong>Tide</strong>, introduced in 1946, hardly conjures the image of waves in the sea anymore.</p>
<p>But in branding, that’s OK, because a brand name’s heaviest lifting happens up front, when the name is new. A colorful name attracts attention, ties a unique message to a product, and is more likely to spread virally (if you’ll pardon the metaphor) when it’s first introduced.</p>
<p>Therefore, for those – like the inventor of Ithkuil – that wish to make language more efficient, we recommend metaphor, which in a single word can turn a caterpillar into a butterfly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To you,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether to feel relieved, sad, or guilty.  Right now, I feel a little of all three.  But mostly guilty.  I was dreading the day, watching the calendar as it crept up.  But then I got so caught up that it came and went and I hardly noticed.  I didn&#8217;t even realize until just now that I had missed it. And now I battle this gang of emotions and the only thing I knew to do was this: to write it out.  To write it to you.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>The fact that you will never receive this letter does not hinder my writing it.  It doesn&#8217;t make me feel liberated, as I wish more than anything that you could.  I thought of writing to you often and just putting all the notes into a jar and saving them up until it was full and I could bring it to you, but I know I can&#8217;t.  The road to you has been all but demolished, so much so that I am afraid to even try it.  And besides, I know even if I did, it would not be you that I&#8217;d be finding there.</p>
<p>There were two things I never got to do.  One you knew: to keep open communication via instant messaging that you had set up and talked with me about.  I got so busy with school and friends that I forgot to search your email.  I forgot to find you.  One you did not know.  It was a cheap painting that I had been working on of wolves.  It was an advanced paint by number, if you will, and honestly it looked like shit.  I felt compelled to finish it and worked fervently for several days, but then I broke. The paint had dried up, the colors weren&#8217;t matching anymore, and my shaking hands couldn&#8217;t catch the details.</p>
<p>For a while, I couldn&#8217;t watch a <a class="zem_slink" title="Sterling Jewelers" href="http://www.sterlingjewelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Kay Jewelers</a>&#8216; commercial without crying.  For a month I went to class in a fog and otherwise slept.  I couldn&#8217;t talk about it.  I couldn&#8217;t talk about you.  It took years to get through a story about you without my voice breaking.  And now here I sit, grieving the fact that I went through the anniversary without shedding one tear, without even realizing it was that day.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a good thing.  I did finally get to a point in which I could talk about you and not have to excuse myself afterward so I could dab my eyes in private.  Maybe this is another step towards acceptance and a healthy moving on.  But that creates another emotion: fear.  I fear this process.  I don&#8217;t want that to go away.  I want that hurt, just a little, because it reminds me of how important you were.</p>
<p>I know that the pain easing does not mean I don&#8217;t care as much as I used to.  I know it&#8217;s supposed to get easier with more time.  But I also know that I don&#8217;t want to forget those little things that make it so painful in the first place.  I don&#8217;t want to cry, but I do.  Not yesterday.  Not on the anniversary anymore.  Not on your birthday anymore.  Not on holidays anymore. And that&#8217;s when I realize that I will never forget the little things, no matter what, because all those little things were what made you so important.  There are certain songs that will always remind me of you and your guitar on the front porch.  There are certain movies that will always make me think of <a class="zem_slink" title="Christmas Eve" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Christmas Eve</a> and you opening your gifts and knowing exactly what they were before the paper was even off. There are certain symbols and pictures and objects that will remind me of your connections to our heritage and your tattoo.  There are still those times that I can hear your voice as clear as if you were sitting next to me – and even still those times that I expect to hear that voice answer the phone.  And those are the things that will never go away.  And I will cry, always, because no matter how long it is, I will miss you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/7/1352318511537/Henry-Moores-sculpture-Dr-008.jpg" width="460" height="276" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Moore’s <i>Draped Seated Woman</i><i>. </i>From<i> The Guardian. </i></p>
<p>A recent article in the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper has raised questions regarding the democratization of art and institutional responsibilities in the stewardship of public cultural patrimony. In regards to public art, it is often difficult to determine who is responsible for its care and maintenance. In light of the global economic recession, it is clear that the cultural sector is in desperate need of funding. Difficult decisions have been made to maintain budgets such as a London council’s proposal to sell a statue by Henry Moore. What must be determined is how far cultural institutions’ responsibilities extend as stewards of public art, and furthermore, who in the public has the right to lay claim.</p>
<p>In the case of a Henry Moore sculpture, which is located outdoors for public access, many problems have surfaced regarding the future of its care. Arguments have ensued from the council and members of the public over maintaining the statue&#8217;s current location and the artist&#8217;s original intent. This case—while not directly involving a museum—still pertains to museums’ and other cultural institutions’ responsibilities to their public regarding the ownership and care of art, and also demonstrates elitism within the cultural sector. Therefore, I will present the case as follows to serve as a precedent for future dilemmas over selling a piece of long-standing material culture for shortsighted revenue and determine how future cases can be mediated through the multi-vocality of stakeholders.</p>
<p>In summary, this case pertains to an article detailing the potential sale of Henry Moore’s <i>Draped Seated Woman</i><a title="" href="#_ftn1"><b>[1]</b></a><i>,</i> located outdoors within a “socially deprived” area of East London<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. East London Council has proposed the sale of the sculpture after a £100 million cut to their budget. The £20 million estimate for the statue’s worth in consideration with additional savings in maintenance and insurance costs has propelled the council to take such actions. Additionally, the council maintains that the sculpture’s current location makes it susceptible to graffiti and other damage.</p>
<p>However, members of the “cultural elite,”<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> such as film director Danny Boyle and Tate Gallery Director Sir Nicholas Serota have made arguments in a letter to the council for the sculpture’s retention with the support of the artist’s daughter, Mary Moore. Boyle and Serota argue that the £20 million estimate is inflated, as the price would be an all-time high for a Moore sculpture. They appraise the sculpture at £5 million, which would not significantly improve the council’s budget. Furthermore, Serota and Boyle contend that the sale of the sculpture contradicts the artist’s original intent, using Mary Moore’s testimony to corroborate such claims. The article describes Moore as a “life-long socialist”<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> who accepted a much lower price for his work than collectors would have offered under the agreement that the sculpture would remain in an area of low socio-economic status for the residents’ own enrichment. Mary Moore purports that her father believed in the importance of art in everyday life and would want it to remain in a public space. Boyle proposes a solution for the statue to be moved to an outdoor Olympic Park facility in East London, where the sculpture would remain in sight, thus protecting it from potential damage, yet allowing the work to still be accessible to the public.</p>
<p>In order to mediate these arguments, several factors must be considered such as cultural institutions’ roles in proper stewardship. This involves a discourse on ethics: Is it ethical to sell objects of cultural patrimony for revenue? Furthermore, who has the right to make such decisions? The news article’s description of Boyle and Serota as “cultural elite” raises questions of authority as well as cultural paternalism. Lastly, in concern of ethics, how far do cultural institutions’ adherence to artists’ original intent extend?</p>
<p>Tristram Besterman’s article <i>Museum Ethics</i> provides a workable definition of ethics that can be used in this case study. Besterman states, “ethics is an expression of social responsibility” and explains that “ethics defines the relationship of the museum with people, not with things.”<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Therefore, in this definition, the council’s ethical role is to identify the stakeholders of the sculpture and address each party’s opinions and requests. Obviously, the residents of East London are the primary stakeholders, as the sculpture is a part of their daily lives and is located within their tax-paying district. Secondly, the “cultural elite,” represented by Serota and Boyle, are stakeholders as well. Demonstrated by their public claims, they are concerned parties and have proposed counterarguments and solutions. Also, Mary Moore represents the artist as a stakeholder and upholds what she believes to be her father’s original intention for the sculpture. Lastly, the East London Council is also a stakeholder, as it is the present steward of the sculpture and has been charged with the sculpture’s maintenance and care.</p>
<p>Besterman goes on to explain that within museums, “collections are part of the public realm” and that it is the stewards’ role to ensure that the collections remain accessible to the public.<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>  While the Henry Moore sculpture does not exist within a museum, it is part of a collection of public art and monuments. Ian Leith of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, a non-profit organization that raises awareness of the value of public art, believes that the Henry Moore sculpture in question belongs to “the greatest national gallery of all—which is outdoors—and it&#8217;s completely undefined.”<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Consequently, these same questions of ethical stewardship within museums apply to the Henry Moore sculpture and should be treated in a similar way.</p>
<p>Clearly, the main issue in this argument is money, or the lack thereof, which is an issue that museums face today. Detailed in a more recent article pertaining to the Henry Moore sale, are other sales of public art in the United Kingdom such as the Bolton Council’s sale of several works of art by artists such as Picasso and John Everett Millais. Gloucester City Council, Newcastle City Council and Leicestershire County Council have also made similar sales of their public art collections.<a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Besterman explains how many museums in the United States “trade-up” or sell some of their objects as sources for revenue, but that this practice is frowned upon in the UK.<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> Therefore it is interesting to see that the stance on sales for public art differ from sales of museum assets.</p>
<p>I feel the underlying problem here is that public art is not valued in the same way as art within museums is, nor is there a clear steward to advocate for the collection of public art in consideration of the public’s interests. There seems to be a need for a museum-like institution to take charge of public art and manage the collection in an institutional manner. Vera Zolberg’s article <i>An Elite Experience for Everyone </i>explains how museums have to justify their purpose to the public and their need for public funding by providing statistics in attendance.<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> How can a collection of public art justify its purpose? By evaluating the stakeholders’ claims to <i>Draped Seated Woman</i>, perhaps the public’s claim to such works and the status of public art can be negotiated and serve in future cases.</p>
<p>Boyle and Serota seem to be arguing for the residents of East London, whose opinions have not been addressed in the articles surrounding this case. As their voices and opinions have not been heard, it is difficult to determine their stance on the sale of the sculpture. Is it ethical for Boyle and Serota, members of the “cultural elite,” to make assumptions for the voiceless residents of East London? Their arguments for the retention of the sculpture imply more than simple altruism. Their stance and positions of authority allude to issues of elitism in museums, a topic that has received much attention in the last 50 years. Stephen Weil explains how museums have portrayed their institutions as “philanthropic,” “charitable,” and “benevolent.” <a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> These words imply that museums come from higher ground than that of their public and that their role is to extend their knowledge downwards to the masses through actions of “social enterprise”<a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a>. The inferred authority of the museum stems back to the origins of museums and digresses from our topic, yet it is important to keep in mind that museums and by extension museum professionals and other cultural sector leaders maintain a level of authority.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Boyle and Serota’s arguments maintain the notion that members of the elite can determine what is appropriate for the public. This draws on Zolberg’s discourse on “cultural literacy,” or the summary of Pierre Bourdieu’s ideas that differing groups of people hold different levels of cultural capital. This capital is based on their <i>habitus</i> or cultural baggage, based on socio-political and economic status.<a title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In short, peoples’ cultural knowledge or appreciation is determined by their social and economic backgrounds. As members of the elite typically hold more cultural capital, it is assumed to be their right and role to determine what is best for those of smaller cultural capital.</p>
<p>Returning to the case at hand, the <i>Guardian</i> article makes clear the site of the sculpture is in a “socially deprived” area.<a title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Thus, Boyle and Serota argue that the retention of the sculpture’s location is crucial to the residents’ cultural enrichment and appreciation. Mary Moore supplements these claims with her testimony of her father’s agreement on the location as crucial to promoting the democratization of art. But is it the cultural elite or artist’s daughter’s place to make such determinations? The East London Council (ELC) would argue it is not. Speaking more for the residents than Serota and Boyle, the ELC seems to be making difficult decisions for the good of the residents. In identifying their shortage of money, the sale of the sculpture could be perceived as a way to lift the financial burden and perhaps maintain some benefits that would be otherwise cut if the statue stays in place. But the ELC is not just thinking of the money; the council obviously feels that for the residents, the Henry Moore holds no cultural capital, hence the vandalism and thefts of such public monuments. A recent article details the council’s final decision to ignore the advisement of Boyle and Serota and place the sculpture at auction.<a title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> As the fate of this sculpture seems decided, I feel responsible to provide alternative solutions for future propositions.</p>
<p>Returning to my previous thoughts on the perceived lack of value for public art, I feel that some form of a non-profit similar to the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association should take stewardship of the outdoor collection. In doing so, new acquisitions can be thoughtfully assessed with regards to expenses and the sales of public works could be avoided. A more defined budget would also be set in place for the maintenance and protection of the works. Also, a museum-like institution would assumedly adhere to a similar code of ethics, and thus decisions regarding stakeholders can be mediated properly. It is important that the public gets a say in the future of its patrimony, and as museums are shifting their missions more towards public needs, more voices are being heard. Therefore, a non-profit acting as stewards of public art would consider the public’s needs more effectively, and hopefully in the future, public art will be withheld from the budgetary chopping block.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Mutter makes a point that I&#8217;ve been hearing editors make most of my career: <a title="Most newspaper stories are too long" href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.ca/2013/01/most-newspaper-stories-are-still-too.html">Most newspaper stories are too long</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s right. But some newspaper stories are too short. And story length is way down the list of problems facing the newspaper business.</p>
<p>I remember when I was at the Des Moines Register, <a title="James P. Gannon" href="http://spectator.org/people/james-p-gannon/all">Jim Gannon</a>, who I believe was executive editor at the time, decreed that no story could be longer than he was tall. He was 5&#8217;10&#8243;, as I recall, so a story couldn&#8217;t be longer than 70 inches. 70 inches! Register reporters were writing so long that Gannon&#8217;s idea of introducing some discipline was to limit stories to 70 inches (and newspaper columns were wider then than they are today).<span id="more-10799"></span></p>
<p>When I was at the Kansas City Times, Editor <a title="Joe McGuff" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McGuff">Joe McGuff</a> tried to hold stories to no more than 35 inches. But, he assured us (when President Ronald Reagan was in the news for defying Libyan dictator <a title="Muammar Gaddafi" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/q/muammar_el_qaddafi/index.html?8qa">Muammar Gaddafi</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Line of Death&#8221; in the <a title="Gulf of Sidra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Sidra">Gulf of Sidra</a>) the limit was not a line of death; reporters could exceed it if they made the case to McGuff and got permission for a particular story.</p>
<p>At various times, editors have restricted jumps from page one, either forbidding them entirely or limiting them to one or two stories a day.</p>
<p>I support Mutter, Gannon, McGuff and lots of editors past and present in their quest to introduce more discipline in journalists&#8217; writing. I freely acknowledge that many of my blog posts run too long, without the limited space of print and without editors to help me trim an extraneous word here and a redundant paragraph there.</p>
<p>But frankly, the problem and the challenge (whether in my blog or in a newspaper or on a news website) is not how long the story is, but whether it&#8217;s worth the length. I can&#8217;t recall ever getting more reader response than I did from two stories that were 70 inches (about the <a title="Lessons in narrative journalism from the rescue of the twins" href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/lessons-in-narrative-journalism-from-the-rescue-of-the-twins/">rescue of twins who nearly froze</a>) and 200 inches long (about <a title="The Homecoming" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/57824432/The-Homecoming">four people</a> in a <a title="The Homecoming" href="http://stevebuttry.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/homecoming.jpg">famous photograph of a World War II homecoming</a>). Those stories didn&#8217;t work because readers want long stories. They connected with readers because they were two of the best stories of my career and people enjoy reading <em>good </em>stories however long they are.</p>
<p>Good stories don&#8217;t have to be long. I&#8217;m not sure either the twins story or the homecoming story were as good as <a title="Roy Wenzl" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/518382.Roy_Wenzl">Roy Wenzl</a>&#8216;s <a title="Baby's birth broke the speed limit" href="http://www.niemanstoryboard.org/2005/04/21/babys-birth-broke-the-speed-limit/">mystery child story</a> or <a title="Brady Dennis" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/brady-dennis/2011/02/25/ABMgsCJ_page.html">Brady Dennis</a>&#8216; &#8220;<a title="After the sky fell" href="http://www.sptimes.com/2005/01/28/Tampabay/After_the_sky_fell.shtml">After the sky fell</a>&#8221; story, neither of which would top 20 inches in most newspapers. The length of a story isn&#8217;t what matters; it&#8217;s how well the story connects with readers.</p>
<p><a title="Longreads" href="http://longreads.com/">Longreads</a> and <a title="Grantland" href="http://www.grantland.com/">Grantland</a> are carving out their digital niches based on their faith in people&#8217;s interest in long, well-written stories. <a title="The Atlantic" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> doesn&#8217;t shy from presenting long stories that are worth the time to read. I&#8217;m confident that journalists and news organizations will continue writing good, long stories at the same time as newspapers fill their precious dwindling space with too many long stories that don&#8217;t merit the space.</p>
<p>I absolutely support Mutter&#8217;s call to tell stories with tables, charts, infographics and other tools when those are more appropriate storytelling tools than strings of paragraphs. The New York Times <a title="Snowfall" href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall">Snowfall</a> project engaged readers successfully by using words and multimedia tools effectively. So did Gene Weingarten&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning <a title="Pearls Before Breakfast" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">Pearls Before Breakfast</a>, which deftly inserted video clips into the text of a long narrative.</p>
<p>We have lots of data about how well stories connect. We know which stories readers are most likely to share with their friends and which they read for long times and which they skim quickly. We should learn from that data and try to write the types of stories that people are going to want to read and share. That&#8217;s way more important than worrying about how long or short a story is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Emily Esfahani Smith</em></p>
<p><a href="http://acculturated.com/2013/01/03/transcendence-and-the-limits-of-science/oliver-sacks/" rel="attachment wp-att-6668"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6668" alt="Oliver Sacks" src="http://acculturated.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/oliver-sacks.jpg?w=300&#038;h=295" width="300" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>Religion, God, transcendence, spirituality: do these things exist independently of the human mind or are they products of neurochemical firings of the brain? When Saul had his revelatory experience on the road to Damascus, had he fallen under the spell of a seizure, as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1427916/St-Paul-converted-by-epileptic-fit-suggests-BBC.html" target="_blank">some</a> have claimed, or was it a flash of the divine that caused his conversion to Christianity? When Fyodor Dostoevsky experienced the self-transcendent moment he describes below, was he momentarily elevated into a mysterious mystical realm or was he having a fit of temporal lobe epilepsy?</p>
<blockquote><p>The air was filled with a big noise and I tried to move. I felt the heaven was going down upon the earth and that it engulfed me. I have really touched God. He came into me myself, yes God exists, I cried, and I don&#8217;t remember anything else. You all, healthy people . . . can&#8217;t imagine the happiness which we epileptics feel during the second before our fit . . . I don&#8217;t know if this felicity lasts for seconds, hours or months, but believe me, for all the joys that life may bring, I would not exchange this one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over at the <em>Atlantic</em>, two scientists and doctors&#8211;the renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks and radiologist Richard Gunderman&#8211;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/sensing-god-and-the-limits-of-neuroscience/266706/#" target="_blank">are debating</a> these fascinating questions.</p>
<p>In his new book <em>Hallucinations</em>, Oliver Sacks writes, “One must wonder to what extent hallucinatory experiences have given rise to our art, folklore, and even religion.” In his <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/seeing-god-in-the-third-millennium/266134/" target="_blank">recent piece</a> for the <em>Atlantic</em> titled &#8220;Seeing God in the Third Millenium,&#8221; he went on to argue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hallucinations, whether revelatory or banal, are not of supernatural origin; they are part of the normal range of human consciousness and experience. This is not to say that they cannot play a part in the spiritual life, or have great meaning for an individual. Yet while it is understandable that one might attribute value, ground beliefs, or construct narratives from them, hallucinations cannot provide evidence for the existence of any metaphysical beings or places. They provide evidence only of the brain&#8217;s power to create them.<span id="more-6664"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>When I interviewed Sacks <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/27/renowned-author-oliver-sacks-examines-life-through/#ixzz2GpxaqZfU" target="_blank">for a profile</a>, his words were slightly softer: “There is always a brain basis for these various religious states, although this says nothing of the meaning or value of hallucinations. I don’t think it’s at all reductive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/sensing-god-and-the-limits-of-neuroscience/266706/#" target="_blank">his piece</a> for the <em>Atlantic</em>, a response to Sacks, Gunderman suggests a more humble approach, citing the limits of neuroscience in unpacking mystical and religious experiences:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;color:#000000;">Before proceeding, we need to pause to consider what we mean by &#8220;transcendent.&#8221; Literally, &#8220;transcend&#8221; means to climb beyond. The idea of transcendence has deep roots in our culture. For example, the fourth president of the United States and principal author of the U.S. Constitution, James Madison, refers to the establishment of a new government as an act of &#8220;transcendent authority,&#8221; which the people alone have the right to perform. Likewise, one of the greatest American writers, Nathaniel Hawthorne, describes the voice of an improbable singer, &#8220;as if some transcendent musician should draw a soul-thrilling sweetness out a cracked instrument, which makes its physical imperfection heard in the mist of ethereal harmony.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;color:#000000;">In the religious context, transcendence implies a reality that is not purely material. Are there things in this world that are real but not physical, in the sense that they have no mass, size, shape, location, or color, emit no sound, and cannot be touched, tasted, or smelled? A thorough-going materialist might deny that such things even exist, arguing that talk of God or gods is mere poppycock. From a materialistic point of view, references to the divine, as well as those to ethereal qualities such as love, beauty, and goodness, merely refer to patterns of human behavior, or what amounts to the same thing, patterns of electrochemical activity in the brain. In contrast, Jews, Christians, and Muslims assert that God&#8217;s transcendence is self-evident, since God created everything material.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The problem is that science only acknowledges the material world&#8211;the world that can be empirically perceived. But the transcendental reality that Dostoevsky, St. Paul, and many other spiritual mystics have experienced, is, by definition, outside the realms of time, space, and the other aspects of our physical world that science lays claim to. So apart from explaining transcendental experiences in terms of neurochemistry, what can science say about them? How do we bridge the divide between what science knows and what mystics claim without outright dismissing the validity of the latter&#8217;s religious experiences?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Gunderman hints at an answer: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps we should not be too quick to abandon the transcendent. What if the transcendent is no different from any other aspect of human experience, in at least one crucial respect? Namely, that there are both false and true experiences of the transcendent, just as there are false and true experiences associated with the senses, with reason, and with feeling. Sometimes what we think to be the crying of a baby turns out to be the whine of a machine, what seems to be a proven conclusion turns out to be based on an erroneous assumption, and what we suppose to be love turns out to be merely a fleeting infatuation. If we are smart, we recognize that we are fallible. Yet our fallibility does not lead us to conclude that we can never truly experience, know, or feel anything.</p>
<p>Let us grant, at least provisionally, something that cannot be proved. Let us suppose for the moment that all human experiences, whether illusory or real, whether immanent or transcendent, are accompanied by neurochemical changes in the brain. Let us further suppose that no experience is possible without such neurochemical changes, and that individuals whose brains have ceased to function can experience nothing. Let us also grant that tinkering with neurochemistry alters experience, sometimes merely by changing its timbres and hues, but in other cases by causing us to experience things that clearly never happened. Would granting all of these points prove that all experiences of the transcendent are unreal?</p></blockquote>
<p>Gunderman goes on to talk about an experience that many of us have had: being moved by music: &#8220;A neurologist might come along and explain that I am merely experiencing the transduction of kinetic energy into electrical energy as processed by neurons in the auditory and higher associative cortices of the brain. And yet, there is something about the music that is hard to reckon in such terms. It would be like saying that a passionate embrace is merely the pressing of flesh on flesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the book <em>Why God Won&#8217;t Go Away</em>, neurologists Andrew Newberg and Eugene D&#8217;Aquili discuss these issues at length. They bring Gunderman&#8217;s example full circle, arguing that there may be reason to believe that some sort of transcendental reality actually exists. They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the narrowest scientific view, it would be possible to believe that we had reduced all spiritual transcendence&#8211;from the mildest case of religious uplift, to the profound states of union described by mystics&#8211;to a neurochemical commotion in the brain.</p>
<p>But our understanding of the brain would not allow us to rest with that conclusion. We knew, after all, that everything the mind experiences is tracked in the brain. A SPECT scan of an opera lover listening to Puccini, for example, would reduce &#8220;Nessun Dorma&#8221; to multicolored blotches, but that would not diminish the beauty of the aria. The music, and the enjoyment it provided, would still be very real. The memory of the music, too, and the emotional pull of the tragedy of <em>Turandot</em>, are real. Even if you were to &#8220;play&#8221; the music and drama again only in your mind, many of the same parts of the brain would be reactivated. Perhaps even your body would get the same goose bumps evoked by Puccini&#8217;s heartbreaking lyrical melody, its crescendos and pianissimos. You would clearly be hearing the music, but only inside your head. Yet the existence of the music and its nonverbal power are still, neurologically, quite real.</p>
<p>All perceptions exist in the mind. The earth beneath your feet, the chair you&#8217;re sitting in, the book you hold in your hands may all seem unquestionably solid and real, but they are known to you only as secondhand neurological perceptions, as blips and flashes racing along the neural pathways inside your skull. If you were to dismiss spiritual experience as &#8220;mere&#8221; neurological activities, you would also have to distrust all of your own brain&#8217;s perceptions of the material world. On the other hand, if we do trust our perceptions of the physical world, we have no rational reason to declare that spiritual experience is a fiction that is &#8220;only&#8221; in the mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>They go on to write: &#8220;At this point in our research, science had brought us as far as it could, and we were left with two mutually exclusive possibilities: either spiritual experience is nothing more than a neurological construct created by and contained within the brain, or the state of absolute union that the mystics describe does in fact exist and the mind has developed the capacity to perceive it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Gunderman, Newberg and D&#8217;Aquili acknowledge the limits of science. What exists beyond those limits we can never know. This brings to mind Pi Patel, the hero of the beautiful novel <em>Life of Pi</em>. Like the neurologists here, Pi straddles the worlds of science and religion. He is a mystic and a lover of all religions&#8211;and he is also a student of the natural world, zoology specifically. Speaking of an atheist science teacher he had as a boy who inspired him to study zoology at university, Pi says, &#8220;I felt a kinship with him. It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them&#8211;and then they leap.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://comingupshorthanded.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/liam-with-new-hand.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-490" alt="Liam with new hand" src="http://comingupshorthanded.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/liam-with-new-hand.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Liam is now the owner of a functional, comfortable device that increases what his right hand can accomplish. The evening before his birthday, Liam and his parents (Rory and Yolandi) stopped by Richard&#8217;s workshop to pick up the completed hand.</p>
<p>Not only did this device cost $0 for Liam&#8217;s family, but the design itself is now public-domain. There is no patent, the details of this design can be used freely by anyone. The specific CAD files used to print the components are available for free-download <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44150">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a long day, but Liam was kind enough to demonstrate using his new hand on video:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4i4RpKYoeEw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><br />
And here he is just 3 days later, practicing and playing with his new hand:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kB53-D_N8Uc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Liam took his new hand with him to his doctor&#8217;s appointment today and also to school! His mother Yolandi says,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Finish with Hand Clinic yay Dr&#8217;s are VERY impressed with Liam&#8217;s Robohand. No operations to be done as yet which is awesome. Amazing stuff to happen very soon. Liam has had so far an fantastic day not shy at all to show all his Robohand. His little school he goes to was a huge hit all the teacher&#8217;s &amp; kiddies were in awe <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  its been a super duper day. Thank you all for the birthday wishes to Liam much appreciated xxx&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Richard and Ivan are deeply grateful for the support of their families (Beth Rademeyer Van As &amp; Jen Owen, you ladies are both indescribably awesome!), thankful for Rory &amp; Yolandi for taking a chance on two crazy guys with an idea and for all the people who have helped with this project.</p>
<p>A special thank you as well to <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot </a>for providing the machines that made it possible to produce light-weight, inexpensive components for Liam&#8217;s hand!</p>
<p>With what we have learned by working with Liam, we see this as just the <strong>beginning</strong>. From here we want to carry this forward, to find other &#8220;Liams&#8221; out there who could benefit from the designs and techniques we are exploring.</p>
<p>If you believe, as we do, that as many people should freely benefit from this as possible &amp; you would like to help make it happen, please visit our <a href="http://fundly.com/just-a-guy-with-an-idea-restoring-fingers">fundraising page</a>. Thank you!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At age 25 with plenty of planned years of awesome boobage ahead of me, I never really considered not having reconstruction after my mastectomy. Although the reconstruction procedure added 4 hours to my surgery and meant considerably more pain and discomfort, there was and is something important to me about maintaining these bastions of my femininity &#8211; and I think it goes deeper than just wanting to look good in a tank top, although that&#8217;s certainly a consideration.</p>
<p>I found this beautiful quote in the book Reconstructing Aphrodite, a series of essays from women who decided to rebuild their bodies after the devastation of a mastectomy. It really spoke to me, and I hope it will speak to you too.</p>
<blockquote><p>From the moment I was diagnosed with breast cancer and faced a possible mastectomy, I knew I wanted reconstruction. This response was out of my own sense of art, symmetry, and aesthetic. It was the same response I would have to a tooth extraction or the loss of any body part. It speaks of how I approach an environment that to me is visually out-of-balance.</p>
<p>How could I be concerned about something so superficial while facing cancer? Perhaps because I did not believe that I had the worst disease in the world. Princess Diana said, &#8220;The worst disease in the world is the lack of love.&#8221; Mother Teresa said, &#8220;The worst disease in the world is to be nothing to nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in the abundant love of God amid friends and family who express God&#8217;s loving kindness. We are surrounded by survivors of all life&#8217;s troubles and grief, surrounded by hope, peace, and joy. I saw the choice for reconstruction as only one of the endless ways to create beauty in my world. It was my surgeon&#8217;s sense of art and beauty and her respect for the female form that gave me the confidence to pursue this path.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I had my second expander fill. I popped another Ativan beforehand, so that I could remain calm in the face of the MegaNeedle. Alas, I do not possess quite the same level of mental zen as the author of the above quote, although I have been doing a variety of yoga poses to ease my tense back. Child pose is THE BEST.</p>
<p>I was too calm about the fill, perhaps, because the MegaNeedle got the best of me this time. I felt everything as my right breast was punctured. I shouted out in alarm more than pain, because I was so surprised to have any sensation. The plastic surgeon apologized, but said it was good news, because it could herald the return of feeling in my breasts. Sweet! Maybe I won&#8217;t have to go the rest of my life unsure whether or not I&#8217;m having a nip-slip.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite weird to be numb across such a wide swath of my body. For example, I noticed that the DermaBond skin glue the surgeons used to close up my wounds &#8211; which, as I previously mentioned, looked like the Joker&#8217;s face &#8211; had started to crack, peel and fall off. I&#8217;m sure that if I had sensation, that would be unbearably itchy, but I can&#8217;t feel a thing. Side note: Can you believe that after surgery they still patch you up using things that can be found at OfficeMax? Staples, thread, glue? What year is this?</p>
<p>Anyway, the plastic surgeon noticed it, and accelerated the process by peeling off the remainder of the DermaBond with sterile tweezers. Again, I&#8217;m willing to bet this would be uncomfortable if I could feel it. When she was done, I was absolutely stunned. The dark, bumpy, scarlike appearance of my wound was approximately 95% due to the DermaBond itself. The actual scar is probably less than an 1/8 of an inch thick and is currently sort of a medium-pink, likely to fade to skin color within a couple of years. Although scar tissue is basically the least of my worries, considering that my life is literally on the line here, I can&#8217;t lie: I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ll be able to bare sideboob with abandon by 2015.</p>
<p>Every time I leave USC, I pass a promise on the wall:</p>
<p><a href="http://killerboobies.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/diseaseofthepast-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1006" alt="USC's Promise" src="http://killerboobies.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/diseaseofthepast-copy.jpg?w=580&#038;h=580" width="580" height="580" /></a></p>
<p>I never fail to marvel at the hundreds of thousands of scientists who work every day to heal people like me. After my diagnosis, I read the book <em>The Emperor of All Maladies,</em> a biological history of cancer written by an oncologist. It was like picking at a scab &#8211; painful at times, but equally addicting &#8211; and it gave me an enormous appreciation for all that we&#8217;ve been able to achieve in the long history of cancer. Gordie read it too, and is considering getting a tattoo of a crab in my honor. You guys, I SWOON.</p>
