			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have seen RPGs before. They&#8217;re funny because they look like toys. A gun is a gun, but an RPG is a stick with a rugby ball on the end and it looks comic unless it&#8217;s pointed at you. What I had never seen, however, was the sheer array of weaponry that South Sudan insisted on lining its roads with in the run-up to independence. Not that you can blame them, though. As the bus enters Juba it passes a long stretch of road on which the rectangular shadows of huts are visible, but these shadows are marked in soot and smashed brick. </p>
<div id="attachment_1885" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7952-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7952-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Dawn In Juba" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1885" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dawn in Juba. At the bottom left you can see faint traces of homes which were razed.</p></div>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be travelling with a good friend, Ryan, whose experience of the cultures and conflicts of Northern Uganda and South Sudan make him a fascinating travel companion. We had decided to travel up, but were forced to wait until painfully late because he was presenting a paper at a conference. We took the early bus out of Kampala on Thursday, reaching Gulu in the late afternoon and waiting beside the road until three AM, when the convoy of buses to Juba arrives. We were joined in our waiting by Junior, a South Sudanese who has spent most of his life in Uganda but was returning home in great excitement for the celebrations, having secured three days leave from his school to attend.</p>
<div id="attachment_1871" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7546-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7546-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" title="Face painting" width="640" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-1871" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Three flags and no shirt is the get-up of choice for this young South Sudanese.</p></div>
<p>When we finally boarded the bus, I was lucky enough to get a seat near the back while Ryan was forced to sit in the front, directly behind the driver. At the best of times this is a terrifying experience- the roads are heaped murram which rises to a central point, but in order to avoid potholes the drivers often swerve to the side of the road, leaning the bus at crazy angles. However the trip had added undertones this time, because very recently two buses crashed on this same route (their mangled remains are still beside the road), killing 29 people. I slept fitfully but Ryan was forced to stay awake by the sight in front of him.</p>
<div id="attachment_1887" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7962-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7962-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="View From The Window" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1887" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A view from the bus window passing over the hills near the Ugandan border.</p></div>
<p>The road is poorest on the Ugandan side, but improves on the Sudanese side partly because the UN built a highway to facilitate their convoys in their passage through to Juba. The road winds through lush hills covered in thick grass and low trees, and more and more huts are springing up as refugees return home. The huts are extremely neat and trim, but everywhere there is the same sight as in northern Uganda, the shattered brick walls of the buildings from before.</p>
<div id="attachment_1886" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7956-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7956-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" title="Sudanese Hills" width="640" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-1886" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">South Sudanese hills.</p></div>
<p>South Sudan has suffered more than its fair share of war, and then some. Along the roads you can still see the skull-and-crossbones signs which mark minefields, and on the eve of independence they were taking no chances. Tacticals (pickup trucks with a .50 cal machine gun welded on the back) were parked all over the place in central Juba, and men with assorted weapons stood, sat or lay at regular intervals along all major roads. Some picked their teeth, others looked thoughtfully at their little heaps of RPG rugby balls, but all were ready to keep the peace.</p>
<div id="attachment_1868" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7491-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7491-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" title="Vote For Secession" width="640" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-1868" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A poster encouraging South Sudanese to vote for secession, on the door of a shed in Juba. The vote passed, 98.8% in favour.</p></div>
<p>We reached the border at 5.20am, and stood in the early dawn chill, waiting for the immigration offices to open. The sun began to rise, and with it a gentle mist from which the pointy tops of small hills emerges. Money changers frantically tried to get us to buy Sudanese Pounds, but in the end (and after a heck of a dance) we were visa&#8217;d up and the bus moved on to Juba. As we got close we were stuck in first  one roadblock (bags emptied, armpits felt), then another, and another. At the second roadblock a great sounding of horns cleared the road, and President Museveni&#8217;s convoy shot past us. I&#8217;ve seen that convoy a good many times, but this was the first time I had seen it stripped of its customary heavy weaponry. But finally we entered town, arriving at Jebel bus park to an atmosphere of welcoming and absolute happiness.</p>
<div id="attachment_1888" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7476-2-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7476-2-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Pickup With Flag" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1888" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A pickup truck flying the flag in Jebel Bus Park, Juba.</p></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s what was so strange about the whole experience of the secession. It was so totally, utterly good-natured and peaceful. I was aware that Juba was at peace before I visited, and I was also aware that the SPLA (Sudanese People&#8217;s Liberation Army) quite like to wear light weapons as bling. But for the two days I was there we were met with nothing but cheery greetings from civilians and army alike, with the exception of one bus driver (but bus drivers are bus drivers). I know the SPLA are no angels, and there are many dark secrets hidden beneath, but for those two days they were on their best behaviour.</p>
<div id="attachment_1872" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7580-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7580-edit.jpg?w=433&#038;h=650" alt="" title="Women in Caps" width="433" height="650" class="size-full wp-image-1872" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Female attendees dressed in their finest party frocks and sun-proof hats as they approach the party.</p></div>
<p>We were met by Roza, a friend from Gulu who now works for the UN in Juba. She helped us find a room for the night, and then we went with her to visit her friends, who were having a celebratory dinner to which we were welcomed despite being uninvited. It was a delicious goat stew with posho and soft, spongy bread. The stew was incredible, but the bread was such a treat. In Uganda most bread is either &#8216;Tip-Top&#8217; brand, or a similar style. It is, in short, not bread. </p>
<div id="attachment_1878" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7715-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7715-edit.jpg?w=433&#038;h=650" alt="" title="Pregnant Mother" width="433" height="650" class="size-full wp-image-1878" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A heavily-pregnant woman clutches a flag at the celebration. Many people fainted from the heat of the sun, and I ended up giving away all of my water, but the party went on regardless.</p></div>
<p>Along all of the roads were huge posters of the South Sudanese flag, of Salva Kiir, and of John Garang. My first introduction to the story of John Garang was last year, when I crossed the (then) Sudanese border to have lunch under the careful watch of a very stern SPLA intelligence officer who made sure I went, ate and returned and didn&#8217;t take any pictures. This was at Kaya (the West Nile border point) and there was a giant poster of Dr John Garang, emblazoned with the words &#8220;Dr John Garang- Forever a Burning Spear in Our Hearts&#8221;. </p>
<div id="attachment_1874" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7603-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7603-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Dr John Garang&#039;s Statue" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1874" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The flag-draped statue of Dr John Garang awaits its unveiling.</p></div>
<p>The actual independence ceremony took place at the Dr John Garang Mausoleum, the final resting place of the father of the nation. He died in a helicopter crash in 2005, the cause of which was never satisfactorily proved, and throughout the morning&#8217;s festivities a flag-draped statue of him dominated the crowd close to the dais. </p>
<div id="attachment_1869" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7538-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7538-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Arriving Early" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1869" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crowds begin to arrive at the Dr John Garang Mausoleum, 7am. In the background is the flag-lined avenue down which the world&#039;s dignitaries drove to arrive.</p></div>
<p>The mausoleum is sited within a large walled field, and by 8am there was a giant crowd of people from throughout Sudan, most forming small circles to celebrate around drums. We arrived just after 7am, and were soon festooned in South Sudan flags, greeting everybody with &#8220;South Sudan Oyeeee!&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1880" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7802-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7802-edit.jpg?w=433&#038;h=650" alt="" title="Suit And Hat" width="433" height="650" class="size-full wp-image-1880" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A man wearing the South Sudanese flag as a hat poses for a portrait.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1870" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7540-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7540-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Dead Or Alive" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1870" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The flag-draped statue of Dr John Garang is seen beside a poster calling for the capture of President Bashir of Sudan, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;. Bashir is wanted on ICC warrants in connection to war crimes committed throughout the country, but attended the ceremony regardless.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1879" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7783-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7783-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Party Dog" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1879" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Even the dogs got dressed up for the occasion. Or perhaps I should say; somebody even dressed up a dog, which looked to be suffering in the sweltering heat.</p></div>
<p>There are over 200 ethnic groups in South Sudan, and there must have been representatives of most at the mausoleum. We walked around, talking to people and marvelling at the worrying amount of bullets, both spent and live, which still litter the ground. At one point we found a live .50 round, a very large bullet indeed. I fetched a security officer, who without ceremony but with a wry grin picked it up and headed for the gate. The atmosphere was one of a music festival, but more men in leopard skin (print and real) than you would usually see. Sadly I know very little of the different tribes there, and while I could spot different Northern Uganda traditional dresses and dances no problem I can&#8217;t claim the same of South Sudan, so you&#8217;ll have to put up with the slightly insulting catch-all of &#8220;South Sudanese tribesmen&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_1875" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7647-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7647-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="Inside the Grounds" width="640" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-1875" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A group of tribesmen wearing fake leopard-skin run across the Mausoleum grounds, waving South Sudanese and American flags.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7589-edit-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7589-edit-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" title="South Sudanese tribesmen dancing." width="640" height="426" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1873" /></a></p>
<p>When Garang&#8217;s statue had been unveiled Ryan and I took a walk to witness the parade, and were invited up onto an SPLA car to get a better view. Then we returned to the mausoleum just in time to witness the raising of the flag. As the flag began to rise, thousands began to cheer and wave their own flags. Finally as it reached the top a rare gust of wind blew through, spreading it out. The crowd went beyond everything they had managed all day, and the emotion was clear throughout. So many people suffered and died for that moment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1881" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7842-edit-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7842-edit-edit.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" title="Raising The Flag" width="640" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-1881" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The South Sudanese flag is raised over the Dr John Garang Mausoleum for the first time.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1876" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7661-edit-edit.jpg"><img src="http://themzungudiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wbp7661-edit-edit.jpg?w=433&#038;h=650" alt="" title="Jumpers" width="433" height="650" class="size-full wp-image-1876" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Young men jumping in celebration.</p></div>
<p>As the festivities began to move out into the streets, Ryan and I went in search of buses to Uganda. It was too expensive to stay (a cheap room is around $100, and literally everything had been booked by the government) and there are no ATMs, so we decided to move. We reached the bus park, however, and found it empty. No buses until the morning, and nowhere to stay. We decided we needed food, so went to an Ethiopian restaurant. There we met William, a Ugandan photographer, who without hesitation offered us a room for the night. He was a saviour, for sure. We walked half way across the city, through scenes of great celebration, to his house.</p>

<p>Then early in the morning we headed out to the Kampala stage, getting a bus easily and heading swiftly through to Uganda. I am lucky beyond belief to be able to do what I do, but this was a privilege throughout. South Sudan was charming and welcoming (though a little pricey) and people like Roza and William made it something unforgettable. I wish the world&#8217;s youngest nation nothing but good things, and I hope it will soon become fully peaceful. The transition from rebellion to statehood is a hard one and there is still a long way to go, but I hope it will get there.</p>

Other national road going colors include Italy&#8217;s rosso corsa and Germany&#8217;s raw silver arrows.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_291" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 332px"><img class="size-full wp-image-291  " title="© The World Via Standby" src="http://worldviastandby.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/253485_10150202206481114_615011113_7518746_2826464_n.jpg?w=322&#038;h=432" alt="" width="322" height="432" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A standby passenger&#039;s dream: lots of open seats and overhead bins to choose from!</p></div>
<p>I made my way to the back of the airplane, my dark brown eyes intently searching the crowded overhead bins for an available space to put my TravelPro bag. I had already passed my assigned seat six rows ago, but I remained focused on my goal of finding room for my carry on. After all, the plane couldn&#8217;t take off until everyone was seated with their items safely stowed away. As I reached the last row I discovered, to my dismay that there was no room in the overhead bins. Miserable and embarrassed, I turned around and started heading toward the front of the aircraft. I pushed my feelings of anxiety and mortification aside and walked hastily up the aisle fully aware of the numerous eyes staring at me.</p>
<p>I had an inkling of what was running through the passengers&#8217; minds and I knew that I was causing a delay. As a standby passenger you are usually the last to board the plane thus having a limited amount of time to store your belongings compared to the passengers who boarded before you.</p>
<p>A young woman wearing a tank top in <em>Pepto Bismol</em> pink and jean shorts rolled her eyes at me as I passed by. Already perturbed, I shot her a look back and continued on my way. Once I reached the front I asked the flight attendant standing in the galley for assistance. She was courteous and called the gate agent who showed up with the ticket. Not long after, a ramp agent appeared on the jetway and took my bag down to the cargo bin. Feeling as if a huge burden had been lifted from my shoulders I finally took my seat.</p>
<p>This incident happened to me a few months ago while I was traveling to Minneapolis, Minnesota. For those of you curious, the bag that I was rolling around was not over-sized. It was small, but still too large to stow underneath the seat in front of me. I&#8217;ve always brought this bag on all my travels and have never run into any complications until this trip.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges that both standby and paying passengers face today is not having any room on the plane to store their carry on bags. The baggage fees are quite expensive and depending on your destination it could cost more. Here&#8217;s a link to Delta&#8217;s website explaining their <a title="checked baggage guidelines." href="http://www.delta.com/traveling_checkin/baggage/checked/index.jsp#us_na" target="_blank">checked baggage guidelines</a> and the cost of their fees. At $25 USD to check in the first bag and $35 USD for the second it&#8217;s no surprise that more travelers are bringing their bags into the airplane. Because of this quandary flights are becoming delayed, sometimes causing passengers with tight connections to miss their flights.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to avoid running into the same situation for both standby and revenue passengers:</p>
<p><strong>1. If you are flying standby and are lucky enough to go directly to your destination check in your bags. </strong>While this may be free for you keep in mind that it may not make it on the same flight you&#8217;re taking. The first time I checked in my bags they ended up arriving on a different flight the next day. Make sure you have important items such as keys and medication with you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pack lightly or bring a bag that is small enough to fit underneath the seat in front of you. </strong>If your trip is going to be short only bring the things you will need. I also suggest &#8216;rolling&#8217; your clothes instead of folding. Not only will this method reduce wrinkling, but it will add room too. I bring my red Osprey backpack everywhere I go and rarely run into complications. The only times I run into a problem is when I get assigned the bulkhead seat. Still, I manage to find room for it since it&#8217;s a decent size.</p>
<p><strong>3. If you do end up with the misfortune of not having a place to store your carry on simply tell your flight attendants. </strong>Remain calm and remember that this is a common problem. It&#8217;s so common nowadays that when a flight checks in full gate agents anticipate this occurrence and are usually there to help. They will give you a piece of paper that has your bag information and tell you that you must pick up your gate checked luggage in baggage claim. This service is free to both paying and standby passengers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although this year&#8217;s trip to Yosemite didn&#8217;t include any rafting (the water was <em>frigid!!</em>), it did include plenty of hiking (legs are still sore) without dominating Half Dome. To even attempt Half Dome you now have to get a permit online months in advance, which we didn&#8217;t know. You can get one the day before you want to go, but it&#8217;s hard. My boyfriend&#8217;s sister was able to get one and she did get to the top. This was her 7th time completing it. Go Melanie!</p>

<p>My cadet, his twin, and I did do an amazing climb. It wasn&#8217;t long in terms of distance, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t easy. It only took about 45 minutes to an hour to complete. It was also a hidden trail. It&#8217;s called Sierra Point. It used to be a well-traveled trail years ago, but due to multiple rock slides, they closed it. Old climbers kept it going though by using symbols with rocks to signify the trail where it wasn&#8217;t very visible. It&#8217;s pretty difficult because it&#8217;s hard to find the trail and it&#8217;s really steep and kind of sketchy in some areas; however, the view is totally and completely worth it. Once you&#8217;re at the top, which has railings because it&#8217;s a sheer cliff, you see five falls within the valley: Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls, Illilouette Falls, Vernal and finally Nevada Falls. It&#8217;s gorgeous. And it&#8217;s the only part in the valley where you can see it. The only fall you can&#8217;t see it Bridal Veil.</p>

<p>We also did the Mist Trail, which leads to Vernal and eventually Nevada if you want to go that far. It&#8217;s called Mist Trail very appropriately because as you go up you&#8217;re hit with a wall of mist coming off the falls and by the time you reach the top, you&#8217;re pretty much soaked, which feels awesome if you do it at the right time of day! Luckily all of the falls were super full due to the amount of snow the mountains had this last winter. There is still snow in the high country. Thanks to all of this snow the Merced River is really, <em>really</em> cold and too high to raft in. Oh well.</p>

<p>My boyfriend and his brother-in-law also did another hike to the upper Yosemite fall, which is a pretty strenuous hike. Good job, babe! The nice thing about this whole trip is that my cadet&#8217;s whole family made it for the weekend, which included his parents, three sisters, brother-in-law, and our nephew. They haven&#8217;t had this kind of family trip in years. It was wonderful.</p>

<p>I took less pictures this trip, but it&#8217;s okay because I know I was having fun while not taking pictures =) Hopefully I can get a few from sweetie&#8217;s sister and his mom&#8217;s camera, as well as his own GoPro.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post again in a few days. A dear cousin of mine whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a few years surprised me when I came home earlier and is staying for a week or so. Shenanigans always occur when she&#8217;s here&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://yearofkindness.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/flowers.jpg"><img src="http://yearofkindness.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/flowers.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" title="flowers" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-371" /></a></p>
<p>Dear Kindness Recruits, </p>
<p>In preparation for Wednesday&#8217;s <a href="http://yearofkindness.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/kindness-army-now-recruiting/" target="_blank">100 Days of Kindness mission</a>, I must tell you something. Sometimes being kind is a bit like being green &#8211; it&#8217;s not always easy and people often give you very strange looks. But this only proves even more just how much the Kindness Revolution is a cause worth fighting for. We live in a crazy, mixed-up world and it&#8217;s up to kindness crusaders like us to remind people that it&#8217;s not all gloom and doom &#8211; that the world is also beautiful and meaningful and kindful. (Yes, sometimes I make up words, just go with it.)</p>
<p>As for me, my shock and awe campaign has already begun. I have upheld my end of the bargain and continued to really challenge myself with this week&#8217;s kindnesses. However, I am also discovering that the best, most rewarding kindnesses are not created but found. My advice to you would be to let your instincts guide you to find opportunities for kindness, because they truly are everywhere when you start looking. </p>
<p>On my 94th day of Kindness my mission presented itself at a shopping centre. I noticed a lady sitting on a bench. Not just any lady: possibly the loneliest lady I&#8217;ve ever seen. It wasn&#8217;t just her strange assortment of clothes or half-dyed hair or the fact that she was sitting by herself staring at nothing in particular or the way everyone gave her a wide berth as if she were about to spontaneously combust. It was something in her eyes, something totally defeated and lost and broken. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to say, or even if she would respond to me when I did speak, but something told me I had to try. </p>
<p>I sat down next to her on the bench and noticed her outlandish shoes. Before I could chicken out I quickly heard myself saying, &#8220;Those are very interesting shoes.&#8221; There was a long pause, she slowly turned to look at me, obviously taken by surprise, and said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I thought perhaps that was the end of that. I couldn&#8217;t think how to go on from there. But then she began to talk. First about how she could only afford that one pair of shoes, then about every other aspect of her life, all of which were equally heartbreaking. I could feel people staring at us, knowing we must have seemed a very odd pairing (me still in my smart clothes from work, and her in the only clothes she owned). That made me annoyed to start with &#8211; she&#8217;s a human being like everyone else &#8211; but then I felt glad they were looking, as it meant I was making a strong point. I gave her advice when she asked for it, but mostly I just listened and tried to make her feel heard and understood. After about an hour the lady seemed to have grown tired of talking and we just sat for a little while. Eventually she turned to me and said, &#8220;Thankyou for listening to me. No one has paid any interest in me for such a long time. And just talking to you has made me think that there&#8217;s a chance things might turn out all right in the end.&#8221; Listening and acknowledging sure is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>On day 95 I faced one of my biggest kindness challenges: giving out flowers. I was viewing it as a major challenge purely from my <a href="http://yearofkindness.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/today-you-are-you/" target="_blank">previous experience</a> &#8211; just thinking about that made my stomach turn itself in knots. And so I decided that rather than wait until Wednesday, I would dive right in and do it straight away. But this time I really thought things through to make sure it had every chance of being enjoyable. I recruited my awesome friend A to come along for moral support (and also because if people can see you have a friend who doesn&#8217;t think you&#8217;re crazy, then they&#8217;re less likely to think you&#8217;re crazy also.) Instead of handing out one bunch of flowers to one person, I handed out a whole lot of individual flowers to different people, thus taking some of the pressure off. I also generally approached people who were standing still or sitting down (at bus stops or in the park), not those who were walking by in a rush. And finally I tweaked the exact wording of my explanation to ensure that I got the words &#8220;free flower&#8221; and &#8220;kindness project&#8221; out in the first twenty seconds before the other person even spoke, because if I didn&#8217;t every single person&#8217;s instinctive reaction was to say no. </p>
<div id="attachment_374" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://yearofkindness.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/suzflowers.jpg"><img src="http://yearofkindness.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/suzflowers.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="" title="suzflowers" width="223" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-374" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A happy flower recipient! </p></div>
<p>In the end, out of about twenty people, only three refused the flowers. Strange to think anyone would refuse to accept a little kindness in their life, but I did not take this personally, only thought it was their loss and moved on. It certainly helped to have A by my side reminding me what a positive thing I was doing, regardless of how people reacted. Of those that said yes, some of their responses were quite incredible &#8211; as A said, it &#8220;warms the cockles&#8221; and &#8220;brings a tear to the eye&#8221;. One lady informed us it was her birthday that day, another said she had been given the exact same flowers from her family during a really happy time and couldn&#8217;t describe how meaningful it was to her to recieve one again, and another lady said she was a big believer in random acts of kindness, that it took real bravery to do it for a whole year and that she was sure it would get much easier as I went along. </p>
<p>And it already is. On days 96 and 97 I bought a coffee for people at two new cafes in the middle of peak coffee hour in the centre of the city (so even the barista looked at me like I was Kermit the Frog). And it was only a single little baby butterfly that fluttered around in my stomach &#8211; rather than a whole butterfly family &#8211; as I explained to the baristas and the businessmen what I was doing and why. What did I care if they thought I was nuts, I don&#8217;t even work in the city so I am never going to see them again. And who knows, maybe later it will sink in somehow and they will see for themselves that random kindness is meaningful and important. And on day 98 I bought a sandwich for a homeless man who was not particularly grateful (making it clear he would prefer money instead), and I did not take that personally either. Just like when I was talking to the lonely lady, people stared at us in confusion as we spoke, and once again I was glad for it. If the man didn&#8217;t appreciate the kindness, at least people walking by might realise that &#8220;normal&#8221; people like &#8220;us&#8221; don&#8217;t have to walk by homeless people as if they don&#8217;t exist. Finally, somehow, I am starting to detach myself from the outcome of the kindnesses, and simply enjoy the journey, wherever it may lead me. Mission accomplished. </p>
