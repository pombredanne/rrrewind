				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eastern Europeans have a natural (or, as we will argue, historically necessitated) proclivity to be negative and I fit that stereotype pretty well. I am not a glass-half-full person. “Tell me what you are doing, and I will tell you what is wrong with it” is a pretty accurate description of my attitude. So, you can’t blame me, if I get fixated on someone whose glass is so empty that it makes mine look like it’s overflowing.</p>
<p>Meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov">Evgeny Morozov</a> – a fellow Eastern European and “a writer and researcher, who studies political and social implications of technology.” It is an amazing field to dedicate your career to. On one hand, technology changes so quickly that, by the time you have discovered a phenomenon to study (music sharing via Napster, anyone?), it is gone. At the same time, our understanding of individual and group psychology and behavior is growing exponentially. One would imagine that the combination of these two factors would provide a researcher with plentiful opportunities to observe, investigate, develop and test hypotheses, build and tear down assumptions.</p>
<p>And then you have Morozov. He does not exactly <i>study</i> and <i>research </i>technology, he speculates about its impact. All of us in the tech world do a lot of that, but his bias is so strong that to describe him as a researcher is as accurate as to say that the <a href="http://www.afa.net/">American Family Association</a> is about family. Judge for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>In his latest <i>New York Times</i> piece, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/opinion/sunday/the-perils-of-perfection.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=all">The Perils of Perfection</a>, he argues that we should not use technology to fix our imperfections unless we are confident that the technology solutions Silicon Valley comes up with have pure intent. On the surface, that makes sense. And then you think about, where medicine would be right now, if we took the same approach with pharmaceutical research. Should we ignore progress, if it is driven by the desire for business success?</li>
<li>Earlier in 2012, he lamented about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/the-death-of-the-cyberflaneur.html?pagewanted=all">Death of Cyberflaneurism</a>, that ancient art of browsing the Internet for useless information. I guess, sites like <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a>, which does an amazing job of finding interesting information; <a href="http://getprismatic.com">Prismatic</a> that curates news content for you, or even <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> (let alone <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>), where friends share a lot of useless stuff, make the art too easy.</li>
<li>And then there is his recurring column, Future Tense, on <a href="http://www.slate.com/authors.evgeny_morozov.html">Slate.com</a>. If someone reads his posts a hundred years from now, they would conclude that the Internet is killing us.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://analogandantisocial.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fanatic.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignright" id="i-285" alt="Image" src="http://analogandantisocial.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fanatic.jpg?w=351&#038;h=196" width="351" height="196" /></a>To be fair, Morozov does have a nose for the silliness and over-the-top enthusiasm of technologists. His ridicule of pointless services that Tweet after you die, products that “erase” the homeless from your view, or forums (TED) that make a communist parade seem propaganda-free, are absolutely on target. Yet, when I read his pieces, I can’t help but think of agent Nelson Van Alden, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire/index.html">Boardwalk Empire</a>’s puritanical government official, whose obsession seems a tad unhealthy. Does Morozov denounce technology because he likes it too much?</p>
<p>In one of his pieces, Morozov quotes Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, who argued that being inconsistent is the only way to avoid becoming a doctrinaire ideologue. Morozov writes with admiration:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For Kolakowski, absolute consistency is identical to fanaticism.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Smart man, that Kolakowski.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://roadtested.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1159" alt="photo (3)" src="http://roadtested.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=289" width="640" height="289" /></a>Recently I found a fedora in my closet. It was sitting where it has sat for almost two decades, wearing a fine coat of dust, pushed back out of sight on a high shelf. It’s a brown fedora with a wide cloth band that is also brown, though darker by several shades. The brim turns down in front, and in the back it turns up, in classic fedora style. Inside, the sweat-stained label identifies the hat as a Stetson.</p>
<p>I was seventeen when I met the man who owned the fedora, the same man who would become my father-in-law a few years later, and he scared the hell out of me. He was about six feet tall, and I don’t mean to insult him posthumously, but I suspect the needle on his bathroom scale stopped closer to three hundred pounds than two hundred. I had heard a few stories about how tough he was, and people said he had a mean streak. That may have been true when he was a younger man, but when I met him he was nearing sixty years old, and he must have mellowed, because he was always cordial to me. We didn’t have much in common, other than his daughter, and our conversations were usually short and stuck to general topics like the weather or his vegetable garden.</p>
<p>The only time I ever heard my father-in-law talk at length was on holidays when his family gathered at his house. He would sit with his two sons in the living room and talk for hours about a single subject that never varied over the years &#8211; the Missouri Pacific Railroad. All three of them were life-long MoPac men, so they talked about railroad people they knew who were sick, or hurt, or who had died or done something stupid, like run an engine off the track. They talked about the union and the latest injury settlements and supervisors who were idiots and men who got fired and then re-hired, because no one ever seemed to get fired permanently from the railroad. I would listen to their stories sometimes, but with nothing of my own to contribute, I would usually gravitate to another room and look for a football game on TV.</p>
<p>My father-in-law lived and breathed the Missouri Pacific, but Old Milwaukee beer was his sustenance. He had an old stuffed chair that he hauled out to his garage after it was deemed unsuitable for the den, and he stationed it within arms reach of a refrigerator that was perpetually stocked with beer. It didn’t matter if the weather outside was scorching hot or freezing cold, he would sit in that chair with the garage door open and drink his Old Milwaukee from the fourteen ounce cans, because it cost less than the other brands in a twelve ounce can. My father-in-law liked bang for his buck. I never asked him why he preferred the ratty old chair in the garage to a much  nicer one in the house, but I have a theory about it. I can still picture him sitting there, Old Milwaukee beer in hand, wearing the fedora.</p>
<p>Standing in my closet a quarter of a century later, studying the dusty hat, a notion crossed my mind that I should start wearing it. I have always appreciated the look of the fedora, and given that my scalp now needs protection from the sun, I saw it as a fashionable solution to a bothersome problem. So I put it on my head, and to my amazement, it didn’t fit. It was too small. I wasn’t sure what to make of it. How could the head of such an imposing man be smaller than my own?</p>
<p>But apparently it was the case. So I put the fedora back on the shelf, to gather more layers of dust. It’s probably just as well. Even if the hat had fit, I could never think of it as mine. It belongs to a man from another place and time, and that’s how it should stay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google&#8217;s announcement that it&#8217;s <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">killing off Google Reader</a>, the company&#8217;s beloved, if not wildly popular, tool for consuming RSS feeds, was met with outrage from journalists and other, largely American nerds who rely on it to efficiently churn through blogs and other websites. But the real tragedy is likely to be felt in countries like Iran, where Google Reader is used to evade government censorship.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>OMG! <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23google" title="#google">#google</a> is shutting the reader?! That is one of the few solutions for us to access the blogs, news, &#8230; in <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Iran" title="#Iran">#Iran</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23filternet" title="#filternet">#filternet</a> <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> &mdash; <br />&nbsp; (@jadi) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/jadi/status/312173123346784256' data-datetime='2013-03-14T12:07:27+00:00'>March 14, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>RSS readers take raw feeds of data—headline, text, timestamp, etc.—and display that information in a stripped-down interface along with many other feeds, which is what makes them so efficient. (<a href="http://qz.com/feed">Here is the RSS feed for Quartz</a>.) Less obvious is how many RSS readers, including Google&#8217;s, serve as anti-censorship tools for people living under oppressive regimes. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s actually Google&#8217;s servers, located in the US or another country with uncensored internet, that accesses each feed. So a web user in Iran just needs access to <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">google.com/reader</a> in order to read websites that would otherwise be blocked.</p>
<p>And, indeed, Google Reader has long been accessible in Iran, where it is the <a href="http://www.appappeal.com/maps/google-reader">most popular RSS reader</a>. Iran would probably have to block all of Google and its many popular services in order to keep its citizens from using Reader. YouTube, by contrast, is easier to censor, though it is also owned by Google, because the video site is located on its own domain, <a href="http://youtube.com">youtube.com</a>. Reader is also harder, though not impossible, to block because it uses more secure technology known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_62920" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><img class="size-full wp-image-62920" alt="This is Reeder, an application for consuming RSS feeds, which currently uses Google Reader to fetch new data. It has vowed to figure out an alternative method." src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-14-at-10-47-29-am.png?w=1024&#038;h=574" width="1024" height="574" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is Reeder, an application for consuming RSS feeds, which currently uses Google Reader to fetch new data. It has vowed to figure out an alternative method.</p></div>
<p>There are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5990540/8-google-reader-alternatives-that-will-ease-your-rss-pain">many alternatives to Google Reader</a>, but switching is a more complicated prospect for Iranians. Many <a href="http://dev.newsblur.com">RSS readers</a> do work like Google&#8217;s—with the service&#8217;s own servers, rather than the user&#8217;s, fetching new data from across the web—but those would be much easier to block, if they gained any traction, without the protection afforded by the popularity of Google&#8217;s other services.</p>
<p>The Iranian government <em>has</em> occasionally blocked all of Google, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/23/iran-block-access-google-gmail">most recently in September 2012</a>, but always <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/01/iran-lifts-block-gmail-vows-absolutely-censor-youtube/">for a limited time</a>. It&#8217;s not clear if Iran&#8217;s move toward a <a title="Iran is sealing off the web as it rolls out a domestic intranet" href="http://qz.com/61274/iran-is-sealing-off-the-web-as-it-rolls-out-a-domestic-intranet/">domestic version of the internet</a> will affect access to <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>. Google also hasn&#8217;t said what it might do with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/feed/">Google Feed API</a>, which is a service for programmers to access RSS feeds, usually for display on other websites. If it sticks around, the Google Feed API would potentially allow someone to build a service that replicates some of Google Reader&#8217;s core features and still rely on Google&#8217;s domain to do it.</p>
<p>Iranian bloggers were vocal opponents of the changes Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/upcoming-changes-to-reader-new-look-new.html">made to Reader in 2011</a>, when the ability to share individual stories with other users was removed. The shared items of certain heavily followed Iranians <a href="http://www.amirhm.com/2011/10/why-google-reader-gooder-matters-for-us.html">served as de facto newspapers</a> free from the government&#8217;s censorship regime, gaining popularity after the 2009 elections led to uprisings in Iran. The next presidential election is this June.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such bad luck!&#8221; <a href="https://plus.google.com/107365676925051486913/posts/VqEeDSCbLKg">wrote Vahid HT, an Iranian, on Google+ today</a>. &#8220;What does the internet without Google Reader look like?&#8230;What harm will come to the online world?&#8221; Another person wrote in response, &#8220;Really what Google is thinking is that all revolutionary ideas do not fit with their absurd ideas.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#333333;">A shot of a protest rally on the streets of my neighborhood in S. Korea. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span id="more-689"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><a href="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/fancy-line.png"><span style="color:#333333;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37" alt="fancy-line" src="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/fancy-line.png?w=196&#038;h=36" width="196" height="36" /></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Pulitzer Prize winning Photojournalist <a href="http://www.barrystaver.com/" target="_blank">Barry Staver</a> once famously said, “The best camera is the one you have with you.” There is an obvious truth to that, and these days almost everyone is equipped with a camera. Famous photo sharing websites like Flickr grew in popularity and eventually culminated in Instagram, the easiest (and hippest!) photo sharing app out there that has been worming its way into seemingly everywhere. Of course now that it’s owned by internet giant Facebook it has significant weight behind it, but still I think the fact that this WordPress’s weekly Photo challenge has been replaced with a <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/my-neighborhood/" target="_blank">Phone-ography challenge</a> is very telling of its influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">For me personally I felt that “the line” that legitimized Instagram as a means of photography was crossed when Time magazine used an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/11/01/why-time-magazine-used-instagram-to-cover-hurricane-sandy/">Instagram photo of hurricane Sandy </a>on its cover. I can’t say I like the direction it&#8217;s going. I often debate film photography vs. digital (with analog advocate <a href="http://pjbrezphotography.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Patrick</a>), but now I feel the debate will soon shift to “real” photography vs Phoneography. The problem with that is, how one defines “real” is arbitrary. It’s the same idea that digital editing is “cheating” but then  you can make the argument that toy cameras, like the Lomo, probably at one point suffered the same stigma of being labeled as “not real photography.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Although it is, and will be, up for discussion for years to come. I personally feel that it will just be that, a discussion, and that the outcome of said discussion has already been determined for us. Phoneography is already a reality and will eventually and assuredly reach the same level as our most sophisticated DSLRs. So it is with reluctant acceptance of a foregone conclusion that I submit my entry into this week “Phoneography” challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><a href="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/fancy-line.png"><span style="color:#333333;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-111" alt="fancy-line" src="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/fancy-line.png?w=196&#038;h=36" width="196" height="36" /></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong><a href="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cheonan-protest.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-691 alignright" alt="cheonan protest" src="http://endlessframe.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cheonan-protest.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a>About the photo:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">I live in Cheonan S. Korea, and coming home from work the other day the street (MY street) was blocked off by this protest briefly, until it was diverted by the police. My Korean ability ranges from weak to very weak so the chances of me interpreting a public speaker ranting through a bull horn from on top of a moving van were slim. Intuition tells me that it has something to do with N. Korea, as it was on the same day that the tyrants to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21751226" target="_blank">North announced their intentions to not honor the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.</a> There is really a mixed feeling about N. Korea in the country, with the oldest generation of people, who actually experienced the war first hand, believing that you can never trust the back stabbing Communists, and then their sons and daughters who were taught in school that it is their duty to send aid and to love and help with the humanitarian crisis across the border to the North, and finally the youngest generation who are too busy staring at their phones to care. Whatever the message the protest was quickly kettled, within 15 minutes, and everyone I’ve asked to shed light on the issue has not heard of it. Still, I was lucky enough to have my phone on me to capture the moment, so props to Staver for being right again. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you are child, you dream, you ponder, you create. Without a care in the world, you splash a drab of paint here with a few sequins scattered there, entirely absorbed in the art of your creation. You follow your intuition, your irrationality, your movement; not an ounce of second thought can hinder your masterpiece. You pin your work up in the hallway, full of pride, knowing that <i>every</i>body can see it there.</p>
<p>When September comes around, you are taken into a world filled with other young people, equally curious but each entirely different. There are lots of other fresh minds, full of innovation, buzzing and wild. You start the term sharing ideas, sharing words and creation. You sing in groups, seeing who can fill their lungs with the most air, who can reach the highest pitch. In the role play area, you metamorphose into an entirely new character, rather like the hungry caterpillar you just read about. When in it’s time to go to the dining room, you skip along in your slightly scuffed shoes, hand-in-hand with your bestest friend. Not a worry in the world will sway you from what you are up to.</p>
<p>Then you enter <i>big </i>school. You are scooped into a class with new faces, new names and a new type of uniform. This time, you have to wear a bright red tie to match the fiery colour of the school logo, a dragon. Sitting at your desk, you drift into a daydream, the dragon dancing around your head, breathing its fumes down your spine. Your teacher drops down in front of you, asking you to ‘have another go’ at your art. Apparently the sky cannot possibly be green, or the donkey orange.</p>
<p>The terms begin to gain speed: Christmas, then Easter, then the joyous summer holidays. You take home work to complete, more and more as the months collect. Numbers, words, nature… All these spheres of thoughts collected and categorised into long complicated names. Mathematics, English literature, Biology. Now you are slightly older, you are told to sit for hours at a time in silence, independently working on each subject. No peaking at anybody else, no eye contact: you are being tested for <i>your </i>ability.</p>
<p>You’ve always had a passion for colour, shapes and words. You’ve always traced the clouds with your imagination as they float past the classroom window. But now you must concentrate on the paragraphs lay before you. You must learn these facts, absorb them, apply them. You must spend several hours analysing their meaning, depicting each sentence until its original meaning has shifted somewhat. And when you write about your findings, you cannot offer your own opinion as itself; it must conform to the <i>learning objectives</i>. If you do not display the expected response, you cannot be thinking in the right way.</p>
<p>You mature into a young adult, imitating the several others around you in lesson. Following the rules of learning that will train you into the right way of doing things, the right pattern of thinking. This is the way forward in life. At some points, you are still able to recall your inner child, projecting it if possible. You now paint with a variety of brushes. You now have more opportunity than ever to create your masterpiece, free and unlimited. A swish of this broad brush, a touch of that intricate brush and a few dabs of an <i>artist’s </i>sponge. You have every colour, every shade; your palette is wider than ever.</p>
<p>But you are too self-critical. You know that line is crooked, those colours do not complement each other, those patterns look absurd together. You spend hour upon hour perfecting each subtle graduation in the stormy sky, each stroke of rain falling at the correct angle onto the horses below. One day you will create your masterpiece.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://topicsofcapricorn.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-7-25-21-pm.png"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-629" alt="Image" src="http://topicsofcapricorn.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-7-25-21-pm.png?w=356&#038;h=526" width="356" height="526" /></a><strong>A long time ago, I really liked music</strong>.</p>
<p>Actually that&#8217;s still true today. I like music more than I like almost everything. Yesterday I told Julie (who is someone I probably like more than music) that if I had to choose between Andy Warhol&#8217;s work and the song &#8220;Roadrunner&#8221; by the Modern Lovers, I would kiss those screen prints and Brillo Boxes goodbye in a second. That&#8217;s a pretty tricky thought experiment though, because the way most people tell the history of the Modern Lovers involves Andy Warhol somehow. This is an oversimplification, since the Velvets were around before Warhol and did their best work without him around, although who&#8217;s to say where the influence starts or stops?</p>
<p>Anyway, I have nothing against Andy Warhol; I just chose him off-handedly because he&#8217;s obviously important. But Roadrunner, man. Great song.</p>
<p><strong>So South By Southwest is going on</strong>.</p>
<p>And when I was a teenager in Omaha, the old-timers were already mourning what SXSW had become. In the days before the early 2000s, I guess it was a place for unsigned bands to be discovered by labels. By the time I heard about sxsw, it was mostly the labels putting on showcases and it was so expensive to go and stay in Austin that week, that unsigned bands just wouldn&#8217;t go.</p>
<p>Still, Nigel and I dreamed of going to sxsw, but the cost and distance to Austin always exceeded our grasp.</p>
<p><strong>I write for a tech website</strong> so I got a smart phone and joined Twitter and started following people who do the same sort of stuff. Many of them are writing from SXSW. Many of them are from Brooklyn. All I&#8217;ve heard about from sxsw is about people going to viral marketing conferences and where people have been spotted wearing Google Glass and TED talk this and bullshit that.</p>
<p>Brooklyn, and New York more broadly, is a place I fell in love with via music. It is also a very strong brand.</p>
<p><em></em><strong>Did you know </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;the idea that art and commerce are at odds is a remnant of an old culture war: dogma presented as forward-thinking but really just protecting<a title="When the NYT tells you something is outmoded..." href="dogma presented as forward-thinking but really just protecting an outmoded status quo" target="_blank"> an outmoded status quo</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course you already knew that. How long has it been since you took the phrase &#8220;sell-out&#8221; seriously? If you aren&#8217;t commodifying everything you do, putting ads in front of your youtube videos and monitoring your page views, you&#8217;re just an idiot and someone else is making that money. No band is going to turn down an opportunity for their song to be used in a commercial.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 410px"><img alt="" src="http://www.art247.com/images/large/BRIDGEMAN/XIR157492.jpg" width="400" height="265" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pope Julius dictates art because he pays Michelangelo.</p></div>
<p><strong>And you know</strong> art has always been at the behest of commerce. Why did everyone paint stuff for the church? Because the church paid them. Lucky painters did paintings of rich families. Even the Impressionists needed their patrons and they still were all poor and covered in lice.</p>
<p>And those examples are just painters! The more expensive and new arts&#8211;like film&#8211;don&#8217;t even have an illusion of being made with hands free of commerce. Some of the most seminal and revered films&#8211;<em>Battleship Potemkin</em>, <em>Triumph of the Will</em>&#8211;are openly propaganda. Every Hollywood movie opens with a corporate logo.</p>
<p><strong>I haven&#8217;t sought out music coverage from SXSW</strong>, because I just don&#8217;t listen to that much contemporary indie rock, or much contemporary music of any stripe. SXSW doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with indie rock anyway.</p>
<p>I guess I see most indie rock as the form of the pop song played on guitars instead of via computer, and sung by a person with a pretty normal sounding voice rather than a computer-aided super voice.</p>
<p>And indie rock has a lot of pretense of &#8220;art,&#8221; but if it&#8217;s all commerce, does indie v. major label matter much? And how is using the same formula for a pop song&#8211;same line-up of two guitars, bass and drums, that has been used since Buddy Holly&#8211;innovative or impressive?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been listening to American Primative guitarists and jazz music and Penguin Café Orchestra and space-age big band, and operettas and none of them are at SXSW, so for all I know it hasn&#8217;t changed, but I have.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is technology</strong> of course. Last night, talking to Julie, I talked about how the acoustic guitar&#8211;even mine&#8211;is made in a factory (in Nazareth, PA), and the frets are a technological development, as is the bridge and the interface is the strings. It&#8217;s on a spectrum with Google Glass. Maybe it isn&#8217;t a spectrum. Maybe they just share a category. I mean, anything could share a category, depending how you categorize.</p>
<p>So it isn&#8217;t with any pretense of authenticity or superiority that I ignore most EDM or whatever. I just look at a computer screen all damn day, and I don&#8217;t want to make music while looking at my computer screen, and frankly, seeing a musician making music on their computer live is a comically depressing, post-modern display. But there&#8217;s no denying that it&#8217;s very <em>now</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I sold off</strong> the Stratocaster a few days ago. The slow winter months tend to result in my selling something of value. Last year it was my amp, which was too big and loud anyway. This year it was the Strat. I liked the way that guitar played, maybe even more than the Telecaster that I kept and will probably have to sell next year, but the Tele has more sentimental value. It&#8217;s just a product that I used, when you get down to it.</p>
<p><strong>Even the SXSW</strong> that old timers pined for&#8211;unsigned bands trying to become signed bands&#8211;is commerce based. Everything is. <img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/images/warhol_ft.jpg" width="275" height="209" /></p>
<p>The fact that everyone clamors to get into conferences given by someone who made millions of dollars running a web-based company probably isn&#8217;t categorically different from clamoring to see someone who made millions of dollars playing two-chord songs to teenagers.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that sort of Andy Warhol&#8217;s point with the Brillo Boxes? Look for art in consumer design, because those are the same thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the bastards won. There was no one else fighting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the counter-culture is being co-opted by the business guys, because there isn&#8217;t a counter-culture. There is only aesthetics. It&#8217;s not like an indie rock festival is categorically different from a tech conference.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s all how you categorize</strong> things, right? You can&#8217;t really afford to be so naïve.</p>
<p><strong>Still</strong>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel so bad with the radio on. It helps me from being lonely late at night.</p>
