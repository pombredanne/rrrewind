			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just me, but I find myself missing those I&#8217;ve lost in the silliest moments. For example, last night when I pulled my gingerbread out of the oven at like 1am (why I was baking this late at night I can&#8217;t really explain, other than to say I&#8217;ve gotten a little weird lately), I felt a pang of pride followed quickly by a tinge of sadness. It was the first time I had used this recipe that the loaves didn&#8217;t cave in the middle&#8230;and as with any baking triumph, my first inclination was to call my best friend and baking inspiration, Ginnie.</p>
<div id="attachment_1478" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1478" title="High School Silliness" src="http://withoutamicrowave.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/christmas-002.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginne and Me, laughing at God knows what.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now dear readers, for those of you who are still checking this little old blog in the hopes that I might one day write again, I&#8217;m hoping that by writing this post and finally talking about the dark cloud that has been hanging over me, I&#8217;ll be reinvigorated in my blogging efforts. You see, I&#8217;ve been avoiding this post like the plague, because honestly, I haven&#8217;t been quite sure how one writes about the death of a best friend. I&#8217;ve also been positive that I couldn&#8217;t NOT write about it, because the events of the past few months have rocked my world so much that they&#8217;re impossible to ignore. Impossible not to share.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll remember, but on my blog I&#8217;ve often referred to Ginnie: the friend <a href="http://http://withoutamicrowave.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/fool-proof-recipe/">who sparked my interest in culinary exploits</a>, the one <a href="http://withoutamicrowave.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/greatest-meals-ever/" target="_blank">with whom I shared my greatest meal</a>, and the girl <a href="http://withoutamicrowave.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/david-lebovitzs-german-chocolate-cake/" target="_blank">who inspired me to make the most-complicated-ever chocolate cake for my birthday</a> without bothering to tell me that I should adapt it to make it simpler. The <a href="http://withoutamicrowave.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/yep-im-still-here/" target="_blank">one I flew across the country to see</a> a few months ago when she was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive type of cancer. The one who left this world on New Year&#8217;s eve 2010, bringing the most challenging year of my life thus far to a close.</p>
<div id="attachment_1479" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1479" title="Mom's Birthday" src="http://withoutamicrowave.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00008.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My mom&#039;s birthday. For birthdays we always got a birthday-baked-good of choice from Ginnie. This year was German Chocolate.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am so much luckier than most; not many people have the chance to say an adequate goodbye to the people they love the most in this world. I got five full days with my best friend a few weeks before she died, and those five days were the greatest gift I&#8217;ve ever received.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of my favorite parts was that, after having no appetite for three months, Ginnie was ready to chow down in the last few weeks of her life (a side effect of the meds). My mom and I brought her breakfast at the hospital, and the girl who has been into healthy and organic food since we were 11 years old requested an egg mcmuffin AND a sausage biscuit. And lattes. Vanilla lattes. Caramel lattes. It was like we were back in high school when she would ring our doorbell at an ungodly hour and only gain admittance because of the coffee cups in hand, crawling into bed with me and my mom to giggle and gossip over steaming mochas.</p>
<div id="attachment_1480" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1480" title="Graduation Ceremony" src="http://withoutamicrowave.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_3431.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" alt="" width="480" height="320" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginnie and me on the night she received her honorary doctorate degree from WSU.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was lucky, because in those last few days together, I got to say everything I needed to say, including goodbye. We laughed and we cried in equal measure, which I think is pretty impressive given the circumstances. But now? Now comes the hard part. Because everything I do feels like a reminder of her, especially when it comes to food. My gingerbread didn&#8217;t cave in the middle this time, but the texture was off, and the person I want to ask about it is Ginnie. She was always like a mad scientist tinkering with things that go in the oven, and I know that she&#8217;d have the answer or at least multiple suggestions for what to try. And sure, I&#8217;m perfectly capable of figuring it out on my own, but it&#8217;s just another reminder that she isn&#8217;t here to help me. And to be honest, I was kind of counting on being able to rely on Ginnie&#8217;s help, you know, for the rest of my life. For everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is very little to regret about the way things happened, but I do regret that I didn&#8217;t get to be at her memorial service. I would have liked the chance to share with everyone what she meant to me. Granted, if you know me, you know that it would have been impossible because I would have been sobbing too furiously to stand up, let alone talk. And of course, there is no way to put into words what she meant to me. But what I would have said is this: She was and is so much a part of me that now, I can&#8217;t tell which parts of me are me and which parts are her.</p>
<div id="attachment_1481" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1481" title="Tattoo party" src="http://withoutamicrowave.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc03247.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We had a fake tattoo party. Ginnie&#039;s tattoo said &quot;homeward.&quot; Mine was a dragon.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And so, having finally said that, I&#8217;m back. A little sadder. And feeling a little older. And crying much more often. But still here. And I&#8217;m going to try again with the gingerbread. Because I will get it right. And when I do I will probably cry, because that&#8217;s what you do when your best friend dies. But I&#8217;ll also smile, because I am so incredibly lucky to have had such an amazing woman in my life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In today&#8217;s edition, we provide a guide to our coverage of the situation in Egypt, featuring breaking news, analysis and commentary.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://natpo.st/fV9zdO" target="_blank">Protests in Egypt</a></strong><br />
We will be keeping you up to speed throughout the day on the protests in Egypt. A curfew has just been announced, starting Friday evening in main cities including: Cairo, Alexandria and Suez. Follow our coverage and check back for updates.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/01/28/peter-goodspeed-obama-faces-a-jimmy-carter-moment-in-egypt/" target="_blank">Peter Goodspeed: Obama faces a Jimmy Carter moment in Egypt</a></strong><br />
Our foreign affairs reporter Peter Goodspeed weighs in on U.S. President Barack Obama&#8217;s role as the crisis in the Arab world escalates.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/photo_gallery/photos-tens-of-thousands-protest-in-egypt/" target="_blank">Photos: Thousands protest in Egypt</a></strong><br />
In the largest demonstration to date, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the street continuing their call for the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. Our photo editors have collected the best images.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/photo_gallery/graphic-unrest-in-the-arab-world/" target="_blank">Graphic: Unrest in the Arab world</a></strong><br />
Egypt was not the first domino to fall in the Arab world: we have put together a graphic detailing the unrest in other nations that have taken to the streets to protest.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/Analysis+Egypt+shows+easily+Internet+silenced/4184021/story.html" target="_blank">Analysis: Egypt shows how easily Internet can be silenced</a></strong><br />
With few telecom providers in Egypt, it was quite easy for authorities to shut down the Internet overnight. Over 20 million users were left without access and showing how vulnerable the web can be.</p>

Out of all the protesting countries, Yemen&#8217;s situation is a little different. The country is in poor economic shape, and neighbouring Saudi Arabia won&#8217;t be happy about the uprising.</p>

Well, the guy had his coat on the floor in front of him.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-778" style="border:1px solid black;margin:5px;" title="snake on floor" src="http://plumbananas.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/snake-on-floor.jpg?w=300&#038;h=191" alt="" width="300" height="191" /></p>
<p>Ewwww!</p>
<p>As soon as I enter a public restroom (even the &#8220;clean&#8221; ones) I start walking like the floor is covered with poisonous snakes. I&#8217;m up on my tippy toes and I feel myself becoming lighter to lessen the force applied to whatever is on those floors. I weigh 85 pounds in public restrooms, really. I scan the floor right to left, left to right for wet spots, brown spots, weird spots&#8211;just&#8230;spots! And if there IS a snake in there, I&#8217;ll see that too.</p>
<p>What kind of messed up human being puts their coat on the floor 12 inches from a public toilet? Do YOU do this? If I&#8217;m offending you, if you&#8217;re face is growing red with indignation and you&#8217;re thinking: <em>what an ass! This guy doesn&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s common to throw your coat down on public restroom floors</em>, then please stop reading because I don&#8217;t want you to feel bad. I&#8217;m going to continue in my belief that it&#8217;s <em>not</em> a common practice.</p>
<p>I washed my hands for a full 40 seconds, twice the necessary time, because I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off that blue coat. My hands were squeaky clean yet I moved them in a circle under the spigot to trigger the sensor. <em>More water, please! I&#8217;m still washing here!</em></p>
<p>I pictured a dirty, dirty man, unshaven, wearing wrinkled pants. Then I looked down at myself, then into the mirror and realized I had just described myself. So I redrew my picture into an even dirtier man, but one with a tiny, tiny head and short, stubby arms. All of a sudden, my anger dissipated because if the guy looked like <em>that</em> I could understand the whole ordeal.</p>
<p>I pumped the towel machine, ripped 18 inches of paper , dried off and looked over there again at those Reeboks. Any empathy had disappeared. I thought: <em>this guy doesn&#8217;t have a tiny head; this guy is a sociopath! I&#8217;ve been in there, I know there&#8217;s a hook on the back of the door; why didn&#8217;t this cretin use the gosh darn hook? </em></p>
<p><em></em>I have used the hook. Let&#8217;s call it the &#8220;keep your coat from touching poo&#8221; hook. If&#8211;Jesus help me&#8211;my coat ever fell from that hook my body would spasm with disgust. I know what goes on in there and I know that this world is full of dirty men with normal sized heads who care not about leaving messes for their cleaner brothers.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I&#8217;m outta here!</em> Obviously, this guy wasn&#8217;t going to end his &#8220;coat on the floor session&#8221; until the room was empty. I used the towel to open the door.  I paused at the water fountain right outside thinking I could hydrate for several minutes and wait to see this guy, but drinking fountains that close to the restrooms freak me out a little, so I just went back to my table and sat down.</p>
<p>Then, whatever groove I had been in before I saw that coat was totally destroyed; I couldn&#8217;t concentrate. I sat there a mess, scanning the place for men of all head sizes wearing blue, poo-stained coats and dirty white Reeboks. No luck. I decided that he must have just wandered in off the streets&#8211;an escaped lunatic!&#8211;and ended up in a bookstore. He probably didn&#8217;t know that these rectangular things with scribbles of ink were called &#8220;books.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate my mind sometimes.</p>

<p><a href="http://tubblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/image13.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:left;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:5px;" title="Tweets from Birmingham South Police" border="0" alt="Tweets from Birmingham South Police" align="left" src="http://tubblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/image_thumb12.png?w=234&#038;h=244" width="234" height="244" /></a>Posting Tweets throughout the day to highlight what the force was doing that day in my local area – which includes my hometown of <a href="http://www.weoleycastle.org.uk">Weoley Castle</a>, as well as Quinton, Harborne, Edgbaston, Bournville, Cotteridge, Stirchley, Kings Heath, Kings Norton, Northfield, Longbridge and West Heath &#8211; there were reports throughout the day of crackdowns on crime including drug busts, road traffic accidents, suspicious activity reported by members of the general public and local businesses and even a lost puppy – all of which were followed up later on with news of how the incident was resolved (the puppy was found, safe and sound!).</p>
<p>I found the Tweets a fascinating insight into what my local Police force do on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/birminghamsouthpolice"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:5px;" title="Birmingham South Police Facebook Page" border="0" alt="Birmingham South Police Facebook Page" align="right" src="http://tubblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/image14.png?w=244&#038;h=121" width="244" height="121" /></a>I wasn’t the only person who thought this – as the Birmingham South Police <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tubblog">Twitter</a> account shot up to over a 1000 followers throughout the day, and for those not familiar with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tubblog">Twitter</a>, there was also a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/birminghamsouthpolice">Birmingham South Police Facebook Page</a> which also provided a mechanism to see what was happening and to provide feedback.</p>
<p>Now I know I’m not the only person who has at times bemoaned the fact that it “feels” there is never a Police officer around when you want one. I’ve heard this same complaint from neighbours and friends.</p>
<p>I’m also not the only person who doesn’t seem to find comfort in the fact that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8472007.stm">Home Office announced that Crime figures had fallen 8% in the last Quarter</a>. The statistic doesn’t make me “feel” safer.</p>
<p>Why is that? I think it’s because most people don’t relate to statistics, and instead go with how they actually <strong>“feel”</strong> based on what they observe.</p>
<p>I spoke to lots of friends and neighbours who had followed Birmingham South Police’s 24 hour Tweetathon yesterday, and without fail every one of them said something similar to “I had no idea of how much the Police do every day!”. From these conversations, I felt a sense of re-assurance and faith in the local Police Force that I hadn’t noticed before. These friends liked knowing what was happening locally – whether it directly affected them or not.</p>
<p>The bottom line is – it’s all about communication, both giving people the opportunity to engage with you if they choose to do so, acknowledging them, and keeping people “in the loop”.</p>
<p>When I ran an MSP, I became very aware of the fact that we’d take clients on – it was typically when they ‘d been let down by other IT providers, their Infrastructure was in a shambles due to lack of maintenance, and IT was causing lost time and money on a day-to-day basis for their business. After we’d stabilised the situation with pro-active monitoring and maintenance, within months the client would often get to the point where they rarely needed to call upon our services to resolve problems – simply because the problems had ceased to exist. It’s at this stage that they started to question why they were paying for our services at all – after all, everything is now ok, right?</p>
<p>So the realisation dawned that it wasn’t enough to fix problems and proactive prevent others. The business had to be made aware of what we were doing for them, and how it helped them. We sent out Daily Reports, Weekly Summaries, and decision makers received Monthly Executive Summaries. On quiet days, we sent engineers to site to resolve problems that could be dealt with remotely – so we weren’t just a voice the end of a telephone. We regularly met with clients for Business Reviews – not just when there was a problem. Changes such as upgrades and patches were notified to the client in advance, along with reasons and timescales. Requests for support were followed up with regular e-mails and phone calls, both during and after.</p>
<p>At times, the only complaint we got was that we “over-communicated”, and that’s a complaint a lot easier to deal with than having to to justify your continued existence to a client during a budget cut.</p>
<p>It doesn’t just apply to Service Delivery either. Ask yourself:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your clients know about all the products and services you provide?</li>
<li>Do your partners and allies know about your latest successes?</li>
<li>Do your prospective clients really know that you can help them with their pain points?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the regular <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tubblog">Twitter</a> updates are to continue from <a href="http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/np/birminghamsouth/">Birmingham South Police</a> or not, I’m not sure, but based on the Tweetathon I think those involved at the Police force should consider the experiment a huge success – they’ve re-assured people, and there are around 1,000 local residents (effectively, their “clients”) who now feel connected and acknowledged by their local Police Force.</p>
<p>It’s an experiment that many of us in all walks of business and life could learn from.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In January 2011, California start-up company <a href="http://www.kno.com/books">Kno, Inc.</a> announced upcoming beta testing of <a href="http://thetechjournal.com/tech-news/kno-ebook-reader-targets-textbook-market.xhtml"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">single and two-screen e-book readers</span></a> specifically designed for use with electronic textbooks. The devices, consisting of 14-inch screens, replicate the size and appearance of a standard hard-copy textbook and allow users to apply &#8220;traditional&#8221; study techniques such as highlighting and margin notes. Kno intends to commence selling both products in early 2011.</p>
<p>E-books are not without <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/ebooks-articles/disadvantages-of-ebooks-549820.html"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">drawbacks</span></a>, and their lack of accessibility for the blind has already been the subject of a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/arizona-state-settles-kindle-lawsuit/3540"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">lawsuit against Arizona State University</span></a> settled last year. However, the recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_e-book_readers"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">proliferation of new general-purpose readers</span></a>, growing <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/02/obama_on_a_college_textbook_ra.html"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">public discontent with the textbook industry</span></a>, and a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/California-Law-Requires/20526/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">California law</span></a> requiring electronic textbooks in all primary and secondary schools by 2020 indicate that the days of a hard-copy textbook being the primary instruction aid are most likely numbered.</p>

<p>The digitization of any creative work raises issues of copyright protection. Although publishers have taken <a href="http://www.myce.com/news/TextBook-Torrents-forced-out-of-business-15130/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">legal action</span></a> against companies that facilitated illegal copying and distribution of textbooks without permission, most infringing activity has been the product of labor-intensive preparation such as scanning of hard-copy textbooks. As a result, the amount of infringement has not been high enough to be a significant concern to publishers. The digitization of textbooks, however, will likely revolutionize the delivery of textbooks in the same manner that digital music changed the recording industry. Similar to an .mp3 music file, a digital book never deteriorates and costs almost nothing to reproduce and distribute to other users. Without controls on this distribution process, a primary purpose of copyright protection &#8212; providing a financial incentive for authors to create original works &#8212; will be easily defeated.</p>
<p>The music industry&#8217;s resistance to the introduction of digital music is instructive, though not completely applicable, for publishers contemplating the growing popularity of e-books. Similar to the publishing industry, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was successful in shutting down the most popular peer-to-peer file sharing service provider. However, <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/10/ten-years-after-napster-music-industry-still-faces-the-free-music/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">similar service providers still exist</span></a>, while others have managed to avoid jurisdiction by <a href="http://domaingang.com/domain-news/software-pirates-moving-over-to-me/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">locating their domains beyond American jurisdiction</span></a>. RIAA&#8217;s real success in combating copyright infringement came when it started targeting and suing individual consumers, often for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2007/10/verdict-is-in.ars"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">astronomical sums of money</span></a>. The publishing industry, however, is not likely to fare as well in pursuing legal remedies as did the music industry.</p>
<p>Unlike RIAA, however, textbook publishers will not be as likely to slow illegal downloading by taking legal action against individual consumers. RIAA reported in 2004 that the music users it sued had downloaded an <a href="http://www.wave3.com/story/1944073/riaa-suing-local-teens-family-for-downloading-music?ClientType=Printable&amp;redirected=true"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">average of 800 songs each</span></a>. A typical student, on the other hand, may use 3-5 textbooks a semester, some of which may not be downloaded. Such low-volume lawsuits would probably not deter other students to a degree that would make the publishers&#8217; considerable investment in legal costs worthwhile.</p>
<p>So how should the textbook industry deal with the advent of digitization? The best answer may be to embrace the technology and develop business models that would ensure continued profitability. The newspaper industry&#8217;s slow reaction to the advent of internet-based news services still threatens its existence, but newspapers are starting to take action to remain viable by streamlining operations (most notably, by singling up publications in most metropolitan areas), concentrating on local features and news, and introducing websites featuring advertising space. In similar fashion, publishers should improve their processes in order to successfully implement an e-book operation. For example, electronic publishing should enable publishers to eliminate distribution overhead and some production costs. Authors could collaborate on <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/open-source-textbooks"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">open source textbook projects</span></a> in order to reduce costs and improve textbook quality. Advertising could be built into each publication. In addition, technology could be used to make electronic books non-transferable by adding copy protection or <a href="http://www.contentguard.com/MPEGRELreference/docs/Fee.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">charging the user a per-use fee</span></a>.</p>
<p>In sum, the ability of publishers to embrace digital technology early by implementing effective business models may enable them to profit from the growth of e-books rather than be victimized by it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;">~ An Epic Concept ~</h3>
<p>So I wanted a new blog header, one that was more than just a nice picture, and one that was related to writing, obviously&#8230;though I have been enjoying the &#8220;Baby and the Wolf&#8221; temporary header.</p>
<p>I had a few ideas about taking photos of Polaroids of my laptop and stuff like that &#8212; there was even a few test shots of dinosaurs &#8212; but in the end, I liked the idea of having something beautiful across the screen of my blog that embodies my&#8230;well, my word.  I don&#8217;t know what else to call it.  It&#8217;s like my lucky token&#8230;you know, my <em>word</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, don&#8217;t laugh, but my word is &#8220;epic.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know.  That seems like a cheesy word to lay claim to.  I get that it conjures up the image of a couple of stoner garage rats making horns and swinging around their guitars.  &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna be epic, duuude.  Billionaires!&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help that.  In fact, I embrace it.  I embrace the cheesiness!  I cheer on the stoner dudes mooching off their parents trying to break into the music industry, the television industry, the whatever-they-know-they-were-put-on-this-Earth-to-do industry, so long as they&#8217;re doing their work.  Too many people out there have convinced themselves to be safe and set reasonable goals anchored in reality instead of risking exposure of their tender underbellies while reaching for the stars.  It&#8217;s hard to stretch and grow in the fetal position<em>, dude</em>.</p>
<p>But &#8220;epic&#8221; is not just about dreaming big.  To me, it reminds me how you always get what you give.  This writing thing I do is one of the most important parts of me, and every day I thank my lucky stars for letting me have this need to make stories and being in such fortunate circumstances to fulfill it.  It&#8217;s that sticky-sweet part of my bone marrow, and if it were gone, I&#8217;d be hollow and empty inside.  Hell, I could write the sweetest country western song that would make your dog bawl, that&#8217;s how much I love writing.</p>
<p>So why would I ever give it anything less than an epic effort?</p>
<p>This is a truth that I wish I knew when I was younger.  People don&#8217;t ever become epic in their pursuits, they just get recognition for it.  I think they were always epic to begin with, in their practice, in their work ethic, and in their spirit.</p>
<p>This is how I want to be epic.  And I hope that my blog encourages folks to be epic too.</p>
<p>See?  Now you feel bad for thinking me corny.</p>
<p>Now a serendipitous thing happened this New Year&#8217;s.  A friend brought over this special beer.  It&#8217;s the only beer I drank, and at 9.5 percent alcohol, it was the only drink I needed.  He was nice enough to let me keep the bottle.  Why was this beer so special?  Let me show you.</p>
<p><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1019.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1485" title="IMG_1019" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1019.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="" width="1024" height="764" /></a>Yes, it&#8217;s Stone Brewing Company&#8217;s Special Edition Vertical Epic Ale.  The epic part is special enough, but this beer also happened to be produced on 10-10-10, my 37th birthday.  That&#8217;s pretty darn cool, but when you flip it over&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1486" title="IMG_1011" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1011.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="" width="1024" height="764" /></a>&#8230;the very definition of epic.  Perhaps it&#8217;s a silly little coincidence, but when I first saw it, I had a sense of magic, of things shifting into place.  I don&#8217;t know how to explain it better than that except that it happens from time to time, and it&#8217;s never failed me before.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">~ Test Shots in the Kitchen ~</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, how to translate this concept into a usable blog header?  Well, I got lucky.  I was making tea in the kitchen one day when I noticed the light was rather lovely cast through my tea.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0794.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1489" title="IMG_0794" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0794.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="" width="1024" height="764" /></a>Mostly I was playing around with the camera on my iPhone 4, and I got this shot, which gave me an idea&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0795.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1490" title="IMG_0795" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0795.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=764" alt="" width="1024" height="764" /></a>Being that tea leaves are often read as part of someone&#8217;s fortune, what if you could create your own fortune?  Drink Epic Tea.  Something along those lines.  I thought it might be fun to maybe type up the epic definition and fashion it as part of the tea brand.  I wasn&#8217;t sure exactly how I wanted to do it honestly.  I just knew I wanted the epic definition from Stone Brewing Company (these people have the absolute <em>best</em> copywriters in the biz), and I wanted the prettiness of the tea, both things that fill me when I write.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">~ Prop Design ~</h3>
<p>I believe in starting with the basics.  I am no graphic designer, and  I don&#8217;t have any photo editing software beyond Paint.  I have OpenWriter, and that&#8217;s what I ended up using.</p>
<p>First, I gave it a shot with one of those free online logo makers to see if I could make something that would look nice on the end of a tea bag string.  This is what I got:</p>
<p><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/draw_logo2-php.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1493" title="draw_logo2.php" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/draw_logo2-php.png?w=129&#038;h=160" alt="" width="129" height="160" /></a><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/draw_logo-php.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1492" title="draw_logo.php" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/draw_logo-php.png?w=129&#038;h=160" alt="" width="129" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>Pretty cool for free logos, but too small to be picked up on camera.  (I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t remember where I generated these, or I&#8217;d link it.)</p>
<p>Ah, well.  Then I thought maybe I should just try typing it out and play around with fonts and see what I could finagle.  I used the epic definition from the bottle verbatim (because it&#8217;s perfect and I give them both credit and props).  It looked a bit like the shape of a heart, so I laid a lined heart over it to see what it would look like.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0886.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1494" title="IMG_0886" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0886.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>I thought it looked pretty ugly, but I liked the idea of it being heart-shaped.  So I tried again and ended up with something better.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0881.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1498" title="IMG_0881" src="http://mybluescreen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_0881.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>Now all I needed was some hot water, a tea bag, good lighting, and great company.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">~ Conclusion ~</h3>
<p>Conceptual photography is <em>fun</em>.  I think what made it even more fun for me was that it was simple, no fancy stuff.  I spent maybe an hour in the backyard with my camera phone, and I ended up with a handful of very usable blog headers &#8212; yay! &#8212; which I will post tomorrow.  Come back and help me decide by voting for your favorite!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I took a huge first step for me in my running experiments, and ran outside. In winter! To say I was nervous before would be a gigantic lying understatement&#8230;I was terrified. What if I was too cold? What if I couldn&#8217;t run anymore? What if all the strange Swiss people stared at me like I was crazy. Ha &#8211; well that last one wouldn&#8217;t matter after having experienced <a title="Asuncion Running Experiment" href="http://anywherehome.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/running-in-paraguay/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">many runs through the streets of Asuncion!</span></a> Perhaps , from here on out, we should refer to this as the <strong>Zurich Winter Running Experiment.</strong></p>
<p>I was dressed like a champion: full length thermal leggings, thermal long sleeved Nike running shirt with a little bit of a turtle neck and thumb holes (love thumb holes!), short socks (oops), North Face Fleece, fleece lined gloves and a thick fleece headband. I headed out of A&#8217;s apartment and onto the streets of the old city. The feeling of fear was washed away as I felt my feet hit the cobble stones and the faces of those around me watched in&#8230;was that admiration?</p>
<div id="attachment_792" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://anywherehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1183.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-792 " title="Path in Zurich" src="http://anywherehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1183-e1296217757644.jpg?w=450&#038;h=599" alt="" width="450" height="599" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Part of the running path alongside the water&#039;s edge</p></div>
<p>Zurich is truly a beautiful city. It is divided in half by a long river which opens up into Lake Zurich. Lake Zurich is not only massive, but it&#8217;s completely surrounded by snowcapped mountains and picturesque homes. Not to mention the Swiss were thoughtful enough to build a walking/running/biking path along the entirety of the water&#8217;s edge. It is truly the perfect place to run or even just relax, as you can&#8217;t beat the views! And, oddly, it never seems to get icy here &#8211; so it&#8217;s even better for outdoor activities!</p>
<div id="attachment_793" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://anywherehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1179.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-793" title="Zurich Lake View" src="http://anywherehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_1179.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wish my phone took a better shot of this view! Notice snow capped mountains in the background.</p></div>
<p>So on my first run a few days ago, I learned the valuable lesson that I could in fact run in the winter, and that at 30 degrees I needed much more layering than at 40 degrees, (when I was dying of heat from the fleece and gloves!) I even managed to run over 5 miles on my second run! Granted, there were many little pauses and stretch points along the way, but I&#8217;m still proud I did it! And now I know that with each run it will start to get easier again.</p>
<p>So far, my Zurich Winter Running Experiment is going well!</p>
