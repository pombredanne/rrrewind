				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was having a conversation with <a href="http://www.timey-wimey.com/" target="_blank">Spring</a> about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0" target="_blank">Doctor Who</a>, as we often do, and it occurred to me that The Doctor is actually an expatriate.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really what this blog is about-  I started to write here originally just to tell my family and close friends what I was up to during my time in Germany.  Over time, however, my blog evolved into more than that-  I talk about life as an expat, and I talk about things that are different from life back in the US, different from the life I knew before last year.</p>
<p>Every third or fourth time I use the word expatriate, or expat for short, someone asks me what it means.  An expatriate is just somebody who lives outside of their native country, whether that be temporary or permanent.  The original meaning of the word referred to people who were permanently exiled or who had renounced their homes, but the word is used much  more generically now to describe anyone living outside their home country.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/doctorwho.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2181" alt="Doctor Who" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/doctorwho.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a>If you broaden the definition slightly of expatriate from country to planet, you can posit that the Doctor is actually an expat.   His homeworld is Gallifrey, a planet that is lost forever in time, but he spends an awful lot of time on Earth, hanging out with humans and generally getting involved with the culture.  That, my friends, is what an expatriate does.  Most of us don&#8217;t spend quite as much time running as the Doctor,  though, with the possible exception of <a href="http://noapathyallowed.com/" target="_blank">Mandi</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about the Doctor as an expatriate got me thinking about all the other expats scattered throughout geeky pop culture, and there are hundreds upon hundreds of them.  Since I&#8217;m a huge list-making nerd, this naturally led to me making a list of some of my favorite sci-fi and fantasy expats from movies, television, comics, and books.  There are far too many to include in one sitting, but these are some of my favorites.  I separate most of them into one of four basic categories: <strong>Last Of My Kind</strong>,<strong> </strong><strong>Stranded</strong>, <strong>Out Of Time</strong>, and <strong>Expat By Choice</strong>.</p>
<p>The Doctor falls into the <strong>Last Of My Kind</strong> grouping.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jonnjonnz.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2188" alt="jonnjonnz" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jonnjonnz.jpg?w=163&#038;h=300" width="163" height="300" /></a>Another memorable example of the last of his kind is J&#8217;onn J&#8217;onnz, the Martian Manhunter.  J&#8217;onn has taken on the human secret identity of John Jones, and he works as a police detective.  Here we encounter a major genre caveat:  Almost all comic book characters have had their story told and retold so many times that there are numerous versions, numerous origins, and numerous backstories.  J&#8217;onn was not always the last of his kind, and certain versions of him have other martians around.  In current continuity, there are green martians and white martians- J&#8217;onn is a green.  In most of the versions though, J&#8217;onn spends much of his non-crimefighting time observing and trying to understand humanity.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/bigblue.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2178" alt="bigblue" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/bigblue.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>Continuing on in comics, we have perhaps one of the most famous expatriates of all time:  Kal-El of Krypton. Sent to earth by his father to escape a dying planet, baby Kal is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, and is raised as their son, Clark Kent.  The story of Superman is so well known in our shared popular culture that even people who don&#8217;t read comics tend to have at least some knowledge of the story.  One interesting question where Superman is concerned, however:  In most versions of his story, Kal-El really knows very little of the cultural heritage of Krypton.  He was raised on Earth, as an Earth child.  Does this mean he&#8217;s not really an expatriate?</p>
<p>I could go on and on about expats in comics, since many of the comic book heroes are living outside their home countries.   As my friend <a href="http://frankfradella.com/" target="_blank">Frank Fradella</a> put it when I bounced the idea for this post off of him, &#8220;&#8230;and geez&#8230; the entire &#8220;new&#8221; X-Men were expats. Storm, Colossus, Banshee, Sunfire, Nightcrawler.&#8221;  Frank is right-  if I keep listing comic book expats, we&#8217;ll never get around to other fun characters.  Let&#8217;s move on to the <strong>Stranded</strong> expats.</p>
<p>While most expat stories in the sci-fi/fantasy genre tend to be fish out of water stories, it&#8217;s a pretty common trope to have people stuck somewhere, trying to get home.  Heck, that&#8217;s the entire premise of Star Trek: Voyager.  I don&#8217;t count them as expatriates, though, because they&#8217;re living in a community of their own kind (i.e. on board Voyager) and they&#8217;re not really integrating into the society around them as much as they&#8217;re just passing  through.  Star Trek: Voyager is the sci-fi equivalent of an American Army base in Germany- just passing through, folks.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/farscape.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2182" alt="farscape" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/farscape.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206" width="300" height="206" /></a>Often, however, the characters who fit this category are <em>stuck</em>.  They want to go home, but don&#8217;t know a way.  Like John Crichton in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farscape" target="_blank">Farscape</a>.  John is an astronaut and test pilot.  In the first episode of the series, he&#8217;s flying his module, Farscape One, and he is pulled into a suddenly appearing wormhole.  When he exits the other side, he&#8217;s in the middle of a battle between the Peacekeepers, a human-looking species called the Sebacean, and a group of escaped prisoners of various alien species aboard Moya, a living ship.  He&#8217;s pulled onboard Moya, and the rest of the series is a combination of his adventures with that group and his attempts to get home.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/flashgordon.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2183" alt="flashgordon" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/flashgordon.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300" width="198" height="300" /></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_gordon" target="_blank">Flash Gordon</a>&#8216;s story is not all that different than John Crichton, although in the wonderfully campy 1980 movie version, he&#8217;s not an astronaut, he&#8217;s a professional football player. (The original 1930s version had him as a polo player.)   During a series of pretty ludicrous events, he gets launched into space, and crash-lands on Mongo, before getting into a series of adventures with the various peoples of that world.  Flash adapts amazingly well, and ultimately winds up saving the various different nations of Mongo from their evil overlord, Ming The Merciless.  There have been other versions of Flash&#8217;s story, but the 1980 version is my favorite, partially because of the amazing <a href="http://www.queenonline.com/" target="_blank">Queen</a> rock-score for the film, but mostly for the amazing cast, including Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin, Max von Sydow as Ming, and the amazing Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan:</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/diiiiive.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2288" alt="Gordon's alive?" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/diiiiive.jpg?w=404&#038;h=500" width="404" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Moving on, then.  The television series Land Of The Lost counts as a <strong>Stranded</strong> <strong></strong>expat story, because the Marshall family (father Rick, children Will and Holly) accidentally moves through a dimensional portal and spends the rest of their time dodging dinosaurs and Sleestaks (humanoid reptilian bad guys) and trying to get back home.  I have no particular fondness for this series, but I like saying &#8220;Sleestak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another great expatriate character who is stuck away from his home is Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, known to most as the Wizard of Oz.  As with comics, there are many different versions of this character.  In some versions, he&#8217;s fairly benificent.  In the original book version, he really just wanted to go home.  In the musical <a href="http://www.wickedthemusical.com/" target="_blank">Wicked</a>, (my favorite version, incidentally,) he&#8217;s actually kind of a dick.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kevinflynn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2189" alt="kevinflynn" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kevinflynn.jpg?w=150&#038;h=99" width="150" height="99" /></a>In another of my all time favorites, the TRON series, Kevin Flynn has a rather interesting version of being stuck in another place. Since 1989, Flynn has been living in the Grid, a fictional virtual reality world.  We don&#8217;t really see much of Flynn&#8217;s life on the Grid, because the movie follows his son, Sam Flynn.  Still, it&#8217;s evident from what you do see that he has established a remarkable life for himself there.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fordprefect.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2184" alt="fordprefect" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fordprefect.jpg?w=300&#038;h=181" width="300" height="181" /></a>Up until this point, all of my <strong>Stranded</strong> examples have been humans.  However, one of my favorite expatriate characters isn&#8217;t human at all.  He is, in fact, from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.   Ford Prefect, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiker%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy" target="_blank">Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide To The Galaxy</a> series, has been in many formats-  books, television shows, radio shows, a movie, comic books, trading cards-  the version pictured to the right is the movie Ford, played by Mos Def.  I prefer the book and radio show versions of Ford, but it was much easier to find a picture of the movie version.   Ford is a roving researcher for the titular Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide.  He came to Earth to research it for the book, and got stuck for fifteen years.</p>
<p>We can go in with the <strong>Stranded</strong> examples for pages and pages, but I think it&#8217;s Time to move onto the <strong>Out Of Time</strong> category.  (See what I did there?)  These are characters who wind up stuck outside of their own time, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_gold" target="_blank">Booster Gold</a>.  I said I wouldn&#8217;t do any more comic book heroes in this list, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fry.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2185" alt="fry" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fry.jpg?w=300&#038;h=223" width="300" height="223" /></a>I didn&#8217;t say anything about cartoons, though.  Take Philip J. Fry, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama" target="_blank">Futurama</a> for example.  In the pilot episode of the series, Fry is a pizza delivery man who gets accidentally (ish) frozen in a cryogenic tube for one thousand years.  He wakes up in the future, and starts working as a delivery boy (naturally) at Planet Express, a delivery company owned as a side-business by Fry&#8217;s distant, distant, very distant nephew, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth.  A quick side-note about Futurama-  this show is insanely smart at times.  From the earliest episodes, the creators plotted out certain things that get threaded throughout the series.  For example, in the future world of Futurama, owls have become vermin and pests, not unlike city rats of the present day.  Don&#8217;t believe me?  Watch the show again from the beginning, and watch for owls.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/buckrogers.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2179" alt="Bidi-bidi-bidi." src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/buckrogers.jpg?w=210&#038;h=300" width="210" height="300" /></a>Getting back to our expats<strong> </strong>in time, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_rogers" target="_blank">Buck Rogers</a>.  Buck is another old character who has been in movies, television shows, comics, and even video games.  The version most people know about is the 1979-1981 television show Buck Rogers, in which he&#8217;s a shuttle pilot who accidentally gets frozen for roughly 500 years. Once revived, he joins the Earth Defense Directorate, finds love, and gains a pet ambuquad named Twiki, a little robot who seems to have been designed to cash in on the popularity of C3PO and R2-D2 from the newly released film Star Wars.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe it never occurred to me before right now as I write this sentence that Buck Rogers + Flash Gordon = Farscape.  Hmm.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/johnspartan.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2187" alt="Enhance your calm, John Spartan!" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/johnspartan.jpg?w=300&#038;h=197" width="300" height="197" /></a>As with all my other examples of expats stuck out of time, John Spartan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_man" target="_blank">Demolition Man</a> was crygenically frozen.  Whatever happened to a good old time machine?  John Spartan is a cop, sent to CryoPrison in 1996.  They wake him up about forty years later to stop another escaped cryoprisoner, the dastardly Simon Phoenix.  You can tell that Simon is the bad guy because his hair is an unnatural yellow-white color.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on to the <strong>Expat By Choice</strong> category.  I could reference Wonder Woman&#8217;s decision to leave Themyscira, but dang it, I said no more comic book heroes.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chewbacca.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2180" alt="chewbacca" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chewbacca.jpg?w=169&#038;h=300" width="169" height="300" /></a>In the Star Wars universe, Chewbacca could loosely be considered an expat.  He isn&#8217;t hanging out on Kashyyyk with the other Wookiees.  However, expanded universe canon states that he fled his home-world when the Empire enslaved the rest of the Wookiees to get construction of the Death Star back on schedule.  This means that technically, Chewie is more of a refugee than an expatriate.  Additionally, since he travels with his friend and business partner Han Solo to fulfill his life-debt (long story), Chewbacca isn&#8217;t really embracing the culture of any specific new place.</p>
<p>While I would love to say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5" target="_blank">Babylon 5</a> is full of expatriate characters, it really only has two:  Sinclair and Sheridan.  Both of them go to live on Minbar at different points in the series.   The rest don&#8217;t quite match the definition of expatriate because the different species on board Babylon 5 all have their own groupings.  You rarely see a Pak&#8217;mara hanging out with the Gaim, for example, and you would never see a Drazi living on the Vorlon homeworld.  It just isn&#8217;t done.   Babylon 5 is a merchant outpost and a travel hub, and although it&#8217;s referred to as a city in space in the opening credits, it really isn&#8217;t.  B5 is run primarily by EarthForce, and it has no predominant single culture.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spock.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2191" alt="spock" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spock.jpg?w=210&#038;h=170" width="210" height="170" /></a>Similarly, Star Trek is full of characters who seem to fit the role of expat at first, but perhaps aren&#8217;t textbook examples.  We have characters like Quark on Deep Space Nine, and Worf on board the Enterprise (and later, Deep Space Nine.)  Quark is a merchant, and since the station is a trading post, he&#8217;s not really adopting the culture of a new home-world.  As for Worf, he has Kal-El&#8217;s problem.  Worf may have been born a Klingon, but he was adopted by and raised by humans.  His primary culture is the one that he&#8217;s most commonly in touch with.  Worf isn&#8217;t an expatriate at all.  He falls into a slightly different category though, and I&#8217;ll touch on that a little bit later on.  Lastly, from my Star Trek examples, there&#8217;s Spock.  Spock was raised on Vulcan, but one of his parents was human.  He chooses to live in Starfleet, which is mostly populated by humans.  Even later in his timeline, when he becomes an Ambassador, he mostly sticks around Earth until his eventual trip to Romulus for reunification efforts between the Vulcans and Romulans.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tealc.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2192" alt="teal'c" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tealc.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a>Now that we&#8217;ve covered Star Wars and Star Trek, I would be remiss to leave out the third Star* franchise, Stargate.  Teal&#8217;c is another character that <em>looks</em> human, but isn&#8217;t quite human.  He is a Jaffa, which is a genetically modified human with an abdominal pouch so that he can serve as an incubator for a larval Goa&#8217;uld symbiote.  It&#8217;s not as icky as it sounds, because the symbiote grants its host Jaffa enhanced strength, health, and longevity as well as rapid healing.  The Jaffa are also an enslaved race at the beginning of the series, serving as military forces to the System Lords, who are the initial run of bad guys in the show.  I&#8217;m vastly oversimplifying the sequence of events here, but Teal&#8217;c defects to the SG1 team and goes back to Earth in the pilot episode of the series.    He becomes a valuable member of the team, and he even tries to live outside of Stargate Command in a regular apartment at one point in the series.  Naturally, he wears a hat to cover up the gold embossed tattoo on his forehead whenever he&#8217;s out in public.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spikegiles.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2190" alt="spikegiles" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spikegiles.jpg?w=300&#038;h=293" width="300" height="293" /></a>Meanwhile, back in Sunnydale, we have a couple of Brits living in America.  One of them is Giles, a Watcher, and the other is Spike, a vampire.  (I won&#8217;t get into Liam&#8230; sorry, Angelus here, because his Irish accent was just too horrific for words.)  The expats in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a> tend to be much more like the textbook definition of expatriate.  Giles is sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher&#8217;s Council, and that&#8217;s not all that different than me being sent to Germany for my job.  As for Spike, I suppose when you&#8217;ve lived for a hundred years or more, it makes sense to try to live somewhere different.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/travelinmatt.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2193" alt="travelinmatt" src="http://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/travelinmatt.jpg?w=201&#038;h=300" width="201" height="300" /></a>Also in the Expat By Choice category is Uncle Traveling Matt, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraggle_rock" target="_blank">Fraggle</a> who spends most of his time exploring &#8220;Outer Space,&#8221; his term for the normal human world the rest of us inhabit.  Matthew is the quintessential exploring expatriate, constantly evaluating the culture and norms around him, even if his observations are more Jane Goodall than Terry Gilliam.  (For those of you that know me well, you know I couldn&#8217;t do a list like this without including at least one Muppet.)</p>
<p>A few paragraphs back, I mentioned that Worf isn&#8217;t an expatriate, and that he falls into a different category than the rest of this list.  That category is <strong>Third-Culture Kids</strong>. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third-culture kid</a>, or trans-culture kid, in the real world is usually the child of an expatriate.  For example, an American couple has a child while living in Germany.  The child is American-born, but German by culture.  When the family relocates back to the country of their passports, the child has to deal with this cultural divide.  Third-Culture Kids are often multilingual, and are very often accomplished.  However, adjusting to their passport country after years of living in other cultures can be incredibly difficult and can take a great deal of time.  This is Worf in a nutshell, although he didn&#8217;t reintegrate with Klingon culture until very late in his life.</p>

<p><strong>These are some of my favorite expatriates from Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Comic Book culture. What are some of your favorites?</strong></p>
<p>*Don&#8217;t know what Grokking means?  I guess you should read Stranger In A Strange Land, then.  I&#8217;m off to <a href="http://www.megaconvention.com/" target="_blank">MegaCon in Orlando</a> this weekend, so you can tell me what you thought of it after I get back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A short reflection on the meaning of democracy and our experience at Occupy organizing at a large “public” university in Michigan.</em></p>
<p><img style="border:0 none;" alt="Photo: , License: N/A" src="http://metrotimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1219856.1318968048%21/image/652713208.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_335/652713208.jpg" width="360" height="224" /></p>
<p>The three of us first began organizing together under the aegis of Occupy in 2011 at the university where we work (though we were also involved in other regional/local Occupies). While the GAs on our campus initially drew more than a hundred students, our numbers quickly began to decline and we ultimately turned into a sort of affinity group that, while consistently active, became a closed space with little potential for movement building. Looking back, we remain convinced that universities are an under organized space in anticapitalist struggles but that the dominant organizing models, in particular their emphasis on <i>democracy</i>, require some fundamental rethinking. In what follows, we detail our experience with the GA and sketch out some of the reasons why it failed to serve as the organizing space that we had initially hoped for.</p>
<p>The GAs were one of the most visible and emblematic features of Occupy and were frequently celebrated as consensus-based decision-making bodies both based on and dedicated to principles of <i>radical democracy</i>. GAs helped to introduce thousands of participants to numerous practices that, while well known to anarchist organizers and professional activists (facilitation, stack, consensus, committees/working groups, etc.), were unfamiliar to many newcomers. Compared with the dismal charade of “politics” characteristic of the electoral system, the experience of “real democracy” was in many ways captivating. It created widely circulable images of protestors and offered a tangible way to imagine what they were seeking when they themselves refused to issue precise demands. These practices were quickly drawn into the everyday language of Occupy, most often in the form of “prefigurative” politics.</p>
<p>While GAs in New York, for example, seemed to draw large numbers over long periods of time, the GAs on our campus quickly became an exhausting and draining burden. First and foremost, they were really, really long. Open conversations often take a long time and at times can end up doing little more than going over the same ground. At the same time, since we weren’t actually occupying a space on campus, participants weren’t already gathered in the same place for an indefinite period of time—folks had other places to be, struggling to find enough time to study and work to pay to study. Second, as numbers dropped at the meetings, the bureaucratic structures of the GA began to seem a little ridiculous. When there are only 20 people in a room, there simply is not a need for such a formalized structure. Given that our meeting size varied so much, planning appropriately was a problem. Third, in part because we were not holding space, our meetings tended to be unfocused. Too much time was spent discussing demands and formulating principles, and not enough on planning actions. It was frustrating to attend a three-hour GA whose purpose could not be synthesized and which often had no product. Ultimately the long, drawn out, romantically declarative GA felt like a fetishistic performance of what we imagined politics to be.</p>
<p>We see these problems as arising not from inefficient or otherwise flawed procedures that impede the GA’s democratic function but rather from the obsession with democracy itself. Neither “better facilitation” nor “bigger GAs” would have changed the political valence of the Occupy model or, for that matter, the objective conditions of struggle on our campus. Democracy is synonymous with a liberal politics in which politics as such is defined as speech and individual rights take precedence over collective missions. Below we offer a series of hypotheses about how the GA conceived of politics and democracy and lay out some questions that, we think, might help us develop new ways to organize.</p>
<p><b>Democracy and the GA</b></p>
<p>Hypothesis 1: GAs are based on the notion that <i>speech is equivalent to democracy and, as a consequence, politics</i>. The structures of democracy that are embedded in the GA form (participation is showing via hand signals or voicing your opinion about a given topic, the human mic and repetition of speech, and so on) will always tend, despite strong disavowals to the contrary, toward a form of politics as speech. The GA absorbs direct action into itself, coordinating and distributing speech acts that come to stand in for the anarchist politics from which the GA emerges. So people talk about how Occupy has “already won” because it “changed the national conversation” about inequality. The premise is that speaking aloud comes to supersede and in a way replace structural change. Talking has to lead to action—the two are intertwined and there must be space for both, but mere denunciation is not enough. In our Occupy, which was not holding space, we spent far more time talking than doing. Meetings can be great, and can generate the social bonds that form the basis of solidarity, but without direct action that potential solidarity withers and dies before it can be tested, strengthened, and deployed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of our direct actions—such as interrupting a regents’ meeting or a speech at the Business school with a mic check—in fact took the form of vocal denunciations, of political speech. The most common reaction to the mic checks seemed to be mild irritation. Other than short delays, our speech had few material consequences. In fact, it could be argued that our actions served to improve the university’s image as a “site of free speech.” After we disrupted a regents’ meeting, the president of our university published an open letter to President Obama the next day beseeching him to address the issue student debt. Shortly after that, he appeared on campus for some photo ops. Tuition still increased 2.8% for in-state students and 3.5% for out-of-state students the following year.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2: Given the dominance of the notion of politics as speech, <i>the GA has a problematic tendency to become the primary site of subjectivization</i>. In its presumptively prefigurative model, the forms of democracy it enables and proliferates come to stand as the embodiment of a coming “democratic” community. But the GA is a horrible site for introducing people to a movement, changing their minds, convincing them to get involved—don’t you want your life to be more like an unending series of 3-hour long meetings? In sites like ours where there is not already a significant level of radicalization (more than 10-20 students and faculty) finding ways of building a group of people to undertake actions and protest is critical. Equally important is having multiple points of entry and forms of involvement. What this means is that the structure of governance (a GA, a meeting, a spokescouncil) ceases to be the place we bring people to try to convince them that they should care more deeply about student debt, go on strike, or occupy a building.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3: The GA is a weak organizing model <i>because it doesn’t think of itself as an organizing model</i>. This creates a problematic overlap between the “form of governance” and the “structure of movement.” These have to be separated. Take the following three cases. In Occupy Oakland, there was initially a dialectic between subjectivization in the streets and containment in the GA, but once this dialectic broke down (coming to favour the GA over the streets) there was no other structure supporting the movement. In Occupy Wall Street, there was a shift from the GA (form of governance) to a dual model with both a GA and a spokescouncil as a parallel organizational structure. Here, the separation between structure and governance is too pronounced and results in a form of shadow governance—the spokescouncil wields the real power and the GAs turn into performance art. In the Occupy at our university, this overlap between governance and structure led to the group’s transformation into an affinity group. Sensing the hollowness of the GA as an organizing model, we shifted to friendship, which is a firmer organizing structure, but which had high barriers to entry and few points for subjectivization.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4: <i>The most powerful GAs are tied to actions</i> or called to determine if a group of people is willing to undertake a large-scale action (“large-scale” being a scalar term, depending on where and how many you are). If we stop thinking of the GA as either an organizational structure or as a site of subjectivization, we can then ask ourselves what it is they do well. In our opinion, the GA works best under two conditions: 1) it involves a decision on an action (in other words, it operates not as mechanism of containment but rather in a dialectic with direct action), and 2) the decision and process of making the decision has a profound effect of supernumerary collectivity (even if it is marked by intense disagreements with other participants). This does not require perpetual repetition or a reconvening as a general meeting structure, but is more of a collective beginning for a very tangible, visible struggle. It does not rely on a notion of politics as speech, but rather links speech and action.</p>

<p><b>Next Steps for Campus Organizing</b></p>
<p>While over the last few years we have seen significant examples of police violence and repression on campuses across the country (especially in California and New York), university administrations more often engage protesters in less direct ways which are highly effective in generating burnout. The denial of confrontation, which while possibly dangerous is at the same time useful for mobilization, ultimately leaves us inaudible. Coupled with the bureaucracy of endless meetings, the administrative response exhausts enthusiasm for movement building. Changing the university requires bringing a halt to the “business” of its everyday operations, something that will actually require the university to publicly confront protestors. For this to happen on our campus, we will need to build support for more militant direct actions.</p>
<p>One of the challenges to organizing on campus is getting undergraduate students—many of whom are being buried under mountains of student debt—to realize that their degree will probably not result in the comfortable middle class lifestyle that they’ve been told awaits them after graduation. This runs counter to their day-to-day experiences in which they do not yet find themselves in the uncomfortable position of not being able to pay back their loans. In a way, we are asking students to anticipate their own future failure. We need to think through the temporality of what people are being asked to act on and how that impacts participation. This requires a longer term relationship with students that may even extend beyond the time it takes them to graduate. Community involvement needs to include alumni and a more intergenerational approach to thinking the figure of “the student.”</p>
<p>With regards to graduate students and faculty, we need to dispel the notion that your scholarship can be your activism. Participation in university-based activism means material risk for individuals whose careers are tied to the institution in such an intimate way. Many of our colleagues, while championing anticapitalist, antiracist, and feminist politics in their work, routinely fail to participate in an open struggle to change the structures that govern our lives. While our writing and research can feed, nurture, and illuminate our struggles (and vice versa), the two should not be conflated. As scholars, we need to put our bodies where our theory is.</p>
<p>Given the current state of student debt, a vicious administrative class, and the prevalence of idealism and creativity, we believe that university campuses are logical and essential sites of struggle. That being said, the university is a trap—only university-based struggles that aim at generalization, at escaping the university and becoming part of wider social condition of refusal (as in Quebec), will have a shot at avoiding either recuperation or reformism. For us, this implies a two part, long-term organizing problem: first, organizing enough students to form a powerful bloc capable of acting on the terrain of the university, and second, organizing the communities that surround us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Joe Abercrombie wrote a lengthy post <a href="http://www.joeabercrombie.com/2013/02/25/the-value-of-grit/">in defence of grimdark fantasy</a>, a stance which should come as no shock whatsoever to anyone familiar with his books. (Which, for the record, I&#8217;ve read and enjoyed, albeit with reservations.) The pro/con debate over gritty SFF is comparatively new, in the sense that its status as a distinct subgenre is comparatively new, but not so lacking in history that we haven&#8217;t already built up a fairly substantial archive of dissenting opinions. What struck me forcefully about Abercrombie&#8217;s essay, however, was his failure to acknowledge, let alone address, a key aspect of the debate, viz: the ways in which grittiness is racially, sexually and culturally political, and whether or not those elements can ever be usefully disentangled from anything else the concept has to offer.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Portraying your fantasy world in a way that&#8217;s like our world?&#8221;</em> Abercrombie asks. <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s only honesty.&#8221;</em> And that&#8217;s<a href="http://fozmeadows.wordpress.com/2012/10/07/levels-of-reality/"> often a fair point to make</a>, when it comes to fantasy. But I find it extremely telling that while he goes on to apply this rule to the presence of death, drugs, sex, swearing, bad behaviour and excrement, he stops short of parsing its relevance to the default inclusion of sexism, racism and other such problematic behaviours in grimdark, crapsack worlds. Or, to put it another way: if your goal in writing gritty SFF is to create what you perceive to be an honest, albeit fantastic version of reality &#8211; and more, one where acknowledging the darker aspects of human nature takes precedence &#8211; then the likelihood is that you&#8217;ll end up writing victimised and/or damaged women, sexist and homophobic social structures, racist characters and, as a likely corollary, racist stereotypes <em>as automatic defaults; </em>which means, in turn, that you run an extremely high risk of excluding even the possibility of undamaged, powerful women, LGBTQ and/or POC characters from the outset, because you&#8217;ve already decided that such people <em>are fundamentally unrealistic</em>.    </p>
<p>Not unsurprisingly, therefore, many SFF readers &#8211; especially those who are female, POC and/or LGBTQ &#8211; are going to object to your definition of reality, not just as you&#8217;ve elected to apply it in an SFFnal context, but as an effective commentary on them, personally: because when you contend that realistic worldbuilding requires the inclusion of certain specific inequalities in order to count as realistic, you&#8217;re simultaneously asserting that such inequalities are inherent <em>to reality &#8211; </em>that a story cannot be honest, or your characters believably human, if there aren&#8217;t mechanisms in place to keep women oppressed, POC othered and LGBTQ persons invisible.</p>
<p>But the thing is, because such mechanisms are already so entrenched as narrative defaults when it comes to SFF worldbuilding, it&#8217;s easy to give them a pass &#8211; or at least, to deny their increased relevance &#8211; in the case of grimdark stories. Because if, as Abercrombie&#8217;s post implies, the grim in grimdark comes only from the presence of graphic violence, full-on sex, drugs, swearing, disease and character death, then it should still be possible to write grimdark stories that lack rape, domestic violence, racism and homophobia, and which feature protagonists who are neither straight, predominently white men nor the ultimate victims of same. And yet, overwhelmingly, that is what grimdark consists of: because somewhere along the line, the majority of its authors have assumed that &#8220;grittiness&#8221; as a concept is necessarily synonymous with the reinforcement of familiar inequalities.</p>
<p>Please note my use of that word, <em>familiar</em>, as it&#8217;s the lynchpin of my argument: that by assuming current and historical expressions of bigotry, bias and social inequality to be universal and exclusive expressions of bigotry, bias and social inequality, grimdark stories are, more often than not, reinforcing specific inequalities as inevitable and thereby serving to perpetuate them further. Which is why, in grimdark, it&#8217;s not just graphic sex, but the graphic rape or assault of women by men, or sex which objectifies women; it&#8217;s not just swearing, but swearing which derives its offensiveness from treating women&#8217;s bodies, habits and gender as undesirable, or which reinforces racism and homophobia; it&#8217;s not just violence, but violence against the othered. </p>
<p>Writing recently about <em>Lincoln</em>, Aaron Bady <a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2012/11/lincoln-against-the-radicals-2/">had this to say</a> on the subject of gritty cinema (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it uses a realist aesthetic to make it seem like a compromising cynicism is <em>realistic</em>. Form becomes content: it shows us the world as it “really” is by adding in the grit and grain and grime that demonstrate that the image has not being airbrushed, cleaned up, or glossed over, and this artificial lack of artifice signifies as reality&#8230; They don’t mean “accuracy,” because that’s not something most people could judge; they mean un-glamorized, un-romanticized, dark&#8230; Our field of view is claustrophobic and drab; we are shown a political arena without sentiment or nostalgic glow. That’s how we know we’re seeing the “real” thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, of course, we’re not. We’re just seeing a movie whose claim to objective accuracy is no less artificial than the filters by which an instagram takes on the nostalgic glow of a past that was never as overexposed and warm as it has become in retrospect. And when we take “gritty” for “realism,” another kind of “realism” gets quietly implied and imposed: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Capitalist-Realism-there-alternative-Books/dp/1846943175">capitalist realism</a> by which ideals become impossible and the only way things can get done is through compromise and strategic surrender. <strong>Anti-romanticism is all the more ideological because it pretends to have no ideology, to be the “plain truth” that demonstrates the falsity of romantic visions. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is where grimdark tends to fall down for me, and why eliding the genre&#8217;s political dimensions is especially problematic: grittiness is only a <em>selective</em> view of reality, not the whole picture. Yes, there&#8217;s pain and despair and suffering, but not exclusively, and when you make grit a synonym for realism &#8211; when you make an active, narrative decision to privilege specific, familiar types of grimness as universals &#8211; then you&#8217;re not just denying the fullness of reality; you&#8217;re promoting a version of it that&#8217;s inherently hostile to the personhood and interests of the majority of people on the planet. (And in that sense, it doesn&#8217;t seem irrelevant that the bulk of gritty, grimdark writers, especially those who self-identify as such, are straight, white men.)</p>
<p>Human beings are flawed, and frequently terrible. We are capable of horrific acts; of racism, sexism, homophobia, and countless acts of violence, discrimination and ignorance. But there are still degrees of flawedness, such that a story which fails to acknowledge our worst aspects is no less &#8220;realistic&#8221; than one which portrays them as the be-all, end-all of our existence. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting realism in your fantasy &#8211; most readers demand it to some extent &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ve all agreed on what realism in fantasy<em> is</em>. It&#8217;s a mistake to assume that your preferred flavour of honesty is the only legitimate one; or, just as importantly, the <em>most</em> legitimate one.   </p>
<p>To summarise the problem of committing to this familiar idea of grittiness, then:</p>
<p>If your idea of &#8216;grittiness&#8217; includes misogyny (for instance), it&#8217;s more or less inevitable that your female characters will not only encounter systematic sexism, but necessarily be scarred by it,<em> </em>because if it were possible for them to remain unscathed by such an integral aspect of your preordained notion of grittiness,<em> </em>then<em> </em>by the rubric of gritty = honest, <em>they would be unrealistic characters</em>. Which means that, with the best will in the world, you&#8217;ve committed<em> from the outset</em> to writing women whose lives and selves are damaged by men &#8211; and while, as a female reader, I don&#8217;t object to encountering such characters, I do object to the assumption that <em>these are the only female characters you can realistically write</em>. </p>
<p>Grittiness has its place in fiction; as do representations of existing inequalities. But when we forget to examine why we think certain abuses are inevitable, or assume their universality &#8211; when we write about a particular prejudice, not to question, subvert or redefine it, but to confirm it as an inevitable, even integral aspect of human nature &#8211; then we&#8217;re not being <em>realistic</em>, but <em>selective</em> in our portrayal and understanding of reality.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><em><span style="font-size:13px;">A guest blog from Kathleen Stone:</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><span style="font-size:13px;">Fiction/nonfiction: what’s the difference?  If there’s a difference, does it matter?  And ei<a href="http://brevity.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/awp2013d.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3322" style="margin:3px 13px;" alt="awp2013d" src="http://brevity.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/awp2013d.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" width="300" height="216" /></a>ther way, what responsibility does the author have to readers and subjects? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">By the third day of AWP, I thought I couldn’t bear to hear these questions discussed.  I thought Lawrence Weschler’s observation about narrative voice and the division of the world between those who know it’s a fiction and those who don’t had been chewed over enough to last me a lifetime.  But still, something drew me to the <i>Why</i> <i>Genre Matters</i> panel.  Maybe the names of the panelists, or something about the blurb in the conference book drew me in, but whatever it was, I grabbed another cup of coffee and soldiered on.</p>
<p>Nonfictionist and moderator Dinah Lenney led off with her own strong point of view.  An author and reader are like two people on a see-saw, with movement and balance between them.  When the author doesn’t clue us in, and we don’t know what we hold in our hands, then the see-saw is left with only one person &#8212; out of balance and disappointing.  There is a diff, and it matters.</p>
<p>Scott Nadelson countered with the oft-made observation that there is no such thing as objectivity.  A blurring between genres necessarily follows, and the author can rely on voice and form to tip off the reader to what’s on the page.  His recent book, <i>The Next Scott Nadelson, A Life in Progress</i>, may be labeled a memoir, but it comes without a guaranty of accuracy.  So maybe there’s no diff at all?</p>
<p>Essayist and critic Sven Birkerts analogized genre to etiquette.  Genre distinctions are like rules, necessary for maintaining harmony amid the tensions, but they need not be stultifying, even as please and thank you are not.  A psyche that invents and writes about a blue bucket is not very different from a psyche that remembers a blue bucket, but different motivations are at play &#8211; – this could have been vs. this happened.  Writers of both genres share the act of creation, of giving narrative shape to the work, but for nonfiction writers, the engine is memory.</p>
<p>Poet David Beispiel joined Scott in label bashing.  Writers should be free to write whatever they want and label it however they want (or perhaps not at all).  Labels exist for the bookseller who wants to know what to order and how to display it, not for the author or reader.  I wonder what he thinks about truth in politics – after all, he does write for <i>Politico</i>.</p>
<p>Multi-genre writer Judith Kitchen agreed Weschler was right about narrative voice being a fiction.  It’s simply a lens for delivery, involving an aesthetic decision but not a deliberate fabrication.  A flood she experienced as a child, which she has repeatedly and variously treated it in her own work, is an actual event seen through different lenses, sometimes intensely and sometimes in passing, but always drawn from memory.  Judith concluded with a segue to why we like memoir:  it takes the place of gossiping with a neighbor over the clothesline.  That clothesline is gone for most of us and we embrace memoir to fill the void.</p>
<p>So, I’m glad I grabbed another cup of coffee and pushed aside my conference fatigue on Saturday morning to hear <i>Why Genre Matters.  </i>Or maybe it doesn’t.  The panel offered one of the most heady and honest exchanges of AWP.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;">&#8211;</span></p>
<p><strong>Kathleen Stone</strong> is a writer who lives in Boston.  Her work has been published in <i>Points East</i>, a sailing magazine, and she has dreams of many more publications to follow.</p>

<p>I traveled to North Korea in February of 2013 to observe The Day of the Shining Star, also known as Kim Jong Il&#8217;s Birthday.It is one of the biggest holidays in the country for obvious reasons. I figured it would be an unforgettable experience to be in North Korea for this event and man, I was not disappointed.</p>
<p>I use a fixed-lens 35mm camera for my photography and I am usually very happy with this instrument. However, travelling in North Korea was the only time I wish I had an interchangeable lens camera as it would have given me more flexibility on the kind of subjects I could have photographed. Compared to other places, it&#8217;s a bit more difficult in North Korea to get up close to the subjects you want to snap photos of.</p>
<p>I saw dazzling monuments to Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and North Korean socialism. I had the rare opportunity to see Kim Jong Il&#8217;s embalmed body at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. We went out to the countryside and saw traditional Korean homes and Buddhist temples. But perhaps my favorite part of the trip were the walks around Pyongyang. Granted, the guides took us to certain, nicer neighborhoods in an obvious effort to hide the poverty and other ills that plagued the city and country. We explored the areas surrounding the famed Mansudae Apartments, Pyongyang Square, and other parks and public institutions. Despite the restrictions, the walks gave me a small glimpse of what normal life was like in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Because I am a Korean-American and can speak the language, I was able to interact with some locals on the street. Not all that I reached out to were receptive to having a conversation with a complete stranger on the street but for the few that did, they were very curious and interested in my background, a Korean from the West. Not once did I experience any hostility from North Koreans regarding my American citizenship. In fact, they were extremely kind and displayed the kind of hospitality and warmth that is characteristic of Koreans. I did wonder at times if my ethnicity trumped my nationality. The older folk were very hesitant about being photographed and many shooed me away or turned their backs. However, the children I encountered playing at the park or rollerblading in Pyongyang Square had no problems having their photographs taken. In fact, they encouraged it! In my photos, you can see that the kids really enjoyed interacting with me, the &#8220;enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is important to remind myself, that what I saw in North Korea was a very sanitized exhibition of the country. They did a not perfect, but still very good job hiding the terrible things that are normally associated with North Korea: the poverty, the lack of basic human rights.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my encounters with the North Korean people have shown me that they are no different than any other groups of people. They were shockingly normal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Random House recently started Hydra,</strong> an electronic-only imprint for science fiction stories and short novels. But, <a href="http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2013/02/second-class-contracts-deal-terms-at.html">as noted by Writer Beware here</a>, the terms in a Hydra deal sheet shown to them are pretty damn awful:</p>
<p>* No advance.</p>
<p>* The author is charged &#8220;set-up costs&#8221; for editing, artwork, sale, marketing, publicity &#8212; i.e., all the costs a publisher is has been expected to bear. The &#8220;good news&#8221; is that the author is not charged up front for these; they&#8217;re taken out of the backend. If the book is ever published in paper, costs are deducted for those, too.</p>
<p>* The contract asks for primary and subsidiary rights for the term of copyright.</p>
<p>Writer Beware notes, appropriately, that this information comes from only one deal sheet it&#8217;s seen from Hydra. But, you know what: One attempt at this sort of appalling, rapacious behavior on the part of Random House is bad <em>enough</em>.</p>
<p>Dear writers: This is a horrendously bad deal and if you are ever offered something like it, you should run away as fast as your legs or other conveyances will carry you.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>1. NO ADVANCE.</strong> Dear Random House: Are you <em>fucking kidding me?</em> Random House had 1.7 billion euros in revenue in 2011 (Bertelsmann, the parent company, had fifteen billion euro in revenue in the same year, with over six hundred million euro in net income) and you somehow can&#8217;t afford <em>advances</em> all of a sudden? Color me skeptical.</p>
<p>Advances are typically <em>all authors make from a book</em>. It&#8217;s a competitive market and most books sell relatively small numbers. One reason to go with a publisher at all &#8212; especially these days &#8212; is because you get a concrete, definable amount of money fronted to you at the start; which is to say, you know you&#8217;ll get paid at <em>least</em> that much. The publisher is <em>not</em> doing you a favor by fronting you an advance; the publisher is making a hard-headed determination of how much money it will owe you (under terms of contract) and giving you that much up front so they don&#8217;t have to bother with royalties on the back end.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also &#8212; importantly &#8212; an amount of money the publisher has invested in a book, which it will not get back if the book fails. It&#8217;s the publisher&#8217;s skin in the game, as it were. If there&#8217;s no advance, there&#8217;s no skin in the game for the publisher, and no real motivation for the publisher to bust its ass on behalf of the book.</p>
<p>Neither Random House nor Bertelsmann is some hard-scrabble, scrappy company trying to make it in this big world; please look again at their revenues and net income. However, even if they were hard-scrabble, scrappy companies<em> it would still be wrong</em> not to offer advances to authors.</p>
<p>Now, according to Writer Beware, Hydra is offering to split the net it makes from the books 50/50, which on the surface at least is a better cut than what authors currently get from traditional publishers (which is typically 25% of net). No doubt this 50/50 net split is being dangled as a fair trade for an advance. But remember that by avoiding paying any advance at all Random House has <em>hugely</em> mitigated its risk &#8212; which means that it has positioned itself to start making a profit from the writer&#8217;s work from day one without any substantial financial investment on its part.</p>
<p>Theoretically the author would be making a profit from day one, too, but wait:</p>
<p><strong>2. The author is being charged costs previously borne by the publisher.</strong> That &#8220;one time&#8221; fee for editing/design plus a continual &#8220;sales, marketing and publicity fee&#8221; of 10% of the net revenue, plus additional continual printing and warehousing fees if the book ever goes to print.</p>
<p>What this means is that the author starts off his or her publishing journey<em> in the hole</em> to the publisher for an unspecified &#8220;one time&#8221; fee that publishers previously covered as part of their ordinary expenses, and see their income permanently diminished by other charges previously assumed by the publisher; the deal sheet in question states that the &#8220;50/50 split&#8221; is <em>after</em> these charges are accounted for, i.e., Random House has just made sure that the real world value of that &#8220;50/50 split&#8221; is substantially closer to the 25% of net that its traditionally-published authors are offered.</p>
<p>And how much will that &#8220;one time&#8221; fee for editing and design be? I don&#8217;t know, but I know that good editing, cover art, page and book design aren&#8217;t cheap; Donato Giancola, the artist who did the painting for the hardcover of <em>Old Man&#8217;s War</em>, got paid nearly as much for his work as I got paid to write the book. It&#8217;s not in the least unreasonable to assume that &#8220;startup costs&#8221; for a book can cost thousands of dollars. So that&#8217;s thousands of dollars that are going to be applied against the income of the writer before he or she makes dollar one &#8212; but not before <em>Random House</em> starts making money. Remember again that Random House is shunting some (and, well, possibly all) of its editorial costs over to the writer&#8217;s ledger; it&#8217;s once again actively minimizing its own costs &#8212; and investment &#8212; by maximizing the costs to the writer.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if Random House&#8217;s charges and fees <em>just somehow</em> manage to zero out an author&#8217;s earnings for a year or two and possibly even longer. It should be noted that most books sell nearly all they are going to sell within the first couple of years; after that they get lost in the pile of newer releases, including from the author. Hydra&#8217;s deal model has the marvelous potential of cutting out the economic heart of the book for the writer &#8212; but <em>not</em>, it should be noted, for the publisher, who will do just fine because its costs have been mitigated up front.</p>
<p>Musicians out there reading this may be smiling ruefully at this point, because they will recognize this sort of accounting; it&#8217;s how the music labels worked their accounting for years, carefully calibrating their fees and costs to make sure their musicians made as close to zero as possible while the labels kept all the money. But at least the musical labels paid their musicians an advance; Random House&#8217;s innovation here is that they aren&#8217;t even doing that.</p>
<p>Note to Random House: You&#8217;re aware what the typical consumer thinks of music labels at this point, right? You&#8217;re aware that one of the reasons that people don&#8217;t feel bad about pirating music is because they believe strongly that the music labels screwed the musicians anyway, so why bother? So, if your contracts are even less fair to authors than musical label contracts are to musicians, what are they going to think about <em>you</em>? And how does it look for the industry as a whole? You&#8217;re not making it easier for <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>All of this is terrible, but if you&#8217;re the writer and you sign on to this, there&#8217;s not much you can do about it because:</p>
<p><strong>3. The contract is for the length of copyright.</strong> Which means you will never get the property back to sell it to someone who will offer better terms, and apparently even subsidiary rights are covered in the deal. To use the music label metaphor once more, this is like the music label owning the master tapes of an album. And again one is left to wonder what in the last twenty years of the economic history of the music industry suggested to Random House that this would be a fine model for them to follow.</p>
<p>Again: This is on the basis of one Hydra deal sheet that Writer Beware has seen. But again: <em>Even one</em> deal sheet of such appalling excrescence is <em>one too many</em>.  If this is the economic model Random House genuinely plans to follow for the future of electronic publishing, <em>it deserves to die</em>. It&#8217;s horrible for authors, which is bad enough, but it&#8217;s also horribly bad for the industry, both in terms of optics (do consumers really need another reason to hate large publishing companies?) and in chaining publishers to a cycle of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also bad because, frankly, it&#8217;s delusional. Dear Random House: It&#8217;s clear you&#8217;re targeting new, unagented authors here because no agent who is not <em>manifestly incompetent</em> would allow his or her client to sign such a terrible contract. But here&#8217;s the thing: New authors <em>don&#8217;t actually need you to sell their work online</em>. They can do it themselves &#8212; and are, and some of them are doing quite well at it. You are working under the assumption that these newer authors are so eager to be with a &#8220;real&#8221; publisher that they will suddenly forget that publishers are no longer a bottleneck to being published, or that you are offering nothing they can&#8217;t do themselves (or have done for them) and offering them nothing for the service &#8212; indeed your business model appears predicated on sucking as much as possible from them in fees and charges while offering as little as possible in way of compensation. Hydra is a vanity publisher, in sum.</p>
<p>Do you genuinely believe these new authors are that stupid? And if so, do you genuinely want an entire imprint of your publishing empire populated by such people?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about me for a moment. Anyone who knows me knows I feel pretty positively about the traditional publishing model; I work with Tor (part of Macmillan, one of publishing&#8217;s &#8220;Big Six&#8221;) because I get excellent service from it, including brilliant editing, fantastic art and design and top-flight marketing and publicity. Tor and its people earn every penny they make from my books, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, and I&#8217;m happy to partner with them and hope to do so far into the future; I am happy to defend Tor whenever someone blithely and stupidly suggests that my publisher is &#8220;just a middleman&#8221; sucking money from me. They aren&#8217;t and they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But make no mistake that my admiration for Tor &#8212; or any of my publishers, large or small &#8212; is grounded in the fact that ours is an equitable relationship. The minute the relationship stops being equitable is the moment when the relationship is done. Because the fact of the matter is that, if it came to it, I could put out my own work; pay for the editing and art and everything else and then put all the profit into my pocket. Because this is the world we live in now. I don&#8217;t usually <em>want</em> to, for all sorts of reasons. But I could. And at this point, so can anyone.</p>
<p>And this is ultimately what I would say to any author who is considering Hydra or any publisher (large or small) who would offer a deal as fundamentally awful as what Hydra seems to be offering: Why partner with someone who doesn&#8217;t see you as a partner? The Hydra deal sheet is pretty clear about this &#8212; it&#8217;s not a contract of partners, it&#8217;s a contract a parasite offers to a host. But the fact is that if Hydra likes your stuff enough to want it, then you can probably find a <em>real</em> publisher, who offers a real partnership, including the payment of advances and the assumption of risk. Or you can publish it yourself, pay your costs up front (hey, they&#8217;re business expenses!) and keep everything you make.</p>
<p>In short: You can do better than Hydra. So do better.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> As a note to any publishing house checking to see if authors will kick if you try to slide this shit past us and say it&#8217;s &#8220;the new reality of publishing&#8221; &#8212; this is us kicking. We will kick you <em>plenty hard</em>. Yes we will.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 8:38pm:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen a contract from Alibi, Hydra&#8217;s sister imprint. It&#8217;s <em>terrible</em>. <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/03/06/a-contract-from-alibi/">See my review here</a>.</p>

<div>This project is a residence for a couple in their thirties, built in Abiko City. The client desired a gallery-like concrete-made space where their pleasure of designed furniture stands out.The location is at the bottom of two plateaus on a soft foundation. Therefore, stakes were necessary to support a reinforced concrete structure. In order to reduce costs, contacting area to the ground was minimized and the number of stakes was reduced. Accordingly, the upper structure was cantilevered. Then, the walls in varying volumes and the roof slab were made into three-dimensional continuous slanted surface and the stress transmission was rationalized, which became a characteristic form.Living/dining room on the second floor has a large open composition towards the green way so as to take in the trees planted on the south side of the site to the interior space. The haircutting space was raised for 1.2 meters from the second floor, so that people will look at the south side green way and the upper side green way and the upper side of the parking on the north side. It also controls the eyesight from the surroundings. The interior space was given a modulated proportion and scale that respond to each space’s activities.</p>
<p>The monocoque form made of concrete was inflated and squeezed, following the necessary spatial volume at the living room, cutting space and the wet area. The stiff structure enabled a sash-less detail of glass and the exterior wall aligned in the same surface and realizes the exterior that emphasizes various facets.<br />
The residence creates many senses of distance by the form that pursued the relationship of spaces and a rationality of the structure. Moreover, by the angles of the multi-surface composition the space is divided, though connected, and creates various sequences that are accompanied by sensual naturel light&#8217;s reflection and refraction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have murdered countless innocents, even children. Armies have bowed before me. I have sown genocide across worlds. Worst of all, my atrocities entertained me.</p>
<p>Of course, my horrific acts all occurred in video games, so I am about as well-adjusted as any modern twentysomething. Like most my age, the massive sum of time spent in digital worlds is a subject not to dwell upon.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of my final spring break. During elementary and high school, this would have been a week spent mostly in my pajamas with a Nintendo controller because girls were either A.) icky or later B.) not talking to me.</p>
<p>Yet sometime during my undergraduate education, video games stopped being so important to me. My murderous, virtual campaigns began to bore me.</p>
<p>Think of an ex-girlfriend that you no longer care about. Looking back, you get annoyed remembering all the times she didn&#8217;t laugh at your jokes or wasn&#8217;t sensitive about that common problem that happens to plenty of guys and is definitely not a big deal (, right?). Yet you still miss the way you felt around her.</p>
<p>My passion for video games has decreased, but I still want them to be an important part of my life. <em>Halo 4</em> was a good game, but I am nostalgic for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s24wxO94uzE" target="_blank">breaking out of Ivory Tower</a> in <em>Halo 2</em>. However, I can play <em>Halo 2</em> anytime, but I know it won&#8217;t be the same. In the words of Tim McIlrath, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MjLKjPc7q8" target="_blank">&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ve outgrown all the things that we once loved.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Why has my passion diminished? Most video games make the same mistakes:</p>
<p><strong>1. An oversaturation of violence</strong> When I was a kid, violence was cool. I wasn&#8217;t watching <em>Power Rangers</em> for the fascinating interpersonal dynamics; I watched to see the Rangers beat up on poorly costumed bad guys (and to see the Pink Ranger). My fondness for violence only increased when playing with guns and blood in <em>Quake</em>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s an upper limit to the violence after which you just become desensitized. After <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS6U7pTrvs" target="_blank">gouging out Poseidon&#8217;s eyes</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJqbQ7wVZ58" target="_blank">destroying a planet-sized monster</a>, who cares about blowing soldiers&#8217; heads off.</p>
<p>Plus, a large part of my enjoyment was its taboo nature. At the time, you wanted to be the kid whose parents let him watch <em>South Park</em> at age 6, but looking back, playing <em>GTA3</em> was sweetened because you had to to convince your mom that the game wasn&#8217;t that violent and was very respectful towards women. This parental interest about what you watch and play ends sometime during your early teens when drugs and sex become more pressing concerns than arrangements of pixels.</p>
<p><strong>2. A disrespect of my time </strong>I am a pretty lazy guy. Most of my friends are either in grad school or working at engineering firms. As a fifth year philosophy student, my schedule is probably not as hectic as most other adults. So if I can&#8217;t find time to play most games, how the hell can anyone else?</p>
<p>RPGs are the worst offender. If I only have a few hours a week to play, an 80 hr experience can easily stretch over a few months. My interest in the plot simply cannot be sustained for that long.</p>
<p>This problem extends to more than just the sum of all playtime. Too many games require a large investment of time before I can even be sucked into a game and see some noticeable progress.</p>
<p>Too frequently, my use case with many RPGs is:<br />
1. Listen to some dialogue to find out I need The Item in another town.<br />
2. Start heading towards that town.<br />
3. Fight wolves.<br />
4. Fight more wolves.<br />
5. Realize I am heading in the wrong direction.<br />
6. Fight giant rat.<br />
7. Drop some loot from my full inventory.<br />
8. Fight wolves again.<br />
9. Arrive at town.<br />
10. Listen to more dialogue to discover that The Item is somewhere else.</p>
<p>15 minutes in, my dog will decide now is a perfect time to demand a walk. I&#8217;ll shut off the console, take Kiva out, realize I accomplished nothing, and put the game aside until tomorrow.</p>

<p>As limited as mobile games like Temple Run are, at least I get a full experience playing them while on the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>3. A meaningless virtual adventure</strong> This is the most fundamental problem of the three. Too many games rely on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth">monomyth</a>, where a young hero heads out on an adventure to save the world and improve themselves along the way. This trope brings grandiosity and a sense of importance to games, but once you reach adulthood in real life, the virtual monomyth becomes hollow.</p>
<p>When you are in high school, it is hard to realize that you&#8217;re imprisoned in a fake life. Paul Graham, partner at Y Combinator, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html" target="_blank">explains it best</a>, &#8220;Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they&#8217;d like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you&#8217;re very docile compared to adults&#8230;Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time&#8230;If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they&#8217;d do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.&#8221; Your actions and responsibilities are limited until age 18.</p>
<p>But once you hit adulthood, you are free to go on any adventure. Although the idea may seem distant, improving the world is a real goal you can fight for. Bill Gates does it every day. But adventures can also be personal. Visit Spain. Write a novel. Get the girl.</p>
<p>Real adventures trump virtual ones. This holds true at both a macro and micro level. Why climb Death Mountain when you can climb Mount Kilimanjaro? Why grind mobs to increase my level when I can grind at the gym to lose weight? While your virtual goals are normally easier to achieve, your real ones have more importance.</p>
<p>For this reason, games aimed at adults cannot rely so heavily on a sense of adventure to impart meaning to the player. Of course, real world responsibilities hinder our chances to work on real goals, so video games can fill a need for accomplishment quite easily. But games need to expand beyond this.</p>
<p>Video games are interesting because anything can happen inside their world. Physics and logic are the programmer&#8217;s plaything. The goal of a game should be to provide a unique experience not possible in any other medium.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve been drawn to mostly indie games recently. So many of them let me do something new, something I have never experienced.</p>
<p>As such, I have created this site to talk about all the indie games I am playing. Upcoming posts will be in-depth discussions on a single game. You can call them reviews. You can call them criticism. You can call them rants or ramblings.</p>
<p>But two major guidelines will instruct my writing.</p>
<p><strong>1. No scores</strong>, hence the name of this site. If you can&#8217;t tell how much I like a game by only skimming the post, then that&#8217;s a problem with my writing ability. Dumbing down my thoughts to a single number is disrespectful to you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t read my reviews before playing the game.</strong> Most game reviews help you decide whether to purchase the product. In that case, telling you about the details about the graphics and game mechanics makes sense.</p>
<p>But that does not interest me. I want to talk about the higher-level concepts a game addresses. The themes that stay with you are more important than when the FPS lags.</p>
<p>If you agree with my philosophy, stick around. My first substantive post will be coming soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://silverfysh.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img-20130108-01050.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6905" alt="IMG-20130108-01050" src="http://silverfysh.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img-20130108-01050.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(Or: A manifesto on the short story as form, despite my own misgivings)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There’s been a lot of hullaballoo around the interwebz about the state of the short story. Curiously and gratifyingly, the two more famous ones—the <i>New York Times</i>’ <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Good Fit for Today’s Little Screens: Short Stories, by Leslie Kaufman | The New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/books/a-good-fit-for-small-screens-short-stories-are-selling.html?_r=0" target="_blank">rah-rah for the form</a></span> that set my Twitter feed abuzz a week ago, and Laura Miller’s (recent) <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Sorry, the short story boom is bogus, by Laura Miller | Salon.com" href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/21/sorry_the_short_story_boom_is_bogus/" target="_blank">scathingly condescending retort</a></span>—don’t offer anything about short fiction’s death, or non-death. Both are about the form’s popularity among a reading public that, by habit and/or taste, tends to overlook it. (I guess this is a good thing, as we hear enough of that kind of twaddle about the novel—undoubtedly, it seems, the short story’s much cooler older brother. It’s twaddle that, I think, just distracts us from actual reading.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, fine, yay, the short story’s not dead. Then again, it’s never been dead. It’s been neglected, it’s been laughed at, it’s been coddled and tolerated—most of the time it’s been passed over because, to quote many a reader, “Short stories are just not my thing.” Shrug. Occasionally, short fiction shines beyond its little conclave of devotees—and the outside world begrudgingly accepts these samples, as an established city might open its gates to seeming barbarians. And the acceptance is always <i>despite</i> the form: <i>Oh, look at this amazing piece of literature, and it’s short fiction!</i> Shrug, again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the short story has never gone away—mostly because, I think, no one’s bothered to organically initiate a lynching—which means it can’t contrive the comeback that will knock our socks off. (The flashiness thing, just not its style, man.) And it will never go away, because what short stories are very good at is simply existing, despite not having the Life—the humanity-saving gravitas—assigned so capriciously to the Novel. The short story <i>is</i>, because most of the time people leave it be. And it’s fucking thrived anyway. (An argument, I’m the first to point out, could be made for literature in general.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway. <a title="Nash Tysmans @ WordPress" href="http://toynbeeconvector.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">My friend Nash</span></a> and I were talking about this earlier today, in exasperated whispers in a crazy-and-crazier workplace, as I rather uncharacteristically offered my two cents about the ruckus on my schizophrenic Twitter account [samples: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="@sashasilverfysh - Sasha Martinez on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sashasilverfysh/status/304412021951184898" target="_blank">01</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="@sashasilverfysh - Sasha Martinez on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sashasilverfysh/status/304440975093293057" target="_blank">02</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="@sashasilverfysh - Sasha Martinez on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sashasilverfysh/status/304591622128156672" target="_blank">03</a></span>]. And in that pocket of sanity Nash and I made for ourselves, I articulated something that I suppose I’ve figured out for myself long ago—one I suppose I can only draw out now because I’m both so fucking <i>frustrated</i> and <i>fangirly-thrilled </i>that we’re even getting our panties in a bunch. Over the short story—of all things to mind! (The grizzled short story is blinking its eyes against the glare of the spotlight: “What the hell are you looking this way for?” it asks, whilst trying so very hard not to smooth down its cowlick.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basically: What marks the short story as a form, as a tradition, is its inherent strangeness—which has translated, over the years, into sheer uncoolness. The short story has never, and will not likely ever, reach the exalted status of the Novel—which, at least, provokes those aforementioned nauseating conversations about its mortality. (Not to mention the badge of honor it’s shaped itself into being; why doesn’t anyone ever reach for <i>The Great [Country of Origin] Short Story</i>?]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We’ve looked toward the short story as the runt trying to play grown up, and halfheartedly at that—only at the insistence of the people who admire it, write it, or need to sell it. It’s just not cool, and it’s difficult to boot. The worse ones feel even more of an affront than bad novels—at least the latter have the grace to give us meat. The best ones sap us of response: All that emotion, all that effort, into so condensed and concentrated a package—<i>Why the hell didn’t I read a novel instead?</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The short story is something that even seasoned readers are loathe to poke, as though they sense that the form has never figured itself out beyond the boundaries it has set for itself. Poor thing. And lord, don’t even get them started on the average-of-ten-headed-hydra that is the short story collection or anthology. Off the top of my head: There are good parts in novels/novellas—but in collections, there are bad stories, and there may be worse scenes in each. With collections, you have to consider unevenness—you have to consider discreteness and unity at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A side note: Undoubtedly, to my mind, the form bears a pathetic existence compared to the novella, whose length—whose matter-of-fact awkwardness—gives it a charm with which to pull people in. The novella has the sensibilities of the short story, but the expansiveness of the novel. Or the other way around. Or it’s a long short story, or a very slim novel. The novella, basically, tricks us by straddling two made-finite-by-tradition forms. It’s the best of both worlds. Well done, novella, four for you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, approaching the short story—reading it, writing it, seeing it in a bookstore and wondering if one should buy it—requires a specialized sensibility. One that takes into account length, degree of expansiveness or concentration, its standing amid a pre-packaged collective, and the fact that it’s not a novel. What the hell do you <i>do</i> with a short story anyway? (The answer, forevermore in Sasha Land: You deal with it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another question I pose to The Great Literary Tradition: Where we ever comfortable talking about a single short story as one would talk about a novel or a novella or a poem? I suppose marketing has a hand in this: Who sells individual short stories? Give the public some heft, by Jove. But how would the greater discourse be if we figure this out? Lots of blogs out there dissect short fiction piecemeal, and rightly so. Maybe we’re wrong to be critical of short stories lumped together. Maybe we should just hold them up against the light, one by one, with the care, energy, and attention they demand.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in that parenthetical, I suppose, is why I’m mad about short stories. I mean, what I love about the form is precisely what constrains it: Its specificity, and the care it insists on drawing from both the writer who writes it and the reader who reads it, thinking, “What the hell did I get myself into and why is it so satisfying?” It’s an intellectual and emotional challenge for both roles. It’s something to admire. It manages to sprawl through careful distillation and painstakingly administered revelations; it succeeds by navigating through the morass that is language, by employing the narrative-as-ethics of the essay, by caring for the character as deeply (and sometimes, in a better, more clever way) as the novel which has built itself up by its raison d’être of championing humanity despite the occasional foibles that can make humanity so sucky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its range, its hair-tearing range, despite the little-engine-that-could character that’s been pushed toward it (one that I know I’m doing, too, in this post that’s gotten way out of hand)! There are tricksters like Lydia Davis, who type up an elaborate sentence as a title and an add-on phrase as the text body itself. There are the gruff macho men that startle you with tenderness, as with Raymond Carver and Richard Yates. There are the doyennes, whom one can imagine to calmly sip tea at their porches as they excruciatingly yet gracefully cram whole lifetimes into twenty-pagers—like Alice Munro, who else? There are the girls with the chip on their shoulders, like Lorrie Moore; there are those who dissent either through twee-poignancy or false bravado, like Miranda July or Joan Silber or Simon Van Booy (this seems to be in vogue these days). There are the short story writers no one reads—like Harold Brodkey or Wilfrido Nolledo. And then there’s Chekhov. (Hah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And yet, what I can hate about the form is precisely that specialized sensibility it will always demand from me. I am, for example, a reader who prefers to polish off books in one sitting, a reader who wants to be devoured by sweeping tales or the emotional grip of volume and heft. And I am an impatient reader—and contrary to how the short story’s been touted for our ilk: Having me sit down with something, only to know that it will end too soon, sends alarms of deep and abiding frustration within me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yeah, I’m a confused duck. That I’m reading short stories at all—that I can pledge by them—is probably enough of an indication. But fuck me, right, short fiction? (Short fiction grumbles in response; it’s getting grumpy. It does that, in my head, especially when it sees that I’ve tangled myself in circular arguments. Right now, it’s barking at me to <i>git</i> and get off its goddamned property.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thing is, children: The short story will persist, and our attitude toward it will endure. The novel may die, resurge, die again, get resurrected endlessly by its legion detractors and champions; the essay will toy with medium and length and preoccupation and ethical standards; the novella will always be the special little snowflake it’s grown comfortably into; poetry will keep curdling our blood with its beauty, its inscrutability, and its conceit that it’s the best form for thought-and-soul that ever will be. And the short story will be in a corner, nursing a warmed beer, brooding over an overflowing ashtray, trying so obviously and awkwardly not to meet anyone’s eye for fear that it might seem too needy—and it’ll be there in that complicated metaphor of a corner <i>forever</i>. And, kids—we’ll all just have to deal with it.</p>
