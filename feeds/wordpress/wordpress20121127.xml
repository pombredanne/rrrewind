				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Stop talking  banalities.</strong> Especially the ones with long art theory words in them. Please.</em></p>
<p>I could read it in his eyes, framed in the very polite frown that people put on their faces when they want to be seen focused and &#8220;with you&#8221;.  He was a friend of mine I&#8217;d decided to introduce to the scratched worlds of Gerhard Richter at Tate Modern.</p>
<p>I was talking about composition, saying something like &#8220;in a great painting, composition is the key to understand the meaning of the story the artist wanted to tell&#8221;.</p>
<p>I admit, it is a phrase void of any practical meaning until applied to a real painting. Like what I did in the <a title="Whatcha lookin’ at?" href="http://artmoscow.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/whatcha-lookin-at/">previous post</a> on  a Van Gogh&#8217;s landscape. But you don&#8217;t have a Van Gogh painting whenever you need it. As with many things in life, when you need it most, it&#8217;s not there.</p>
<p>So, I thought of an object-based lesson right there, on the spot.</p>
<p>The lesson involved three meanings that a picture of London taken from the second floor of Tate should be sending across to a potential viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1. Take a &#8220;touristic&#8221; photo, saying</strong> <strong>I&#8217;ve been to London.</strong></p>
<p>Easy. Most interesting shapes, forms, scenes in the middle, not too much of the sky, not to much of the river, with the usual instinct to get everything, including both banks of the Thames,  into a single picture.  You don&#8217;t have to think to take it, it just comes out on its own.<br />
<img title="" alt="" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5902/bizart495.0/0_3e6e6_831a1480_-2-L.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Task 2. London is a spiritual city. </strong></p>
<p>Merchants, city bankers, embankment restaurants, the bustle of the megapolice life rhymed by the cupolas and spires of churches and cathedrals. Voilà! We don&#8217;t show the river, we show the skies, the spires, and the city.</p>
<p><img title="" alt="" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5206/bizart495.0/0_3e6e7_d8c08bb7_-1-L.jpg" height="343" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Task 3. London is a city which history is linked to the river. </strong></p>
<p>Ok, forget the skies, focus on the river and wait until a couple of ships sail into the frame, preferably in the opposite directions.<br />
<img title="" alt="" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5701/bizart495.0/0_3e6e8_cf136ff7_L.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t wait for the ships, we imagined them.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4. Take a picture that will have a human dimension</strong>, what the newspapers call &#8220;a human story&#8221;. A human story in London. I was surprised that my tired friend came up with a solution in a few seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6517/98708185.13/0_8e366_e6c74d39_XL.jpg" height="720" width="536" /></p>
<p>Very lonely art lover who is in love with Tate. She&#8217;s not happy, methinks. She wants to be there in the city, mingle with the crowd, meet someone who is not Tate! But she&#8217;s stuck. She is afraid to cross the rubicon of the Thames in search of a new life.</p>
<p>I find his story madly romantic. For all I know, the lady in the picture could be  a happy mom of two. But what matters, is that he learned how &#8220;composition becomes the key to the meaning&#8221;.</p>
<p>Next time you happen to be at a spot from which everyone is taking pictures as if the view is bound to stop existing tomorrow &#8211; think about three different meanings, and change the composition to accomodate each of them.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a game best played by two. If it is your boyfriend or girlfriend &#8211; I promise the romantic returns of immesurable worth. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Confession: when I started this post, it was going to be funny. Nothing earth-shattering. You wouldn&#8217;t have spit out your lunch. You wouldn&#8217;t have peed your pants. You might not even have laughed out loud. But it was to be typical <em>the</em> <i>book</i> <i>of</i> <i>alice</i> fare.</p>
<p>As I was getting ready for work Tuesday morning, Alice looked at me and said, <span style="color:#008080;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very pretty.&#8221;</span> I was creating an opening and coming up with the perfect one-liner to close the post when I decided that wasn&#8217;t the post I wanted to write today.</p>
<p>You all know that story that has been making the rounds?  The one about mothers telling our daughters we are beautiful? It is every bit as amazing as folks are saying. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to read it, then you can check it out <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-king/telling-daughters-i-am-beautiful_b_2166212.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003">here</a>. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-king/">Amanda King</a> writes poignantly and with truth that lies in the depths of every mother&#8217;s soul.</p>
<p>Even in its general amazingness, I can&#8217;t subscribe to her thesis wholesale. Why? It is complicated.</p>
<p>For one thing, I don&#8217;t want physical beauty to be a priority for Alice. I get that Amanda King wasn&#8217;t saying that. I get that she is facing the reality of being female in this world where beauty is prized. And I get that she clearly has her priorities straight with regard to raising strong, thoughtful daughters.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alice&#8217;s age has something to do with it. She is young enough that I prefer her to use &#8220;beautiful&#8221; as an adjective to modify sunset, or song, or flower. A beautiful story. A beautiful painting. But not a face. I don&#8217;t want her worrying about that at four years old. Not yet.</p>
<p>Another reason? I am beautiful. Not crazy beautiful. Not model beautiful. Not breathtaking. But pretty enough that I don&#8217;t spend time worrying about it. And do you know what? It just isn&#8217;t that big of a deal. It is a convenience. A free pass. A smile and a held door once a month or so that might not otherwise be held. It might not be fair, but it is reality. Which is why it doesn&#8217;t define me.</p>
<p>The &#8220;me&#8221; I want Alice to identify when she thinks of me during her childhood is the one who is strong, loving, and smart. Maybe even sort of funny. An occasional pain in the ass and an irrational stickler when it comes to her dinner table behavior. A mother who would never raise a hand to her, and who apologized when she raised her voice (unless, of course, Alice totally deserved a grouchy mama due to her general stinkeriness at that given moment). I want her to recall her mother as fun and passionate, if flawed. And a mother who loved the shit out of her.</p>
<p>But beautiful? My soul, I should hope. My shell, I&#8217;m less concerned with. And I hope upon hope that she judges herself by that same standard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late into the night of my 28th birthday, I was doing a passable impression of a dancing fool. It was almost four in the morning, I had consumed enough alcohol to administer local anesthetic to a small platoon of foot soldiers, and I was blithely unaware of impending danger. But there it was, in the shape of a hurtling body that belonged to a friend of mine, and which mysteriously, after traversing the length and breadth of the living room in whose corner I was safely dancing, placed itself in a load-bearing position on my right ankle.  When bodies had been moved, I found a rather large protuberance where my ankle used to be. Ice, an emergency room visit, crutches, in that order. And the end of my running career.</p>
<p>Before my right ankle suffered that disastrous third-degree sprain, I used to run. Respectably long distances in Central Park, with an eye on completing the New York Marathon someday. My longest run was eleven miles (2 laps of the <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/reservoir/reservoir.html">reservoir</a>, <a href="http://www.centralpark2000.com/cp-runners-map.pdf">one loop of the park</a>, and then another lap of the reservoir); my usual run was a morning six-miler, the classic loop of Central Park. I ran in summer afternoons and winter mornings alike; I ran in the rain and I ran in the snow. (My late winter evening runs through Central Park in the winters, when I could see the lights come on in the buildings that line Central Park West and the Museum Mile were as enchanting as anything else I have experienced in this great city.) I ran with professors and graduate students; I ran with roommates. Running made my financial insolvency easier to bear; it provided easy entertainment on days and evenings that sought diversion. (One summer, with my impecunious condition  making it ever harder to indulge in even the occasional beer or large meal, my running transformed me into a whippet-like creature, with sunken cheeks that enabled a resemblance to a prisoner of war at a not-particularly salubrious holding facility.)  I was never a particularly graceful runner but on a good day, I always felt like I glided through Central Park&#8217;s beauty, experiencing it in a way that was distinct from my interactions enabled by riding on a bike or by walking.  Running was yet another way to discover New York City, a physically and mentally transformative one.</p>
<p>But a busted ankle that made my right side unstable, and which necessitated the wearing of orthotics (to this day), coupled with sloppy execution of a rehabilitation program, meant that this running was first curtailed and then slowly choked off. I injured myself a year later, when I returned to running a few months later, and then again several years later when I tried again. I became nervous and tentative, and grew hesitant about lacing up a pair of running shoes. My running is now restricted to the occasional lap of Prospect Park, to attempts to run fast 5Ks.</p>
<p>Those occasional laps still manage, effortlessly, to transport me, even if only for much shorter periods, to those days when muscle-powered locomotion at eight miles an hour was mysteriously capable of inducing states of physical and meditative bliss.</p>

<p><a href="http://misfortuneofknowing.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-forgetting-river_cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2081" title="The Forgetting River_Cover" alt="" src="http://misfortuneofknowing.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-forgetting-river_cover.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" height="150" width="99" /></a>In her memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Forgetting-River-Survival-Inquisition/dp/1594487391/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353854009&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Forgetting+River"><em>The Forgetting River: A Modern Tale of Survival, Identity, and the Inquisition</em></a>, journalist <a href="http://www.doreencarvajal.com/About1.html">Doreen Carvajal</a> describes her journey to uncover her Catholic family’s Jewish roots that were long buried as a result of persecution during the Spanish Inquisition.  It is an engaging read, one that is well-suited for anyone interested in genealogical research or Spanish or Jewish history. Her analysis of the silent survival of Sephardic Jewish cultural traditions, even while <em>converso</em> families “proved” their Catholic allegiance by attending mass and tolerating pork, was especially fascinating.</p>
<p>My only complaints are the memoir’s incongruous structure that repeatedly jumps time and geographic location and the inclusion of what felt like distracting, irrelevant material to an outsider joining Carvajal on her journey of self-discovery.  Chapter 19, which takes place in Brussels in 2010 while the majority of the story features Spain, is particularly puzzling, both in its weak connection to the family history at the heart of this memoir and in its details about the outrageous lengths to which Carvajal went as a reporter to stalk a silent victim of clergy sexual abuse (apparently, she wanted “to understand why there was silence for so long” — even though the reasons “why” are rather obvious to anyone familiar with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718961">social science on the subject</a>; it may be interesting to know the specifics of a case, but if the survivor doesn&#8217;t respond to your efforts to find him, leave him alone).</p>
<p>A few chapters later, returning to Spain and jumping to August 2011, Carvajal ends her pursuit for clarity on her family’s history with many questions about her distant past answered, enough to solidify her understanding of her family’s origins.  Like any genealogical mystery, though, one solved through oral histories and funeral prayer cards, it seems the highest level of certainty is “more likely than not,” not “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Many of us crave to unravel our family’s mysteries, myself included, and I have often wondered why the answers to these questions are important.  Could learning about our historical background change who we are today?  Does any of it matter, or is genealogy merely another form of self-indulgent entertainment?</p>
<p>In my case, my maternal side is Sri Lankan Moor, and the oral history suggests we have distant roots in Yemen, while my father’s side is Irish, Sioux, and Basque, with a DNA test substantiating portions of my family’s tale and other pieces of evidence supporting the rest (such as Census data, pictures, and multiple sources for the oral history).  I wonder sometimes whether it would matter if I suddenly learned, possibly through a DNA test, that we hail from a different area of the world, perhaps through a later migration from Africa, East Asia, or Eastern Europe?  To some extent, the knowledge could matter in a concrete way, as some diseases are inherited and concentrated in certain ethnic populations.  Otherwise, how such a “surprise” would change how I perceive myself and my affinity with others is an open question.  It feels like these genealogical surprises <em>do</em> matter on some level, but for reasons I cannot articulate.</p>
<p>If there is a lesson in genealogical research, it is how interconnected we are to one another.  It is part of what makes the ongoing distrust of Jews in Spain, which Carvajal describes aptly, so absurd, given that Jewish and Muslim blood pulses quietly through the veins of a large percentage of the Catholic population.  Each of us is much more than what we see on the surface, the result of thousands of years of procreation, migrations, plagues, and war among groups that are more closely related than anyone ever admits.  Knowledge of this common heritage should inspire tolerance, but the level of prejudice in the world today suggests that this lesson either remains a secret or is less persuasive than I would have hoped.</p>

<p>Black Friday is here once again.  H and I made our annual Black Friday pilgrimage.</p>
<div id="attachment_2532" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 437px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-168.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2532 " title="black-friday-2012-168" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-168.jpg?w=427&#038;h=569" height="569" width="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We looked for a parking place, like forever.</p></div>
<p>The lines were long and epic</p>
<div id="attachment_2534" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 498px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-170-version-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2534 " title="black-friday-2012-170-version-2" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-170-version-2.jpg?w=488&#038;h=366" height="366" width="488" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Black Friday shopping traffic was unbelievable</p></div>
<p>The roads were packed with holiday traffic, and we had to park <strong>miles</strong> away from the mall.</p>
<div id="attachment_2533" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-169.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2533" title="black-friday-2012-169" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-169.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">OMG, We had to park, like MILES from the mall&#8230;</p></div>
<p>We scored a great deal on some sunshine (80% off, Woohoo!).  I trampled some people to get a screaming deal on some Fresh Air (it was practically free at $00.00).  We also got a HUGE box of endorphins for all our friends <em>and</em> all the loyal readers of this blog.</p>
<div id="attachment_2537" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 498px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-173.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2537 " title="black-friday-2012-173" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-173.jpg?w=488&#038;h=650" height="650" width="488" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">H jams over to the food court for some mall pizza</p></div>
<p>It was not all fun.  We had to climb to the 200th floor of the mall for some Sweeping Views.  Then we went screaming down to the lobby, only to hammer back up 160 floors for some Burning Quads.</p>
<div id="attachment_2536" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 498px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-172.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2536 " title="black-friday-2012-172" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-172.jpg?w=488&#038;h=366" height="366" width="488" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">H nears the 200th floor of the mall. Phew!</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2550" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-181.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2550" title="black-friday-2012-181" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-181.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The parking lots were absolutely packed</p></div>
<p>All things considered, it was a successful Black Friday.  We spent $000.00 and arrived home tired and hungry.</p>
<div id="attachment_2549" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 437px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-180.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2549 " title="black-friday-2012-180" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-180.jpg?w=427&#038;h=320" height="320" width="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The mall was so packed, we felt like cattle.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-179.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2543" title="black-friday-2012-179" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-179.jpg?w=300&#038;h=186" height="186" width="300" /></a>Pretty pictures aside, there is a message to this post.  As I write this, there are probably 1,000 anti-Christmas consumer rants being madly typed out on WordPress.</p>
<p>This is a blog about outdoor adventures large and small, finding peace and joy in nature, and the reward of outdoor sports.  Christmas is a strange thing.  It&#8217;s like a switch that turns on in mid-November.  All of a sudden, there are gazillions of messages offering eternal happiness and Christmas cheer if you just buy more stuff.  Shopping is fun, right?  What could be more fun than getting to the mall at 6am, and fighting traffic and crowds to save $20 on a widget?</p>
<p>Advertising is both subtle and insidious.  It equates buying stuff with happiness.  Buy <em>this</em> and your kids will love you.  Buy <em>that</em> and you&#8217;ll be a chick/dude magnet.  Show how <em>unique</em> and <em>sophisticated</em> you are with prominent labels on your clothing.  Somehow our self worth has become entwined with what you buy or what brand you wear, <em>rather</em> than what you do.  The message of &#8220;<em>Buy More Stuff</em>&#8221; reaches tens of millions of Americans who flock to the malls on Black Friday.  The reality is that a day outdoors with your family or friends creates memories that will live on long after Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-177.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2541" title="black-friday-2012-177" alt="" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/black-friday-2012-177.jpg?w=488&#038;h=650" height="650" width="488" /></a></p>
<p>As we march toward winter solstice and winter holidays (whatever you celebrate), days are short and daylight hours valuable.  My message is twofold and simple-</p>
<h3>Life is about DOING stuff, <em>not</em> stuff.</h3>
<p><em>and</em></p>
<h3>When you look back at your life in your elder years, you&#8217;ll never wish you spent more time at the mall.</h3>
<p>So get out there.  Use your days for awesome adventures.  Use your nights for online shopping (if  you must), in the comfort of your home, in your pajamas, with the beverage of your choice, as you plan your next outdoor adventure&#8230;</p>
<p>Note:  The photos taken in this post are from on Mt. Tamalpais and at Nicasio Reservoir- Marin County, CA.  And yes they were taken on Black Friday.</p>
<p>See you on the trail&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update-  </strong>Just received notification that I&#8217;ve been selected for <a title="Freshly Pressed" href="http://wordpress.com/#!/fresh/" target="_blank">Freshly Pressed</a> for the second time.  I&#8217;m humbled, yet again.  For those new to the TahoeSux blog, it&#8217;s about celebrating a love of outdoor adventure through running, hiking, skiing, biking, surfing, stand up paddleboarding, mountain life, pretty pictures, and just being outdoors.  We are committed to original content and only post our own words and pictures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How on earth (no pun intended) did you manage to invent an entire island?</p>
<p><a href="http://elliemort.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342" title="Somewhere that does exist" alt="" src="http://elliemort.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/map.jpg?w=590&#038;h=443" height="443" width="590" /></a></p>
<p>Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but you have ridiculously powerful satellites that can take pictures of things from space. They can see the Great Wall of China from hundreds of miles up, they&#8217;re that powerful. They can probably even see me waving to them now if they squint hard enough.</p>
<p>So if a satellite can see the earth in that much detail from so far away, how did you not notice this island isn&#8217;t actually there? It was named and everything &#8211; Sandy Island. So I assume it also had a capital, and a flag, and a GDP, and all the other &#8220;official&#8221; stuff that comes with being an actual place.</p>
<p>And if it was named, people must have been living on it, too &#8211; where did they go? Did they emigrate when times got tough? (On second thought they probably came to Britain &#8211; everyone else bloody well does.) It must have had animals too &#8211; maybe a species of gibbon previously unknown to the human race, with cancer curing properties? Did they think of that?</p>
<p>A Google spokesman told the BBC (you can see for yourself <a title="The real deal" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20442487" target="_blank">here</a>) that &#8220;the world is a constantly changing place, and keeping on top of these changes is a never-ending endeavour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apart from obviously being a fan of tongue twisters, this guy must not know what a day&#8217;s hard graft looks like. According to some very reliable scientific research (a Google search &#8211; they are useful for something), the continental plates move at around 1cm per year.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not going to be totally dense here. I&#8217;m imagining that small islands (the one in question seems to be around 25 miles long &#8211; OK, small in comparison) move faster than that, say 2cm or 3cm per year. That&#8217;s still not much. You&#8217;d have to be seriously lazy to miss it.</p>
<p>Even if you left it 50 years before going back to check it&#8217;s still there, it&#8217;s only going to have moved about a metre. I imagine the resulting conversation would go something like, &#8220;Shit &#8211; that island we thought was here isn&#8217;t here!&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Oh, wait &#8211; it&#8217;s over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are only four possible reasons I see for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>The island is wearing an invisibility cloak.</li>
<li>The people who went looking for it had had a few too many cans of Fosters (yes, they were Australian. Yes, I am stereotyping.)</li>
<li>The island sank, and is now known as &#8216;Sandy Atlantis&#8217; to the locals, who have developed gills.</li>
<li>The people who &#8220;discovered&#8221; it in the first place had had a few too many of whatever their national alcoholic beverage is.</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to hearing your own suggestions/excuses.</p>
<p>Much love, not too much admiration</p>
<p>Ellie</p>

		<description><![CDATA[‘Some people will always tell you that what you are trying to accomplish is impossible; those people have no idea what they’re talking about.’- Frosty Heeson 
<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=2839&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/c7ae68805af1193525566aed721d1123_l.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2841" style="width:361px;height:296px;" title="c7ae68805af1193525566aed721d1123_L" alt="" src="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/c7ae68805af1193525566aed721d1123_l.jpg?w=345&#038;h=279" height="279" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>‘Some people will always tell you that what you are trying to accomplish is impossible; those people have no idea what they’re talking about,’ says Frosty Hesson, surf legend and first-time author of <em>Making Mavericks.</em><br />
<a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mavericks-final-hires.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As well as the book – co-authored by Frosty Hesson alongside Ian Spiegelman, Rick Hesson – a film titled <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1629757/"><em>Chasing Mavericks</em></a> has just been released. It tells the life story of the surfing legend Frosty, played by Gerard Butler and his mentorship with Jay Moriarty, played by Johnny Weston, a then budding 12-year-old surfing novice who, like many surfers, planted their boards in the surf of Northern California’s’ Half Moon Bay, with an appetite for the towering waves of the notorious surf-spot ‘Mavericks’.</p>
<p><a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mavericks-final-hires2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2850 alignleft" title="Print" alt="" src="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mavericks-final-hires2.jpg?w=128&#038;h=154" height="154" width="128" /></a></p>
<p>In 1990s, Jay approached Frosty to train him to surf one of the most behemoth waves on Earth, the legendary Mavericks surf break near his home in Santa Cruz. It was Jay’s audacity that propelled Frosty to mentor him. Through his coaching, not only was a friendship created but raw courage and life lessons such as the importance of not letting the fear of others affect one’s success, were breathed into the heart of Jay, who became notorious for being one of the youngest, at only 16 to brave the 40ft waves of Mavericks.</p>
<p>Since the young age of three Frosty, who was nicknamed that for his white as snow hair, was not only destined to do great things on land but also in the sea. It was growing up by the bay in San Francisco in the 1950’s that began Frosty’s connection with the ocean. ‘My parents were concerned because I had no fear of water.’</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just Frosty’s determination and loving relationship with water that made him a phenomenal surfer, but his ability from young to observe the world and to take lessons from every opportunity and every aspect of wonderment that he came across. He overcame the hardships of an at times tumultuous childhood burdened with financial troubles and riddled with a hard-drinking father and a chronically ill mother.</p>
<p>Despite the adversities, the welcoming nature to others his parents created in the home along with his passion to help others, enriched his life and pushed him forwards towards a life spent surfing on the beach, chilling in his van and mentoring others in the value of not only being great surfers but great purpose-filled people who believing that anything and everything is possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2294891981_0279174e98.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2844" title="2294891981_0279174e98" alt="" src="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2294891981_0279174e98.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" height="199" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>‘No one can live out someone else’s vision; it had to come from within you,’ he says in his book. He goes on to explain where the basis of his attitude about life came from by telling the story of the summer his parents took him and his siblings to the Mohave Desert where they came across an abandoned mining town from the 1800’s called Calico. In that ghost town one of the miners had built a house out of brown, green and clear wine bottles and mortar. Upon walking in, Frosty describes the impression it had on him to see the majesty that someone could build up from what others may have considered disposable. ‘It was just four walls and a brownish-gray weathered door, the grain raised from all the moisture being sucked from the wood by the heat, but when I stood staring through those walls long enough, they became the stained glass window of a church, and they became a kaleidoscope.’ It was in this moment that Frosty developed an understanding that life is all about which angle you look at it from saying, ‘Just because you don’t see what everybody sees it doesn’t invalidate your view.’<br />
<a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/215.jpg"></a><a href="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/fmp-chasing-mavericks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2856" title="fmp-chasing-mavericks" alt="" src="http://lovsnmua.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/fmp-chasing-mavericks.jpg?w=300&#038;h=185" height="185" width="300" /></a><br />
It was at Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay, California on December 19th, 1994 where Jay Moriarty paddled out to meet a 40fth wave, the biggest wave of the morning. Upon rising to his feet, the wind pushed his surfboard into the air and dropped him down five stories into the ocean which sucked him 40 feet underwater and while many thought he was dead, he walked away becoming an iconic surf star. Sadly, Jay’s life was cut short at the tender age of 21, when he drowned while free diving.</p>
<p>While Frosty may appear as a superhero, with a book and a film about himself and his experiences, at the end of the day, he is just a kind-hearted fellow human who stands as a role model for the enduring spirit and willingness to give, in order see others shine with great purpose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today goal was to arrive via a scenic bike trail in Queenstown. We first had to continue a short 20 km stretch next to the busy road before passing through Gibson: one of New Zealand’s hot spots for wineries. It was beautiful cycling next to the vineyards and it both reminded us of the South of France. The density of the camper vans increased as we neared one of the most famous adventure centers in the world. As a break we took a quick look at a bungi jumper that was jumping from a 50 m bridge. From that moment on we followed a ‘bikers and walkers’ only path throught the mountains. We visited an old and cozy little town called Arrowtown and continued for 70 km on this trail. A must do for anyone visiting Queenstown and a big thank you to the government of NZ for creating this wonderful trail.</p>

<p>Since the road to Milford Sounds and the west coast is very busy and to give our legs some rest, we will rent a car for 5 days and combine it with hikes to explore this region. We did not book anything in advance and were surprised to hear one of the Hertz representatives say that all cars were booked. Luckily we got a good deal with Apex for a car that would fit the bikes and would allow return to Greymouth (570 km north of Queenstown). Couscous with a delicious thai sauce in the center of Queenstown was a great way to end the day. Another 10 km of cycling in the sunset brought us to another hidden campsite near queenstown.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to be one of those people who honestly thought and held the perception that white-skinned Caucasians were the ultimate epitome of beauty.</p>
<p>That is, when I was living in South East Asia, I genuinely regarded Caucasians and people with fair skin and blue eyes as physically attractive, thinking “whiteness” was what you needed in order to be beautiful inside out.</p>
<p>Whenever it was blazingly hot and sunny outside in Malaysia or Singapore and I wanted to go out, my mum would incessantly nag at me to stay in the shade or else I would “get all black” and ugly. I always naively obliged thinking she was Mrs. Know It All.</p>
<p>I would also always gawk in admiration at Caucasians who strolled around here as the thought “oh wow, they are so beautiful” whirled around in my head.</p>
<div id="attachment_1334" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://themabelkwong.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_6476.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1334" title="IMG_6476" alt="" src="http://themabelkwong.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_6476.jpg?w=433&#038;h=577" height="577" width="433" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">People in East Asia are known to use every means to shield themselves from the sun so as to not get tanned while outdoors.

<p>I’m definitely not the only one who (used to) thinks this way. Over the past century and up until today, there is a <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/091123/asia-white-skin-treatments-risks">craze</a> amongst people of Asian ethnicity – Chinese, Koreans, Japanese etc. – living in East Asia to look as white or fair-skinned as possible. Whitening beauty products are all the rage here, abundantly stocked on supermarket shelves and advertised more than a fair bit in newspapers.<span id="more-1330"></span></p>
<p>Quite a number of people in this region hold the superficial idea that being beautiful is equated to “looking as white as possible”. And this shallow trend in Asia shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>Some reasons behind such a prolific phenomenon in East Asia struck me after a couple of years living in Melbourne. The so-called rigid aspects of Asian culture can be partially to blame (don’t get me wrong, I am very proud of my heritage).</p>
<p><strong>Asians in general are taught to abide by traditions and exercise filial piety, and this in turn simply reinstates the long-held belief in every generation that fair skin is the quintessence of beauty. </strong></p>
<p>Whiteness has always been a salient albeit a slightly <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/weekly/2012-06/29/content_15533864.htm">evolving standard</a> in Chinese history. During the Han period in China, women of court boasted unearthly white Moon-like faces. Later in the Tang dynasty, reddish-white faces were a common sight among the women of this era. Empress Wu Zetian <a href="http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/7Kaleidoscope5334.html">passed down</a> her royal skin whitening recipes to her daughter Princess Taiping who never questioned such techniques and emphatically sought to preserve them.</p>
<p>And today alabaster white skin tones are immensely popular in Asia for arguably this reason.</p>
<p>Don’t we all feel that inkling of ‘Asian shame’ if we are rebellious towards our parents or get a wigging from them? I would always fret over tan lines that materialised on my arms and legs after a school hiking excursion under the sun in Singapore and wondered what my parents would say.</p>
<p>As it has been for centuries in Asian cultures, we aren’t inclined to disrespect history. We aren’t exactly told to question but encouraged to adhere by traditional values and beliefs – think “study hard, get good grades” – and essentially shut up and listen most of the time. So the notion ‘whiteness equals beauty’ permeates today due to East Asians’ unconscious innate in-bred instincts to listen to repetitive advice on this subject and fervently pass these messages down to the next generation.</p>
<p>The preference and tendency to socialise with other Asians who share similar perspectives is also ostensibly another reason behind this whiteness craze. Bruce McConachie <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/theatre_topics/v008/8.1mcconachie.html">writes</a> that sociologist Raymond Williams’ idea of “structures of feeling” designates the emotional bonding below the conscious level due to the collective experiences by a particular group. That is, we frequently gravitate towards and feel a sense of connection with those who possesses similar experiences as us.</p>
<p>While living in East Asia, most of my friends were of Asian background and we took much enjoyment in Asian-activities such as celebrating the Lunar New Year and yapping about traditional superstition.</p>
<p>And naturally we agreed that ‘dark skin’ is ugly given that it’s often associated with being ‘poor’ or dark skinned peasants planting rice in paddy fields under the scorching sun, and ‘whiteness’ pretty as it tends to be equated with high economic statuses or Caucasians decked out in spiffy business attire working in comfortable air-conditioned office buildings. Just like in the movies.</p>
<p>In essence, <strong>the more us Asians who had similar mindsets stuck together, the more the mentality ‘white is beautiful’ stuck in our heads – no one challenged this idea.</strong></p>
<p>This frame of mind can also be said to persist today due to the presence of relatively few <i>gwei los</i> or <i>gwei muis</i> in Asia. I gawked whenever I spied one of them in Singapore. Thinking back, I stared because <strong>compared to most of the other people around me that were of Asian descent, Caucasians simply looked different feature-wise. Exotic almost. And exotic is always attractive and eye-catching</strong>.</p>
<p>When I moved to Melbourne, I was immediately riveted by how everyone is constantly encouraged to be creative, to inquisitively think outside of the box. Individual opinion is highly valued in the Western world. During class discussions, I was always asked to speak my opinion on the topic thrown up in the air. Once my class was asked to deliberate the stereotypes of whites and non-whites and that got me thinking:</p>
<p>Is skin colour <i>really</i> justified as the benchmark for beauty? A beautiful personality?</p>
<div id="attachment_1338" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 429px"><a href="http://themabelkwong.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_6480.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1338" title="IMG_6480" alt="" src="http://themabelkwong.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_6480.jpg?w=419&#038;h=558" height="558" width="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me enjoying the sun in Melbourne. With sunscreen of course. Photo by <a href="http://replacingink.blogspot.com.au">Replacing Ink</a>.</p></div>
<p>No. As I’ve <a href="http://mabelkwong.com/2012/11/08/im-white-so-that-means-im-pretty-and-smart-right">mentioned</a>, at the end of the day, <strong>just as age is just a number, skin colour is just a colour</strong>.</p>
<p>I began thinking even more broadly as I met people from different backgrounds with different beliefs. Although I did meet people who did think “white was beautiful” at school, most were very proactive about sharing alternative opinions.</p>
<p>As such, I eventually developed a penchant for looking at both sides of the coin and not confining myself to thinking about one perspective in any given situation.</p>
<p>And when I walk out of my Melbourne flat, I see Caucasian after Caucasian person on the streets – alongside speckles of people of Asian ethnicity. A very common, bland sight that I’ve gotten used to seeing on an ordinary day.</p>
<p>So much so that I’ve come to realise “whiteness” and “non-whiteness” are both <i>merely physical features</i>.</p>
<p>What’s more interesting is having a spontaneous conversation with a white or non-white person, and seeing the nice things that they do. Which are never the same and always one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p>And that’s where real beauty emanates from.</p>
