<p>Great news! I&#8217;m funny now!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened: I was Googling &#8220;How to write a thank you letter for a present that boggles the mind&#8211; seriously, what is this thing?&#8221;, and my fervent Google prayers were answered by <a href="http://www.ehow.com/" target="_blank">eHow.com</a>. If you&#8217;ve never heard of eHow, it&#8217;s a website where contributors write articles on how to do things. Often these are very helpful things like <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4697759_reduce-heating-bill.html" target="_blank">&#8220;How to Reduce a Heating Bill&#8221;</a>. Sometimes they&#8217;re surprising things like, <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5979734_foil-plot-keep-ransom-yourself.html" target="_blank">&#8220;How to Foil a Kidnapping Plot and Keep the Money Yourself&#8221;</a>. Sometimes they&#8217;re very odd things like, <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5306660_cat-diploma.html" target="_blank">&#8220;How to Get Your Cat a Diploma&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5168869_keep-rats-snakes-out-toilet.html" target="_blank">&#8220;How to Keep Rats and Snakes Out of the Toilet&#8221;</a> (which opened up a world of toilet-vermin-related terror for me that I previously did not know existed). In an effort to distract myself from toilet-rats and -gerbils and such, I decided to find out if there&#8217;s anything eHow CAN&#8217;T teach you.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t. I learned <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5741226_look-like-pamela-anderson.html" target="_blank">How to Look Like Pamela Anderson</a>. I learned <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5691545_greet-alien-visitor.html" target="_blank">How to Greet an Alien Visitor</a>. I even learned <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7681846_put-stickers-guitar.html" target="_blank">How to Put Stickers on My Guitar</a>, and though I haven&#8217;t learned How to Buy a Guitar yet, or How to Convince Yourself to Buy a Guitar Even Though You Have No Musical Talent and Hated Piano Lessons When You Were a Kid, I&#8217;m sure eHow is just waiting for me to ask. I thought to myself, <em>Self, is there anything you&#8217;ve really wanted to do that your innate boringness was preventing you from accomplishing? Surely eHow can help!</em> and that&#8217;s when the internet provided an answer in the form of a How-To Guide:  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4614110_write-funny-facebook-status-message.html" target="_blank">How to Write a Funny Facebook Status Message</a>.<em> Ah-ha! </em>I said to myself. <em>You could be funny! </em>It was quite the breakthrough, and I&#8217;ve spent the better part of the day learning how to do it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t have to practice after this. Just reading these articles made me a Funny Person. I decided to start small…</p>
<p>Step #1 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7416574_send-comic-text-messages.html" target="_blank">How to Send Comic Text Messages </a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This one was helpful because I was previously unsure of my texting abilities. The guide walks you through the step-by-step process of sending a text message, even making sure you double check that you&#8217;re sending it to the right person. That&#8217;s great news because I once ended a relationship by sending a comic text message to the wrong person. Unfortunately, it kind of glosses over the actual funny part. It directs you to a website with humorous messages, but says a shared joke or experience is better. This is going to be a problem for me, because I can&#8217;t decide what&#8217;s actually funny or not.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I practiced by sending my brother a text that said, &#8220;Hey. Remember that time when I asked you what kind of spatula I should buy? Laughing out loud.&#8221; He did not respond, I assume because he was incapacitated by laughter, but also possibly because he was in school. I realized that I needed to define Being Funny.</p>
<p>Step #2 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5321935_really-funny.html" target="_blank">How to Be Really Funny</a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I picked this one over similar guides because of the &#8220;really&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to be regular amounts of funny, but I couldn&#8217;t find one that said &#8220;pee-in-your-pants hilarious&#8221;, so I went with it. The first step is to find a sarcastic person who is making people laugh and ask them if they are being sarcastic. If you are not laughing and other people are, don&#8217;t worry! They&#8217;re not laughing at you, they&#8217;re laughing at sarcasm that you&#8217;ve failed to recognize. I wish I&#8217;d known this in middle school, because I now realize there&#8217;s no such thing as bullies. If the person answers in the affirmative, you&#8217;re supposed to stalk them and learn their habits. This probably involves a lot of hiding behind menus and trash cans. I was home alone all day and I had no one to follow, so I just skipped a few steps until I found one I liked, which was to make hilarious faces during normal events. In fact, I&#8217;m making hilarious faces as I type this!</p>
<div id="attachment_726" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-726 " title="Me being funny" src="http://listfulthinking.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img00011.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me being HILARIOUS!</p></div>
<p>Step #3 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2248252_be-sexy-funny-like-sarah.html" target="_blank">How to Be Sexy and Funny Like <span class="zem_slink">Sarah Silverman</span></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Bonus! I am now funny <em>and</em> sexy. I don&#8217;t look like <a class="zem_slink" title="Sarah Silverman" rel="myspaceeverything" href="http://www.myspace.com/everything/sarah-silverman">Sarah Silverman</a>, but I have accumulated several topics that are taboo, including Mormon underwear, talking about how much I like asbestos, and the board game &#8220;Taboo&#8221;. Apparently these are my new bread and butter. I&#8217;m not sure what to do with them, but maybe just yelling those things at certain times is enough to be funny. On to the sexy part! I need to accumulate T-shirts, which I already have. BLAMMO! Perhaps I was sexy the whole time.</p>
<p>Step #4 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2257167_tell-funny-stories-like-ron.html" target="_blank">How to Tell Funny Stories Like <span class="zem_slink">Ron White</span></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This tip is very interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Deliver jokes and funny stories with a very raspy voice. <a class="zem_slink" title="Ron White" rel="myspaceeverything" href="http://www.myspace.com/everything/ron-white">Ron White</a>&#8216;s raspy voice is from smoking too many cigars and drinking too much Johnnie Walker Black Label Whiskey. Be insightful but blunt when delivering material.</p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If I&#8217;m talking to you and my voice starts getting raspier, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m being funny. Even if you miss the punch line to the jokes I got from the internet, this should be enough to clue you in when it&#8217;s an appropriate time to laugh. I will also be drinking more whiskey and smoking cigars, then gargling razor blades to ensure that my raspiness is genuine. I practiced when my dad came home from work, and he asked me if I had a cold. I asked if he was being sarcastic. He was not.</p>
<p>Step #5 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6377248_funny-stuff-email.html" target="_blank">How to Find Funny Stuff to Email</a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Since I&#8217;d mastered funny text messaging, I moved on to email. This is great because I finally have a way to respond when my grandma sends me adorable forwards about kittens. Just you wait, Grandma. The guide recommended collegehumor.com and it looks like it&#8217;s right up your alley.</p>
<p>Step #6 <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2284837_develop-childs-funny-bone.html" target="_blank">How to Develop a Child&#8217;s Funny Bone</a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I didn&#8217;t open this one because it kind of scared me when I thought about it. Why would I want a child&#8217;s funny bone? Where would I keep it? In a jar on my shelf? Under my bed? How would I explain it to my friends? What if one day I&#8217;m framed for a series of terrible murders and the police discover that I have developed a child&#8217;s funny bone and am keeping in a jar on my shelf? Won&#8217;t that look bad?</p>
<p>There you have it. I&#8217;m no longer a Comedy Padawan. I&#8217;m a Humorous Jedi. A Funny Person. I&#8217;ll be here til Tuesday.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, I stumbled upon this Babble article &#8220;<a title="Babble blog article" href="http://www.babble.com/mom/work-family/mom-blog-wisdom-36-best-blogging-tips-julie-a-little-pregnant/" target="_blank">Wisdom from Mom Bloggers</a>&#8221; and devoured it. I&#8217;m still a blogging newbie, and what better for me than to get some decent (<em>and free</em>) blogging advice from some of my favorite mom bloggers out there?! The article asked 36 popular, amazing, successful mom bloggers to give their best blogging tip for new mom bloggers (<em>hello?! That&#8217;s ME!</em>). The very first one I read touched instantly on what I love most about having a blog&#8211;the sense of community. I touched on my feelings about this in a prior post, which you can read <a title="I’m talking about my Twitter friends" href="http://jamesandjax.com/2010/12/07/im-talking-about-my-twitter-friends/" target="_blank">here </a>if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>There were a few I thought to be extremely important to remember when posting anything on the internet&#8230;FOR ALL TO SEE! Especially this one from the beloved Heather Armstrong, of<a title="Dooce" href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="_blank"> <em> Dooce</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be aware that anyone and everyone can read your words. The last person  you would ever want reading your website will eventually find and read  your website. Write knowing this beforehand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously, this cannot be stressed enough. The other day, thanks to SiteMeter I discovered that someone local found my blog and read EVERY. SINGLE. POST. They spent over an hour devouring (I guess) every morsel, every word I&#8217;d ever written here. And guess what? It kind of freaked me out. There are, I admit, a few people out there I&#8217;d rather not know anything about my life. And the thought that the last person (or few people) I would want reading my blog was perhaps reading each and every word of it, like Heather Armstrong said would happen, was almost too much to bear. I thought for a minute about whether I should even have a blog. I&#8217;m usually a very private person, and it&#8217;s kind of unlike me to blog at all.</p>
<p>But then I came to my senses and remembered how much I&#8217;m enjoying blogging about being a mom and how it has helped me get past PPD and a lot of other negativity/baggage. And I also remembered all of the compliments I&#8217;ve received from friends, family, and total strangers who are enjoying reading my posts. So I&#8217;m gonna truck on.</p>
<p>I really loved this comment from Eden Marriott Kennedy, of <a title="Fussy" href="http://www.fussy.org/" target="_blank"><em>Fussy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be honest. Your experience as a mother may be incredibly similar to  other women&#8217;s, but no one else sees life exactly like you do. Write  that.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this one from Candy Kirby, of <a title="The Laughing Stork" href="http://thelaughingstork.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Laughing Stork</em></a>, really hit home for me (because of <a title="The Wiggles, yeah that’s right–The Wiggles!" href="http://jamesandjax.com/2010/10/02/the-wiggles-yeah-thats-right-the-wiggles/" target="_blank">my Wiggles post</a> back in the early days):</p>
<blockquote><p>Never drink and blog.  (Drunk Tweeting, however, is not only acceptable, but recommended.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Jill Smokler, of <a title="Scary Mommy" href="http://www.scarymommy.com/" target="_blank"><em>Scary Mommy</em></a>, wrote something that also resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Decide from the beginning how much you want to share. If I had it to do  over again, I wouldn&#8217;t publish my kids&#8217; real names and I&#8217;d consider  going the whole anonymous route.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been a bit regretful that I used my kiddo&#8217;s real name right from the get-go. I kinda wish I&#8217;d used a pseudonym. You never know what creeps are out there using every tidbit of personal info you post. I&#8217;m careful to not post anything about my town or anything that could lead said creeps to my family. And one of these days, I&#8217;ll learn how to watermark my photos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with one more, possibly my favorite because it&#8217;s so freaking true, by Mr. Lady, of <a title="Whiskey in my sippy cup" href="http://www.whiskeyinmysippycup.com/" target="_blank"><em>Whiskey in My Sippy Cup</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not do this for money. Any time you mix money and passion, something  about both changes. Allow yourself time to evolve as a writer, and yes,  you will evolve as a writer, even if you&#8217;re superb now. Writing is a  gift that keeps giving&#8230;you get better every time you do it. Just  write, just let your passion bloom. Money can come later, if you want it  to, but you need those first few years to grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope if any of my readers have been on the fence about starting a blog (mom blog or otherwise), this post helps them take the plunge!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been mistaken for a tough guy.  I&#8217;m slight of build, avoid confrontation when possible and have a fairly low pain tolerance.  These are attributes that most people would leave off their dating site profiles (except for little-guys-looking-for-love.com&#8230;ok, I just made that up) but I am who I am and I accept it.  On a scale of 1 to 10 on the toughness meter, I&#8217;m probably about a 4.5 and that&#8217;s being generous.  One thing I&#8217;m sure of though is that I am tough enough to handle my children&#8230;or at least I thought I was.</p>
<p>If you live anywhere that witnesses the change of seasons, you know that this time of year is prime cold and flu time.  Here in the mid-atlantic/northeast, the bitter cold of winter is upon us as evidenced by the white stuff that covered my yard this morning and the frequency in which my wife and I use our remote start on the car (thank you technology!).  If you have kids, you also know that just as the sun is guaranteed to rise each day, your home is guaranteed to be an incubator for the dreaded &#8220;common cold&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now despite my relative lack of toughness, there are some things I am proud to say I can handle such as running a marathon (done it twice) and in a few weeks, participating in the Polar Bear Plunge.  These things help increase my rating on that toughness meter I mentioned earlier, but nothing makes that number plummet like catching a cold.  So when I woke up early last week with a lump in my throat and a runny nose, the wife knew she now had 3 babies on her hands.</p>
<p>I suffered through several days of work; complaining to co-workers, requesting additional boxes of tissues, and responding to my wife&#8217;s text-message inquiries about how I was feeling with, &#8220;not so good&#8221; and a sad face emoticon.  I even game a half-assed effort during play time with the kids one night and promptly hit the sack just after 8:00pm.  After several days of this life-threatening illness, my condition was upgraded from critical to stable and I felt I was on the mend.  Despite my efforts to keep the germs away from the kids however, it was inevitable that the outbreak would spread&#8230;and spread it did. </p>
<p>By the early part of this week, both Izzy and Jake were showing signs of the cold.  The wife and I prepared ourselves for several nights of sleeplessness, increased levels of crankiness and the possibility of some diaper surprises (parents out there, you know what I&#8217;m talking about).  With the exception of a slight fever however, these symptoms never really showed up.  Instead, we were graced with the usual antics of &#8220;Iz and the Jakester&#8221; in all their glory.</p>
<div id="attachment_149" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://sportsjim81.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/168355_1786951070852_1151813990_2164871_241951_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-149" title="Iz" src="http://sportsjim81.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/168355_1786951070852_1151813990_2164871_241951_n.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just a normal day in the life of Izzy</p></div>
<p>My mind couldn&#8217;t comprehend what I was seeing.  &#8220;How can these kids be so happy, so full of energy, while being sick at the same time?&#8221;  DOES NOT COMPUTE!  When I&#8217;m sick, I feel like a grizzly bear that&#8217;s just come out of hibernation and is subsequently shot in the rear with a tranquilizer dart.  When <em>they&#8217;re</em> sick, they look like the pictures you see above and below.</p>
<div id="attachment_150" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://sportsjim81.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/163018_1786952670892_1151813990_2164877_3563931_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-150" title="The Jakester" src="http://sportsjim81.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/163018_1786952670892_1151813990_2164877_3563931_n.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cold? What cold?</p></div>
<p>While I sat there watching Izzy spin around in circles with one sock on and an empty milk cup in her hand, I wondered how it was possible that my kids were tougher than me.  At one point, Jake shot me a look that said, &#8220;Man up Dad!  It&#8217;s just a cold.&#8221;  Izzy followed it up with a comment in Infantese that loosely translated, meant &#8220;C&#8217;mon Pops&#8230;this is how we roll.  Can you hang with us?&#8221;  I felt my toughness rating dropping like a rock.  I thought about &#8220;showing the kids whose boss&#8221; by banging out a few push ups but moving from the couch to the floor seemed a bit excessive.  I mean I&#8217;m still recovering after all.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s been about a week and a half now since the first symptoms reared their ugly head and I am still fighting the remnants of a cough.  The kids meanwhile, have shaken off their sickness like my dogs shake off the falling snow.  Hopefully their level of toughness sticks with them as they grow and they take after their mom rather than me.  If not, I feel bad for my wife as she&#8217;ll be stuck taking care of babies for a very long time.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the language barrier is a biggie, so I would be remiss not to post (first of several) about this particular hairy monster that we must adapt and adjust to as best we can. To sum up the language &#8216;thing&#8217;, the motto is just, &#8216;be nice&#8217;. As a Southerner might say, &#8220;when you don&#8217;t know the language from a hill of beans, it&#8217;s best, just to be nice.&#8221; When I was fresh off the plane, I smiled so much, my cheeks hurt, but now I just have really strong cheek muscles and it has served me well. When I arrived, my french was relegated to just the basics&#8211;&#8217;bonjour&#8217;, &#8216;merci&#8217;, &#8216;au revoir&#8217; and of course those that all of us learned from the Pointer Sisters in the 70&#8242;s (we all know the ones, let&#8217;s leave it at that!). Needless to say, a big portion of humble pie is always on the menu when you are learning a new language.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about one particular piece of humble pie I ate. I was already nervous, because I was to meet my husband&#8217;s family for the first time. I worked overtime before they arrived, cranking out the french lessons one after another using my language software, zipping through each one before the characteristic harp noise could signify that the right answer was chosen. Man, I was ready and thought I would be OK, as long as the topics stayed simple (insert misconception #1). But no one ever talked about dogs, cats, airplanes or boats, which is the useless dribble you learn first. I tried to insert the topics when I could, but frankly, I was even boring myself in doing so. Then, to add insult to injury, I mispronounced one of the simplest responses, &#8216;merci beaucoup&#8217; (phonetically correct: mair sea/bow coow) instead, I pronounced &#8216;beaucoup&#8217; incorrectly as, &#8216;bow cyu&#8217;.  In doing so, I essentially told my future brother-in-law, that he had a nice derriere. Not the lasting impression I had in mind, but boy, did I make one! He smiled and kindly corrected me, understanding what I meant to say while preserving both our dignities, thank goodness! Then I thought, oh my, to how many others had I said it incorrectly? I could only hope that they all understood too and knew that I tried my best, as evidenced by my good-hearted brother-in-law.</p>
<p>It really was and still is amazing, how accepting people are when you at least try to speak their language. I have been told by a few native French who have encountered more than a few other English speakers (namely Brits &amp; Americans) who come and expect people to adapt to their way, with no intention of learning the language. This was shocking to me. Again, as a Southerner, my family would be aghast to know that I had been a guest in another country (similar to visiting someone&#8217;s home) and didn&#8217;t do my best to be a good one during my stay. I think learning just a few words of the language in whatever country you visit or live, is very much like visiting a friend&#8217;s home and bringing a small gift to show your gratitude. It is a gift to see the world and meet new people, so why wouldn&#8217;t we treat it as such?</p>
<p>Looking backward through the binoculars, it is difficult it is to humble one&#8217;s self in needing the help of others and becoming dependent on the kindness of strangers. So much rides on a first impression that to look foolish for not saying something properly, can be very disheartening and prevent you from dusting yourself off to try again. So, I can certainly understand why there are people who do not learn because of their fear of being humiliated or not being accepted. Sadly, the opposite is true from my experience. People want to help you when you make the effort. Just think of friends, coworkers or your own children who you knew they were doing their best to learn and they smiled when you tried to teach them. The same philosophy works, be nice and try your best even if it&#8217;s only a few words, use them and you will be surprised how well and how far it will take you!</p>

<p>Between the Minneapolis lakes there&#8217;s a series of channels and paths and the obligatory bridges to facilitate over-lake transportation for the masses. This double path enables both the biped upright beings to prance at their leisure as well as the bi-wheeled cyclists to whiz by unencumbered.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the post from a couple weeks back of the toilet paper. Something about the stark blacks and whites with some sparse middle ground, here shown as striped planes that curve away and lighten.</p>
<p>Just more Uptown meandering under the persistent overcast above.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://handmadebyannepotter.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1020876.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-537" title="Free craft supplies" src="http://handmadebyannepotter.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1020876.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>While I can easily justify the expense of &#8220;must-have&#8221; craft supplies (the sparkly beads I&#8217;ve been eyeing, a palette of lusciously colored wool roving, black brass bezels, you know), I cannot justify the expense of boring craft tools and supplies. All those sundries that don&#8217;t sparkle, but do all the hard crafting work, then sit in the craft room when you finally turn out the lights. Most of my favorite tools and supplies are free upcycles.  And you know what that means: more money to spend on yarn.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a list of some of my favorite (free) craft workhorses:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Egg cartons</strong>. With little easy-access compartments, egg cartons are perfect for sorting supplies, like when making 10 pairs of matching earrings for your sister&#8217;s (too extensive) bridal party. Thank you, egg carton. They&#8217;re also great for small painting projects: both holding painted objects mid-coat, and posing as a perfect drying rack.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Plastic lids</strong>: Use plastic sour cream (oatmeal, yogurt, raisin) lids as toss-able paint palettes. And I have finally learned to put these under my super-gluing projects.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Fannie May boxes</strong>. These boxes are the perfect size for most beading projects, holding beads and supplies, and then keeping the finished product safe.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Bread tags</strong>. Those white plastic tags that secure the bread bag are a knitting life-saver. They work nicely as removable stitch markers and also to identify UFOs in your work basket. I&#8217;m always stealing the needles out of a neglected project to start a new (soon to be neglected) project. With bread tags, I can Sharpie the needle size I used, or even the last row number onto the marker, slip it onto the project and have NO GUILT as I leave that project in the dust. These babies can also mark circular needles (which, I don&#8217;t know why, are never marked like their straight needle cousins).</p>
<p>5.<strong> Beans</strong>. A cheap filler for small knit toys.</p>
<p>6.  <strong>Velveeta boxes</strong> (and Ramen noodle multi-pack boxes).   OK, now don&#8217;t judge me for having these boxes in my pantry (I do) but they make great, uniform storage boxes for all your craft supplies.  They&#8217;re rigid, corrugated boxes that can hold up to serious craft storage (30 bottle of blue acrylic paint?  15 half-full bottles of glitter?  OK then.).  And their shape is high-walled and perfectly rectangular, so they line up nicely on shelves.  Add square manila labels for full craft-prissiness.</p>
<p><a href="http://handmadebyannepotter.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1020884.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-539" title="Bamboo skewer, polka dot painter " src="http://handmadebyannepotter.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1020884.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>7. <strong>Bamboo skewers</strong>. At all times, my paintbox has at least ten of these wooden skewers lying around. They make not one, but <em>two</em> sizes of perfect polka dots (small and extra tiny) and nicely dig out the dried paint that always gunks up the paint bottle I&#8217;m trying to squeeze.</p>
<p>So now, there&#8217;s only one thing left to do: buy a box of Fannie May.</p>

<div>This is a small collection of pictures I took during flights to various destinations. An observation on how humans occupy land. It does not try to be scientific; on the contrary, it is more of a poetic homage on human intervention, treating urban transformation and agricultural production as a means of constructing landscape. I deliberately did not put any names of the places; in this way it turns into a matrix of typologies, and the places lose their specific local identity. It urges you to think urban space on the basis of models (linear and expansive models, etc) and not the actual place itself.</div>
