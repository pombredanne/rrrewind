				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a long time I really disliked weird crops, by which I mean anything beside from the fairly standard 2&#215;3, 1&#215;1 and so on. I think this was probably a by product of going through the stage where I felt photography was about the process rather than the end result, and wanted to capture everything perfectly in camera. A weird crop implied tweaking after the fact, some form of digital or darkroom manipulation. Now I know these things almost always take place whether its visually apparent or not (and whether the photographer owns up or not) I&#8217;m not so bothered by them, in fact I find strange crops rather fascinating.</p>
<p>Broomberg and Chanarin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.choppedliver.info/people-in-trouble/">People in Trouble</a> series got me thinking about the subject again. Their images use circular crops, but primarily because of the nature of their source material rather than because the shapes are meaningful in themselves. It&#8217;s interesting how unambitious our framing of images is. Sometimes with good reason, but I wonder if there might be a place in certain contexts for crops that don&#8217;t follow the standard boring box, whether shapes can be connotative or political in themselves? Shapes undoubtedly have implications, circles connote stability and completeness, triangles direction and sometimes instability depending on their orientation. Here are a few small experiments to try and show what I&#8217;m talking about:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The English language is full of strange idioms, many of them that we use without understanding how that phrase came to being. I only have time for a few but I might add more later. Let&#8217;s take a look at them shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Train of thought: </strong>The process and direction of one&#8217;s thoughts</p>
<p>From the early 14th century, the word &#8220;train&#8221; meant a &#8220;drawing out or delay&#8221; of something. In the mid-15th century, the word evolved to include a &#8220;retinue or procession&#8221;. The first example of the term &#8220;train of thought&#8221; was attested in the 1650s whereas the first use of the word &#8220;train&#8221; in the sense of a locomotive. As a result, the idiom &#8220;train of thought&#8221; has nothing to do with trains (the transport) and is more likely to derive from a &#8220;delay&#8221; of a &#8220;procession&#8221; of &#8220;thought&#8221; (hence losing your train of thought).</p>
<p><strong>Cup of Joe: </strong>Coffee</p>
<p>There are a few theories on this one. I&#8217;ll talk about the two most popular ones here.</p>
<p>The first is attributed to Secretary of the US Navy, Josephus Daniels (1862-1948), for banning all US Navy ships from serving alcoholic beverages. As a result, sailors resorted to the next strongest drink: coffee.</p>
<p>The second is a reference to a &#8220;cup of jamoke&#8221; as coffee is a compound of Java and Mocha. The term jamoke has been used in popular culture before, hence a &#8220;cup of joe&#8221; being derived from a &#8220;cup of jamoke&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Beat About/Around the Bush: </strong>To avoid getting to the point</p>
<p>The earliest example of this term was recorded around 1440 in the poem <em>Generydes &#8211; A Romance in Seven-line Stanzas. </em></p>
<blockquote><p>Butt as it hath be sayde full long agoo,<br />
Some bete the bussh and some the byrdes take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>This anonymous poem exists only as a single handwritten manuscript in the library of the Trinity College and Cambridge. The implication of this was that it was worse to &#8220;bete the bussh&#8221; than to &#8220;take the byrdes&#8221;. The next earliest example of the modern day phrasing of the term can be found in George Gascoigne&#8217;s <em>Works</em>, 1572.</p>
<blockquote><p>He bet about the bush, whyles other caught the birds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Technically, the correct phrase, if you stick to the origins of the word, would be &#8220;beat about the bush&#8221; but the incorrect US version took over in around 1980 so now most people say &#8220;beat around the bush&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Gung Ho: </strong>Over-enthusiastic attitude towards doing something</p>
<p>This word was adapted from the Chinese military motto meaning &#8220;work together&#8221; (the word being kung ho). Lt. Col. Evans Carlson used this term frequently during World War II, where he would hold gung-ho meetings for his troops. They would discuss their problems and orders at these meetings. The expression became even more popular after the movie <em>Gung Ho! </em>in 1943 depicting a marine who did everything it took to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Take the cake: </strong>Taking a prize symbolising victory or success</p>
<p>While it is widely believed that the phrase originated from the strutting competition known as the &#8220;cake-walk&#8221; in which the winner would have been said to have &#8220;taken the cake&#8221;, where cake was often the prize. This was popular within the black community of Southern USA in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>However, this expression has existed since the early 5th century BC where the Greeks used &#8220;take the cake&#8221; as a symbol for taking the prize. In 420 BC Aristophanes wrote &#8220;The Knights&#8221; (a criticism of the powerful Athenian politician Cleon).</p>
<blockquote><p>If you surpass him in impudence the cake is ours.</p></blockquote>
<p>The term &#8220;take the biscuit&#8221; is used the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Early bird (takes the worm):</strong> Opportunity goes to those that are prepared</p>
<p>This is a tough one; the first recorded example can be found in John Ray&#8217;s <em>A collection of English proverbs 1670, 1678.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The early bird catcheth the worm.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this suggests that the word was already in popular usage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Hines, author of a whole bunch of fantasy novels I have never read, recently decided against participating in an &#8220;ask me anything&#8221; session on Reddit, an online community known as much for narwhals and bacon as misogyny, rape apologia, and men&#8217;s rights activism. Oh, and <a href="http://youtu.be/VuMdQRRLoYg" target="_blank">Anderson Cooper</a>. And memes. Lots and lots of memes.</p>
<p>I was initially distraught at the idea that an author, even one I am personally unfamiliar with, would deprive the generally good-natured Reddit community of an opportunity to ask what sort of operating system Mr. Hines uses, but after reading his explanation, I side with Mr. Hines.</p>
<p>I read the Reddit thread in question last week, before various blogs (like Shakesville &#8212; a blog you should be reading) picked up the story, and couldn&#8217;t bring myself to write my thoughts on the subject simply because they were so complicated. Mr. Hines writes very clearly what I liked and did not like about the thread in question and why he cannot participate in his scheduled AMA.</p>
<p>From his post:</p>
<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> important that we understand why people rape. But there are other ways to find that insight. Books, essays, research, and more. I’ve spoken with rapists and batterers, and it did give me a better understanding as to how this crime happens. But the circumstances of those conversations were very different. They were controlled, with people who had been convicted and held accountable for their actions. People who, as far as I could tell, appeared to genuinely regret what they had done. In situations where excuses were not tolerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2011/03/feminism-101-helpful-hints-for-dudes.html" target="_blank">Shakesville</a>: &#8220;If one in twenty guys (or more) is a real and true <em>rapist</em>, and you have any amount of social activity with other guys like yourself, then it is almost a statistical certainty that one time hanging out with friends and their friends, playing Halo with a bunch of guys online, in a WoW guild, in a pick-up game of basketball, at a bar, or elsewhere, <em>you were talking to a rapist</em>. Not your fault. You can&#8217;t tell a rapist apart any better than anyone else can. It&#8217;s not like they announce themselves.</p>
<p>&#8230;It&#8217;s very likely that in some of these interactions with these guys &#8230; someone told a rape joke. &#8230;[Y]ou laughed.</p>
<p>Or maybe you didn&#8217;t laugh. &#8230;[M]aybe you just didn&#8217;t say anything at all.</p>
<p>And, decent guy who would never condone rape, who would step in and stop rape if he saw it, who understands that rape is awful and wrong and bad, when you laughed? When you were silent?</p>
<p>That rapist who was in the group with you, &#8230;he felt validated, and he felt he was among his comrades. &#8221;</p>
<p>Is the Reddit thread in question, as Hines suggests, a &#8220;how-to guide&#8221; for rapists? Possibly. Or is it a way for some rape survivors to gain closure? Definitely a possibility. Could it be, as I felt when I read the thread, a way to gain insight into the minds of criminals? Yes. It could. But the risks far outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>Someone reading this thread could think rape is okay. Someone could feel he is &#8220;among his comrades.&#8221; And I applaud Hines for not only walking away, but stating clearly and effectively that he will not participate in this community and this thread is not okay.</p>
<p>But go read it for yourself. And maybe buy one of his books.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Okay, so there is no smooth transition from Israel to Vietnam &#8211; just a sad little apology from me for not blogging for an entire month between trips.  So yes, I came back from Israel, soaked up a little Seoul, started my life as a Samsung employee, and headed straight back out into this big ol&#8217; world.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And this is how we find ourselves in Hanoi&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00838.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1544" title="DSC00838" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00838.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Our trip to Vietnam started as a pretty typical question between friends &#8211; where should we meet?  So, when our chingoos (= amigos, in Korean) suggested Hanoi instead of coffee, we immediately signed up for the adventure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00846.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1553" title="DSC00846" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00846.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The four of us landed in Hanoi not knowing what to expect, but we all instantly fell in love with the chaotic, humid mix of city, jungle, East &amp; West.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1559" title="06 Vietnam" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01082.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1589" title="DSC01082" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01082.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="584" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1555" title="06 Vietnam1" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam1.jpg?w=501&h=358" alt="" width="501" height="358" /></a><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc010841.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1587" title="DSC01084" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc010841.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="308" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">Most of Hanoi&#8217;s central streets are lined with lush trees&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00805.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1565" title="DSC00805" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00805.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="285" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1566" title="06 Vietnam2" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam21.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">overflowing with noisy motorbikes&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00853.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1567" title="DSC00853" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00853.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">and crowded with food vendors and hungry customers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc010782.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1570" title="DSC01078" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc010782.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" title="06 Vietnam3" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01106.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" title="DSC01106" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01106.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1574" title="06 Vietnam4" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam4.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">The old, dilapidated (yet rich) French colonial villas bring a surprising pop of color to the bustling avenues, which we explored sweat-ily for hours, finding artistic shops and delicious restaurants along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00866.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1576" title="DSC00866" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc00866.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">One of my favorite discoveries was Madame Hien (15 Chan Cam, Hoàn Kiếm, Hanoi), an exquisite restaurant serving traditional Vietnamese food in a luxurious colonial estate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" title="06 Vietnam6" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam6.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" title="DSC01121" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01121.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="378" /></a><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" title="06 Vietnam7" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/06-vietnam7.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01120.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" title="DSC01120" src="http://asfarasicantell.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc01120.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">We spent a full day in Hanoi, filling our tummies with good Vietnamese food and enjoying the unique energy of the city, but this was only the first leg of our journey.  Our next stop?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sapa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>True Story: <em>I Love Eggs</em>. Sunny-side-up, poached, scrambled, fried, hard-boiled, deviled&#8230; I really love eggs. My good friends from school will tell you that I ate an egg salad sandwich almost every day during my senior year of college. This is serious business. Very fortunately for me, I now have ten feathered roommates who love eggs just as much as me, if not even more.</p>
<p>Meet the chickens.</p>
<p><a href="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chickens-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-158" title="Chickens 1" src="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chickens-1.jpg?w=300&h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chicken-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-159" title="Chicken 2" src="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chicken-2.jpg?w=300&h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The chickens are pretty hard to photograph on an iPhone as they like to run around in that typical chicken way, so please excuse the blurry faces. They are good chickens, however, and I promise they have normal faces, not blurry faces. Our chickens are free-range, organic-fed, happy, blur-free chickens. And guess what?! They make so many delicious eggs!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Right now we have four grown up hens and six little guys. The little guys aren&#8217;t so little anymore, I suppose, as they are nearly the size of the grown ups and will likely start laying any day now. Probably when it cools down a little bit. I was pretty frightened of my new roommates at first. They really like to swarm at you and peck around your feet (and maybe <em>on</em> your feet if your shoelaces happen to look like worms). They make weird noises and puff up and act really angry and broody (ha ha get it? broody?) when, in reality, they&#8217;re actually quite docile and silly. I am starting to become quite fond of the chickens!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our very biggest chicken, Mabus, is a monster of a hen. I have been practicing picking up the hens lately, and today it was my grand goal to get up the guts to pick up Mabus. It happened!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mabus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-160" title="Mabus" src="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mabus.jpg?w=300&h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I don&#8217;t know why I am making that face. Mabus is a really nice chicken. We have meaner chickens than Mabus. She is arguably the loudest of the chickens, of course, but she&#8217;s really a very amiable creature. I had no reason to be making such a face at Mabus. Sorry, little hen.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As you can imagine, we eat a lot of eggs at our place. Oftentimes, we are swimming in so many eggs that we have no idea what to do with all of them. This is when we send out SOS texts to friends and family &#8211; &#8220;DO YOU NEED ANY EGGS RIGHT NOW??&#8221; This was the case right before we went to San Francisco. Right now, unfortunately, not so much. We&#8217;re pretty sure it&#8217;s just because of the intense heat we&#8217;ve got going on right now &#8212; most of the chickens&#8217; energy is going to staying cool. In any case, we only get an egg or two every day which we greedily cook up on the same day.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Fresh eggs? Like&#8230; layed 10 minutes ago fresh eggs? Boy, let me tell you, they&#8217;re pretty delicious.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Inspired by my old friend and fellow blogger, Rebecca Yang of <em><a href="http://yangwithadashofyin.wordpress.com/">Yang with a Dash of Yin</a>, </em>who posted a delicious <a href="http://yangwithadashofyin.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/poached-eggs-with-rosemary-tomato-sauce/">recipe</a> the other day that I&#8217;ve been drooling over for some time, I decided to finally learn how to poach these eggs. Now, I&#8217;m someone who will order an Eggs  Benedict at any chance I can get these days, and typically end up paying a premium for delicious poached eggs. I was a little nervous to try to do it myself for the very first time, but&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;It went pretty well!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/poached.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-161" title="Poached" src="http://calundmark.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/poached.jpg?w=300&h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I poached them very quickly so that there was still a good amount of yolk in the middle, just how I like it. I found it was really, really easy&#8230; but Blaise tells me that I&#8217;m getting spoiled by learning how to poach eggs with such fresh eggs. I hear it is a little more difficult with store bought ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am very proud of my first egg poaching experience. I served it on top of a potato hash that was also pretty simple:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2 potatos<br />
1 green onion*<br />
1 medium garlic clove*<br />
small handful cherry tomatoes<br />
basil*, salt, pepper, other spices (to taste)<br />
olive oil -or- butter</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">*items were pulled from our garden!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Heat up a seasoned cast iron skillet while you peel and cut both potatoes. Throw them in and stir them around with a bit of the olive oil so they are all completely coated. Salt and pepper the potatoes. Cover. Let cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. After the potatoes have had some solo time in the skillet, toss in the garlic and green onion. Continue to cook on medium, making sure that nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan, but remembering that the potatoes really do need a good amount of sustained heat-time to soften. If it&#8217;s looking like the potatoes are mostly just getting brown and burn-y, throw in a little bit of butter or oil to help them stay soft. When the potatoes are just about done, chop up some cherry tomatoes and throw them in, too. I try to avoid putting tomatoes into my hashes or stir fries until the very end because they get pretty wrinkled and acid tasting as opposed to staying sweet and succulent.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Additional goodies to put in:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">kale, spinach, or any other leafy green<br />
mushrooms<br />
peas<br />
carrots and/ or parsnips<br />
avocado<br />
lean meats</p>
<p>or, as pictured above&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">eggs.</p>

<p><span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The Psychology of Storytelling<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Stories are a very vital piece of being convincing.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
You’d feel that, as a guy who cares for inquiries and data, I’d be indisposed to storytelling in one piece.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
As a vendor though, I can’t be: those in sales and marketing have recognized for a long time that stories win against data when it comes to influencing for the reason that stories are easier to appreciate and tie in to.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Are you slotting in stories into your copy? Are you using them on your blog?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
If you’re fretful to appreciate and tap into the influence of storytelling, get prepared to jot down some notes!<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Why You Need to add in Storytelling<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Storytelling works.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
But why should you have to add in this flowery technique into your writing?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
A bunch of folks are reluctant to telling stories because they think that “the specifics” are the most influential pieces of substance they can bring.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
It’s not, and here’s a revelation that assists to clarify why:<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Am I telling you that it’s better to say nothing in a brilliant style?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
No, of course not In its place, the point that I’d pretty make is that how you say something is just as essential as what you are saying.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
If you reject to recognize this, you menace having your excellent information become lost in an ocean of less precious substance.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Here’s the thing,: While we are all frequently opposed to the idea of being told what to do, we are very vulnerable to approving with the “moral of the story” due to how it is accessed to us.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
How Stories have an effect on the Mind<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
It would be polite to be able to justly sway people into fitting more flattering about your contribution, right?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Of course!<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The question then is this…<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Do stories really hold that much sway?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
According to research by psychologists Green &amp; Brock, they do.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
In fact, it’s probable that you greatly underrate how much stories influence you!<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The cause that stories click so well on us is that we are vulnerable to getting “swept up” in both their significance and in the way of their telling.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Quite literally, stories are able to transport our mind to another place, and in this place we may hug things we’d likely ridicule at in the “cruel, genuine world”.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Think about this example: You’ll often see politicians create a “story” for their campaign, and focus much of their efforts speaking with the public in crafting and footing by these stories.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Creating the story of “tough guy who is cruel on crime and supports states rights” is easier to appreciate than discussing the intricacy of how the administration plans to actually tackle the crime rate.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
You see this being utilized every day on platforms as big as TED talks to speeches by world leaders.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Instead of only discussing the “information”, they begin talks with phrases like, “Imagine if you will…”, and as we’ve seen, it’s with very good reason: stories help sell arguments of all types, from, “I believe that these liberal/conservative points of view are correct,” to, “I believe this product is suited for my goals.”<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
This information is useless, however, unless we address how to write better stories.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
How to Create Better Stories<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The #1 trait of a persuasive story is how “engaging” the story is.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
There are a million writing blogs that will go on and on about how to craft amazing stories, but is any of that (potentially good) advice backed up by research?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
In fact, there is an additional study conducted by Green &amp; Brock that addresses just what makes a story engaging.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Here’s what they found:<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
1.) Suspense works just as well as you’d expect<br />
The “cliffhanger” just may be the oldest trick in the writing book, especially writing for television, but there is a reason why it’s used so often…<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
It works!<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Despite our numerous exposure to this method, our brain just can’t “get over” suspenseful moments: it’s a relationship that just won’t die, we will always want to know what happens next!<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
In fact, suspense works so well that the hotly debated <a class="zem_slink" title="Suspense" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Zeigarnik Effect</a> would have you believe that it’s the best way to kill procrastination.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Research in that area seems to point to humans being much more inclined to finish something that has already been started (researchers interrupted people doing “brain buster” tasks before they could complete them… nearly 90% of people went on to finish the task anyway, despite being told they could stop).<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Suspense in stories really allows you to create addictive content, as long as the suspense appears early enough in the post to activate the Zeigarnik Effect.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
2) Creating detailed imagery helps craft the setting YOU want.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Want to get people swept up in your stories?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Tell them what they are receiving swept up in to, and they will respond.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Could any of us relate to the heroic deeds in tales like those of the <a class="zem_slink" title="The Lord of the Rings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Lord of the Rings</a> without <a class="zem_slink" title="J.R.R. Tolkien" href="http://www.last.fm/music/J.R.R.%2BTolkien" rel="lastfm" target="_blank">Tolkien</a>’s elegantly comprehensive imagery of the dangers of Mordor or the perils faced by Frodo and Sam?<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The imagery paints the picture of any good story, we could say that [Spoilers if you haven't read/seen Lord of the Rings] “Frodo and Sam fight a massive spider,” but Tolkien spends an entire chapter on the ordeal, taking the time to help the reader picture, the fierce character of the enemy and the bravery of our heroes who persevere despite their many weaknesses (doubt, fear, dismay, etc.)<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Implementing the “real” into a fantastic setting often helps create a better connection with the reader.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
I don’t know the feeling of encounter a spider the size of a house, but I do know what terror feels like, and I also know how hard it can be to persevere in the face of immense doubt of your abilities.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
These “all-too-real” elements of a fantastical story make it easier to relate to.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
3.) Literary techniques (like metaphors or irony) are essential pieces of memorable stories<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
As with most high school kids in the <a class="zem_slink" title="United States" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667 (United%20States)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">United States</a>, I was required to read a lot of the “staples” of high ch1ld literature.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
By far my favorite work was <a class="zem_slink" title="Animal Farm: Centennial Edition" href="http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-Centennial-George-Orwell/dp/0452284244%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0452284244" rel="amazon" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a>, a story that serves as a great example of the power of the many literary techniques at your disposal.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
In the beginning, the story in Animal Farm seems quirky at best: When the de-facto leader of the animals, <a class="zem_slink" title="Old Major" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Major" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Old Major</a>, dies, two pigs called Snowball and <a class="zem_slink" title="Napoleon" href="http://www.biography.com/people/napoleon-9420291" rel="biographycom" target="_blank">Napoleon</a> take over and see out his “vision”, which they interpret to be the driving out of Mr. Jones, the farm owner.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Snowball is eventually chased away by Napoleon, and Napoleon begins to enact new rules for the Animal Farm, which begin to become warped as Napoleon and the pigs become more like their previous masters, culminating with the memorable phrase revealing what the rules have truly become:<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Needless to say, there is a lot at work under the surface of this story, as it is a metaphorical tale that relates the events of the rise of Stalin and the <a class="zem_slink" title="Soviet Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Soviet Union</a> before the second <a class="zem_slink" title="World War II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">World War II</a>.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Suddenly, a book about pigs taking over a farm begins to serve as a cautionary tale on how political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
There are many literary techniques and a countless amount of examples, I’m simply serving up this particular one to show you a singular instance of a writer using them to turn a seemingly simplistic story into a extraordinarily memorable and highly controversial work of art.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
4.) Modeling works because change is easier with an example<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
If you want someone to change a conduct (or become more inclined to taking a desired action), then you can “model” it with a story.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The character in said story should go through the transformation that you would like the reader to go through.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
The transportation effect is really evident here: people place themselves in the situation being told, reimagining themselves as the main character.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Oftentimes, they are made to see why the choices made were the right choices.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Strangely enough (or maybe it’s not so strange…), I often see web hosting providers showcase stories of customers past “cheap web-hosting nightmares” in which the customer describes a situation where they were freaking out from their site being down after receiving massive exposure, eventually “learning their lesson” and vowing to never again use anything but ______ [insert whoever is selling.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Positive stories are also used quite often, stories where individuals solve a huge menace in their life or get to where most people would like to be serve as transportation vehicles to recruiting new people to the cause.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
If you run a fitness based business (as an example), highlighting a tale of triumph over the generalized disadvantages of being out-of-shape to accomplish what previously seemed like “impossible” fitness results is a great way to get people fired up up to become more interested in fitness.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
6 ) Characteristics of Highly Influential Stories<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Now, a post on Sparring Mind wouldn’t be complete without an additional study to compare things to (reliable information is the result of approving research).<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
I really enjoyed a recent investigation (and the actual research) discussed in a piece by Roger Dooley, author of Brainfluence (great book, that’s my aff link).<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Dooley discusses what a difficult time lawyers have in influenced the jury during a tough case and the comparison he makes to your typical “car salesman” is spot on:<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
One of the difficulties of persuasion tasks is convincing a jury in a courtroom.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Car salespeople have it easy by comparison – they control the environment and have the complete concentration of the customer.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
Envisage, if you were in a Lexus showroom listening to why you should buy one of their vehicles, and at your elbow was a BMW salesperson, once in a while objecting to the Lexus pitch and then delivering her own.<br />
<span style="color:#0b8fd0;font-family:'Bookman Old Style';font-size:medium;"><br />
That’s the condition of affairs in a courtroom–arguments presented by one side will be directly (and mercilessly) attacked by the other side.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>A look into the treatment drug-like substances are given in video games.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span id="more-210"></span></strong></p>
<p>Drugs in games don&#8217;t work like their real-life counterparts. Often all they do is augment the player character, giving special powers or increased abilities. Often these substances are marketed as &#8220;power-ups&#8221;, however there is one mainstream series that doesn&#8217;t mask it&#8217;s intentions when it comes to using drugs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Bioshock: ADAM</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://images.wikia.com/bioshock/es/images/0/09/EVE_hypo.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="262" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">  The series Bioshock are revolutionary games, treating the player to unique and amazing locales, as well as a gripping mythos. The series never shied away from delicate issues, reveling in violence and bloodthirsty children, but it is the series portrayal of the drug ADAM that is perhaps the most controversial.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The wonder drug utilizes blank D.N.A to mold and create super powers and enhancements to the users body. Scattered throughout the sunken city of Rapture, ADAM is found in hypodermic syringes. These Hypo&#8217;s are graphically injected into the veins of your character&#8217;s forearm. This blunt, horrifically realistic portrayal of drug use is mysteriously offset by it&#8217;s lack of impact. Sure, your character gains the use of lightning, or can throw a fireball, but there is no indication of any sort of addiction as a result of these self injections.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This anomaly is made even more mysterious by the twisted inhabitants of Rapture known as Splicers. These residents were twisted and mutated by their extensive abuse of the drug. It&#8217;s overuse contributed to the downfall of the City, and yet your character seems completely immune to it&#8217;s addictive nature. All this does is tell the gamer while the drug will destroy other people&#8217;s lives, they needn&#8217;t worry about it themselves. This is a poor treatment regarding the addictive aspect of drugs in games. There is another game that deals with this subject in a more realistic manner. And that Game is Fallout 3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Fallout 3: Chems</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/images/15960-1-1301611678.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="421" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Drugs are a large part of the post apocalyptic wasteland. (For a review of Fallout 3, click <a href="http://ninetyninepercentgaming.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/review-fallout-3/#more-3" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">here</span></a>). In such a grim and hopeless setting, the inhabitants of the Capital Wasteland often turn to chems, meds, stimulants and drugs to escape. Your character is no different, and can utilize a variety of IV-like fluids as well as syringes and pills to augment both mind and body, as well as to flush his body of unwanted radiation and poisons.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Substances like the inhaler Jet and the pill Mentat are addictive, and repeated use over a short period of time will cause the player character to become hooked on the drug. Without then using the drug, the player will experience periods of disorientation and dizziness. Their overall ability will suffer and all their stats will drop. It is an effective way of portraying the negative aspect of substances. Alas, one drug is not treated the same way as the others. It also happens to be the most crucial one.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.fallout3.net/obrazki/f3_ekwipunek/stimpak.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="372" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A stimpak is effectively post-apocalypse morphine. A hypodermic syringe which restores health to the player, This drug can be used infinitely with no negative effects. This is in complete contrast to the other substances in the game. While fixed in Fallout New Vegas, the decision to omit Stimpaks from the addictive substance list highlights the worlds regard of painkilling drugs against recreational drugs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://ninetyninepercentgaming.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mariomushroom.jpg?w=510&h=329" alt="" width="510" height="329" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">drugs have an unquestionable presence in video games. They come in a variety of shapes, forms and potency. They&#8217;re often mistreated and misused, but recent games have started treating them with the respect and fear they warrant. Every year, the video game industry improves and furthers itself to maturely deal with controversial topics such as these, and this fellow gamers, is a good thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">                                                                                                                                                                                                                           -Michael</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today, I have renewed faith in cinema&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>A great moment can pass you by if you&#8217;re not paying attention. If you&#8217;re so busy waiting for something epic or magnificent to happen, you may miss something far more moving and ten-fold more important. This morning, I&#8217;m going to talk about something that was in a recent film and is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>THE</strong></span> most important and vital moment in film history for the last twelve years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got to be from a foreign film right? Wrong. It&#8217;s from an established American director responsible for two, soon to be three, of the highest grossing films in history. Well, it had to be Spielberg or Scorsese or Coppola right. Wrong again. It&#8217;s Christopher Nolan*&#8211;famous for the Batman re-crafting and &#8220;<strong>Memento</strong>&#8220;. What, pray tell, is this magical moment? What movie is it from? Tell us Bert! Please tell us!</p>
<p>Here is the most important and powerful moment in film history since the start of the new millennium and most folks missed it:</p>
<p><strong>In &#8220;Batman: Rise of the Dark Knight&#8221;, Daggett is berating Bane for not fulfilling his end of the deal. Bane then does something that chills my blood&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>He softly places the knife edge of his left hand quietly on Daggett&#8217;s shoulder.</em></strong></p>
<p>Bane said nothing yet his action spoke volumes. A lesser director might have had the villain rip his heart out or something clumsy and cliched like that. Nolan chose something far more frightening and sinister.  Something that is unmistakably powerful and brutal, yet subtle and delicate&#8211;icy and cruel. You knew instantly Daggett had stepped over an invisible line and the Devil himself was waiting past that threshold.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="tumblr_m7up9mWtPx1qadcdio1_1280.png" src="http://bertbranson.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-tumblr_m7up9mwtpx1qadcdio1_1280.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>I feel this moment ranks up there with that horrible, empty stare Hannibal Lecter gives agent Starling at their first meeting. It&#8217;s the end of &#8220;<strong>The Usual Suspects</strong>&#8221; or Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s speech in the diner from &#8220;<strong>Pulp Fiction</strong>&#8220;. It&#8217;s an amazing moment in cinema history, and Bert said it first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*<em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong></em>:  Thanks to all the readers that spotted my<strong> HUGE</strong> mistake!  Christopher Nolan is not an American, but a dual citizen of England and the US.  Before I assume something, I&#8217;ll do all my homework.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
