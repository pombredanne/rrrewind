				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first apartment in Tokyo was a shoebox designed for very tiny shoes. It was one room with a squat toilet and no bath. A streetcar ran past the apartment&#8217;s one window with a riotous clang-clang-clang from a heart-stopping 4:30 in the morning. Anyone who tells you that you can learn to ignore that kind of thing is lying.</p>
<p>Most of Tokyo&#8217;s streets don&#8217;t have names or numbers, so when I gave people directions, it was, &#8220;Take the narrow street between the ramen shop and the tobacco stand, turn left at the condom machine, and right at the black cat. Look for the cemetery on your left. My building is the beached whale in the middle of it.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know why there was an apartment building in a cemetery. Back then I couldn&#8217;t speak Japanese, so I couldn&#8217;t ask. And a little mystery always adds spice to life.</p>
<div id="attachment_528" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/5851530709_2cc65abfda_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" title="5851530709_2cc65abfda_z" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/5851530709_2cc65abfda_z.jpg?w=300&h=222" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Rob Ketcherside</p></div>
<p>Despite the lack of street names, Tokyo is laid out with some reason, if not rhyme. It&#8217;s a spider web with the Emperor&#8217;s palace in the middle. The palace is circled by eight concentric ring roads which are numbered, sanely enough, one through eight. The major roads radiating out from the center are also numbered, but with no logic or detectable pattern. There&#8217;s a route one that eventually becomes two, but nowhere near Tokyo. Nobody seems to know where route three is. The one that goes past my neighborhood is 246. There&#8217;s no 245 or 247.</p>
<p>This neighborhood was at one time farm land, and its streets were once deer paths and rabbit runs. Wandering around the area, one discovers dead ends and switchbacks so it&#8217;s not unusual to be looking for something and discover that you just can&#8217;t get there from here. But along the way, one can also discover traditional houses next to modern monstrosities, temples and shrines&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_143401.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-529" title="111203_1434~01" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_143401.jpg?w=89&h=150" alt="" width="89" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;gates leading nowhere&#8230;<a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_142801.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-530" title="111203_1428~01" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_142801.jpg?w=92&h=149" alt="" width="92" height="149" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;or a tree growing through someone&#8217;s balcony.</p>
<p>I guess in the end it&#8217;s not about getting there. It&#8217;s about what you do along the way.</p>
<p>* For the uninitiated, a mikan is a mandarin orange.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a bit of a creature of habit.  I wear the same running clothes (I do <em>try</em> to wash them twice a week), run the same course with minor variations for distance, and chant the same mantra as I fight my way through the last half mile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Run the hydrants, babe.  Just run the hydrants.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_880" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-880" title="Half Mile Marker" src="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-5.jpg?w=222&h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Half mile left to go</p></div>
<p>It has never changed, albeit I have only been on this running program since May.  As I round the corner at the last half mile mark I start to think about how close I am to finishing.  Previous <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-ab">posts</a> will tell you I am not a big fan of running, so the <strong><em>end </em></strong>of a run is quite possibly the only part I actually like.  Because I am a glutton for punishment (and my condo is located on a hill) the last half mile is two-thirds uphill and one-third slight decline / mostly flat.  This makes for a great start to every run but a horrible way to end when I am sucking wind and battling my inner <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-bB">demons</a>.  So I chant:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run &#8216;em babe.  Run the hydrants.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure why I refer to myself as babe.  Sometime I call myself by my first name with the Y ending my mother uses, sometimes by my last like the drill sergeants used to but usually it is babe&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;  whatever&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_883" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 121px"><a href="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-42.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-883" title="Another Hydrant" src="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-42.jpg?w=111&h=150" alt="" width="111" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just before the pancake</p></div>
<p>As I climb the first hill on my last half mile stretch my breath becomes labored and shallow, the hummingbird invariably resumes its residence in my chest cavity.  But as the incline turns to decline the knot holding the concrete bollard tied to my waist loosens and both fall away.</p>
<p>Another hydrant down, three more to go.</p>
<p>I try to lengthen my stride much like a lion would as it closes in on its prey but it ends up looking more like <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-8f">this</a>.  I pass another hydrant, two more to go.  The ground levels out to a pancake and I ready myself for the final push.  I envision myself running beside <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-7G">Abby Wambach</a>, striding down the pitch on my way to a glorious goal.  I pass the second to last hydrant, embark on the last hill and suddenly there are three bollards tied to my waist and these ones are anchored to the cement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Run &#8216;em babe.  Run down that last hydrant.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_891" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-31.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-891" title="Second to last" src="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-31.jpg?w=222&h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Death by incline</p></div>
<p>I am dying and these are my final moments.  Instead of spending them in a bed surrounded by my loved ones I will die alone here on the pavement next to this friggin hydrant.  My lungs will surely burst like a balloon released to the heavens.</p>
<p><em>T</em><em>he air is to thin up here!</em></p>
<p>Last hydrant.</p>
<p>I push, I fight, I scream.</p>
<p>I finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four men with gray hair sit in Starbucks &#8211; three read the Sunday New York Times, six dollars at the counter. The other holds a small, brown book with no title or picture on the cover. He sits, holding the book, then stands and tells his reading neighbor to “have a good one” and leaves.</p>
<p>A younger-looking man walks in and up to the counter, orders a soy no foam and I think “Soy what?” But the barista knows, and that’s what matters. He tells the barista, after receiving his drink, “Thanks. Take it easy.” Everyone wanting everyone to have good ones and take it easy.</p>
<p>A gaggle of young patrons enter. The fat one is quiet. The blond is obnoxious. He says loudly, “I hope there are security cameras in here,” and complains about the location of the trashcan. A girl tells him lightly, “Chill out,” and I think about what if instead, after receiving our coffees, we told the baristas, “Hey, thanks. Chill out.” It wouldn’t have the same benign effect as “take it easy.”</p>
<p>The barista says something to the gaggle, and they all laugh, including the adult leader. They laugh loudly and together, they really laugh, enjoying this involuntary expression of pleasure, and they like him, this barista. He made their coffees exactly how they like them and they only had to give him sixteen dollars and he said something funny and a bit flattering to no one in particular so there is no jealousy and they really laughed, and for a moment an eight-hour drive back to Cincinnati doesn’t seem so bad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This epic adventure of our four young heroes begins on a gloomy, overcast morning.<br />
The fifth of their band had fallen from the ranks.<br />
Even Charlie, the Australian Shepherd, was to deny them his companionship on the long journey ahead.</p>
<p>Alas, the four heroes would march forth, a united army,<br />
Into what was foretold to be days of thunderous storms and merciless showers.</p>

Our heroes enter the dark forests of Killarney,<br />
Like knights forging into the abyss of battle.<br />
How will they persevere for nine days when the first hour begs for relief?</p>
<p><a href="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc02421.jpg"><img title="killarney provincial park ontario hiking loop packs" src="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc02421.jpg?w=625&h=833" alt="" width="625" height="833" /></a></p>

<p>The constant, piercing pain in their shoulders was unprepared for;<br />
Every footstep on the uneven, rocky path becomes akin to lifting lead.<br />
Did our heroes expect too much?<br />
Delude themselves into believing that they were worthy of winning this war?</p>

<p>There is a momentary reprieve in the sojourn<br />
As our band of ravenous travellers stop to refuel.<br />
Chief&#8217;s succulent veal roast is devoured like The Last Supper.<br />
A mountain of fluffy white rice nurses the mind&#8217;s wounds back to health.</p>

<p>Merry as elves, stomachs content with the feast,<br />
Our heroes take up their pilgrimage once more.<br />
Yet, what is said to take one hour extends into two for our weary crew.<br />
Then, the first of them is hit.</p>

<p>Big J&#8217;s knee, giving way to the unforgiving terrain, waves the white flag.<br />
Agony stretched across her face,<br />
She attempts bravery in the midst of falling arrows,<br />
Her comrades patch her up and again, they roar on.</p>
<p><a href="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc02462.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3185" title="killarney provincial park ontario hiking loop injury the pig portage" src="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc02462.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="833" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, as the merciful mirage appears to the worn desert travellers,<br />
The sign to their first night&#8217;s home beckons.<br />
After a few wrong turns and balancing perilously on narrow ridges,<br />
Our exhausted heroes stumble into an oasis.</p>
<p><a href="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_3483.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3182" title="killarney provincial park ontario hiking loop topaz lake sign" src="http://cafe23dotme.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_3483.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="833" /></a></p>

<p>The fight is not over; it has only begun.<br />
They know the worst awaits them in the mountains,<br />
Like the sleeping dragon that will surely awake when neared.<br />
Will our heroes survive and slay the beast?</p>
<p>Stay tuned &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the hardest thing you&#8217;ve ever done (physically and/or mentally)? Why do you define it as the &#8220;hardest thing&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What&#8217;s up?! Okay, for those of you who are like, <em>What has happened to Cafe and why is she talking like Shakespeare??? </em>I thought that writing about my hiking trip adventures in the style of this week&#8217;s <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/weekly-writing-challenge-metaphor-and-similie/" target="_blank">Writing Challenge by The Daily Post</a> would be so much fun! I really did feel like this was an epic tale and seriously the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done, at least physically (but mentally, it was up there too!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I hope you enjoyed it <em>and </em>if you want to hear about the rest of the trip in this epic prose (hehe), holla in the comment box!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- Cafe ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Written for this week&#8217;s <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/weekly-writing-challenge-metaphor-and-similie/comment-page-1/#comments">DPChallenge:  Easy as Pie</a></em></p>
<p>Once upon a time when I had a job and an income and approximately the same amount of stress but coming from different areas, I was a high school English teacher in a kinda-stupid-but-ridiculously-snooty-even-though-it-is-mostly-populated-by-well-off-white-trash-types suburb.</p>
<p>The educational paradigm there was trying to shift itself into a thing that was totally student-centered.  As such, students were supposed to figure out what they wanted to do with the rest of their lives by age 14 and subsequently take only classes that would further this aim for the rest of their high school career and beyond.</p>
<p>I thought this model was pretty dumb. I&#8217;m certainly pro-career-minded education and allowing students to choose classes that will appeal to their interests as well as their individual learning styles; however, how&#8217;s anybody supposed to know what he&#8217;s going to do for the rest of his entire life at age 14? And shouldn&#8217;t we force him to read some things he doesn&#8217;t like, and do some math problems he&#8217;ll never use just to expand and exercise his brain?</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this post is to fit into the weekly writing challenge and to set up, in your mind&#8217;s eye, my classroom in which the following frustrations took place:</p>
<p>Teaching metaphors and similes to ninth graders is like putting a Santa Claus costume on a cat.</p>
<p>You have to use a lot of force and a lot more cajoling, and then the end product isn&#8217;t even that attractive.</p>
<p>Because explaining the difference between a simile and just any old comparison to a bunch of freshmen is like explaining the difference between a tuna and a dolphin to a really backward, unconcerned-with-law deep-sea fisherman.</p>
<p>You can do it all day long, until all your breath is gone, and that fisherman is still going to harpoon the closest thing in the water, be it tuna, halibut, dolphin, or a smaller boat.  And that freshman, when asked to write a simile, is going to write you things like, &#8220;The baseball game was like a football game, except with fewer yardlines,&#8221; and &#8220;The Revolutionary War was like the Civil War, except with more British people.&#8221; (Note:  These are paraphrases of actual sentences that actually came across my desk.)</p>
<p>Oh yes, ninth graders can spout off the definition of a metaphor or a simile as vociferously and reliably as Ol&#8217; Faithful spewing hot water.</p>
<p>But just like that hot water in Wyoming that springs up from the ground and turns ethereal, these definitions cannot be accessed in any useful, meaningful way.</p>
<p>That is, until those definitions, like that water that is steam, rematerialize in a different form and fall back on the students.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not their fault, not really.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old&#8217;s brain is Jello that hasn&#8217;t completely set.  There&#8217;s good stuff in there, and a lot of it&#8211;a can of fruit cocktail, some marshmallows.  But it&#8217;s not ready for consumption:  It still needs to be poured into a mold and then left in the icebox for a few hours.</p>
<p>One day, perhaps, after having endured the proper conditions, a brain is ready to come out of the fridge and be served out of delightful little fancy glasses.</p>
<blockquote><p>And, of course, the thing about Jello, which also goes for a brain:  There&#8217;s always room for it.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mingblue.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/photo-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7347" title="Greed--but one step away from guilt." src="http://mingblue.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/photo-1.jpg?w=384&h=414" alt="" width="384" height="414" /></a></pre>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>An old teaching consultant and an old hack strolled into a chichi French cafe awash with sunlight and tourists. The old teacher held forth on the benefits of four-hour sleep patterns, cholesterol, and the kingdom of Catalonia, while the old hack tried unsuccessfully to get the attention of the waiters who were playing a kind of bumper cars game&#8212;looking like they were coming at you but avoiding our table at the last second.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I catch no glimpses of the person the teaching consultant first met in that fish market of a canteen in senior high school; no longer the awkward teenager, I now brandish my knowledge of social chatter like a pink umbrella in the rain, and I maintain eye contact as if the shameful skeletons in the teenager&#8217;s closet have long gone.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Back in that grimy school canteen, the consultant, who comes from a line of pedigreed educators, already knew he wanted to teach. But I, the girl who later was to become a hack at the local fashion press, was just a messed up kid with a collection of glass and porcelain unicorns on her dresser.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>She managed to get the waiters to bring the glasses of water, the briochette, the rosti and mushrooms, the carpaccio beef salad, and coffee. But after a few attempts, she gave up asking for the lemon tart, the berry tart and the bill. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A quarter of a century has passed, and remarkably, still in our prime, the old teacher and I trade bon mots almost Woody-Allenish in style and texture; self-conscious descriptions (mine), obsessions (his), the threads of dialogue embellished with ripostes and parries.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Even though his back was to the waiters, the old teacher managed to get their attention every time.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>&#8220;How do you do it?&#8221; the old hack asked. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>The old teacher replied sagely, &#8220;When you signal them, you have to look like you&#8217;re falling off the chair.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Age is just a number, and time is an illusion. There&#8217;s a saying in the fashion world that fashion never gets old, it just get re-created. The present is the past, simply re-tailored for the time. That&#8217;s why Scott Fitzgerald wrote that we &#8220;beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Old friends never go out of fashion.</p>
<pre style="text-align:left;"></pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://voyem.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3865" title="photo" src="http://voyem.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I moved to Brooklyn October first. With a lease on a new (old) apartment, less work hours and more freedom to pursue my entrepreneurial endeavors, I discovered once again that New York is nothing if not a series of choices &#8211; most of them small: like a thousand raindrops for your life storm.</p>
<p>I took the wrong bus up Madison today, and ended up in Queens. $15 later, I thanked my cabbie and made it to a meeting on Upper West just in time.</p>
<p>That was a 5 second, 30 foot long, $15 mistake, starting at the right stop on 54th and Madison Ave, and ending at escaping the rain, and catching the wrong transit out of the city instead of my familiar territory on 79th to catch the crosstown. And, that&#8217;s how New York works &#8211; a bajillion baby decisions you make without paying attention that can throw off your whole afternoon (day? week?) and drain your entrepreneurial bank account, if you don&#8217;t watch it. And yes, my entrepreneurial bank account is that small.</p>
<p>I settled in Bushwick because I love the diversity here. The bodegas and the graffiti, the hip hop on the street on my way to Manhattan and the colorful home hair dye jobs waiting for the M train.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way I got used to rubbing shoulders with people different from me. And, I missed that before I landed here. I wanted that back.</p>
<p>On a budget, in a new place, with a full plate, I&#8217;m reminded of all the things that have grounded me before when I was in this predicament. And, oddly enough, it&#8217;s the lessons I learned in Uganda that have been most relevant for me, in Bushwick &#8211; starting with leaving my comfort zone.</p>
<p>1. Move out of your comfort zone, and make a home there.</p>
<p>The first few weeks (months?) in any new city, country, place, you find yourself walking around wondering what the hell you just did. But it was in a village off the Kampala to Gulu highway that I first discovered that moving outside your comfort zone is the place where you begin learning about yourself. Once you get past feeling strange that everybody doesn&#8217;t look and feel like you,  your own weirdness gets a whole lot clearer, and you&#8217;re free to let your freak flag fly.</p>
<p>2. Enjoy what you have.</p>
<p>Agnes wears mostly the same three outfits when I stay with her in Uganda, but she&#8217;s got a few crazy little numbers tucked away that she pulls out for special occasions. I&#8217;ll never forget the look on her face when she first walked out and showed me her red, floor length dress. Re-living an old favorite, in front of a new audience, is just the best.</p>
<p>Moral of the story being, budgets suck. And, I&#8217;m pretty sick of mine already. But it&#8217;s just when I&#8217;m tempted to die over looks 1 straight through 42 in Prada&#8217;s F2012RTW, I remember I really love my Frye boots, and my Jeffreys, and the Gap vintage patched jean jacket that I was dying to wear all summer. By the way? Happy fall, Manhattan.</p>
<p>3. Refry, reheat and repurpose.</p>
<p>I learned in Uganda that the way you eat is relative, and the perception that you can&#8217;t eat the same thing for a week is, in fact, a little silly. I&#8217;ve seen a single chicken re-heated and remade seven different ways &#8211; and enjoyed it 7 (okay, five), different times.</p>
<p>Lesson learned. I wanted to make brunch for friends this weekend, after a late show in Williamsburg. So, I bought groceries to feed five. Huzzah! I have been able to re-create brunch for every single meal this week, and haven&#8217;t gone grocery shopping since.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; thanks for all the left over beer, Kyle.</p>
<p>4. Can you make that at home?</p>
<p>I loved the way that food brought us together, when I lived in Kakooge and Wobulenzi. We laughed a lot more. We sat a lot more. We conversed longer.</p>
<p>There was this whole pounding in my chest panic attack thing the first day I realized how many things I was missing from my routine  that I thought I &#8220;needed,&#8221; but about week four? I found a lot of things weren&#8217;t so necessary anymore. I&#8217;m finding it here too: with things like like going to Starbucks, when I could brew in my french press at home, or drinking a beer on my pack porch in the crisp fall evening air, instead of buying gin and tonic out on the town. That whole happy simplicity part of me is waking back up, and I&#8217;m finding that I notice the little things more than I did when I was running through the line for my double breve Americano, and grabbing lunch to go every day. Not to mention, I&#8217;m finding that I enjoy my home &#8211; and the people in it.</p>
<p>5. Get some perspective.</p>
<p>Paring down, eliminating, going without are all things I think we get used to looking at negatively, but I&#8217;ve begun to realize that simplifying your life can actually be much more grounding, and help you keep your priorities in line. I&#8217;m looking forward to talking to people more. I&#8217;m noticing nature. I&#8217;m noticing ideas. I&#8217;m feeling creative. Isn&#8217;t that why we chose to be entrepreneurs? We wanted to put ideas and passions first, and stick it to the man, every now and then? I budgeted out shampoo and body  wash, and I&#8217;m enjoying Castille soap again. It&#8217;s good for your hair. It&#8217;s good for your body. It&#8217;s good for your small shower. Not to mention, I love me some almond vanilla goodness. After that, I switched to straight coffee, on my Starbucks run through. And, boy oh boy do those .50 refills make me a happy camper on Monday (and Tuesday, and Wednesday and&#8230;shit. Let&#8217;s not talk about it).</p>
<p>Get yourselves some Oktoberfest six packs. Open your windows. Go without a few lattes, and buy a potted plant.</p>
<p>Happy simplifying, Brooklyn. I&#8217;m off to shower with some Vanilla Castille goodness, and fall asleep under the M train.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a poem at the age of 16, sitting outside the cafeteria windows at my high school. It was a rough sketch of my elementary school experience, where I was disgustingly and mercilessly bullied. I had never been able to put the feelings I had about the experience into words, but I was able to now &#8211; and re-reading it after I had written it made the tears come to my eyes.</p>
<p>I put it away for years, but I brought it back out when I was putting together the poetry for my book. At the last, I decided to include it, because it still spoke of the rawness and horror that I felt while writing it that beautiful summer day just before I went into grade 10. I didn&#8217;t want to forget my experience, and the experience of so many other kids who go through bullying.</p>
<p>I watched a video yesterday of a news anchor who had been sent a fatphobic email. Her name is Jennifer Livingston, and she addressed this disgusting email with grace and aplomb. She said everything I wish I could have said to my bullies way back in those elementary school days &#8211; and she spoke out for people who are still going through that stuff. Kids who are dying because of it. Kids who feel like they have no hope.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;ve had several conversations, similar to Jennifer&#8217;s broadcast, with ignorant people. No, it&#8217;s not any of your business what my weight is. No, you don&#8217;t have to tell me I&#8217;m fat, I already know it. Most fat people do &#8211; we&#8217;re not stupid, and being fat is rarely the result of just eating &#8220;bad food&#8221; or not exercising enough. I also know that I have an upturned nose, or that there are other physical characteristics about me that may not be pretty or conventionally beautiful. It doesn&#8217;t mean I get your scorn. It doesn&#8217;t mean you get to make fun of me, or make me into a big joke or someone to torment. That says a lot more about you than it does about me.</p>
<p>When I nanny, I really try my best to show kids their best characteristics, and celebrate them for all of who they are. I don&#8217;t believe that anyone deserves torment of any kind. Now, with the advent of the Internet, there are people who seem to get their jollies on running people down. That&#8217;s . . . sad. I can think of so many other things to do to improve myself than running someone else down.</p>
<p>So, thank you, Jennifer Livingston, for being inspirational and a real figurehead for children and adults everywhere. As a woman, I thank you for standing up for women of all sizes on national TV. As a fellow caregiver, I salute you for setting the example for the children we both take care of.</p>
<p>You rock. And you&#8217;re gorgeous. I loved your video. Click on the photo below to view what Jennifer has to say.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Editor's Note: As <a href="http://overfiftyunderfive.com/about/" target="_blank">promised</a>, from time to time this blog will go wildly off topic to review coffee bars and discuss the quantum entanglement of babies and coffee. This is what is happening now. If it's not your cup of, um, tea, not to worry. Our regular cast of characters will return in the next post.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://babiesandcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/baby2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-583 aligncenter" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;" title="baby2" src="http://babiesandcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/baby2.jpg?w=270&h=270" alt="" width="270" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Starbucks is my Methadone clinic. When the babysitter doesn&#8217;t show up, I take the kid there to give his mother a break. I pouch him up in the Bjorn and we walk to Starbucks, where he has nothing and I have a double shot to see if any nerve endings will start firing again.</p>
<p>The founder of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, started it because he wanted to emulate the coffee bars of Italy. Starbs has drifted pretty far from Italy. In a strange tectonic shift it has become closer to being a call center in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai">Chennai</a>. As I watch people working at the long tables I realize I am looking at a cubicle farm, not a cafe.</p>
<p>I hold my lukewarm espresso in its paper cup, surveying the workers, until the baby begins to fuss. It&#8217;s time to move. If I keep moving, there is peace. If I remain in one place for long, there is no peace. While pouched in the Bjorn, the baby has a particular, curious problem with Points of Sale. Standing on line at Staples to pay he had a meltdown. The cashier&#8217;s polite smile froze on her face, then drained away like old ice cream. The baby had another meltdown at Wells Fargo. The tellers were taking their time counting other people&#8217;s money and the kid lost it, even though moments earlier he had been smiling at other people in line. For some perverse reason, they thought his crying was cute.</p>
<p>I have been hearing it a little too often to find it cute, although my wife and I have certainly become connoisseurs of crying, as though we are archeologists working with ancient bones, delicately turning them over in our gloved hands, dusting the years from them, seeking their meaning amid a larger puzzle of mystery.  &#8217;Oh,&#8217; we say, as we recognize a particular breathing pattern, &#8216;that&#8217;s his hungry cry,&#8217; He catches air in a short gulp. &#8216;Yes, that&#8217;s the tired cry.&#8217; There is a guitarish wah-wah effect. &#8216;That&#8217;s the bored cry.&#8217; And when his mouth becomes a red furnace of sound: &#8216;It is time to feed him.&#8217;</p>
<p>Baby rage is relatively unexplored, except by writers like Rachel Cusk. I suspect babies feel rage because of the way we dress them. You put a kid in an outfit with a picture of a duck on his ass and he&#8217;s going to cry like hell. At least, that&#8217;s one theory.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of crying lately, and any forward progress we&#8217;ve had in this regard has not been linear. In the same way that Starbucks has incrementally slipped from being a coffee bar to a call center, we have slipped and slid and circled around nap times and sleep cycles. We call putting him down in the crib to yell his head off a nap, and they call what they make espresso, but it&#8217;s made by a machine, not a barista. Many times during the day, the kid can only sleep after having a good cry. At night, he is worn out and can glide into a perfect sleep, a leaf spinning noiselessly down river. There is about as little craft in a Starbucks espresso as you can image. On the other hand, there is as much craft in parenting as you can imagine. It&#8217;s positively artisanal, given its numbing attention to detail, its repetition, its faith in outcomes without knowing outcomes, and the stone serious dedication of its practitioners.</p>
<p>I walk up the block, get coffee and come back, and then do it again. The kid has nothing and I have a double shot.</p>
