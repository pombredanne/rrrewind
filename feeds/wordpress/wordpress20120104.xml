			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sure you have heard of the &#8220;Couch to 5k&#8221; or &#8220;Couch to 10k&#8221; workout programs.  They are designed to do just that:  Get you off the couch and moving.  Running.  Engaging in an activity other than being a couch potato.</p>
<div id="attachment_513" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 193px"><a href="http://appfinder.lisisoft.com/app/10k-runner-couch-to-5k-to.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-513" title="couchto10K" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/couchto10k.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There&#039;s an app for that. Is there an app that will do squats and lunges for me while I reap the benefits?</p></div>
<p>Along a similar vein, we are undertaking a modified version&#8211;a &#8220;Couch to Get Your Butt Back into Backpacking Shape&#8221; program.  We hike, we are not runners.  I&#8217;ve made it my personal maxim not to run unless I am being chased by Orcs.  (Orcs.  Not orcas.  Certainly not okra.)</p>
<p>Orcs are those hideous creatures that exist in the (fictional, or so I&#8217;m told) realm of Middle Earth.  They do the bidding of the evil Lord Sauron and have an unquenchable hunger for &#8220;man flesh.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_514" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/orc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-514" title="orc" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/orc.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="229" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A very special kind of orc, called Uruk-hai. I&#039;ve always thought that &quot;The Fighting Uruk-Hai&quot; would make a great name for a high school football team.</p></div>
<p>Orcas, on the other hand, are those incredibly cute marine creatures, also known as Killer Whales.  Wild orcas are not considered a threat to humans, although some in captivity have been known to maul their handlers.</p>
<div id="attachment_515" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/orca.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-515" title="orca" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/orca.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="184" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Watch out, that whale&#039;s a KILLER!</p></div>
<p>Okra is another thing altogether.  It&#8217;s a vegetable, that when prepared properly&#8211;not too mushy and drenched in an Indian style curry sauce with some onions tossed in&#8211; is quite delightful.</p>
<div id="attachment_516" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 269px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/okra.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-516" title="okra" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/okra.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is boring okra.</p></div>
<p>Since the last time I <del>got off my rear end</del> did any serious hiking was in July, when we climbed Katahdin for my husband&#8217;s birthday, it has become necessary to engage in a murderous diet and exercise regime.  This program consists of the following self-inflicted torture:</p>
<p>Paying attention to my long neglected gym membership.  Reacquainting myself with a bizarre contraption known as an <em>&#8220;incline treadmill&#8221;</em> that simulates&#8211;although not perfectly&#8211;<del>trudging </del>walking up a really steep hill.  If there are pine trees to look at, and hiker stench involved, I don&#8217;t typically have a huge problem with steep hills.  I enjoy pine trees, especially when they are not sitting in my house dropping needles.  I also find hiker stench to be an oddly non-offending scent, one that is not reproducible in the sterile environs of the gym, what with its lack of dirt and vegetative matter.  Upon reaching the top of a <em>real</em> steep hill, you have payoff in the form of an exquisite view, from a place that you can only reach on your feet.  The payoff on an incline treadmill is not quite as rewarding:  <em>&#8220;Yippee, I get to eat a banana and take a shower.&#8221;</em></p>
<div id="attachment_517" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 264px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bananas.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-517" title="bananas" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bananas.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, goodie.</p></div>
<p>On days off from the gym, I still have to do SOMETHING.  So I work out along with the help of a &#8220;Biggest Loser&#8221; exercise DVD.  Thankfully, it does not feature everybody&#8217;s favorite workout coach, Jillian Michaels.  She kind of makes me lose sight of anything resembling Christian grace.  But it does feature something else that makes me want to scream bad language at the top of my lungs:  lunges and squats.  These moves are beneficial to the  hiker because of the &#8220;boulder hopping&#8221; and &#8220;boulder climbing&#8221; that the hiker will inevitably encounter.  As beneficial as these training moves are, they are evil.  They make doing the simplest task later on&#8211;such as hopping down the three steps to the backyard to throw a tennis ball to your dog&#8211;an exercise in sheer torment.  And getting up out of a chair after you&#8217;ve sat for longer than 15 minutes?  Forget it.  For at least a week or two, you&#8217;d better just be comfortable with the fact that you will pondering the necessity of &#8220;getting up&#8221; after sitting down.</p>
<div id="attachment_518" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jillian-michaels.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-518" title="jillian michaels" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jillian-michaels.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, sure, she LOOKS nice enough. Don&#039;t be fooled.</p></div>
<p>Goodbye, Buffalo Chicken Wings.  Hello, Tangerines.  You may be roughly the same color, but you&#8217;re fooling nobody.</p>
<div id="attachment_519" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 269px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tangerine.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-519" title="tangerine" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tangerine.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You&#039;re not a Buffalo Wing. How...DARE you!</p></div>
<p>Learning&#8211;one more time&#8211;that breakfast does not consist of several cups of coffee.  That is only PART of a balanced breakfast.  Those several cups of coffee should be accompanied by something healthy, like yogurt, or fruit and something with…whole grains.  How boring are whole grains??!!  You can dress them up all you want, but they&#8217;re still not nearly as scrumptious as Nutella thickly smeared all over white bread toast.  Or Nutella thickly smeared all over Rice Krispie Treats.  Or Nutella simply licked off of a spoon.</p>
<div id="attachment_520" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 207px"><a href="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/nutella.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-520" title="nutella" src="http://orangespicedrop.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/nutella.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Behold, the greatness that is Nutella.</p></div>
<p>And this is just the beginning.  Other adventures await, including walking along with my house and bed on my back (That&#8217;s why they call it backpacking, silly!) and trying to do this while wearing heavy hiking boots instead of my light as a feather athletic shoes.</p>
<p>Make no mistake.  This <strong>is</strong> what we do for fun.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1423" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tombasson.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/2_3.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1423  " title="Tom 5yrs" src="http://tombasson.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/2_3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=450" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ants in my pants... c&#039;mon, I was cute!</p></div>
<p>When I was growing up my mother always told me I had &#8220;<strong>ants in my pants</strong>&#8220;. I was always excited or agitated about something, and couldn&#8217;t sit still for a second.</p>
<p>Not much has changed.</p>
<p>Even now I struggle to simply &#8220;be still&#8221;. My mind always active &#8211; always looking ahead to the &#8220;next&#8221; thing &#8211; I have to force myself to live in the present, and find quiet reflection really difficult.</p>
<p>And yet, in a world where things are moving so fast, I realise that sometimes in life, you have to stop before you can truly begin, and that pressing pause to be still and reflect is often the <em>best</em> way to start. Of course, you don&#8217;t want to live life looking behind you, but taking time out to intentionally slow down and consider the year gone past can be an extremely beneficial, rewarding, and productive thing to do. <a href="http://northfield.co.za/blog/Trevor-Hudson" target="_blank">Trevor Hudson</a> says,</p>
<h4>&#8220;We don&#8217;t learn simply from experiences; we learn when we reflect on those experiences.&#8221;</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.appletreelive.com/index.php/catalysts/travis-gale/" target="_blank">Travis Gale</a>, leadership coach and a good friend of mine, believes strongly in taking time out to reflect, and says that the key to healthy reflection is all about <strong>asking the right questions</strong>. He says, <em>&#8220;Many of us look for answers, but few sit down and think about the right questions to ask. Questions have the uncanny knack to open up possibilities, to get us thinking out the box, and perhaps break down the limitations we put on ourselves.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And so, before you start 2012, why not  STOP and ask the right questions? Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What energised me most in 2011?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which relationships brought me the most joy? Why?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which relationships put me under the most pressure? Why?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What were the &#8220;defining moments&#8221; of 2011?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What strengths did I see in myself during 2011?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Under which conditions did I see myself thrive?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What did I avoid doing that I know I most needed to do?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What books and mentors had the greatest impact on me? Why?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Am I closer to my friends and family from my activities last year?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these kind of questions allows you to accomplish two objectives. First, it forces you to focus on the important things in your life and not get lost in the trivial. Second, it provides an excellent platform to set goals for the new year.</p>
<h5>On Thursday, I&#8217;ll post the second thing I think you should do in 2012&#8230;</h5>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you live or visit Thailand, you&#8217;re not doing it right if you haven&#8217;t eaten street food at least once. It will probably be the best and cheapest meal you have had so far (or maybe even ever). Worried about food poisoning? Don&#8217;t, I haven&#8217;t gotten it from street food. I&#8217;m no expert but you can see the food being cooked in front of you. Not cooked enough for you? Just tell them to cook it some more &#8211; problem solved!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davidgaughran.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/calendar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1631" title="calendar" src="http://davidgaughran.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/calendar.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a>This has been a year of massive changes. Some of the older hands say that the business has always been this way.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t think we are simply seeing another year of flux. Instead, we are witnessing a process unfold which will revolutionize publishing forever (or at the very least, the foreseeable future).</p>
<p>But hey, I could be wrong, and we might all be back querying &#8211; and fawning in the comments of agents&#8217; blogs &#8211; by March.</p>
<p><strong>January</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The year opened with a booming e-book market as millions of Americans went on a binge buying spree to fill up their new e-readers &#8211; most of which were Kindles. That led to a handful of self-publishers posting truly eye-catching numbers, some of whom were beginning to be approached by agents and publishers, and being offered foreign deals. Success, however, was not just limited to these few and, from the middle of the month especially, most self-publishers saw a dramatic increase in business.<span id="more-1629"></span></p>
<p>I had my own avalanche to deal with. After spending Christmas in Ireland, I flew back to Sweden. A four hour delay meant it was past 3 a.m. when I got home, only to be faced with four feet of snow outside my front door, which had to be dug out. I was happy though, my long agent search had come to an end, with an up-and-coming New York agent keen to sign me. I was watching the developments in self-publishing and e-books with interest, but felt that best results would be achieved after publishing a few books the traditional way.</p>
<p><strong>February</strong></p>
<p>To the surprise of everyone, the post-Christmas e-book boom continued through February, with self-publishers grabbing an ever-increasing share of the genre bestseller lists. When the AAP figures for this month were released two months later, they revealed a historic milestone: <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/the-future-has-happened-already-e-books-overtake-paperback-sales-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">e-books became the dominant format for the first time</a>, outselling both paperback and hardcover, capturing 29.5% of the market. In less happy news, storm clouds were gathering at Borders, and the signs weren&#8217;t good.</p>
<p>It was a bleak month for me. The agent&#8217;s interest evaporated and he never had the courtesy to explain why. I still expected him to get in touch at this point; it would be another full month before I realized he had simply changed his mind about my book, and wouldn&#8217;t even bother to tell me. It was a depressing time. A short of mine, <em>The Reset Button</em>, was collecting nothing but form rejections, I couldn&#8217;t summon the strength to keep querying, and my second novel had hit a wall. I began to doubt whether I had the requisite ability or tenacity.</p>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<p>While John Locke was posting record numbers and dominating the bestseller lists, two other writers caught the headlines. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/books/amanda-hocking-sells-book-series-to-st-martins-press.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1325164893-Mhne/cQY99GT3/ypRW1yDA" target="_blank">Amanda Hocking leveraged her phenomenal self-publishing success into a $2m deal</a> while Barry Eisler shocked the publishing world by <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/03/ebooks-and-self-publishing-dialog.html" target="_blank">walking away from half a million dollars to self-publish</a>.</p>
<p>I had reached rock bottom, and considered walking away from writing altogether. The Hocking and Eisler deals made me consider self-publishing anew. While both moved in opposite directions, I saw both developments as a validation of self-publishing. I started hanging around <a href="http://www.kindleboards.com/index.php/board,60.0.html" target="_blank">Kindle Boards</a> and realized that success was far deeper and wider than the handful of names making the news. I spent the last week of the month wrestling with a decision on whether to self-publish <em>A Storm Hits Valparaíso</em>. The arguments of Joe Konrath <em>et al</em> made sense, but I was also being swayed by the fearmongering of the defenders of the status quo. I just couldn&#8217;t decide.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>April</strong></span></p>
<p>John Locke&#8217;s staggering success (understandably) spawned an army of imitators. <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/will-99-cent-e-books-destroy-the-world-as-we-know-it/" target="_blank">Everyone started freaking out about 99c books</a>, ignoring the millions of free books that had been around for years and hadn&#8217;t brought the industry to its knees or put all writers in the poorhouse. At the same time, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/do-you-prefer-print-books-enjoy-them-while-you-can/" target="_blank">bookstores were in serious trouble</a> across the world. The biggest chain in Australia collapsed, and the main chain in the UK announced the closure of hundreds of stores.</p>
<p>I broke my impasse by deciding to self-publish some shorts. I figured I could see if I enjoyed the experience without &#8220;risking&#8221; my novel (or the increased costs to publish it). Besides, that was still with three top agents, and I wanted to at least hear what they had to say. My aim was to get something uploaded before the end of the month (which I managed by a couple of hours), and document my experiences on this blog. I think my first post had four views.</p>
<p><strong>May</strong></p>
<p>It became clear that the e-book revolution would be no respecter of national borders when <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/e-book-sales-explode-in-the-uk-up-300-in-2010-childrens-up-500/" target="_blank">the frenzy spread to the UK</a>. Amazon announced they were now selling <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1565581&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">more e-books than all print formats combined</a>. And literary agents began <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/a-bad-week-for-agents/" target="_blank">attracting negative headlines</a> as they attempting to figure out a way to make money in this new world. The old order was fragmenting, and something messy and chaotic (and beautiful) was emerging in its stead.</p>
<p>My first e-book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004YTI01Y" target="_blank">If You Go Into The Woods</a> went live, quickly followed by another short, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051ZG7AG/" target="_blank">Transfection</a>. I sold more than 150 copies in my first month and was enjoying the process so much that I pulled my novel from the last three agents considering it. I was going all in. And to celebrate, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/haiku-10-never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-carbohydrate/" target="_blank">I wrote a haiku</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June</strong></p>
<p>In a slow news month, a major US agency (kind of) <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/major-us-agency-moves-into-publishing-or-do-they/" target="_blank">moved into publishing</a>, JK Rowling <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/jk-rowling-really-is-self-publishing-a-closer-look/" target="_blank">moved into self-publishing</a>, and John Locke announced <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/john-locke-sells-a-million-books-then-tells-the-world-how-he-did-it/" target="_blank">the sale of his millionth Kindle book</a> - and that was just the last week in the month. Earlier in June, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/indie-writers-making-history-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">two indie authors made history in the UK</a>, the malevolent hawkers of 99c books were accused of <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/exploding-myths-destroying-minds/" target="_blank">destroying minds</a>, publishers were charged with <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/04/more-bad-behaviour-from-agents-publishers-vs-naipaul/" target="_blank">systematically under-reporting e-book sales</a> (and underpaying their authors), and VS Naipul was outed as a <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/06/04/more-bad-behaviour-from-agents-publishers-vs-naipaul/" target="_blank">prize mysogynist</a>.</p>
<p>My plan to release <em>A Storm Hits Valparaíso</em> hit the skids when I got an editorial report which sent me running in the wrong direction for most of the month. My current editor saved me from making a complete hash of it, but I decided to park the project towards the end of June and began work on <em>Let&#8217;s Get Digital </em>instead while I considered her suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>July</strong></p>
<p>Borders <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/borders-inches-closer-to-liquidation-what-happens-next/" target="_blank">inched closer to liquidation</a>, print continued <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/adult-fiction-print-sales-collapse-down-25-7-in-first-half-of-2011/" target="_blank">its death spiral</a>, being pounded into submission by the <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/the-relentless-march-of-e-books/" target="_blank">relentless march of e-books</a>, and Amazon began signing successful self-publishers to their new imprint mystery and thriller imprint, Thomas &amp; Mercer, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/indie-author-j-carson-black-agrees-publishing-deal-with-amazon/" target="_blank">adding J Carson Black</a> to their existing roster of Joe Konrath, Blake Crouch, and Barry Eisler.</p>
<p>I released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DC68NI/" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s Get Digital: How To Self-Publish, And Why You Should</a> which quickly became my top-seller and almost cracked the Top 1000. I made the PDF version free <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/lets-get-digital/" target="_blank">here</a> which was so popular it crashed WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>August</strong></p>
<p>Amazon continued to add successful indies to their roster, signing <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/exclusive-indie-author-michael-wallace-signs-5-book-deal-with-amazon/" target="_blank">Michael Wallace</a> and <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/indie-author-scott-nicholson-signs-two-book-deal-with-amazon/" target="_blank">Scott Nicholson</a>. John Locke signed a <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/john-locke-signs-print-distribution-deal-with-simon-schuster/" target="_blank">highly unusual print distribution deal</a> with Simon &amp; Schuster, which not only allowed him to retain e-rights, but <em>all</em> his rights &#8211; essentially hiring the publisher as his printer and distributor and paying <em>them</em> royalties. The arch-defenders of trade publishing were dancing in the aisles when the comprehensive <a href="http://publishers.org/press/44/" target="_blank">BISG report</a> was released appearing to show the industry in rude health. However, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/publishing-not-in-such-bad-shape-after-all/" target="_blank">all was not as it seemed</a>. Finally, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/apples-lawyers-get-busy/" target="_blank">a class action suit was launched against Apple and five major publishers</a>, alleging e-book price-fixing.</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s Get Digital</em> made a big splash picking up some key endorsements, some big book blog reviews, and some tasty blurb quotes. The resultant sales meant I recouped the $1,000 publication costs in just over a month. I started working on the &#8220;final pass&#8221; of <em>A Storm Hits Valparaíso</em>, but soon realized that it needed wholesale changes.</p>
<p><strong>September</strong></p>
<p>I was on holidays for the first two weeks of the month and have zero idea what happened in the publishing industry (btw, if Stephen King decided to self-publish or anything like that, someone should really fill me in). In the second half of the month, <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/amazon-launches-in-spain-kindle-store-by-year-end/" target="_blank">Amazon opened their Spanish site</a>, Scott Nicholson shared <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/share-the-wealth-a-radical-solution-to-translation-costs/" target="_blank">a radical solution to translation costs</a>, and <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/amazon-throw-down-the-gauntlet-four-new-devices-basic-kindle-79-tablet-199/" target="_blank">four new Kindles were launched</a>.</p>
<p>I had a huge slump in sales, and started to think outside the box about how to turn it around. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned though as I hadn&#8217;t released a new title in some time, and my primary aim was to get my novel out, once it was at the required standard. I thought that would take another week or two. The best laid plans of mice and men&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>October</strong></p>
<p>Amazon kicked off the month by <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/amazon-opens-kindle-store-in-france-basic-kindle-for-99-euro-surcharge-abolished/" target="_blank">opening the French Kindle Store</a> and <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/indie-author-traci-hohenstein-signs-four-book-deal-with-amazon/" target="_blank">signing yet another indie</a>. Kobo responded by signing <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/kobo-partners-with-major-european-booksellers-as-global-english-e-book-sales-surge/" target="_blank">two key partnerships in both France and the UK</a> which could revolutionize their fortunes in both markets. Finally, I looked at <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/the-european-market-whats-slowing-growth-whats-driving-it/" target="_blank">what was driving growth in European markets, and what was slowing it</a>.</p>
<p>It was another slow sales month for me, but exciting things were starting to happen. I signed deals to translate <em>Let&#8217;s Get Digital</em> into French and Spanish, and launched <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/crowdfunding-a-novel-turning-a-profit-before-you-publish/" target="_blank">a crowdfunding exercise</a> to cover the costs of publishing my next novel.</p>
<p><strong>November</strong></p>
<p>The month opened with some (more) bad news for large publishers: AAP figures showed that new e-book revenue <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/warning-signs-for-large-publishers-in-august-aap-figures/" target="_blank">wasn&#8217;t quite replacing the fall off in print</a>. <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/amazon-faces-serious-international-competition-from-japan/" target="_blank">Kobo were purchased</a> in a deal which could have huge implications for the international e-book market. Penguin launched <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/penguin-launches-rip-off-self-publishing-service-targeting-inexperienced-writers/" target="_blank">a vanity-esque self-publishing imprint</a>, which attracted widespread criticism. And a best-selling self-published novel <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/bestselling-self-published-novel-inexplicably-disappears-from-amazon-uk-causing-huge-lost-sales/" target="_blank">inexplicably disappeared from Amazon UK</a>.</p>
<p>My sales finally turned around, November besting September and October combined. <em>Let&#8217;s Get Digital</em> got it&#8217;s 50th five star review, and I celebrated by raising the price to $3.99. I was interested to see if sales would remain the same, or dip. They rose, giving me my second best month in terms of income, and by far the best outside the time of a new release. My crowdfunding exercise was oversubscribed, generating $2,300 in pre-orders for <em>A Storm Hits Valparaíso</em> &#8211; which blew me away. It also had the happy side effect of putting in place a strict deadline for completing and releasing the book.</p>
<p><strong>December</strong></p>
<p>Amazon owned December in news terms: they <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/amazon-opens-kindle-stores-in-spain-italy-abolishes-surcharge/" target="_blank">opened Kindle Stores in Spain and Italy</a>, shocked veteran writers by <a href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/?p=6076" target="_blank">paying royalties in time for Christmas</a>, announced they were selling (well) over <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1565581&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">a million Kindles a week</a>, and, just when we thought we had the self-publishing game figured out, tearing up the rule-book with <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/how-much-do-you-want-to-get-paid-tomorrow/" target="_blank">KDP Select</a>.</p>
<p>As for me, well, let me see&#8230; I&#8217;m sure something happened this month&#8230; oh yeah, I published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OPORV8" target="_blank">A Storm Hits Valparaíso</a>. It only took me <a href="http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/around-the-world-in-80-drafts/" target="_blank">five-and-half-years</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>I was going to do a big post on New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but I&#8217;m keeping it simple this year: <em>write great stories and lots of them</em>.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone! Thank you for all your support this year. My professional career has really turned around in 2011 &#8211; selling around 1,800 books in my first seven months, hitting 5,000 free downloads, and pulling in well over $5,000 &#8211; and that&#8217;s all down to you guys.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making enough to live off, but for the first time in my writing career I can see a path to that point &#8211; and that&#8217;s a beautiful thing. I&#8217;m getting checks from Amazon each month which are paying my rent and lots of bills, and they are getting bigger all the time.</p>
<p>The market feels like it has doubled since December 25th. Probably because there are millions of new readers out there filling up their devices right now.</p>
<p>Go get &#8216;em!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Cairngorm mountains are home to some beautiful and uncommon wild flowers - and here are just a few of them, discovered on a trek up Carn Ban Mor in June 2010.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&amp;blog=256907&amp;post=2018&amp;subd=freshlypressed&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms7-e1325685432340.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026" title="Panorama" src="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms7-e1325685432340.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="321" /></a>On a hot day in June 2010, we climbed Carn Ban Mor, one of the peaks in the Cairngorms.  Our quest was for dotterel, elusive little plovers which arrive on the high Cairngorms plateau every spring, and breed on the windswept summits before heading off again at the end of the summer.</p>
<p>We succeeded in getting great views of dotterel, but we also encountered some wonderful wild flowers on the walk up.  These provided a good excuse to take photographs and drink in the views as we rested our weary limbs.</p>
<p>Carn Ban Mor rises to 1,052 metres (3,090 feet) above sea level, and it isn’t classed as a ‘Munro’ simply because its near neighbour, Sgor Gaoith, rises to 3,668 feet and there isn’t enough of a dip in between them.  That sounds too much like bureaucracy to me!</p>
<div id="attachment_2025" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms6-e1325685393582.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2025 " title="Carn Ban Mor" src="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms6-e1325685393582.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking back, showing the snow fields</p></div>
<p>The ascent begins from Glen Feshie, to the south of Aviemore.  A rough track leads through some woods before emerging onto the open hillside;  the rest of the way is along a stony but well-defined path right up to the summit, which appears impossibly distant from lower levels.</p>
<p>In the boggy areas close to the woodland we found Fragrant Orchid (<em>Gymnadenia conopsea</em>), Heath Spotted-orchid (<em>Dactylorhiza maculata</em>) and Alpine Starflower (<em>Trientalis europaea)</em>, also known as Chickweed Wintergreen.</p>
<div id="attachment_2029" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2029" title="Fragrant Orchid" src="http://thehazeltree.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cairngorms12.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fragrant Orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea)</p></div>

<p>Cold winds were blowing off the still-lying snow field near the top, even though the midday sun was baking.  Underfoot, the ground was dusty with the heat, and the grasses were crisp and parched through lack of rain.  (Remember this was 2010 &#8211; the scene would have been very different last summer!)  The beginnings of mountain streams created damper patches, and here we discovered Marsh Violet (<em>Viola palustris</em>) and Marsh Marigold (<em>Caltha palustris</em>).</p>

<p>At the summit, bright pink mats of Moss Campion (<em>Silene acaulis</em>) were growing among the scattered boulders, along with Alpine Azalea (<em>Loiseleuria procumbens</em>).  Even on a hot summer’s day, with nothing but a few innocent-looking white clouds floating in a clear blue sky, it was easy to see how harsh and inhospitable this landscape is&#8230; and how lucky we were to experience it in such conditions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if the Mayans, doomsday prophesiers , soothsayers and televangelists are right and 2012 is the end of history as we know it or the end of mankind; it&#8217;s going to be one heck of a year for geeks and nerds alike. This year&#8217;s going to see the return of favorites such as Doctor Who and Fringe, as well as a slew of new video games and Hollywood blockbusters. Whatever may come of this year, it&#8217;s certain to be the year of the geek. That all being said, I&#8217;ve taken it upon myself to compile a list (in no particular order) of some of the more noteworthy things to look forward to this year.</p>
<p><strong>15. <strong>The Hunger Games Comes to Film<br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I&#8217;ve heard a lot of buzz going on about this one.<em> The Hunger Games</em> takes place in an unidentified future time period after the destruction of <a title="North America" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>, in a nation known as <a title="The Hunger Games universe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Panem">Panem</a>. Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol and thirteen surrounding, poorer districts. District 12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly <a title="Appalachia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia">Appalachia</a>. As punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol, every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by lottery and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised event in which the participants, or &#8220;tributes,&#8221; must fight to the <a title="Death" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">death</a> in a dangerous, outdoor arena, controlled by the Capitol, until only one remains. The story follows 16-year-old <a title="Katniss Everdeen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a>, a girl from <a title="The Hunger Games universe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#District_12">District 12</a>, who volunteers for the 74th Games in place of her younger sister, <a title="Primrose Everdeen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primrose_Everdeen">Primrose</a>. Also participating from District 12 is <a title="Peeta Mellark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeta_Mellark">Peeta Mellark</a>, a baker&#8217;s son whom Katniss knows from school and who once gave her bread when her family was starving. I haven&#8217;t read the book, but that doesn&#8217;t stop me from looking forward to the film.</p>

<p><strong>14. <strong>The Avengers Movie<br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Now I&#8217;m a huge fan of comics, mostly the Marvel franchise (not that I don&#8217;t like DC), and as such, I&#8217;m a fan of The Avengers. From what I hear, this year will see &#8220;earths mightiest heroes&#8221; grouped together on the big screen. It&#8217;s about time. I&#8217;ve seen all the separate movies that have led up to this point and I&#8217;ve liked all but one of them.  This year we&#8217;ll all have a chance to see Thor! Captain America! Iron Man! The Hulk! Nick Fury! And the rest in action on the silver screen. It&#8217;s something definitely worth waiting for, though the question of how they plan on giving each Avenger the proper amount of time on the screen as they go up against Loki and from what I&#8217;ve read(spoiler alert)&#8230; possibly the Scrulls. This film will either be worthy of comic book fan movie of the year, or it&#8217;ll be a huge bomb. Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s not the later of the two. For anyone of you unfamiliar with the Avengers should check out their Wikipedia page by clicking here (<a title="Avengers (comics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_%28comics%29">Avengers</a>)</p>

<p><strong>13.</strong> <strong>iPhone 5</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of the many fans out there of Apple products; namely the iPod touch, iPad, and of course iPhone, so it&#8217;s no wonder the iPhone 5 managed to find its way onto my little&#8230;not soo little list. A lot of folk seemed disappointed at the release of the iPhone 4S, but those who didn&#8217;t buy one will have their day in the sun as it were in the late summer or fall of 2012 with the release of the iPhone 5 which is a complete redesign of the iconic device. It&#8217;s also said that the new iPhone 5 will be sporting a larger screen as well as a sleeker body design. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t wait to try it out.</p>

<p><strong>12. Zombie Apocalypse </strong></p>
<p>Now i&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re probably confused as to how the Zombie Apocalypse made its way onto my auspicious list of things to look forward to this year, right.?. But if you put into consideration the growing social unease regarding the state the world is currently in, irreversible damage to the earth, and dwindling natural resources, maybe a good push of the big red reset button is just what the doctor ordered. And what better way to usher in that restart than with a Zombie Apocalypse? Sure, some of your friends and neighbors might become flesh eating ghouls, but that&#8217;s the price of progress. And look on the bright side, some of your least favorite people might end up zombies.. and you know what that means. Time to grab your shotguns, shovels, swords and the like and get some undead revenge.</p>

<p><strong>11. <strong>PS Vita</strong> and the <strong>Wii U</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>They&#8217;re not necessarily games in of themselves, but on one hand you have a handheld device that can mimic/replicate PS3 experiences on a smaller screen, and on the other, we have a sequel to a console that has pretty much helped to bring gaming to the masses as; it’s definitely a good time to be a gamer, regardless of what particular console you prefer. Sony&#8217;s PS Vita will attempt to take some of the handheld gaming market back from Nintendo thanks largely to the device&#8217;s use of Augmented Reality &#8212; a technology that utilizes a built in camera to juxtapose gaming action with real world environments. The Vita promises to translate all our favourite home console experiences onto it, and the Wii U promises better third party support, along with a range of top tier first party games that we’ve come to expect from Nintendo. Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><strong>10. <strong>Avengers vs. X-Men</strong></strong></p>
<p>Marvel is billing <em>Avengers vs. X-Men</em> as &#8220;the biggest comic book event in history.&#8221; Who knows if the 12-issue miniseries will even remotely come close to impacting the comic book  industry as much as DC&#8217;s recent New 52 initiative. Here&#8217;s a video that&#8217;ll tell you a lot more about it than I&#8217;ve managed to.</p>

<p><strong>9. Apple TV</strong></p>
<p>Steve Jobs told Walter Isaacson that he &#8220;cracked&#8221; the TV in his biography. Will we see a TV from the company, complete with some sort of Siri-based voice controls? One can only hope. The Apple TV is a <a title="Small form factor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form_factor">small form factor</a> <a title="Computer networking device" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking_device">network appliance</a> designed to play digital content originating from the <a title="ITunes Store" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a>, <a title="Netflix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>, <a title="YouTube" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a title="Flickr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">Flickr</a>, <a title="MobileMe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobileMe">MobileMe</a>, <a title="MLB.tv" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.tv">MLB.tv</a>, <a title="NBA League Pass" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass">NBA League Pass</a>, <a title="NHL GameCenter (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NHL_GameCenter&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">NHL GameCenter</a> or any <a title="Mac OS X" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X">Mac OS X</a> or <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a> computer running <a title="ITunes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes">iTunes</a> onto an <a title="Enhanced-definition television" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced-definition_television">enhanced-definition</a> or <a title="High-definition television" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television">high-definition</a> <a title="Widescreen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen">widescreen</a> <a title="Television" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television">television</a>.</p>

<p><strong>8. iPad 3</strong></p>
<p>Given the product cycle Apple adheres to, you can also expect an upgrade to the iconic tablet in March (as was the case in 2011) It&#8217;s expected that the new iPad 3 will come with major upgrading. Some of the rumored specs of the device are that it may come equipped with an enhanced retina display feature to its 10-inch screen. It may also come with a 2048A<span style="font-size:x-small;">—</span>1536 resolution display. It may also become &#8220;modestly thicker&#8221; (0.7 mm) to accommodate the twin light bar system needed for its higher-resolution display. Next thing you know, all TV&#8217;s will be replaced by iPads hanging on walls. Who&#8217;s got two thumbs and is looking forward to that? This guy.</p>

<p><strong>7. <strong>Tron: Uprising</strong></strong></p>
<p>This 10-part animated series will bridge the gap between <em>Tron</em> and <em>Tron: Legacy</em> by telling the story of a young program&#8217;s revolution against the tyrannical Clu 2. Despite having a new character in a leading role, the series will feature familiar faces like Kevin Flynn and Tron himself. The show takes its visual cues from the sequel film as opposed to the retro-like look of the original <em>Tron</em> film. Not that that&#8217;s a bad thing. The animation in the series will be a mixture of 2-D and 3-D  and is said to be stunning. Even better is the fact that the show&#8217;s voices are provided by Elijah Wood, Lance Henriksen and Bruce Boxleitner. Even though this is conceived as a limited run series, any further exploration of the <em>Tron</em> world is a good thing in my book. Let&#8217;s hope this is better than the Animatrix was.</p>

<p><strong>6. Doctor Who: Season 7</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>From what I&#8217;ve heard, the Ponds may be leaving the company of the Doctor and there&#8217;s only one more year until the 50th anniversary?! Since the skilled hands of Stephen Moffat took over the beloved science fiction/fantasy series it has been a nonstop thrill ride through the big bowl of wibbly wobbly timey wimey&#8230; stuff with the Eleventh incarnation of the Doctor portrayed by Matt Smith.  Now he is promising to not only get rid of beloved companions, Amy and Rory Pond but there will be no two parters on a show known for its cliffhangers. How will this effect the show?? Will there be more new villainous villains more villainous than the Silence and the Weeping Angels??</p>

<p><strong>5. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked quite a few times about The Hobbit in a previous blog or two, but that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m purely excited about the film. Any chance to see Ian McKellen back on the big screen as Gandalf is worth the wait and watch. Even if he&#8217;s coming back as Gandalf the Grey as opposed to Gandalf the White. If you don&#8217;t know, The Hobbit is the latest Tolkien based film by Peter Jackson to take place in the world of Middle Earth. Though you won&#8217;t see Gimli, Legolas, Eragorn or Borimear, there&#8217;s sure to be a slew of likable characters in their stead.. and far more dwarves. If the world&#8217;s going to end this year, at least I&#8217;ll get to see this film before it happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://randomgeekings.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-20110716024053789.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303" title="THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY" src="http://randomgeekings.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-20110716024053789.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="395" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. <em><strong>The Woman In Black</strong></em> </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be good to see Daniel Radcliffe back on the big screen, even if it&#8217;s not as Harry Potter, the boy who lived. Based on Susan Hill’s 1983 novel of the same name, which was also adapted into a long-running stage play, <em>The Woman in Black </em>is about a young lawyer who encounters a malevolent ghost in a small British town. From what little I&#8217;ve seen of the preview or trailer for the film, I&#8217;m excited. How&#8217;s Mr. Radcliffe going to deal with this malevolent specter of a woman without his trusty wand in hand? I can&#8217;t wait to find out. This post-Potter film promises to be a winner. Hollywood needs more good old-fashioned ghost stories like this one.</p>

<p><strong>3. Playstation 4</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Sony Playstation is well into the development of its next generation console. Both Sony and Microsoft have publicly gone on record that their current consoles will have life cycles of 10 years, the PS3 was released in 2006. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re likely to wait until the very end of that shelf life. As for rumours about the PS4: Blu-Ray for certain, portable gaming data, a redesign of the PSN, more power (up to ten times more than the PS3 according to some estimates) and key for fans with shelves full of older titles: backwards compatibility, and who doesn&#8217;t love backwards compatibility? I know I do.</p>

<p><strong>2. Video Games</strong></p>
<p>Tomb Raider: 2012 sees a re-boot of one of the defining games of a generation as Lara Croft is due to return in Tomb Raider. With a trailer first unveiled at E3 last summer this new version of the game serves as a prequel to the original. Developed by Crystal Dynamics it has high hopes for this latest edition in the hugely successful series which sees the heroine stranded on a mysterious island and fighting for survival. Who doesn&#8217;t like a good survival game.?.</p>
<p><a href="http://randomgeekings.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tomb_raider_2012_video_game-t2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307" title="tomb_raider_2012_video_game-t2" src="http://randomgeekings.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tomb_raider_2012_video_game-t2.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V: One of the most controversial game series over the last decade 2012 could see a new edition to the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The trailer alone made shock waves around the gaming community when it was released in early November. Set back in San Andreas it left more questions than answers for the game&#8217;s fans. Who is the middle aged man featured in the trailer? Will it be as violent as previous titles? Will it prove big enough to break Call of Duty&#8217;s strangle hold on the video game market? Whatever the answers are,  if it does make it onto the shelves next year Rockstar North will surely have the biggest selling game of 2012 on its hands.</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3: This is one game that does have a release date confirmed for 2012 (March 9th if you&#8217;re wondering). You play Commander Shepherd taking on ancient alien race The Reapers. Following their all out invasion Earth has been captured and the Galaxy is on the verge of annihilation. And you&#8217;re the only thing standing in their way. So far so standard for fans of the sci-fi genre. But what makes this series&#8217; different is it wide ranging game play. It boasts multiple endings which play out depending on the decisions you make during the game and the type of fighting you do it&#8217;s likely to earn another sure fire hit for developer Bioware (Reminiscent of the &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; books, I&#8217;d say.)</p>

<p><strong>1. Windows 8 Tablet</strong></p>
<p>From what I understand, Samsung and HP will be the first makers of any Windows 8 tablets which will use the “Metro” interface on tablet that is presently used in Windows 7 Phone .  These tablets are going to be thin and light with lots of supports, Apps, an App store, and it will run on ARM, Intel and AMD chips. The price of these tablets will be similar to Android tablets. Though I&#8217;m a huge fan of Apple and all its many fine products, I&#8217;m still a PC user, so while I look forward to Apples new products, I can&#8217;t help but find myself intrigued by the Windows 8 Tablet. Will it be enough to steal me away from Apples iPad 3? Only time can tell.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_41501.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51" title="IMG_4150" src="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_41501.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>That&#8217;s my niece and she&#8217;s about the only person in the world who would be impressed by my scrawny body and sorry excuse for muscles. Not only is she impressed I dare say she&#8217;s mesmerized. So I got to thinking&#8230;this having a baby thing might not be such a bad idea if they&#8217;re this easy to impress. I&#8217;ve done lots of otherwise unimpressive things in my life that all the sudden will be very impressive to a baby.</p>
<p><a href="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/guitar.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-53" title="guitar" src="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/guitar.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I have no musical talent at all unless you count singing in the church choir before my voice changed. But sometimes I wish I did have musical talent. That&#8217;s me playing air guitar to Sweet Child o&#8217; Mine at my wedding. I was rockin&#8217; out and for a minute I really thought I was Slash. Notice the bride however &#8211; not impressed. If she were a baby? She&#8217;d be very impressed.</p>
<p><a href="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_1384.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-54" title="IMG_1384" src="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_1384.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Here we have the common over mitt. Usually very boring &#8211; not to a baby! You think that&#8217;s impressive, wait until you see my place mats.</p>
<p><a href="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_1795.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-55" title="IMG_1795" src="http://misguidedparent.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_1795.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I&#8217;m a really crappy fisherman. The one time my dad took me fishing when I was little I ended up throwing the entire fishing rod into the ocean. But, a baby would have NO CLUE just how pathetic this fish really is. I could convince her it&#8217;s the biggest fish in the world.</p>
<p>Since I expect to have many more unimpressive moments in my life it seemed like a good time to have a baby!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mainstreetmusingsblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/unknown.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-716" title="Unknown" src="http://mainstreetmusingsblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a>If you haven’t heard, asphyxiation and foot binding aren’t just for waterboarding anymore.  Water torture has a frozen counterpart and it’s called <a title="All about snowboarding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding" target="_blank">snowboarding</a>.</p>
<p>Snowboarding is a test of oxygen deprivation.  Specifically, it tests whether a person can survive the Colorado Rockies where he finds himself gasping for air at 10,000 feet above sea level, a place generally reserved for mule deer, mountain goats, and the skeletal remains of the pioneering Donner party.</p>
<p>The reason snowboarding must be conducted on a steep mountaintop is so the boarder can gain momentum while sliding down a snow-covered slope on a single board without relying on brakes.  The board is about the size of a small surfboard, yet when you’re careening down the mountain at 40 miles per hour, shrinks down to a Popsicle stick.</p>
<p>Snowboarding is often compared to skiing because in both sports, you fall.   An important difference is that skiers possess an emergency release mechanism on their bindings which allows them to fall unencumbered by skis.  This helps them avoid broken bones and suffer only knee injuries and concussions before they have to hike back up the fifty feet to unbury and retrieve their skis.</p>
<p>Snowboarders, on the other hand, are firmly attached at the feet in non-release snowboard bindings.  The exception is when the snowboarder decides to adjust his strap-in bindings while suspended in midair on the chairlift and accidentally catapults the board into the skull of an unlucky gaper.  In such cases the snowboarder invariably experiences tremendous remorse and yells down comforting words like,  “Dude.  Can I have my board back?”</p>
<p>Considering that both feet are bound to a relatively narrow snowboard, it is logical that falling is the leading cause of injury in snowboarding as the boarder is launched at a 90-degree angle at rocket speed and ragdolls downhill before finally coming to a halt with the help of a snowboarder, skier, or mature pine tree.</p>
<p>Compared to skiing, snowboarding injuries are usually to the upper extremities and the ankle.  This is because when snowboarders lose their balance they can’t “step out” a leg to recover, as they are shackled to the board.  The instinctive protective reaction during a fall is to outstretch a hand towards the ground (or towards God if the fall is off a cliff) to break the landing.</p>
<p>“Shredding,” “grinding” the rail, and “inverted” aerials are all fitting terms for snowboarding because they describe not only moves and stunts on the board, but also what happens to some snow boarder’s bones and ligaments after a wipe-out.</p>
<p>Some of you parents may have already learned this the hard way if your child has ever been rushed to the emergency room with a broken right wrist and a minor concussion after taking an ugly crash while soaring down the half-pipe, as my son has.  If you’ve been fortunate not to have yet experienced this, think twice when your child innocently asks, “Can I try snowboarding this winter?”</p>
<p>If, in a weak moment, you lose control of your senses and say yes, be sure to invest in a good snowboard helmet and wrist guards.  Otherwise, encourage the pursuit of a less harmful sport, like mountain climbing, ultimate fighting or skydiving.</p>

<p>Now that the festive season is winding down, decorations are being packed away, people begin their latest keep fit plan and try to stick to new resolutions I find myself sat wondering what 2012 will bring for the wonderful people that I had the privilege of getting to know and fell in love with in Meheba Refugee camp this summer in Zambia.</p>
<p>I spent 3 gloriously hot weeks sleeping in tents, cooking local food, visiting the &#8216;long drop&#8217;, walking to collect water and introducing adults and children to the beauty of books, playing games, having fun and sharing tears. I was lucky enough to form close connections with a handful of people whose stories will stay in my heart and fuel my nightmares for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Meheba is an established camp. This means that the refugee&#8217;s whole lives are here most of the young children that I encountered have only ever lived in Meheba. They are not victims of droughts, famine or natural disasters but instead tend to be political victims who were &#8216;lucky&#8217; enough to escape their homeland. Carrying their children on their back, trekking across mountains and wading through rivers until they found the safety that Zambia offers.</p>
<p>The refugees come from a variety of countries: DR Congo, Rwanda, Angola, Somalia, Burundi, 2 from Tanzania and 1 from Zimbabwe. When they arrive at the camp the UNHCR <a href="http://www.unhcr.org.uk/">http://www.unhcr.org.uk/</a> provide them with the materials and a time frame to build their own house. Until that house is built they are given a sizeable tent to live in. They are also given crops and tools to grow their own food. Any food that they do not eat themselves can be traded for additional items-wheel barrows, bikes, wooden posts&#8230;potatoes and carrots are the currency of this happy land.</p>
<p>The first words that I uttered as we entered the camp were &#8216;but where does everyone live?&#8217; It is huge, there is a lake, 7 schools, one high school and 1 free medical centre and even a market. It sounds luxurious&#8230;to be honest it is when I compare what I lived in to the pictures of emergency refugee camps that are erected over night for famine relief.</p>
<p>However, it is not quite Buckingham Palace and its biggest downfall is its size. The camp is sectioned into 8 zones A-G. It takes almost three hours to walk from one end to the other. A 6-hour round trip if you live in zone G and want to go to zone A.</p>
<p>Of course the medical centre and high school are in zone A so that local Zambians can also use these facilities. That means if somebody in Zone G or F needs medical attention they need to leave aside 6 hours of their precious time to seek it&#8230;time that they would usually use to plough the field, bake bread, and tend to their crops&#8230;they will never ever seek it. Instead they go to their local witch who we interacted with closely for a period of 4 days but that is a story for another time!</p>
<p>It also means that local Zambians and not the refugees use the expensive high school, which costs 1.5 million Kwacha to attend. They don&#8217;t accept their potatoes or carrots.</p>
<p>This infuriated me beyond belief and I had many heated discussions with the UNHCR. Surely these facilities are for the refugees, they should be centralised and accessible to all&#8230;.&#8217;but the world doesn&#8217;t work that way madam. There are strict laws that we must follow.&#8217;</p>
<p>I refused to sit back and do nothing. I frequently used one of the UNHCR&#8217;s jeeps to pick up the injured or sick and drove them the hour bumpy ride to the medical centre. Not a long-term solution but hopefully I helped out a few people and in return the love and appreciation I received was over-whelming. This small act got me invited to countless feasts in my honour and I was even invited to sacrifice the pet chicken (quite the experience).</p>
<div id="attachment_92" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bluntsbookblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/301292_10150774059300441_792095440_20423242_4609610_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-92" title="301292_10150774059300441_792095440_20423242_4609610_n" src="http://bluntsbookblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/301292_10150774059300441_792095440_20423242_4609610_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My baby friend and I</p></div>
<p>The one decision that I simply could not accept, but unfortunately had no power to effect even the slightest change was to do with the plans for the repatriation of the Rwandans. Deeming that their country is now settled for them to return the UNHCR moved out 200 people as a test and gave them free transportation back to Rwanda (how anyone’s life can be used as a test is beyond me). Of course these people have not been heard from since, why would they when they were chased out for marrying the wrong person, saying the wrong thing or looking at the wrong person. These people are still wanted!</p>
<p>The UNHCR still plan to send the rest of the Rwandans &#8211; around 1000 adults and children back to Rwanda in December 2012. The Rwandans are beside themselves. If the decision is not changed then they have decided that they will go through with a mass suicide. They told us that &#8216;they would rather take our own lives, our own children&#8217;s lives then go back to torture and hate&#8217;. Thinking about these beautiful people looking into our eyes and telling us their story- their eyes full of fear and ours full of tears still leaves me somewhat emotional today.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 190px"><a href="http://bluntsbookblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/293449_10150774173390441_792095440_20425609_6384914_a.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-90" title="293449_10150774173390441_792095440_20425609_6384914_a" src="http://bluntsbookblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/293449_10150774173390441_792095440_20425609_6384914_a.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The dancing lady.</p></div>
<p>The UNHCR must have the most difficult job in the world. Of course they don&#8217;t want to send these people back but with Zambians discovering gold and diamonds in the refugee camp soil I fear that a new mine will strip away the hopes and maybe even lives of yet more innocent people.</p>
<p>All my Christmas and New Years wishes go out to these beautiful people. I hope that decisions are changed, sense is seen and battles are won. In the words of Justin (a 10 year old Congolese boy) as long as everyone &#8216;says their prayers and stays cool like a banana&#8230;Hakuna Matata.&#8217;</p>
