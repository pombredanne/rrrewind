			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://the170.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cabaret2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-987" title="Cabaret" src="http://the170.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cabaret2.jpeg?w=281&#038;h=400" alt="" width="281" height="400" /></a>As is noted in the <a title="170 Greatest Films" href="http://the170.wordpress.com/170-greatest-films/">170 Greatest Films</a> section of this blog, the foundation of the 170 list is AFI&#8217;s original <a title="AFI 100 Years ... 100 Movies" href="http://www.afi.com/100years/movies.aspx" target="_blank">&#8220;100 Years &#8230; 100 Movies&#8221;</a> list from 1997. Ten years later, the esteemed organization took another look at the greatest American films with a new, fresh perspective. <em>Citizen Kane</em> topped the list both times, but there were some modifications in 2007. Some films fell off the list. Some were added. Among those added was this 1972 classic, which I recently watched for the first time.</p>
<p><em><a title="Cabaret" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068327/" target="_blank">Cabaret</a></em> was <em><a title="The Godfather" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/" target="_blank">The Godfather</a>&#8216;</em>s primary competition at the Oscar ceremony that honored some of the greatest films of 1972. (<em>The Godfather</em> ranked third on the original 1997 AFI list, and jumped to the runner-up position in 2007.) Many consider Coppola&#8217;s film to be &#8220;the perfect film,&#8221; but there were some doubts it would win the top prize at the Oscars that year. Throughout the night, <em>Cabaret</em> beat <em>The Godfather</em> in several categories. In total, <em>Cabaret</em> won an impressive eight statues out of its 10 nominations. <em>The Godfather</em>, however, took home just three out of 10 nominations. (Well, technically, only two went home since Marlon Brando refused his Best Actor award.)</p>
<p><span id="more-984"></span></p>
<p>Though <em>Cabaret</em> won awards for Bob Fosse (Best Director), Liza Minnelli (Best Actress), Joel Grey (Best Supporting Actor), cinematography, music, and editing, among others, it was bested for the top prize by the classic gangster film. Despite the musical&#8217;s domination that night, it hasn&#8217;t achieved the appeal of its closest competitor. Nonetheless, the film is a classic in its own right, blending some superb writing, terrific acting, and flawless direction and music.</p>
<p><em>Cabaret</em> is a classic American musical where the characters don&#8217;t burst out in spontaneous song and dance. The music is integrated in an authentic way that only enhances the film, rather than distract from the plot. Check out my <a title="Favorite Films" href="http://the170.wordpress.com/favorite-films/">Favorite Films</a> section for more information about the 1972 classic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, good morning blog fans, back after a week or so in the lovely sunshine of southern Spain where the Monkey’s keeper and I have been painting the landscapes around us with <a href="http://www.paint-andalucia.com/AboutUs.php">Paint Andalucía</a>. Suffice to say we had a great time and more stories will come out as the week(s) go by. Fi and I were a bit unsure. Having never been on a group holiday before we were a bit wary. You know, you don’t want to have to put up with the whiner or some clinging hanger-on for a week. It could really spoil things. Thankfully, though, not the case here. We were a group of two ladies from California, a couple from Israel, a couple of ladies from Hemel Hempstead, one from London and me and Fi. We had a great time with no drips or idiots and we just went with the flow of an amazing week.</p>
<p>Our tutor and guide for the week was the lovely, talented and creative artist<a href="http://www.annamartin.co.uk/"> Anna Martin</a> (ably assisted on this occasion by Geraldine McDonald, I hope I’ve got the spelling right), whose work is rich with texture, colour and inspiration.</p>
<p>If you think you’re gonna come here and paint prissy landscapes guided by Anna’s hand then think again (though, if that’s what you want to do, then fine). Anna’s guidance is to get you thinking and reacting in a much more fluid and free way. But – more of painting in the next instalment. Firstly, where were we ? !</p>
<p>Torrox Pueblo – a lovely hillside village about 50 kilometres east of Malaga with a serenely peaceful plaza where you can while away a balmy evening, or sunlit siesta, sipping wine or cerveza from the bars. Tapas aplenty.</p>
<div id="attachment_470" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0154.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-470" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0154.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680" alt="" width="1024" height="680" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Torrox Pueblo..............la Plaza</p></div>
<p>The village itself is about 5 kilometres inland, Torrox Costa being the beach resort, which leaves it exquisitely free of the beach ball and soccer shirt sonics of other Spanish holiday villages which hug the coast.</p>
<p>Saturday was “welcome and intro” day and after our settling in period we reconvened in the evening for the first of what were to be several excellent tapas dinners in the village square. Food would play a significant part in our week of paint. It was bound to – we were in the Med – and it was universally outstanding !</p>
<p>Sunday was first real painting day followed by a great evening dinner, again. Monday was a trip to Frigiliani for sketching and an afternoon banquet at “Maria’s” . Tuesday we visited the <a href="http://fincafantastica.biz/Acebuchal.html">Alcazaba</a>, a Moorish fortification in Malaga, to paint.</p>
<div id="attachment_473" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0073.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-473" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0073.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680" alt="" width="1024" height="680" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Putting the World to rights in Frigiliani</p></div>
<p>Wednesday was rest day though Fi and I spent the day painting the square in Torrox Pueblo. On Thursday we tripped out to the wonderfully evocative village of<a href="http://fincafantastica.biz/Acebuchal.html"> Acebuchal</a>, the village of Ghosts, in the mountains above Malaga.</p>
<div id="attachment_475" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0161.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-475" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0161.jpg?w=680&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="680" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Acebuchal</p></div>
<div id="attachment_476" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0170.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-476" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0170.jpg?w=680&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="680" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Acebuchal</p></div>
<p>What a superb village for painting. The sun burned casting the village in a bright white light and we scattered our boards and easels. There was perfect peace, silence, inspiration, and dare I say again, superb food in the afternoon !</p>
<div id="attachment_477" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0226.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-477" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0226.jpg?w=680&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="680" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I hope that&#039;s not a &quot;Tapas and Cerveza Belly&quot; developing !</p></div>
<p>Friday was tidy up and finish off any paintings that required some additional treatment, or perhaps you could start another one from the viewpoint of our host’s, Dave and Gill Armstead, veranda.</p>
<div id="attachment_471" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0011.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-471" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0011.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680" alt="" width="1024" height="680" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Painting on the Terrace at Finca la Paz, Dave and Gill&#039;s place</p></div>
<p>Then, to round things off in style for the evening, our hosts had arranged as a “special”, a trip to Torrox Costa to a tapas bar where we would see live flamenco. Fantastic. If you’ve witnessed this you’ll know how stunning it is – if you haven’t, you must.</p>
<div id="attachment_478" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0345.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-478" title="KONICA MINOLTA DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://singlemaltmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pict0345.jpg?w=680&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="680" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Incredible dancing makes for some evocative blurred images</p></div>
<p>More drinks and farewells in Torrox Pueblo Plaza and we had all made some new friends, discovered some new painting skills and techniques, developed a tan, ate great food and were generally rather smug. I know it’s not always like this, but hey, when it is, go with it.</p>
<p>Paintings and more coming up&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3371" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040769.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3371" title="P1040769" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040769.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The line of duffle bags as soldiers ready for deployment from Ft. Carson.</p></div>
<p>Saturday was deployment day for many Army families from <a title="Fort Carson" href="http://www.carson.army.mil/" target="_blank">Fort Carson</a>.  The site of the duffel bags lined up on the side of the parking lot was unsettling; I knew each one represented a family that was about to say good-bye.  I didn&#8217;t count the bags, but estimated that close to 300 soldiers left for a year-long deployment in Afghanistan&#8211;my son was one of them.  Although this is Josh&#8217;s third deployment, it was the first time that I was with him on the day of his departure.</p>
<p>We started at the company command location on post and while the soldiers stood in line to draw their weapons, which they carry with them the entire trip, the families waited outside.</p>
<div id="attachment_3372" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040788.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3372" title="P1040788" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040788.jpg?w=468&#038;h=351" alt="" width="468" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Families and thier loved ones spend precious minutes together prior to the call for formation and a year-long deployment in Afghanistan.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting most of the men in my son&#8217;s squad and some of their wives.  Several of these couples are experiencing deployment for the first time.</p>
<div id="attachment_3373" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040772.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3373" title="P1040772" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040772.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tracie Ciambotti takes a walk with her son, Josh, before his third deployment since joining the Army.</p></div>
<p>Next, we went to the gymnasium parking lot where families huddled close together, taking every opportunity afforded to them to get one more kiss or another hug.  Every direction I looked, I saw a family savoring every minute they had left together.  One soldier knelt down as his young daughter inspected his weapon; another held a newborn baby while his wife and two daughters clung to him; many soldiers posed with their families for that last photo.</p>
<p>A call to formation was ordered and the troops immediately responded, each one taking his place in the line-up as role-call began.    As each name was shouted out that soldier proceeded to the gym entrance, made sure his back pack fit into the required box for the carry-ons, and then disappeared into the gymnasium.</p>
<div id="attachment_3374" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040783.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3374" title="P1040783" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040783.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The call for formation.</p></div>
<p>Soon they emerged from the other end of the building and rejoined their families.  Josh&#8217;s squad gathered in one area as we waited for the moment we all dreaded&#8211;the final role-call.</p>
<p>That call came and each soldier reached for the final hugs and kisses, grabbed his weapon and back pack, and headed for the building as his name was called.  My son said, &#8220;Okay mama, I gotta go&#8221; as he reached down for our final hug.  I said, &#8220;Take care, I love you and will be praying for you every day&#8221;.  He replied, &#8220;I know Mom, love you too&#8221;.  After Josh and Alison shared their final embrace, he headed into the building.</p>
<p>Alison&#8217;s Facebook post Saturday night said, &#8220;There are no words to describe the pain of watching him walk into that gym. May our countdown start now!&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_3375" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040758.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3375 " title="P1040758" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p1040758.jpg?w=468&#038;h=351" alt="" width="468" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tracie&#039;s son Josh hugs his wife Alison.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twoplacescalledhome.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/storage-boxes.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-252 alignright" title="storage boxes" src="http://twoplacescalledhome.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/storage-boxes.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="http://honeyandlance.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/moving-day.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Take it from someone who&#8217;s moved over 100 times in her life that somehow when you move &#8212; even if you&#8217;re not materialistic &#8212; you become attached to your THINGS! Sentimental things like your high school yearbook, <a class="zem_slink" title="Barbie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie" rel="wikipedia">Barbie dolls</a>, sports jerseys and photos (that you haven&#8217;t looked at in years!) become items you can&#8217;t possibly get rid of. Practical goods that you&#8217;re not sure you&#8217;ll need or be able to find in your new country (or city) such as themometers, books, dryer sheets or holiday decorations you look at differently when faced with not having at your new home.</p>
<p>So the debate begins. If you&#8217;re going for a short time, do you put things in storage and buy new when you get there? Do you ship what you have and risk having to throw away or buy new anyway? Before I tackle this unruly topic, let me say there is no easy answer on this one, only options. I feel I am uniquely qualified to begin your process around this one though. Here are the lessons I learned as I share my own experiences.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#000000;font-size:17px;line-height:25px;">Be Clear on What&#8217;s Important for You to Take</span></p>
<p>I moved here with the philosophy that I was only coming to Oz for 18 &#8211; 24 months and would move back to where I came from when I returned, so I stored nearly everything I owned. Yup &#8212; school certificates, towels, office supplies, Christmas decorations, furniture and yard tools. I shipped legal documents, clothing I thought I needed, a few items of furniture and most importantly, my dog. Great thinking at the time and probably better choices I could have made looking back on it now.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Size</strong>: In most countries housing is much SMALLER than in the US (think NYC or SF size places in many cases). Or if you&#8217;re moving out of home into an apartment, in with a partner or to a dorm, there are always size considerations. Consider the amount of personal belongings you&#8217;ll have access to and/or be able to use on a <em>daily basis</em>. It may be less than what you&#8217;re used to.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Your Environment</strong>: Styles, environmental and/or cultural differences may have an impact on your clothing and/or furniture choices, so put yourself into that new environment before you decide on what&#8217;s important. I did not need a snow blower in Sydney, for example. Nor did my wool business suits work for the casual warmer climate. Take the bare essentials and repurchase what you need for the climate and culture you&#8217;re relocating to.</p>
<p><a href="http://twoplacescalledhome.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/moving-box-filled.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-254" title="Moving box filled " src="http://twoplacescalledhome.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/moving-box-filled.jpg?w=300&#038;h=255" alt="" width="300" height="255" /></a><strong>Consider Your &#8216;Home&#8217;</strong>: Take sentimental things that you may not think are important at the time, but will become so. I shipped my favourite reading chair, a sweater my mom knitted, a shoe box full of photos, recipe books, a few small pieces of artwork and my twelve year old dog. Although these may not have been pragmatic choices and many were expensive to ship, I do not regret them one bit. Once unpacked, these were things that made me feel at &#8216;home&#8217;, even when I was <a href="http://twoplacescalledhome.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/10-things-to-d…ou’re-homesick/ ‎">homesick</a>.</p>
<h3>Make A List</h3>
<p>Or Lists&#8230;finalize them and stick to them. Have a friend support you when it&#8217;s emotionally too difficult. If you choose to give things away, your donations may be tax deductible. If you choose to sell unnecessary items, there are plenty of places to do so on-line. The money you&#8217;ll save on storage or shipping can be used for relocation or NEW THINGS!</p>
<h3>Inventory and Label Your Boxes</h3>
<p>When I returned to the US on holidays or for work, I broke into my storage unit often. I had forgotten certain documents for tax purposes, I wanted a couple of Christmas ornaments for the tree to remind me of home, I needed some old family photos for a geneology project.</p>
<p>These items were difficult to find as I did not inventory or label the boxes to the right level of detail. The box said something like: &#8220;Christmas decorations&#8221; &#8212; I had 5 boxes and had to go through them all. I would suggest both for storage and shipping that you not only put an overall category on the box, also put a list together of the items inside with some meaningful detail such as &#8220;ornaments Sarah made at school, coloured tree lights, tinsel&#8221; etc. Put descriptions on that make sense to <em>YOU</em> (not the mover, if you&#8217;re being packed). This will also save you time if you store now and decide later to ship, as nearly everything in the box will need to be inventoried.</p>
<p><strong>Next week&#8230;Part Two: Shipping</strong> Organising and culling is the emotionally difficult step. Next week we&#8217;ll explore how to get your stuff where you&#8217;re moving to.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryanalexander/3771574775/"><img title="library gun" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3590/3771574775_39947c0db6.jpg" alt="a gun around the word library" width="500" height="95" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">by BryanAlexander on Flickr</p></div>
<p>I love libraries. The idea that I can go into a big building, wonder the book shelves and then pull a random book and learn about something entirely new just makes me giggle. I love books. But these types of libraries are going the way of the dinosaur. We don’t need to go into libraries anymore. I haven’t since I was in undergrad doing esoteric research on corporate culture. For anything short of books published in the 1960’s, you can probably find all the information you’ll need online. And by now, those 1960’s books are probably scanned in, as well.</p>
<p>This reasoning, that everything is now available online, is what is jeopardizing the jobs of 86 Californian teacher-librarians. Basically, the schools are running out of money and need to get rid of something – and libraries are it.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 189px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ccacnorthlib/2822605396/"><img title="library reference area" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/2822605396_82ea6d99fc_m.jpg" alt="computers in a library" width="179" height="123" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">by CCAC North Library on Flickr</p></div>
<p>The thing is, if they classify these librarians as teachers, then, as teachers, they will get all the rights associated with their seniority, and can’t be fired quite so easily as just delivering pink slips. They would be able to transfer to other positions as classroom teachers. So, <a href="http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/news/05182011/lausd-doubts-seasoned-teacher-librarians-can-teach">the argument going on in LA</a> is whether or not a librarian is a teacher, and the questions they’re asking seem to revolve around whether or not they take attendance or similarly nit-picky details that do not prove anything.</p>
<p>This reasoning misses the point of what a library really is, because libraries should be the last thing they get rid of. A library is not just a place where information is stored. It is a place where research skills are learned. I remember once asking my mother what a librarian did. She replied: “They teach you how to find information.”</p>
<p>When Seth Godin sketched out <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/05/the-future-of-the-library.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Fsethsmainblog+%28Seth%27s+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">his view of the perfect future library</a>, he said:</p>
<p align="center"><em>The next library is a house for the librarian with the guts to invite kids in to teach them how to get better grades while doing less grunt work. And to teach them how to use a soldering iron or take apart something with no user serviceable parts inside. And even to challenge them to teach classes on their passions, merely because it&#8217;s fun. This librarian takes responsibility/blame for any kid who manages to graduate from school without being a first-rate data shark.</em></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/37531816/"><img title="student and teacher" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/21/37531816_f40a468f83_m.jpg" alt="student and teacher" width="240" height="138" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">by Wonderlane on Flickr (Not Bernier)</p></div>
<p>Well, Seth, this library is already here. Okay, maybe not the soldering iron bit, but <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/20/local/la-me-0520-tobar-20110520">that is what librarians like, Rosemarie Bernier, do</a>. She teaches her high school and middle school students how to find information online, how to tell if information is useful, and how to simply access the web. For instance, when I was in high school, I participated in library clubs, including an anime club and a writer’s workshop.</p>
<p>Librarians help student learn how to take this wealth of information online and make sense of it. Yes, the tools are all there, and if you know what you’re looking at it’s easy. Not everyone can read between the lines and sense the bias in a CEO’s discussion of Global Warming on his blog versus an LA Times’ journalist’s discussion on her blog. People need to learn these things. If it came naturally then scholars would not be so highly regarded. Librarians teach how to be a scholar, and this is not something easily picked up in a classroom. Classroom teachers are already too busy teaching where to put punctuation. They can’t be expected to do everything.</p>
<p>And then there is that second function of a library as community center. A library becomes a place where people can learn not just about the mechanics of information but also about society. It puts the information at people’s fingertips, no matter their age, and then provides them a playing ground to practice what they have learned.</p>
<p>Yes, paper books might not be around much longer – not as we know them – but the library still has a place.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebron James is still not an NBA champion. And that my friends is quite possibly a very good thing. As he is right now, Lebron James is denying us the chance to watch the most talented athlete on the planet shine, and do what he does best.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan was humbled in high school, cut from his team, and forced to work hard to overcome the adversity and ascend to the peak of his passion.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant started all of about eight games in his first two years in the NBA, riding the bench, observing as much as contributing. He had to prove himself and deserve his spot on the floor.</p>
<p>Lebron James has had absolutely everything handed to him. Realizing that perhaps an NBA title will not be simply handed to him, no matter how sexy and glamorous his team is, or which superstars he teams up with will motivate James to do what it takes to be a champion.</p>
<p>Whether that&#8217;s work on his post game, grow up and achieve some mental toughness, or learn to keep his mouth shut, or perhaps all of the above and then some, perhaps James can use this as motivation to improve in those areas.</p>
<p>Perhaps then James can quit robbing basketball fans of watching what should be absolute greatness. Instead of the greatest player in the world being great, we were treated to the games greatest player not even being one of the five best players in the entire series.</p>
<p>So yes, Lebron James did not win an NBA title, and ultimately, everyone might be the better for it.</p>
<p>If this experience humbles James like it has the potential to, the chastising and derision of James may all eventually work out in his favor, and his losing was still enjoyed by those eager to take their shots at a man who has done plenty to earn them.</p>
<p>Perhaps no sports star has ever been the subject of such scrutiny, and in some cases such scathing criticism as Lebron James has. Then again, perhaps no sports star has done more to deserve it.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s on the court transgressions, bad PR decisions, mindless comments, or just coming off as an arrogant jerk, the reasons to dislike James spread far and wide.</p>
<p>No, he&#8217;s not getting himself arrested, he&#8217;s not committing felonies, but he is seemingly on a mission to be as disliked as possible.</p>
<p>When one man proclaims himself as &#8220;King&#8221;, and has a tattoo saying &#8220;Chosen1&#8243; across his broad shoulders, you expect those broad shoulders to carry a heavy burden. When they don&#8217;t, it comes across as shameless self promotion, an over-sized ego, and a ridiculously inflated sense of self.</p>
<p>All three describe James perfectly.</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t win a title in Cleveland because Mike Brown couldn&#8217;t coach and Danny Ferry couldn&#8217;t put the proper supporting cast around him.</p>
<p>Well in Miami, he didn&#8217;t have Mike Brown to blame, and his supporting cast consisted of two players on the US Olympic team. He still couldn&#8217;t win a title.</p>
<p>So who do you blame now Lebron? You want to go tell Pat Riley he didn&#8217;t give you a good enough supporting cast? Why don&#8217;t you treat Bosh and Wade like you did Moe Williams and Antwan Jamison, making it so very clear that you don&#8217;t wish to be playing along side such inferior talents, enabling them to prohibit you from winning a championship. It obviously isn&#8217;t your fault that you failed again to win a title.</p>
<p>We of course know it&#8217;s not James&#8217; fault. We know this because according to James&#8217; on court behavior, he&#8217;s never missed a shot or committed a turnover without being fouled, and he&#8217;s never committed a foul himself.</p>
<p>So this latest failure can&#8217;t be Lebron James&#8217; fault. There must be many others to heap the blame on. We surely can&#8217;t attribute this loss to the fact that supposedly the world&#8217;s greatest basketball player, who is said to have the potential to be the greatest of all-time, was nowhere to be found in crucial fourth quarters of close games.</p>
<p>So where does the blame go?</p>
<p>But of course, the blame goes to God, at least per James&#8217; own comments. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s fault, because He didn&#8217;t want him to win a title this year, that&#8217;s what it was. More on that in a minute, but clearly, another example of Lebron James finding another excuse for why he didn&#8217;t succeed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to go struggle, to have shots not falling, to have a bad night. It&#8217;s another to hide in a corner, almost like the poor little league kid in right field praying the ball isn&#8217;t hit to him.</p>
<p>James would have you believe that he&#8217;s not there to be a scorer. The best player in the world should be putting the ball in the basket, period. James argues that he&#8217;s a two way player, which he is, and a phenomenal one at that, and that you can&#8217;t just look at stats, you have to look at the other things he does on the floor, and what the end result is.</p>
<p>Well, the end result is the Heat blew a 2-1 lead over the Mavericks, including multiple large fourth quarter leads. So sure, we can look at things beyond the box score, like, you know, the final score. The final score makes it quite clear Lebron James didn&#8217;t do enough to help his team win.</p>
<p>The plus/minus rating is nowhere close to the most reliable stat in the world, however, when it&#8217;s as extreme as -24 for supposedly the most gifted basektball player in the world, that&#8217;s worth noting. The Heat outscored the Mavericks by 14 points without James on the floor, but were outscored by 24 when he was out there.</p>
<p>So clearly James was doing a lot of other things that don&#8217;t show up in the box score contributing to his teams success and ultimate NBA championship, right? You know, like getting torched by Jason Terry, a guy who&#8217;s never been to an All-Star game as his contribution, then, yes.</p>
<p>Had he continued to shut down Terry as he had early on in the series his offensive woes, or unwillingness to shoot the basketball wouldn&#8217;t have been focused on quite as much.</p>
<p>However, Terry, at a huge size disadvantage, and very little advantage anywhere from a physical aspect, scorched the nets in the second half of game five, and the first half of game six. When Terry boastfully stated that he didn&#8217;t think James could guard him for seven games, it was thought Terry was speaking out of place, and such words would only further motivate James to play stifling defense.</p>
<p>It turns out the opposite took place. It lit a fire under Terry and seemingly squelched any remaining fire James had. As Deshawn Stevenson said after game four, it was if James simply &#8220;checked out&#8221;.</p>
<p>In light of his almost complete lack of scoring in the 4th quarter, and absolute lack of clutch scoring, James said &#8220;The ball doesn&#8217;t go in every time&#8221;. And he&#8217;s right. But he seems to ignore the fact that the ball will absolutely not go in if you aren&#8217;t willing to shoot it.</p>
<p>Then again, such mindless comments from Lebron James that seem to make absolutely no sense seem to be the norm.</p>
<p>Last year on twitter he proclaimed, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think for one (minute) that I haven&#8217;t been taking mental notes of everyone taking shots at me this summer. And I mean everyone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course during the course of the year we&#8217;ve been told over and over again by his coach, and the King himself that he doesn&#8217;t care what the fans or media members think.</p>
<p>Then during his press conference he wastes no time taking his shots at all those fans who were clearly elated to see him lose, and to get his shot at the media thrown in too. But he doesn&#8217;t care what they think, right?</p>
<p>He told us he thought the league should contract, then of course backpedaled away saying he didn&#8217;t even know what contraction meant. Do what?</p>
<p>He told us that anything less than a championship this year would be considered a failure, but in his press conference following game six in which that goal was made completely unattainable James said, &#8220;We have nothing to hang our heads low&#8221;. And he&#8217;s right, save that little part of his season being a complete failure, per his own words at the outset of the campaign.</p>
<p>Lebron said before game five that it was &#8220;now or never&#8221;. Now he&#8217;s saying he just knows &#8220;The Man upstairs&#8221; hadn&#8217;t decided it was his time yet. Well, if game was now or never, then I suppose the rational conclusion to draw, based on James&#8217; own words, is that it&#8217;s never.</p>
<p>And for the record, I don&#8217;t believe God has pre-determined when Lebron James is going to win an NBA title, I think He might have more important things on the docket. On that note, Jason Terry, your faith in God, while honorable and what not, is not the reason your team hoisted up an NBA championship trophy this season.</p>
<p>The point being, there&#8217;s a common thread here. Lebron James contradicts himself as well as any public speaker outside of Washington D.C. ever has. Does he do it because he&#8217;s really that dumb, that ignorant and stupid? Or does he do it because he, which at times he claims he doesn&#8217;t, others makes it clear he does, cares what the public thinks of him and does his best to try and atone for things he&#8217;s said that may rub people the wrong way?</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m going with the ignorance excuse. Lebron James has been coddled since he could hold a basketball, and as he got older, he got worse. Accountability was never an issue for him, never something he dealt with. Neither was adversity. The world was, in his eyes, completely his on a silver platter with the rest of the people in it merely his servants and supporting cast in his quest for world domination.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&#8217;t come as a shock that he doesn&#8217;t get it. He doesn&#8217;t at all realize or understand the response his poorly chosen words receive. He&#8217;s out of touch with reality, so he obviously fails to see why many of the things he does rubs people the wrong way.</p>
<p>Insulting fans and media members alike in his press conference following the finals defeat and implying the lives of fans are inferior to his own was just James staying true to the course. He probably didn&#8217;t mean to come off quite like the arrogant jackass that he did, but because he&#8217;s ignorant to how the rest of the world thinks, and lives, he couldn&#8217;t understand how such statements can be taken that way.</p>
<p>His mocking of Dirk Nowitzki being sick, and subsequent attempt to argue that&#8217;s not what he was doing just further illustrates the point. James was arrogant enough, and just enough of a jerk to mock Dirk in the first place. But on top of that he was ignorant enough to think he could pull a fast one on anyone who saw the video, while still carrying on his little inside joke with his buddy Dwayne Wade and nobody would get it.</p>
<p>No Lebron, the rest of the world isn&#8217;t as dumb as you think, nor are they as inferior as you make them out to be.</p>
<p>If James is allowed, and he is, it is perfectly within his right, to make such comments about the fans that make it possible for him to live his obviously superior life, then there&#8217;s absolutely nothing wrong with people taking umbrage with that and having their own negative things to say about Baron, er&#8230; King James.</p>
<p>Sure, we&#8217;ll all wake up to our sorry lives tomorrow all the same, whether he had won an NBA championship or not.</p>
<p>The thing is, because he didn&#8217;t win that championship, James will be waking up to his same life as a perceived front running choker who still doesn&#8217;t have a championship ring.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe he won&#8217;t wake up to the same life in the morning. Maybe he will wake up one day this summer as a much more humbled man, a more determined man, and a man who has what it takes to be a champion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mom sez sometimes ya gotta slow down; take time to enjoy life.  She calls it &#8220;smelling the roses.&#8221;  I think that&#8217;s dumber than an empty box of kibble, coz we don&#8217;t have any roses &#8212; silly humans.  I think what she means is life is short and it&#8217;s even shorter for us doggies (yikes) so we have to treasure each moment.  So there I was after playing with mom and I was treasuring the moment and I realized ya don&#8217;t need to smell no roses or kibble. Sometimes you just need to fill your mouth with your favorite chew toys and take a quick nap.  You can quote me.  I&#8217;m EmmaLou, Golden Destroyer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watched the Wednesday Night Races out of the Miles River Yacht Club with Daryl and Lila, Kevin&#8217;s parents who visited from PA. We went to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum to get a good view of the river and a gigantic cruise boat was tied up, taking up the whole gigantic view. So we tucked underneath the lighthouse there, and watched from the shade &#8211; which was pretty sweet. A hot evening &#8211; even hotter today &#8211; 99 degrees as  I type these words on Thursday at 4:21 pm. Ugh.</p>
<p>But it was a beautiful evening for sailboat races, perfect! We hung out for the better part of an hour, watching boats, talking to people and watching two barn swallows frantically feed their hungry brood of four chicks, nested up in the rafters of the lighthouse &#8211; a VERY public place to raise a family!</p>
<p>Kevin, Mike and Carrie Kabler are on the smaller boat with the red hull, &#8220;Echo&#8221; below &#8211; they had a great time. Looks like Kevin may be lucky enough to pencil this into his calendar every Wednesday night this season.</p>
