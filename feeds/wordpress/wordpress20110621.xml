<p><em>And some giraffes and gazelles.</em></p>

<em>Then we drove across the Serengeti to this HUGE rock. It was probably 300 feet high, but I&#8217;m guessing. And we climbed it.</em></p>

<p><em>When I first heard that we were going to climb a big rock yesterday, I pictured something more along the lines of, I don&#8217;t know, like a switch backing hike up a path.</em></p>
<p><em>No. It wasn&#8217;t like that at all. We climbed up. Like, I don&#8217;t even know how to describe it, at times, it felt like we were going straight up. Of course, we&#8217;re weren&#8217;t, but it seemed like it. I was so out of breath by the time I go to the top, from the exertion and nerves. The view was gogeous though.</em></p>

Well, credit to whoever did.</p>
<p><em>Then we had to get down. Our guides had said we were going down a different way, an easier way, but no. I crawled, crab crawled, on my butt, most of the way down.</em></p>

<p><em>It was some of the craziest and stupidest [stuff] I&#8217;ve done.</em></p>

<p><em>Then we had to drive to our camp. At first it was beautiful, driving across the Serengeti, with these endless plains. It was just amazing. So amazing. </em></p>

<p><em>Until we encountered the mud. We were sliding all over the place and I was quite scared. Okay, terrified. One of the other drivers got stuck, and we had to pull him out. I was stressed, to say the least.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dear City of Vancouver and all its residents</strong>,</p>
<p>Yes, this is me in the picture above.<br />
Yes, this is me in the 1:30-1:33 mark of this <a title="Theft" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSNFxnaGqcA">youtube</a> video.</p>
<p>I am not proud of my actions and have made a visit to the Vancouver Police Department, over the weekend to turn myself in.  This blog will serve as a public apology to those that I have offended with my actions, to clarify certain issues, and to address a few peripheral issues that I take as a concern.</p>
<p><em><strong>My Apologies</strong></em></p>
<p>I apologize to the City of Vancouver for participating in this riot.<br />
I apologize to the residents of Vancouver for having to deal with the consequences of the event.<br />
I apologize to my friends and family that have been affected by my actions.<br />
I apologize to the <a href="http://canucks.nhl.com/">Canucks</a> for reacting in a way that is unsportsmanlike.</p>
<p>I apologize to <strong>Black &amp; Lee</strong>, its employees, and all the customers who have been affected by my actions.</p>
<p>I apologize to <a href="http://burrard-acura.ca/">Burrard Acura</a>, my managers, my coworkers and its customers.  In no way, shape or form does Burrard Acura condone this type of violence or misconduct.  It is not necessary to associate my actions with the good reputation of Burrard Acura.</p>
<p>I apologize to <a href="http://enspireme.org/">Enspire Foundation</a>, its’ volunteers, sponsors and supporters. Enspire Foundation is a reputable non-profit organization that does not condone violence or misconduct behaviour in any way, shape or form. To additionally make things clear, I have not been active with Enspire for quite some time now, so there is no need to associate my actions with the integrity of Enspire Foundation.</p>
<p>I apologize to <strong>UBC Athletics and Recreation</strong> and to the <strong>UBC Rowing Team</strong>, the coaches, the athletes, my coworkers and manager, its other employees, its participants and its clients.  In no way, shape or form does UBC Athletics or the UBC Rowing team condone violence or misconduct, and should thus not be associated with my actions. To additionally clarify, I have not been a part of the UBC Rowing Team at all during the last term.</p>
<p>Lastly, I apologize to the Faculty of Science.  The faculty of science in no way, shape or form condones violence or misconduct.  My actions should not be reflective of the good research and work that they have performed.</p>
<p><em><strong>My Story</strong></em></p>
<p>I know a lot of you don’t believe me, but the truth is that I take full responsibility for my actions and am sincerely apologetic for what I did.  What I did was completely out of character for me, but I did it because I was influenced by mob mentality.  I want to shed light onto the thought process that was in my head so that maybe you can all get a little bit of an understanding and sympathize for people like me, who made wrong decisions but have now become victims of this social media form of mob mentality.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why don’t I think I deserve all this treatment?</strong></em></p>
<p>Because for one, I’ve admitted to my mistakes, two, I am ready to deal with the consequences in a judicial manner, and three, because (may I remind you that) I am responsible for <em>theft – </em>a fairly minor action compared to vandalism and arson. Please remember and understand that I am not responsible for the riot.</p>
<p>I did <strong>not</strong> vandalize any buildings.<br />
I did <strong>not</strong> set fire on anything.<br />
I did <strong>not</strong> break any glass.<br />
I did <strong>not</strong> instigate the riot.<br />
I did <strong>not</strong> physically harm anybody.<br />
I did <strong>not </strong>jump on any cop cars.<br />
I did <strong>not</strong> even plan on being in the riot.</p>
<p><em><strong>On any regular day I would not condone looting</strong></em>.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the riot everything just seemed so right.</p>
<p>At the time, being a part of the riot was simply to fulfill the adrenaline rush I was looking and hoping for – an adrenaline rush that I previously got from post-winning games: hugging randoms, dancing on the streets, honking car horns non-stop, and high-fiving just about everybody.  In the same way that everybody enjoyed collectively showing pride in our team, it was enjoyable to express my disappointment in a collective manor.</p>
<p>I had no intentions of defiling the city.  I love Vancouver as much as you do – I’ve lived here since I was 7 months old.  But in my immature, intoxicated perspective all I saw was that the riot was happening, and would continue happening with or without me, so I might as well get my adrenaline fix.</p>
<p><em><strong>And what was going on my head about the stealing?</strong></em></p>
<p>As bad as it sounds, the stealing was purely fun for me.  I had no intentions with the product.  I just wanted to get a souvenir at the time.  I took two sized 42 mens dress pants.  I’m a woman’s size 6-8.  I don’t have any brothers, cousins, boyfriends, fathers, grandfathers or anything else of the like that are size 42 in mens.  I did not plan on selling them either.</p>
<p>*FYI: The pants will be returned, but are not yet returned because the cops want to schedule an appropriate time and date to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>I’m a UBC student, and an adult.  Shouldn’t I know the difference between wrong and right?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well yes, I should…but in certain circumstances our perspectives get seriously skewed.  It was extremely hard to see the consequences in taking a couple pants,  when around me people were lighting up cars, smashing windows and inflicting physical pain on one another.  My train of thought at this point was that “the place is already broken into, most of the contents of the store have already been stolen, so what difference does it make if I take a couple things?”  Not convinced?  Maybe Christopher Schneider, assistant professor of sociology at UBC, can convince you.  In his recent quote in the <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Police+grossly+understaffed+Game+union/4969234/story.html#ixzz1PkhK6KrV">Vancouver Sun</a> he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the riot started unfolding …you have a lot of law-abiding citizens hanging around downtown who otherwise would’ve got out of Dodge…When you have a mob or riot-like activity, individual accountability tends to go out the window. People see other people setting fires and they think, ‘I’m going to set a fire too, and I won’t get caught.’ These types of people typically wouldn’t set a fire on their own.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>But still, a lot of you don’t find credibility in the theory of mob mentality</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve heard people discredit the theory of mob mentality in the case of the 2011 Vancouver Riot. People say that it is clearly possible not to be influenced by others, because for one, majority of people left downtown right away and didn’t participate.  And further, that many people who stayed didn’t do anything but watch/take pictures/film.  Therefore anybody who tries to reason out by citing the theory of mob mentality is just finding a scape goat.  Not true.  I would know.  John Tauer, physiology professor of the University of St. Thomas would probably also know.  In a <a href="http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/vancouver-riots-highlight-mob-mentality-jun-16-2011#ixzz1Pi2lpeGo">Minnesota newspaper</a> he states that “many factors…create a mob mentality — though emotion and alcohol do top the list.”</p>
<p>And that’s really what it was for me. I was immature, intoxicated, full of adrenaline, disappointed in the loss, filled with young rage, and have a “go-out-and-do-it” kind of personality.  It had nothing to do with anarchy because I am definitely <strong>not an anarchist.</strong>  I am a law-abiding citizen that has had a clean slate criminal record before this night.  I had no intentions on harming the law, the city, any businesses or any people.  It was a spur of the moment kind of thing and I just got caught up in the chaos.</p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>As soon as I left the riot I knew that what I did was wrong.</strong></em></p>
<p>As soon as I left the riot I knew that what I did was wrong.  My levels of alcohol and adrenaline in my blood had seriously died down, and I was no longer surrounded by the mob.  It’s a little funny to me that that was so, because this is exactly what Schneider was explaining earlier: that people lose their individual accountability when in a mob.</p>
<p><em><strong>If I knew that I was wrong, then why didn’t I do something about it sooner?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em>I knew that I was going to return the pants and tell the cops that I made a mistake, but why did I wait 2.5 days instead of .5-1 day?  Well, that would be out of pure nervousness…nervous to tell my parents and my sister.  I was raised in a good family and I was more nervous to tell them than the cops.  I had to be okay with admitting it to them before I could go out to the cops.<br />
<strong><em><br />
T</em><em>he infamous smile</em></strong></p>
<p>And still, a lot of people will never find remorse for me because I had a huge smile on my face.  But like I said earlier, it was fun at the time.  I thought it was pretty funny because this is the only time that I would ever do something like this.  The smile on my face was an “I’m such a badass I can’t believe I’m doing this!” kind of look.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you still don’t believe I’m a good person, here’s a little side story for you</strong></em>:</p>
<p>As many of you already know, I am majoring in Conservation Biology at UBC.  I strongly belirve in ecological conservation and sustainability.  That night, I saw a few  people that were trying to knock trees down.  So what did I do?  I yelled at them, saying “Pleaaseee, not the treees!!!!”  And what did they do?  They stopped.  And I felt like a hero.</p>
<p><strong><em>The “21st Century Witch Hunt?”</em></strong></p>
<p>In social media sites such as facebook and twitter, we have seen the following actions regarding the riot:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass amounts of people acting in ways that they would not normally act</li>
<li>people thinking its okay to harm others because everybody else is doing it as well</li>
<li>ensuring that peoples’ lives are destroyed, by making sure <em>everybody</em> collectively e-mails, phones and spams their families, their jobs, their schools, and all others that they are associated with (<em>do it for your country! no wrath! vengeance is ours! the lives of others are miniscule the actions that they have mistakenly done!</em>)</li>
<li>trying to ruin the reputation of all organizations that they are associated with</li>
<li>threatening associations to ruin their reputation if they do not disassociate themselves with that person</li>
<li>exaggerating what that person did in order to make their actions seem completely unforgivable</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this sound a little bit familiar?  I don’t know about you, but to me this sounds like people are trying to retaliate by yet another form of mobbing – the thing about this form of mob mentality that astounds me is that this time they’re doing it sober.  As <a href="http://www.thecheapseats.ca/2011/06/is-that-your-roommate-the-web-search-for-vancouver-riot-culprits.html"><em>Beer</em></a> writes in a recent blog that I ran into, “Let’s hope the guilty are found and punished, but also try to make sure the online search for them doesn’t devolve into a 21st century witch hunt.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the VPD does <em>not</em> support the negative behaviour that has been so prevalent online.  In fact, many of you should even be careful of what you say online, because everything that you say online is basically written in stone.  And anything that you say can and will likely be used against you in court.  If not in the judicial court, then in this new-aged social media court that everybody seems so happy and willing to partake in.</p>
<p>The judicial court is designed to give accused individuals the punishment that they <em>deserve</em> based on the actions that they have made, and protect them from punishments that they do <em>not deserve.  </em>It is made up of people that have received years of education and training.  This new social-media court that we see is made up of people who likely know very little about rightful punishments.  They make decisions based on emotions and try to incriminate individuals in harsh ways that are extremely unnecessary.  We need to leave the decision making to the experts, who can separate themselves from emotional decisions provide just punishments. <em></em></p>
<p>The VPD defined harassment for me the other day: that it is multiple attempts of unwanted communication.  They further advised me to file harassment on anybody who did not leave me alone.</p>
<p><em><strong>A Peripheral Aside: Notes on Feminism &amp; Racism<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>There are a few things that I have seen on social media sites that have come across to me as a major concern.  First off, a little bit about racism:</p>
<p>Since<strong> I am a</strong> <strong>Canadian citizen</strong>, I am aware of my rights.  Let me show you a little insert from the Canadian Charter of Rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Equality Rights</h2>
<hr />
<p>EQUALITY BEFORE AND UNDER LAW AND EQUAL PROTECTION AND BENEFIT OF LAW / Affirmative action programs.</p>
<p><strong>15. (1)</strong> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or <strong>ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex,</strong> age or mental or physical disability.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of <strong>race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex,</strong> age or mental or physical disability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Racism is not accepted in my country, so to the following people, and all others of the like, if you are going to make racist remarks, then maybe <strong>you</strong> should leave our country.</p>
<p><a href="http://therealcamille.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/racist-comments1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6" title="racist-comments1" src="http://therealcamille.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/racist-comments1.jpg?w=456&#038;h=280" alt="" width="456" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>@Mo Hill, I’m glad you own a colour TV.  I suggest also owning a time machine.  That way you can go back to the 1960′s, when colour TVs first started selling in large numbers…and when racist remarks like yours were much more appreciated. Also, Mr. I’m-so-Canadian, learn how to spell colo<strong>u</strong>r right.  In Canada we spell colo<strong>u</strong>r with a ‘<strong>u</strong>‘.  It’s because we are part of the British Commonwealth.  Were you aware of that?  If not, try reading up on it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations">Wikipedia</a>.  (PS, that is what people in the kom-pyu-ter-world call a <em>hy-per-link</em> – sound it out, it’s not too hard!)  You can click on it and it will direct you to the Wikipedia page I was talking about.  You can also find other important information on there, such as, articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupidity">stupidity</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbecile">imbecile</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation">mental retardation</a>.   Hope that helps, xox!!!).</p>
<p>Here’s another thing that bothers me: why is everybody so surprised that a female partook in the riot?  What is with this attitude that females are incapable of doing what men can do?  Maybe it takes an event like this to show you misogynists that woman are fully capable of anything you can do.  And if my actions lead to that revelation in your obscure little heads, then maybe it’s a good thing that I partook in this event.</p>
<p><em><strong>My Theory &amp; Thoughts on the situation</strong></em></p>
<p>What do I think of this whole situation?<br />
I think it has been completely blown out of control.<br />
I think that people are all over my case for several reasons:</p>
<p><em>1) I’ve lived here all my life so I am bound to have made a few enemies along the way. </em><br />
It seems abnormal how passionate some people are at trying to ruin my life.  Well you know what?  I think it’s sad how much you all want to ruin my life and how I have become the centre of your worlds.</p>
<p><em>2) I’m a UBC student that works two jobs, volunteers and am athletic.</em><br />
Well guess what folks?  People who work hard make mistakes too.  And to the guy who called me a “disrespectful spoiled little bitch,” you are completely wrong.  I was raised by hardworking parents and was taught to work hard for myself.  I work hard to pay for my own rent, my own groceries, my own bills, and my hobbies.  I have additionally also been fully responsible for financing my own education.  I have been working since I was 14 years old – as soon as I was legally able to do so.  I have been responsible for obtaining my volunteer opportunities and my work opportunities.  So please people, find it in your humane hearts to let the cops deal with the rest of this.</p>
<p><em>3) I have been dehumanized.</em><br />
Nobody has sympathy for a picture.  I have been painted out as a criminal, and not the person that I really am.  Everybody associates me with all the bad things that have happened in the riot.  I do not agree at all with how far the riot went.  If you must know, I wasn’t even at the riot when it was at its peak.  And to the girl that messaged my sister on Facebook, I sincerely apologize that your boyfriend got stabbed, but I had nothing to do with that.  I wish him the best and I hope he gets better.  But please separate me, and <strong>especially my family</strong> from these horrible things that have been done.  Remember, the only thing that I did was take a couple things from a store.  It’s fairly minor compared to the rest of the acts that were done.</p>
<p><em>4) People don’t know how else to vent their anger<br />
</em>I honestly think that the reason why people are so strongly targeting people like me is because people are upset.  They are drunk off of emotions, and want to do everything they can to fix their city.  I completely understand that and like I said, am not proud of myself!  Collaborating to clean up the city?  Excellent way to remediate the mess.  IDing people?  Very helpful for the VPD – saves time and money for the cops and in the end for our city.  Harassing people, ruining their lives, and finding unlawful punishments?  Not at all helpful.  It gives the cops more things to deal with, and is in a way a form of anarchy.  The laws were made for everybody to follow: criminals and spectators alike.  So for you to disregard the laws makes it seem like you are an anarchist…starting a mob…based on social media…<strong>starting to get the picture yet?</strong></p>
<p>Anyways, long story short, venting your anger on people does not make the situation better, so feel free to ID people and help in ways that you can, but don’t ruin our lives!</p>
<p><em><strong>My Requests:</strong></em></p>
<p>In the Canadian society that we all know and love, we are taught to be righteous individuals, to stand up for our rights, and to be loyal to society.  Well great, props to everybody for being loyal to society by IDing people.  They (we) will get what they (we) deserve.  But you guys are completely forgetting that we have rights as well.   It is completely unrighteous to be spending your entire day(s) contacting us, re-posting our pictures, and having everybody collaborate to ruin our lives.  Not even the VPD spend that much time on us, so please simmer down a tad bit.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Canada prides itself in being a peaceful country.  We Canadians are loved around the world because we know how to handle ourselves and we avoid war as much as possible.  The actions that I have seen on social media sites are embarrassing to our country and our reputation.  These actions do not reflect the kindness that us Canadians are all known and loved for.</p>
<p>So please, give me, my family, my friends, my school, my employers, and everybody else or everything that I am or was associated with a break.  It’s called mistakes.  I learned from my mistake, I am not proud of my mistake, and I will make sure not to be influenced by people as easily as I was.  I will make sure to make proper judgements on all my decisions in life.  I am prepared to do community work, pay fines, and if worst comes to worst, even a criminal record.  The same goes for Nathan Kotylak, Sienna St. Laurent, Jason Li and all the others who deserve a break.</p>
<p>As angry as this blog is (a natural response after seeing people repeatedly trying to – successfully – ruin your life), I am again very sorry for my actions. I have reported to the VPD, will return the pants when they want me to, and am currently waiting to see what I will be punished with.</p>
<p>I want to save this last paragraph to my friends and family who have supported me through this difficult time.  Without your help I may have lost my mind already.  To those who know me and have turned their backs on me, please delete me from Facebook and disassociate yourself from me as much as possible because I don’t want to have anything to do with you.</p>
<p>Thank you ever so kindly for your time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Real Camille</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we wrote about one of our favorite places in the city—<a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/05/18/spring-on-the-high-line/" title="Spring on the High Line" target="_blank">the High Line</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/8-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-649"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/81.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="Flowers Along The High Line, Phase Two" title="Flowers Along The High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-649" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/18-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-656"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/181.jpg?w=500&#038;h=394" alt="Water Feature at the High Line" title="Water Feature at the High Line" width="500" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-656" /></a></p>
<p>The post was slightly fueled from cabin fever (it had rained that entire week!), but mostly we were anticipating the opening of the High Line&#8217;s Phase Two, which runs from 20th Street in Chelsea north to 30th Street. </p>
<p>That time has finally come.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/2-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-645"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg?w=500&#038;h=341" alt="Flowers Along The High Line, Phase Two" title="Flowers Along The High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-645" /></a></p>
<p>The second phase differs from the first in a few ways. </p>
<p>Unlike the original section of the park—which seemed to be wide open, with the exception of a few warehouses and the Standard Hotel—the new pathway seems to snake along between residential buildings, both old and new. </p>
<p>This gives the second phase a more intimate feel, as windows and fire escapes of buildings are within arms reach of the park&#8217;s railings.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/11-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-651"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/112.jpg?w=500&#038;h=338" alt="The High Line, Phase Two" title="The High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-651" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/20-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-658"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/201.jpg?w=500&#038;h=418" alt="A View of the High Line, Phase Two" title="A View of the High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="418" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-658" /></a></p>
<p>Near 22nd Street, there is a nearly 5,000 square foot grassy lawn for visitors to lounge or picnic on. </p>
<p>You can also people watch on the nearby stadium seating, made from reclaimed teak wood from southeast Asian farm buildings.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/5-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-646"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/52.jpg?w=500&#038;h=372" alt="The Grassy Lawn at the High Line, Phase Two" title="The Grassy Lawn at the High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-646" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/9-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-650"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/93.jpg?w=500&#038;h=396" alt="Viewing Area at The High Line, Phase Two" title="Viewing Area at The High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-650" /></a></p>
<p>There is even more seating near the end of Phase Two, where an elegant curve of teak benches extends toward the exit of the new section.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/19-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-657"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/192.jpg?w=500&#038;h=370" alt="The Lot at 30th Street at the High Line, Phase Two" title="The Lot at 30th Street at the High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="370" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657" /></a></p>
<p>One of the biggest attractions surrounding the new section&#8217;s opening is actually below the High Line itself. The Lot at 30th Street—yes, literally a lot—currently houses food trucks and a bar, so hungry and thirsty High Line visitors won&#8217;t go without.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/13-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-653"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/131.jpg?w=500&#038;h=370" alt="Food Trucks at the Lot at 30th Street" title="Food Trucks at the Lot at 30th Street" width="500" height="370" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-653" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/14-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-654"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/141.jpg?w=500&#038;h=305" alt="Colicchio &amp; Sons Bar at The High Line, Phase Two" title="Colicchio &amp; Sons Mans The Bar" width="500" height="305" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-654" /></a></p>
<p>A few perennial favorites, including <a href="http://redhooklobsterpound.com/" title="Red Hook Lobster Pound" target="_blank">Red Hook Lobster Pound</a>, <a href="http://www.thetacotruck.com/" title="The Taco Truck" target="_blank">the Taco Truck</a>, and <a href="http://kelvinslush.com/" title="Kelvin Slush" target="_blank">Kelvin Slush</a> were out today. <a href="http://www.colicchioandsons.com/" title="Colicchio &amp; Sons" target="_blank">Colicchio &amp; Sons</a> is manning the bar, serving beer and wine on draft. </p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/15-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-655"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/151.jpg?w=500&#038;h=366" alt="Rainbow City at the High Line" title="Rainbow City at the High Line" width="500" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-655" /></a></p>
<p>The former parking lot is also home to a rotating selection of public events, most of which are free.</p>
<p>Currently, the space is home to AOL and <a href="http://www.friendswithyou.com/blog/rainbow-city-nyc-">FriendsWithYou&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Rainbow City.&#8221; </p>
<p>Described as &#8220;an urban playground,&#8221; the lot is filled with colorful (and giant!) inflatable balloons that visitors are encouraged to interact with.</p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/12-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-652"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/121.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="Flowers In Bloom Along The High Line" title="Flowers In Bloom Along The High Line" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-652" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smithratliff.com/2011/06/09/the-high-lines-new-addition/7-7/" rel="attachment wp-att-648"><img src="http://smithratliff.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/72.jpg?w=500&#038;h=353" alt="Blooms Along The High Line, Phase Two" title="Blooms Along The High Line, Phase Two" width="500" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-648" /></a></p>
<p>The second phase has been a long time coming, so we were thrilled to finally have the chance to enjoy it. This new addition has set the bar pretty high for the third and final addition!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we’ve discussed before, there are two types of breakup songs.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Songs that depress the hell out of you:</strong></span> These songs help you wallow in your breakup. You hear one of these songs, and suddenly you are sobbing and miserable. They remind you of everything that sucks about your breakup, about your ex and about your whole damned life. Good activities while listening to these songs include thinking about the last time you and your ex kissed, staring at pictures of the two of you when you were blissfully, sickeningly happy, and eating Ben and Jerry’s in your pajamas after not showering or leaving the house for days. <a href="http://simplysolo.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/top-10-bestworst-breakup-songs/">Here’s a list of these songs.</a> Oh, and be sure to read the comments for some great additions to my initial list.  </p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Songs that empower you to move forward:</strong></span> These songs make you realize you are going to be okay. They inspire you to move on, and maybe help you develop some healthy anger toward your ex. These songs remind you of how much better you are without him/her, whether it’s because he/she was a jerk or because he/she just wasn’t right for you and now you can find “the one.” Good activities while listening to these songs include singing like a maniac in your car, dancing in the shower and rocking out with your friends while drinking wine and eating ice cream. Ice cream is a must for either set of songs – this is a breakup, after all.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is my top 10 list of empowering breakup songs:</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>10</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>You’ll Think Of Me</p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> Keith Urban</p>
<p><strong>Best lines:</strong></p>
<p>Take your records, take your freedom</p>
<p>Take your memories, I don’t need ‘em</p>
<p>Take your space and take your reasons</p>
<p>But you’ll think of me<br />
And take your cat and leave my sweater</p>
<p>‘Cause we have nothing left to weather</p>
<p>In fact I’ll feel a whole lot better</p>
<p>But you’ll think of me, you’ll think of me</p>
<p>Someday I’m gonna run across your mind</p>
<p>But don’t worry, I’ll be fine</p>
<p>I’m gonna be alright</p>
<p>While you’re sleeping with your pride</p>
<p>Wishing I could hold you tight</p>
<p>I’ll be over you<br />
And on with my life</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>9.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>So What</p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> Pink</p>
<p><strong>Best lines: </strong></p>
<p>And guess what, I&#8217;m havin&#8217; more fun</p>
<p>And now that we&#8217;re done</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna show you tonight</p>
<p>I&#8217;m alright, I&#8217;m just fine</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re a tool so</p>
<p>So what? I am a rock star</p>
<p>I got my rock moves</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want you tonight</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>8.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>Better In Time</p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> Leona Lewis</p>
<p><strong>Best lines: </strong></p>
<p>Thought I couldn&#8217;t live without you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna hurt when it heals too</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll all get better in time</p>
<p>Even though I really love you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna smile cause I deserve to</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll all get better in time</p>
<p>Since there&#8217;s no more you and me</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time I let you go</p>
<p>So I can be free</p>
<p>And live my life how it should be</p>
<p>No matter how hard it is I&#8217;ll be fine without you</p>
<p>Yes I will</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>7.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>Fighter <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong>Christina Aguilera<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Best lines:           </strong></p>
<p>After all of the stealing and cheating</p>
<p>You probably think that I hold resentment for you</p>
<p>But, uh uh, oh no, you&#8217;re wrong</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause if it wasn&#8217;t for all that you tried to do</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t know just how capable I am to pull through</p>
<p>So I wanna say thank you</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause it makes me that much stronger</p>
<p>Makes me work a little bit harder</p>
<p>It makes me that much wiser</p>
<p>So thanks for making me a fighter</p>
<p>Made me learn a little bit faster</p>
<p>Made my skin a little bit thicker</p>
<p>Makes me that much smarter</p>
<p>So thanks for making me a fighter</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>6.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>Carousel<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong>Laura Izibor<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Best lines:           </strong></p>
<p>Every day has its ups and downs</p>
<p>You think you&#8217;re lost</p>
<p>You will be found</p>
<p>Most of us want the same old things</p>
<p>Someone to love</p>
<p>What it brings</p>
<p>I know it’s hard it gets tough sometimes</p>
<p>You gotta hold on, like a carousel</p>
<p>Going around and around and around and around</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>5</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>Irreplaceable <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong>Beyoncé <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Best lines:           </strong></p>
<p>So since I’m not your everything</p>
<p>How about I&#8217;ll be nothing, nothing at all to you</p>
<p>Baby I won&#8217;t shed a tear for you, I won&#8217;t lose a wink of sleep</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy</p>
<p>To the left, to the left</p>
<p>To the left, to the left</p>
<p>To the left, to the left</p>
<p>Everything you own in the box to the left</p>
<p>To the left, to the left</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you ever for a second get to thinking you&#8217;re irreplaceable</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">4.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Song title: </strong>I Saw The Sign<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong>Ace of Base <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Best lines:           </strong></p>
<p>I, I got a new life</p>
<p>You would hardly recognize me I&#8217;m so glad</p>
<p>How could a person like me care for you?</p>
<p>(Why?) Why do I bother</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re not the one for me</p>
<p>Ooooo, is enough, enough?</p>
<p>I saw the sign and it opened up my mind!</p>
<p>And I am happy now living without you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve left you, oh-oh-OH!</p>
<p>I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign</p>
<p>No one&#8217;s gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong></strong>My review of the rock and roll memoir by<strong> Steven Tyler</strong>; Harper Collins, ©2011</em></p>
<p><a href="http://spikeymom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/tyler-book2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-495" title="Tyler book2" src="http://spikeymom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/tyler-book2.jpg?w=167&#038;h=255" alt="" width="167" height="255" /></a>I probably would not have purchased this book had I not elected to watch <strong>American Idol</strong> this spring, for the first time in 6 or 7 years. I started watching once the number of contestants had been whittled down to 13, and the final “live” shows began. I enjoyed the show this year for two reasons. For one thing, there was a good group of young singers who made it to the last weeks of the show. They were fun to watch as they developed into talented performing artists. The second reason was the new judge this year,<strong> Steven Tyler</strong>. I knew who he was, of course: one of the most famous rockers in the world, the front man of<strong> Aerosmith</strong>, the biggest, most famous American rock band. Tyler was hilarious as an AI  judge. He was also sympathetic (maybe even a little too much so) and prone to shoot from the lip. He was frequently bleeped, though we all knew what he was saying. I found him really likable, and enjoyed his non-critical remarks (he just wasn’t very hard on the kids.) When he performed his American classic, <strong>Dream On</strong>, on the final night of the show, I was truly hooked on Steven Tyler.<br />
He wrote <strong>Dream On</strong> when he was only 17 years old, and he owns this song completely. He’s 63 years old now and he can still belt it out. His trademark wail on the high note was a classic and he virtually stole the show right there.  You can see this performance right here:<br />
(Turn on your speakers, and go straight into ‘full screen mode’ on the<strong> YouTube</strong> clip.)</p>
<p><a title="&quot;Dream On&quot; (AI 10 short version)" href="http://youtu.be/qaRYVvS_7WY" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/qaRYVvS_7WY</a></p>
<p>Back to the book. He holds nothing back, it seems, and comes clean on his life in rock and roll.<br />
Born <strong>Steven Tallarico</strong> into an Italian family living in the Bronx, and raised partly in NYC and partly in Sunapee, NH, where his parents owned a summer resort, he was both a city boy, and a nature boy who loved the country life. It soon becomes clear to the reader that he decided at a very young age that all he wanted was to become a rocker.  And he wanted that for the reasons that have always driven young men into rock and roll: he wanted to sing, he wanted the girls, and he wanted that life. He got it in spades. Although when he was young he was mocked and called (unprintable here) names because of his big lips, as he matured he was likened to Mick Jagger and was frequently taken to BE Mick Jagger, because his lips were so similar to Mick’s. This similarity only increased young Steven’s desire to be a rocker. He wanted to become a wailer, a famous rocker. In fact, he even wanted to be like Janis Joplin, one of his idols. Well, you know what accompanies the rock life: all you have to do is look at the list of rockers who died young (e.g. Janis, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison.) The drugs got them. Steven Tyler freely admits that he blew through about 20 million dollars, all spent on drugs, and he outlines all those drugs and how he got them, in this book. Lord only knows how many women he slept with (that of course being a major reason for being a male rock star.)</p>
<p>And yet, as I read of his life of debauchery and drugs, I still could not help liking him.<a href="http://spikeymom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/steven-tyler.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-496" title="Steven Tyler" src="http://spikeymom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/steven-tyler.jpg?w=213&#038;h=300" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>He has a great sense of humour. He may not have pursued a formal education but he is well-read (literary references abound in his book) and he has a gift for writing both music and lyrics. He easily turns a rhyme at a drop of a hat, and loves to share the lyrics and the poetry that just come naturally to him (and comes probably more easily when he is high.)</p>
<p>He’s been to rehab four times. Relapsed badly several times, but between the 3rd and 4th rehab he was clean for 12 years! He slid back into drug use when he was on prescription pain killers after foot surgery. But he’s been clean again for over a year, it seems. And there he was, on American Idol, age 63, and he’s still standing! Good on you, Steven, and may you continue to entertain the world.</p>
<p>This was an entertaining (he’s so funny) and engrossing book. It is not for the faint of heart  and definitely not for the prudish. But if you think you would enjoy reading a biography/memoir that will reveal a  rock and roll life to you, this is your book.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">the national park is celebrating its 75th anniversary throughout 2011, and if you live in the area or plan on visiting southern cal soon, i would definitely recommend making the trip. bring lots of water, sunscreen, and insect repellent, and then head out to explore joshua tree. . . you will not be disappointed. check out some of the photos from our journey!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mood: Bad.</p>
<p>Today was the first day of summer vacation I&#8217;ve been home with the kids. I think I&#8217;m ready for them to go back to school. And they were only here for half of the day because they&#8217;re attending Faith Formation at church in the mornings. What in THE HELL am I going to do with them for the rest of the summer? If it&#8217;s a nice day and they&#8217;re out with their friends, it&#8217;s tolerable. But today was chilly, and I guess no one was around, and insulting Cameron was David&#8217;s chosen activity.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Put a lock on the refrigerator door.</span></strong> And on all kitchen cupboards. No matter how many times I tell them that they aren&#8217;t allowed to eat anything before running it by me, a whole box of granola bars seems to disappear as soon as I&#8217;m not within earshot of the kitchen.</li>
<li><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Deep cleaning.</strong></span> One room per week. Ever heard of Mr. Clean? Well, you&#8217;re his bitches now.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Reading list.</span></strong> I want quiet. Every time there&#8217;s a rainy day I&#8217;m not listening to the TV blaring <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> and <em>Victorious</em> reruns that I&#8217;ve seen a million times. Suggestions welcome.</li>
<li><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Photo shoots.</strong></span> I have a tripod now. And an external flash. And an extra lens. And thinking about getting some light reflectors. Dude, that shit gets heavy. Someone needs to haul it all around for me.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Cooking lessons.</span></strong> If they&#8217;re going to eat me out of house and home, they should at least be able to cook a meal for me. Hopefully someday a nice girl will appreciate it.</li>
<li><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laundry.</strong></span> Ok, Beyoncé, you need five wardrobe changes during the course of a day? Well then you&#8217;re in for a treat. Like smelly underwear? I hope so because 5 boys x 7 days  x 1.5 per day = around 50 pairs per week. You&#8217;re lucky it&#8217;s flip-flop season, because socks are actually much worse.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">We had just completed another round of shooting in San Francisco around places like Golden Gate Bridge, Treasure Island, Hwy 280, Lombard Street (which you can check out <a title="In and Around San Francisco" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shsmani/sets/72157626887021257/" target="_blank">here</a>) and were driving back home. We were driving through the bay bridge discussing that enough has been captured of the bridges in San Francisco from various different perspectives and it was time to do something different. Something more intensive, interesting and the output should be way different from what of was done before.</p>
<p align="justify">That is when it occurred to me that I should try my hands at Time lapse photography. I had immediately decided that I would indeed do time lapse photography. So my friend pops up the question, what is this time lapse? Well, I explained what I had read in Wikipedia, this is what it said..</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>Time-lapse photography is a cinematography technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that which will be used to play the sequence back. When replayed at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, and then played back at 30 frames per second; the result would be an apparent increase of speed by 30 times. Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of high speed photography.</em></p>
<p align="justify">What was left to be decided is only when and where would I do this?</p>
</blockquote>

<td valign="top" width="394">
<p align="justify">While we had a number of locations in mind that we had previously scouted, we were keen to do something with Bay Bridge in it, since it has the San Francisco downtown as its backdrop. We knew the only place where we could locate a spot like that would be on the Treasure Island. Treasure Island was not just a private area, it was also a federal establishment, since there was a naval base out there. We did not want to risk straying into unwanted territory and get ourselves into trouble.</p>

<p align="justify">We spent hours on Google without much luck. Then we pulled up the Google map and tried to see if there was any place that would give an amazing view of the bay bridge with the SFO sky line in the background. The map did show a couple of spots which might work. However there was this construction of the new Bay bridge which was in progress which more or less closed down the spots we had zeroed in on. We then decided that we will go the following Friday evening to scout for locations. If anything works out, we will return the following day to carry out the actual shoot.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meanwhile, I had to ensure I had all the necessary gear to ensure the shoot proceeded as thought. I figured out one important gear was still missing, that is the interval-o-meter. Interval-o-meter is the device used to automate firing of the shots from a camera in a preset interval. While in the past I had used Nikon camera pro software, coupled with a laptop and connecting cable, it proved too much of a hassle and too much to take care of on a dark night at a place which I still don’t know anything about. So I got back to our savior “Google”. After a lot of digging in and a lot of second thought and consideration, I took some risk and went in for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E1TN5A" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E1TN5A" target="_blank">generic interval-o-meter</a>. Well, this thing never had a proper review, but after some deep digging, I figured out it is the same product as several others, except for the nameplate. I was easily saving anywhere between $20-$70 bucks. I took the risk and amazoned it.</p>
<p align="justify">I am of the firm opinion that higher price does not always translate to higher quality, so except for the camera and the glass, everything else is carefully selected to give good value for money. While there are a number of tripods running into hundreds of dollars, I picked up a sub $50 tripod back in 2008 and I am very happy with my purchase. Same is the case with the rain cover and a number of other gear in my camera bag. Thankfully, so far those stuff have been working fine and I have no qualms.</p>

<li>Cleaning Kit &#8211; To defog the glass, again a must have in the bay area.</li>
<li>High speed and Large capacity memory cards &#8211; since the camera is going to chunk out about 60 images per minute, each of it of the highest JPEG quality possible.</li>
<li>Fully charged batteries with as much backup juice as possible.</li>

<p align="justify">Amazon site showed that it is not expected to be delivered until the following Monday, a week in which heavy rains were predicted. But then, Amazon never ceases to surprise you. On Thursday evening, I noticed the voicemail lamp blinking on my phone, checked up at the front desk only to find out the interval-o-meter had arrived early.. woo hoo! I called up my friend and decided that we would leave work early the next day and try our luck with the time lapse photography. So again we were on the bay bridge driving towards treasure island discussing the possible outcomes of tonight’s adventure. We took the exit off bay bridge towards treasure island and from that instant on were scanning left and right for the right spot, only to get honked by fellow drivers slowed down by our enthusiasm to find a spot. We had to move on, we then took the right towards the Naval Base and wandered back and forth for about 45 minutes without much luck. I was also ready to pay fine for parking the car in unallocated spaces. But then nothing was getting us the view that we had envisioned.</p>

<td valign="top" width="476">We had almost given up, since the light was falling off quickly now, but my GPS (Nokia N95 8GB phone) had not given up, it kept spelling out instructions to nowhere (or so it appeared to us). We decided that as a last try we will follow the GPS. We got back into the car and drove as the GPS instructed only to find a small road to the right, we did take it with a lot of speculation, but then voila.. there it was. It was truly a breathtaking view, straight out of a holly wood movie. There was only one problem left, parking the car. We just pulled over onto the dirt surface, and parked the car along the slope, it was delicately hanging in there, but who cared about a rental car? More so when the view in front of us was mesmerizing at the least to worry about anything else.</td>

<p align="justify">I set up the gear quickly, fired out some test shots, adjusted the camera settings and set off the interval-o-meter and relaxed a bit. But then, this was just beginning and over the course of the next 90 minutes or so, I was checking in on the light every few minutes to ensure that it was not getting too dark.  This was the first time I was trying a proper time lapse photography and few minutes into the shoot, I realized that I had chosen a very tricky subject. With light changing every minute, it was getting very difficult to control the exposures and I was concerned how the final results would be. Because every time I increase the EV value, the scene gets brighter than the previous shot, whereas the expectation is in dusk the video should progressively darken out. Nevertheless, I kept aggressively changing the settings to compensate for the deteriorating light conditions. Thankfully, it appears those changes helped and though the final video does have some flicker and shakes, the video did come out decent enough. More on the settings and time lapse photography techniques in another blog.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, we setup my friend’s camera to take some long exposure shots and try out various different experiments. I must mention this about him, he was absolutely patient and supportive not just that evening but on previous occasions and the following morning when we shot another time lapse of the sunrise from Twin peaks. Thanks Saurabh! You were awesome company!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh well what an evening it had been, while we are yet to ingest the awesome view that we have in front of us, we saw 2 guys walking towards us, our hearts were pounding wondering if those 2 were cops. Thank god, they were just fellow photographers, trying to get a view of the city. Understanding they were, they never came anywhere close to our setup knowing that we were working on a time lapse. And yeah, we did end up without getting copped.</p>
<p align="justify">Having a very clear sky, we did not end our day here, we proceeded to Twin peaks, to do some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shsmani/5505451432/in/set-72157626887021257/lightbox/" target="_blank">panoramic shots</a>, then proceeded to have dinner at New Delhi Restaurant and then returned to Treasure Island on the way back to do more shots of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shsmani/5505490506/in/photostream/lightbox/" target="_blank">Bay Bridge</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shsmani/5505430746/in/set-72157626887021257/lightbox/" target="_blank">San Francisco downtown skyline</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">I wanted to do something more than just a timelapse video, that is when I put together the following image. I selected about 9 images from about 4000+ images, depicting each 10 minute period of the total 90 minute period. Picked up portions of the image and stitched them together to make the final image has seen here. I have to admit, that this is not a completely original idea and I have seen something similar elsewhere, I am just glad that it came back to me at the right time and I was able to put it together neat and clean.</p>
