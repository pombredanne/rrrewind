				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Mall of America" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2254/2082114224_2803c6fde4.jpg" height="333" width="500" /></p>
<p>Most folks who know me well are aware that I do not take much pleasure in shopping&#8211;especially the kind of retail shopping that involves plunking down major cash outlays for transitory and often cheaply made consumer goods. In short, I just about have to be dragged to a shopping mall.</p>
<p>That said, I can understand how shopping can be classed as &#8220;retail therapy.&#8221; There&#8217;s the thrill finding that seemingly perfect item to fill a need, or more likely, a want in a person&#8217;s life. I&#8217;ve been there and done that and have come to find the outcome severely lacking.</p>
<p>Now I practice &#8220;not-so-retail&#8221; therapy. Let me explain. As a member of <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thecompact/" target="_blank">The Compact</a>, I avoid buying new items that contribute to an ever-growing waste stream and violate principles of justice and equity that I hold important.</p>
<p>My latest &#8220;not-so-retail&#8221; therapy sessions involved Goodwill, Staples, and Dollar Tree. Here&#8217;s the story.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="black wool coat" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dfY1AWwWlmA/TvKbp6yQgVI/AAAAAAAAFOI/g3yumZAZoj0/s320/black+wool+coat2.jpg" height="253" width="320" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been looking for a basic black wool winter coat since moving back north of the Mason/Dixon line (great match for clergy clothes), so I stopped in at my local Goodwill to check out what might be available. Sure enough I found a gorgeous classic style from a New York custom tailor for $12. Awesome! Then I found a pair of black Ann Taylor dress pants that fit perfectly for $4. Nice! Finally, I found a name brand long mock turtle sweater/dress that is perfect for tights or skinny jeans and boots for $3. Score! To make it even better, the nice lady at the cash register took an additional $2 off  the price of the pants because they were missing a button. Wow!</p>
<p>So for $17 I got three wonderful articles of clothing that are useful, in great condition, and didn&#8217;t put anything new into the consumer stream. Plus, these items helped me to get closer to my black/white and shots of bright color basic wardrobe that I&#8217;ve been aiming for as clothes wear out. My deal is that when three things come in three things go out, so three summer shirts went bye-bye.</p>
<p>A few days later, after considerable research (assisted by my more tech-savvy spouse), I headed over to Staples armed with a 20% off coupon to purchase a new projector for the congregation I serve. I came out with a fine model that has everything we need along with a set of nice speakers (40% off) for a total ticket of considerably under $500. Being a good steward of the congregation&#8217;s money is important. Could I have found one used? Possibly. In this case, I decided to make the purchase new to balance value, need, and time constraints.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="EPSON EB-S10_009" alt="" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5220/5502213646_02bd64ed65.jpg" height="332" width="500" /></p>
<p>Finally, the lure of The Dollar Tree next to Staples was too much to resist, and $13 and change later I emerged with 10 cans of Muir Glen organic diced tomatoes, two jars of an upstate New York regional pasta sauce (great ingredient list), and a box of organic peanut butter chip granola bars. I couldn&#8217;t have been happier had you set me loose in Macy&#8217;s the day after Thanksgiving with a $1000 gift card.</p>
<p>You probably understand the search for a good value on the projector, but you may be shaking your head and wondering how I can get so excited about dollar store diced tomatoes and secondhand clothing. It is, after all, counter to everything our culture tries to sell us about what it means to be a consumer. That&#8217;s the point. I no longer need to be told, sold, or &#8220;guilted&#8221; into consuming beyond my needs.</p>
<p>As part of a culture that takes way more than its share of the world&#8217;s resources, I feel a responsibility to weigh each purchase carefully. I prefer to buy local or regional brands (often dumped at dollar or outlet stores) to avoid supporting agri-giants. I buy used clothing whenever possible and try to avoid big box stores in favor of locally owned businesses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="New Fishers Goodwill store" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6904985795_3186f6606b.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a constant effort to be an un-consumer in a consumer culture, and I fail miserably from time to time. But I believe it is the effort and thought that count. If all of us would simply begin to weigh our purchases more carefully in terms of justice, environmental impact, and impact on the local economy and our neighbors, I think we&#8217;d see a huge difference. At least that&#8217;s my hope, prayer, and dream. In the meantime, I&#8217;m content to engage in not-so-retail therapy whenever I must consume. Sure is a lot easier on the bank account, too!</p>
<p>How about you? What are your tips for being a more thoughtful consumer? Do you engage in no-so-retail therapy, too?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lisabardack.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_38791.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-805" title="Halloween Candy" alt="" src="http://lisabardack.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_38791.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" height="768" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Another Halloween has come and gone. After hopping from house to house in a celebratory frenzy, our little Ninja Claire came home, plopped on the living room rug and began the ritual carried out for generations: the sorting of candy. I remember doing it myself as a kid, with great excitement, wondering if I had more Sugar Babies this year than last. For Claire, it’s Nerds, Dots and Laffy Taffy that top her list. Twizzlers, too. Watching her sort with joy and precision, I pushed down the sadness and confusion I felt, knowing how happy she is to have all this candy. Knowing it’s all made with genetically modified corn syrup.</p>
<p>I don’t want to dampen her sunny spirits with my concerns or deprive her of confections that give her such happiness. I don’t want her not participating in this sweet indulgence that all her friends partake of. She knows to an extent what genetically modified food is, that it’s not good for her. She knows that it’s in candy. And together we’ve decided that moderation is the key, so she’s fine with one piece a day. I’m proud of her restraint.</p>
<p>So one piece a day it is for a short while, but this doesn’t sit easily with me, because I don’t trust GMOs. Because the FDA does not test for the safety of GMOs, instead relying on the biotech companies that create them to determine if they are safe. Because I know that the dose is not the poison and that children are much more vulnerable. Because studies show it may be affecting her immune systems in ways that may be irreversible.</p>
<p>As of right now about 85 percent of the corn grown in the United States is genetically engineered to either produce an insecticide or to survive the application of herbicide. GM corn is equipped with a gene from soil bacteria called Bt or Bacillus thuringiensis. This produces the Bt-toxin in the corn, an insecticide that breaks open the stomach of certain insects and kills them.</p>
<p>If this stuff is engineered to get into the gut of bugs and kill them, what is it doing to children who ingest it? Companies like Monsanto say nothing at all. Yet, in a <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/05/31/study-found-toxin-from-gm-crops-is-showing-up-in-human-blood.aspx" target="_blank">recent study in Canada</a>, the Bt-toxin showed up in 93 percent of maternal blood samples, 80 percent of fetal blood samples and 69 percent of non-pregnant women blood samples. Some discredit this study and other studies that raise concerns about the effects of GMOs. Some say we need to be paying serious attention to them.  I tend toward paying attention to them.</p>
<p>Yet I stuck a Laffy Taffy in her lunch today as requested, along with a prayer that I am not doing her harm. What kind of mother am I? I feel so conflicted, dancing between GMO knowledge and a kid’s right to enjoy candy. It’s really the only GMO food she eats. I’m an organic mom for the most part when it comes to the food I feed Claire, but I trip over the candy. I can’t face telling her that it’s poison when it’s candy, something so fundamental to childhood. Maybe the little she has won’t have an effect on her.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I should be like the moms who say no to GMOs all the way. But I can’t seem to do it. I don’t want Claire to feel deprived of such a basic childhood pleasure. I can only hope that this isn’t a decision I will later regret. It sure does take a bit of the happy out of Halloween.  And puts the scariness back into it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>If Thoreau could have a pond, so can I.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_56921.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1584" title="IMG_5692" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_56921.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112" height="112" width="150" /></a>I have been going out to the Bear State Forest about 25 minutes from Lenox and it has become my refuge. It is beautiful, solitary, and I’m watching the seasonal changes happen before my eyes. I have only had time to go once a week on my one day off, so it is my church, my sanity, my communion with nature and myself. I need it and crave it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5699.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1568" title="IMG_5699" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5699.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>I thought I would be finding a new hike to explore each week, but every Sunday I am drawn back to the same pond. I guess if Walden Pond was good enough for Thoreau for a couple of years, once a week on Benedict Pond is ok for me. Silence is broken only by leaves noisily crunching under my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5711.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1569" title="IMG_5711" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5711.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>It seems as though I’ve actually learned this whole resting thing that I sought way back in my first post (<a href="http://meanderest.com/2012/04/16/meander/">Meander</a>-81 posts ago!). I am comfortable with the unknown and the realization of “what will be will be” that I learned at the Medicine Wheel <a href="http://meanderest.com/2012/09/03/lessons-from-a-cattle-drive/">(Lessons from a cattle drive</a> ), and it is allowing me to rest in the path laid out before my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_56951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1585" title="IMG_5695" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_56951.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>As I was hiking around the pond I was struck by something I heard this week in the acting conservatory about our bodies being <i>containers.</i> I let this rattle around in my brain as I hiked and it really started to make sense. The idea is that I am just a container filled with stuff (wisdom, beauty, goodness, anger) whatever the text may need at a given moment. In my daily life this principle works too. I am the container for beauty. I am not beauty but I am the conduit that beauty passes through to others. I’m not wisdom but I am the conduit that wisdom passes through. If I stay open I can be anything! I can be charm, I can be discernment, intelligence because I am just the container. A willing fabulous container. I do have to make a conscious effort to open my lid to be filled and pour out on others, but what a lovely way to live! It takes away all responsibility and greed. I am just the container for good things to pass through to others, so I can’t really take prideful credit, it’s not my doing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5326.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1571" title="IMG_5326" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5326.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>My pond is very special. Someone has made a note box and inside is a composition book, pencils and sharpener. It is situated right near a lovely bench that looks out on the pond. I stop each time and draw and write something in the book. <a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5720.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1572" title="IMG_5720" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5720.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>Today I drew a picture of a pitcher, my container, being filled and pouring out wonderful things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5733.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1573" title="IMG_5733" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5733.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>I walked past a tree that is being gnawed by a beaver. When I was little one of my favorite movies was <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> and since that time I have had a soft spot for beavers and dogs eating spaghetti. I can still hear the animated, buck-toothed, lisping beaver saying with a whistle “sthaay, it workths sthwell!” (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z1k2h9ePfg">watch a clip on YouTube</a> ) I’ve always wanted to be able to make that whistling lisp but have never been able to master it. So to see a tree in a partially gnawed state along the path that looked just like the one in the movie, flooded me with excitement. I found a few more toothed trees and then found the smaller pond where there were beaver huts. I cannot wait to go back next week when I have a bit more time and sit silently and wait to see if I can actually encounter my first real beaver in it’s own habitat possibly busy at work storing up food for winter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5705.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1574" title="IMG_5705" alt="" src="http://meanderest.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_5705.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" height="150" width="112" /></a>My life continues to amaze and delight me. There are new things happening everyday, from hurricane warnings, meeting with school officials for the Shakespeare Festival, being asked to be in a play working with psychiatric patients, watching actors hone their craft, walks in ankle-deep leaves, sharing wine and having reunions with old friends. I am completely where I want to be for now. There is a deep satisfaction in knowing I am where I am supposed to be. And it’s all because I learned to patiently put one foot in front of the other and trust that I am on the right path even if it looks covered with weeds and dimly used.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>I learned this, at least, by my experiment;<br />
that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,<br />
and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined,<br />
he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.</b><br />
from the &#8220;Conclusion&#8221; to <i>Walden</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you outline your article, story or novel before you start writing? Outlining has always struck me as sounding a bit too much like work, and I’ve preferred to think of my creative endeavors as being <i>freeing! unrestrained!</i> Unfortunately, I‘ve come to the realization that my unstructured writing usually winds up being <i>plot-less! unfinished! </i></p>
<p>One reason I avoid outlining is that I’m not entirely sure how to go about it.  I don’t think I need to outline the same way I did in high school, with all those Roman numerals and indentations and such. Even less appealingly, “outlining” was big in law school (as in, “have you outlined the Torts chapter on Trespass to Chattels yet?”)  Yuck!  I try to avoid thinking about law school whenever possible.</p>
<p>I know there are no “rules” for how best to outline, say, a novel, and that it’s all very individual, whatever works best for each writer, etc., etc. But the thing is, I’m overly wordy and impatient on a good day, so I’ve always thought that once I start taking the time to write a really long, detailed outline of the story rattling around in my head—well, I might as well just start drafting the story and see where it ends up. Unfortunately, this usually means that my stories just keep going… and going…with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Well, it’s finally dawned on me that this approach is not working out. As much as I would like to think that my stories grow and blossom and wind their way toward an inevitable and satisfying finish…. that really never happens. So what’s an aspiring novelist to do? I don’t like outlining, but I feel I must at least try it, and I really, really don’t want to use Roman numerals.</p>
<div id="attachment_1111" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 234px"><a href="http://popcorntheblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/outlining-blog-photo_compressed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1111" title="Outlining Blog Photo_Compressed" alt="" src="http://popcorntheblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/outlining-blog-photo_compressed.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" height="300" width="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is not really my outline.</p></div>
<p>Well, it seems the stars have aligned to help me on my way!</p>
<p>First, I found this great <i>Writer’s Digest Magazine </i>blog post called <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/how-to-outline-the-easy-way-like-janet-evanovich">“<i>How to Outline (The Easy Way) Like Janet Evanovich”</i></a> that a) makes me feel better since it seems I&#8217;m not the only reluctant outliner out there, and b) shows <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/how-to-outline-the-easy-way-like-janet-evanovich">an example</a> of how million-billion-gazillion-copies-sold author <a href="http://www.evanovich.com/">Janet Evanovich</a> outlines: with pictures! Well, not really with pictures—but she uses a more visual approach to outlining— a “storyboard” method. That seems do-able to me.</p>
<p>Second, the perfect, no-risk laboratory for my outlining/storyboarding experiment happens to be starting TODAY! <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> has begun! I’ve participated in NaNoWriMo for the past two years— just plunging in with a whole lot of seat-of-my-pants writing and hoping for the best. Both times, I started out strong, writing a chapter or two of an actual, continuous story—only to hit a wall, and have my Nano experience deteriorate into more of a daily personal journal rather than culminate in an actual story. Well this time, I’ll face Nano with a storyboard outline! I’ll stick to it and see if I can write through a <i>whole</i> story&#8211; with a beginning, middle and (this would be unprecedented) an end.  If it’s bad, it’s bad. I don’t care as long as it gets finished. That’s all part of the fun of Nano&#8211; you are allowed (encouraged!)  to write badly, just as long as you write (finish!) your novel.</p>
<p>So, I’ll be making an outline…. right after I finish this blog post! (Just to prove to you how much I abhor outlining, I couldn’t bring myself to outline this blog post <i>about outlining</i>. Perhaps that explains why it sort of veered off into being more about ‘finishing things’ than ‘outlining’, per se.)</p>
<p>Now back to my original question: Do you outline? What do your outlines look like? Do you stick to them? I’d really love to know what works for you!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Allow me to be a hypocrite.</p>
<p><a href="http://sublimelife.org/2012/10/04/science-war/">Not long ago I wrote about how everyone is trying to turn back the clock on science.</a> So many religious fundamentalists and leftist activists are trying to deny the basic principles of sciences when they disagree with the conclusion.</p>
<p>In the past year, noted physicists including Stephen Hawking have made the conclusion that the idea of God&#8217;s place in creating the universe isn&#8217;t &#8220;necessary.&#8221; Interesting. They are basing their conclusions on the notion that every time they derive equations and close some gap regarding an unknown aspect of the universe and its creation, they find a reasonable explanation sans supernatural. So while there are still some mysteries about the spawning of the universe, they feel that whatever they discover, it will be based on something reasonable and not founded in divine mysticism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Prime Mover man myself. While there are so many elements in life easily explained by evidence, such as atomic structures, evolution, DNA, etc., there still is no explanation or proof about what set this giant mechanism known as the universe into motion. Something had to do it. Even if physicists uncover what did spawn the universe, they can&#8217;t explain <em>why</em> it was created. Science is not concerned with the <em>why</em>, only the <em>how</em>. This is fine. It&#8217;s what science does— to provide explanations to the phenomena around us.</p>
<p>The theory of God&#8217;s necessity works the opposite for me. Every time they uncover something, whether it&#8217;s about atoms or the universe, they find yet another, unexplainable facet of their structure which needs investigation. It never seems to end. They have faith in that they will continue to find things deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>But at some point, there has to be an impetus, or a threshold from what we can perceive and understand to an area completely beyond our ability to experience. By ability to experience I do not mean something we can&#8217;t experience <em>yet</em>. I mean something that&#8217;s impossible to see, hear, taste, smell or touch.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a gulf that we can never cross because there&#8217;s no ship to sail over it.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s where God is. Or isn&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 470px"><img alt="Venice - S. Giorgio" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/6/27/1340813384145/San-Giorgio-Maggiore-Veni-008.jpg" height="276" width="460" /><p class="wp-caption-text">St Giorgio Maggiore</p></div>
<p>My first boyfriend sent me a postcard once, from the depth of his compulsory military service, that simply read “Wish you were here”. I was not that familiar with the English language and its subjunctives yet and that phrase resonated mostly to Pink Floyd’s music. But it compelled me to research its meaning and, since then, there have been many incarnations of “I wish I were” &#8211; in Venice, in Cape Town, in the arms of another man, in a more challenging job, in a better mood.</p>
<p>For many years, I was a compulsive seeker: of thrills, experiences, changes, new cities. I clocked miles, continents, jobs and men, always wishing for something or someone a little bit different, some greener pasture that I imagined lived just around the corner. It was indeed exciting, at times satisfying, but it always came with a tinge of letdown attached.</p>
<p>Now, when I wake up in the morning, the first sight my blurry eyes set on is a large photograph of slightly stormy waters, lapping the edges of the Church of San Giorgio, in the Venice lagoon. Many a dawn did I wish I were back there instead of being greeted by the relentless Californian sun. I would daydream, shrouded in the crumpled sheets, how my life would unfold if I had a job that required a boat to get to or how I would stop to pick up the ingredients for dinner at one of the many markets &#8211; our version of trendy Farmers’ Markets but their staple shopping experience. I would wake up to the sound of water sloshing under my windows instead of the chirping of birds and, in winter, I would brave the cold and fog, to meet some friends for dinner, just like that, on the spur of the moment, instead of opening my calendar and pencil something in five days from today.</p>
<p>If I were somewhere different, somewhere so magical, my existence would be perfect; every object and every emotion properly placed in their cubby-hole, an endless series of romantic days and dreamy nights.</p>
<p>I am not sure when the transition happened. It crept on me unnoticed, the way unpleasant habits sometimes do. The transition from wishing to having. A life in Venice. Sure, I could have that, like I had all the others. And it would be just as messy and unpredictable and at times hard and annoying. And also humid and full of tourists.</p>
<p>The truth is I wish I were&#8230;..right here. I took my own sweet time to learn to enjoy the clouds rolling in to create the perfect atmosphere for a Halloween night, the quiet sound of my dogs napping at my feet, the unconditional and imperfect love of the people who matter, my uncertain future and my perfect present.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be a life in Venice or in Timbuktu or wherever else my path will take me. In the comfort of my skin, it seems irrelevant right now. The dogs have raised their heads in food expectation. The half-drained cup of tea has gotten cold. The most melancholy hour of the day has set in, the one that always made me wish for something, someone, somewhere different. Now it only reminds me it’s time to switch the lights on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish I were the subjunctive mood. So mysterious. So misunderstood. If I were the subjunctive mood, only the cool crowd would <i>get</i> me, man. People would want to plumb my depths, find what lurks beneath these still waters. But my innermost nature would remain an eternal mystery, because I’d be like the wind, baby.</p>
<p>The subjunctive mood has been referred to as a linguistic fossil, and as fewer and fewer people understand it, it falls farther and farther out of use and someday could conceivably disappear entirely. What a pity that would be.</p>
<p>Of the people who do use it, one has to imagine that a good portion of those don’t know why they use it beyond recognizing that it “sounds right.” Someone might sing, “If I were a rich man,” but if pressed on why he or she sang “I were” instead of “I was,” the person would likely have no real idea—and might even fear that an error had been committed.</p>
<p>The Merriam-Webster definition of mood is the “distinction of form or a particular set of inflectional forms of a verb to express whether the action or state it denotes is conceived as fact or in some other manner (as command, possibility, or wish).” (I could have paraphrased the definition right off, but this way I can recommend <i>Harm∙less Drudg∙ery</i>, an informative and entertaining blog from Merriam-Webster lexicographer Kory Stamper.)</p>
<p>To put it more simply, mood shows the mode or manner that thoughts are expressed. Most people are much more familiar with the indicative mood, used to express facts and opinions and to make inquiries, and the imperative mood, used to give orders and make requests.</p>
<p>The subjunctive mood, marked by seemingly odd verb forms and sometimes known as the malady-sounding conjunctive mood, is used to express statements that are contrary to fact or conditions that are doubtful or unreal, such as wishes and possibilities. Clauses beginning with <i>if</i> are a frequent hideout for subjunctive verbs.</p>
<p>The following are a few examples of subjunctive verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I <i>were </i>taller, it would be you looking up to me.</li>
<li>I wish it <i>were</i> a sunnier day.</li>
<li>Her command was that we all <i>be</i> on our toes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unreal states, wishing, longing even: yes, the subjunctive mood is a dreamer, and what a beautiful thing to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish I were a ghost for a while.  If I were, I wouldn&#8217;t bother with the clanking chains bit.  I&#8217;d figure that I had carried enough baggage around during my regular life.  Instead, I would just relax and enjoy my newfound lightness of being.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t waste any time moaning or groaning either, or hovering above people&#8217;s beds, scaring them half to death.  If I were a ghost, I&#8217;d float to the top of a tree, probably a red maple, and I&#8217;d linger there as the leaves turned to glory and some fluttered to the ground.  I&#8217;d flutter down too and become one of them, swirling and twirling and skittering along the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I would visit some folks, but not the ones who had caused me misery and heartache when I was alive.  I&#8217;d be glad that I never had to see them again.  I would visit the ones who would welcome my company, the ones who loved me, or lonely ones who felt forgotten or invisible to the world.  I&#8217;d stay with them while they sat in their kitchens drinking coffee in the early morning.  Time would mean nothing to me and I&#8217;d visit lots of them.  When they went to bed that night, they&#8217;d be a little bit cheered, without knowing why.</p>
<p>If I were a ghost, I&#8217;d go places.  Boy, would I go places.  I&#8217;d drift in and over and through the most beautiful places on Earth and I&#8217;d become a part of them.  When people saw these places, they&#8217;d be seeing me, and they&#8217;d tell people about it.  &#8221;I&#8217;ve been there before but this time it was really something,&#8221; they&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>If I ever started to feel dead inside I would fly, lightning fast, straight up the vertical planes of the tallest skyscrapers in the biggest cities.  I&#8217;d absorb all the glittering scenes and chaotic sounds below and I&#8217;d be filled again with the energy of the living.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I guess I would haunt some places, mostly libraries and museums, but only at night when there&#8217;d be nobody to scare.  I&#8217;d look for other ghosts among my favorite books and art, maybe even pass through some of them, but I&#8217;d be quiet.</p>
<p>If I were a ghost, I wouldn&#8217;t bother anybody or anything, I&#8217;d just be.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>This piece is a response to the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/weekly-writing-challenge-i-wish-i-were/" target="_blank">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> from WordPress.  The challenge this week is to write a post using the prompt &#8220;I wish I were&#8230;&#8221; After writing this one, I must say that the spirit of the subjunctive mood haunts me still.  :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until a few years ago, I paid an exterminator to do my killing.  A gentleman of about sixty, came every few months and moved quickly through the house, squirting liquid death in corners and along baseboards.  And during these visits his voice was constant.  It began innocently enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of bugs you been having?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roaches.  Ants.  And spiders. Lots of spiders,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>I expected him to pause while compiling my response then go back to his truck to blend a cocktail of insecticides just for me, but he went on about his business, speed-walking around the kitchen with the metal can he came in with, noting how carefully he serviced homes with children.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can&#8217;t do anything about ants. Not really spiders even.  They&#8217;re harmless anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>I know they&#8217;re harmless, </em>I thought.<em>  But I want them dead!</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like having a boy and a girl?&#8221; he asked, lunging to the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>I had a boy and a girl, it was true.  But I never thought of it as a choice, either in regards to their sex or in my liking them.  &#8220;I guess so!&#8221; I shouted back.</p>
<p>I mean, what would I do, what <em>could</em> I do, if I stopped liking them?  Could I trade them in for newer models?  Did they have reset buttons?  I&#8217;d always assumed that liking my children was required.  Suddenly, I didn&#8217;t like thinking about my kids anymore.  And it would go on like this.  He&#8217;d ask me what I thought about an upcoming football game, while I made a list of orphanages and adoption services in the metro area.</p>
<p>After a few more visits he began adding personal, and sometimes sordid, bits of intelligence gathered from other customers in the area.  One family had an ongoing dispute with a neighbor about the toxicity of the mosquito service he provided.  And another woman had part of her bottom removed.  For a few weeks after this, I couldn&#8217;t stop staring at neighborhood fannies, consumed by a curiosity to know who this poor woman was.  And even though I wasn&#8217;t inviting him to share any of this, I still felt guilty, as if I should have crammed toilet paper into my ears when I saw him pull in the driveway.</p>
<p>And presumably by mistaking my usual silence for agreement, he soon began vomiting out his political views.   <em>This candidate or party would save us from the moral and economic decay we faced.  The other candidate or party was the antichrist.</em></p>
<p>So here was a man, who, although a little odd, was otherwise pleasant, and appeared to be able to hold down a job.  He also knew how to drive a truck and was good at lacquering cabinetry and toys with poison.  But at the same time, he had assembled a collection of political opinions with the care that a three year-old takes in wiping his ass after a shit.  Honestly, if there is process that turns a human into a pile of feces on a bathroom floor more quickly or completely than politics, I don&#8217;t know of it.</p>
<p>I get that there is competition for this honor, so let me address a few of them.  Atheists might argue that religion is such a process, but, although not a true believer myself, I can see how some religious writings are rather practical.  Take, for instance, if you were seeking a wife, the Bible tells you to <em>find an attractive prisoner of war, bring her home, shave her head, trim her nails, and give her new clothes.  </em>Voila, you have a wife (Deuteronomy 21:11-13).  And also guidance in labor relations - <em>it is okay to beat a slave to a temporary crippling as long as you don&#8217;t damage his teeth, in which case you must set him free</em> (Exodus 21:26-27).</p>
<p>Or perhaps some women feel that sexual urges have this impact on men.  But from my 40+ years with a penis, it seems perfectly logical that closing a box of cereal (slipping tab A into slot B) can divert blood from one head to the other.  And anyway, according to Ephesians 5:21-25, it is my right to do so with my good lady wife.</p>
<p>No.  When I see <a class="zem_slink" title="Ann Coulter" href="http://anncoulter.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Ann Coulter</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Keith Olbermann" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Keith Olberman</a> at the front of their respective lines for the shit buffet, I&#8217;m sticking with politics.</p>
<p><a href="http://thechildishman.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/coulter-olberman.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-331" title="Coulter Olberman" alt="" src="http://thechildishman.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/coulter-olberman.jpg?w=590"   /></a>So what does this have to do with <a class="zem_slink" title="David Sedaris" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">David Sedaris</a>?  Well, this past weekend my wife and I went to hear him speak.  Sitting behind us was a &#8221;girls night out&#8221; gaggle who, to express their free-spiritedness, removed their shoes, put them on the backs of our seats, and began moaning about politics before the reading began.  <em>How awful things would be</em>, they said, <em>if Romney became President</em>.  And they made a pact, then and there, with their toes on my collar, to move overseas if Romney won.  Unlike the same pact they made before Bush&#8217;s re-election, <em>this time</em> they were serious.  They were really going to leave!</p>
<p>After his readings, Sedaris took some questions, one of which was about his essay <a title="Undecided" href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2008/10/27/081027sh_shouts_sedaris">&#8220;Undecided&#8221;</a> published in <em>The New Yorker </em>before the 2008 presidential election.  He briefly said how odd such political indecision was, likening it to confusion over two choices of entree &#8211; chicken, or a &#8220;platter of shit with bits of broken glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand that Sedaris is a humorist, and one of the best at that, who probably couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to comment on politics and poke fun at the same time.  And I must admit that I am decidedly <em>decided</em> in the upcoming election.  I have an opinion, so I, too, am subject to the following criticism.</p>
<p><em>Who cares what your political opinion is</em>!  And why is it so important to have a political opinion anyway?  Isn&#8217;t it possible for a person to listen to crapstorms over betrothing, buggery, and bullets and say &#8221;Okay, I&#8217;m not sure how these effect me.  I&#8217;m already married.  My wife doesn&#8217;t allow deliveries through the back door, if you know what I mean.  And I don&#8217;t enjoy shooting people in the face.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, for the politcally-minded who believed Obama would close Guantanamo and substantially pull us out of wars and economic sludge, and for the people who believed this country would go to hell within months because of &#8220;socialism,&#8221; maybe you made the right, obvious, and noble choice - chicken.  Too bad you&#8217;ve been eating shit with broken glass all along.</p>
