			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes in Korea we walk from place to place or sometimes we take a taxi cab, but my favorite way to travel is by Seoul-train. When we go underground to catch the subway, it is like another world where everything smells like waffle cones and smart phones. Tiana taught me how to take the yellow line to the orange line to the blue line and she also taught me how to scan my metro card on the way out of the station so I don&#8217;t get trapped underground. People on the subway like to sleep and I always wonder how many people miss their stops and wake up to find that they have accidentally ridden to the end of the line. The other day, a little old man with some shopping bags and a pair of wire rimmed glasses nodded off to sleep on my shoulder. He rested easy for a minute then jerked awake when the train started up again, but I barely noticed that he used me as a pillow, as I was busy watching several sleepers in the aisle across from me. Another thing people do on the subway, besides rest, is fondle theirÂ smart phones, which means that they text, surf the internets or play Angry Birds. The cabin of the train is pretty quiet, but sometimes you can catch quiet conversations over the hum of the metro engine, and sometimes you can hear the automated voice announcing over the loud speakers that you have finally made it to Bokjandong. But without fail, the loudest noise by far is the constant tapping of people&#8217;s fingers on their iPhones, texting their neighbors to say hello.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For quite some time now I have been thinking of buying a bicycle. Â It would make going to &#8216;medium&#8217; distance places (where it&#8217;s a fair distance to walk but really shouldn&#8217;t need to take a car) much easier, fun, healthier and friendlier on the environment.</p>
<p>On a trip to Japan last year I came across these bicycles at a very reasonable price, that would fold-up in half for easy storage &#8211; perfect for an apartment dweller with limited space. Â But I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to buy it, carry it around during my holiday and post it back to Australia! Â I really should have made the effort, I&#8217;m kicking myself for it now as I haven&#8217;t been able to find anything quite like them since. Â If you&#8217;re enjoying a bike ride this weekend, I&#8217;m very jealous.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://timonsopus.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gentleman-at-desk.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2792" title="Gentleman at Desk" src="http://timonsopus.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gentleman-at-desk.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="273" /></a></p>
<p>What is that sound you ask? I am banging my head on my desk.Â  Why?Â  I have an addiction to pain. Life is about pain management.Â  Writers must have extraordinary threshold for pain.Â The deadlinesÂ are often too short. Editors change documents beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Did I mention the submission process? Â There is a significant chance the proposal or draft will face rejection. Some writers collect their rejection letters. This whole process reeks of insanity. What a wonderful world. I can smell the psychological scarring.</p>
<p>Apparently, I am not alone inÂ my angst toward writing. Novelist and journalist Anna Quindlen offers her take in <em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304432704577348020550966282.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">The Agony of Writing</a>.Â </em>Quindlen is a very successful columnist and has published several books. Despite this, she has to force herself to write. According to Quinlden, &#8220;I hate to write. I have to force myself every day to sit down and begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>She offers a method to her madness by establishing a routine. &#8220;I convinced that there are only so many words per day in the human body: if you do some longish emails and a few tweets, you feel done.&#8221;Â Â She has developed coping skills for the craft. There so much I need to learn.</p>
<p>On another subject, the PulitzerÂ Prize Board declined to award a prize in fiction.Â  Novelist Ann Patchett voiced her concerns in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/opinion/and-the-winner-of-the-pulitzer-isnt.html?_r=3&amp;src=tp"><em>And The WinnerÂ </em>Isn&#8217;t.</a>Â Â  Patchett&#8217;s essayÂ emphasized the importance ofÂ  fiction in our society.Â <em>Following complex story lines stretches our brains beyond the 140 characters of sound-bite thinking, andÂ </em><em>staying within the world of a novel gives us the ability to be quiet and alone, two skills that are disappearing faster than the polar icecaps. The Pulitzer Prize is our best chance as writers and readers and booksellers to celebrate fiction. This was the year we all lost.</em></p>
<p>Georgetown Professor MaureenÂ Corrigan offers differentÂ perspectiveÂ regarding Pulitzer Prize controversy.Â  She served as one of the jurors that recommended books to the Pulitzer Board.Â  According to Corrigan, there is aÂ flaw in theÂ awarding the prize. There is no crisis in American literature. Corrigan offers aÂ fewÂ recommendations to reform the process in<em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/pulitzers-no-decision-in-fiction-exposes-flaws-in-the-process/2012/04/18/gIQAXJooRT_story.html">No Decision on Fiction Prize Exposes Flaw in Process.</a>Â  </em></p>
<p>Among the proposals,<em>Â </em>Corrigan suggests that the winner is selectedÂ by a pluralityÂ and not a majority. From her perspective, this would avoid gridlock. If this is not aÂ practicalÂ solution, sheÂ  proposes that the jury (which consists of literaryÂ experts)Â can select the winner. The jury reviewed over 300 novels and short story collectionsÂ toÂ decideÂ the nominees.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greg Oden has been cut by the Portland Trailblazers due to chronic knee problems.Â  Brandon Roy announced his retirement in 2011 prior to the start of the season, citing &#8220;degenerative knees&#8221; as the major contributing factor in his decision.Â Â  Something is going dreadfully wrong in the Northwest! And it&#8217;s not the athletes&#8217; fault.</p>
<div id="attachment_211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 200px"><a href="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/greg-oden-dunking.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-211 " title="greg oden dunking" src="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/greg-oden-dunking.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="265" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the Greg Oden drafted by the Trailblazers!</p></div>
<p>In the August of 2008, I received a call from then Portland Trailblazer&#8217;s assistant General Manager Tom Penn.Â  &#8220;I heard about your services and want to know if you have an interest in conducting your biomechanics assessment on Greg Oden?&#8221; was how he started the conversation.Â  I replied, &#8220;Of course, what did you have in mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Tom, they had just been given the ok for Greg to start practicing basketball.Â  After about an hour of conversation about what types of tests I would perform, Tom and I decided now would be as good a time as any.Â Well, it turns out Greg Oden was in LA filming an episode of a television show and if I could get there before he left it would be an ideal time to test Greg. So I packed up my biomechanics equipment and headed for LA.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Mondrian Hotel in Beverly Hills, the hotel staff directed me to their exercise facility where I began to set up my equipment. Greg arrived shortly after I did and we immediately got started on the first of six (6) motion analysis-based biomechanics assessments I would conduct on him that day.Â  At the time, we called the assessment motion DNA testing.Â  The concept is based on the idea that no two people move the same way.Â  Every person&#8217;s motion is as unique to them as their fingerprint or DNA.Â  What affects the efficiency of their motion DNA is their physical strengths, weakness, injuries, habits, limitations, and more&#8230;regardless of whether their physical history is positive or negative.Â  It all affects how each person moves.</p>
<p>In Greg&#8217;s case, his history was affected by his height and injury history, as well as the training and rehab he&#8217;d undergone since his first day of playing sports.Â  At the time of his assessment, Greg was coming off micro-fracture surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee which cut his rookie season short before it started.Â  The procedure and coinciding rehabilitation program forced Greg to miss his entire rookie season.Â  According to team physicians and the medical staff, Greg was recovered and approved to return to the court for practices and &#8220;game like&#8221; situations.Â  Greg&#8217;s biomechanics assessment told a different story.</p>
<p>Test 1- I hooked up 2 inertia-based motion tracking sensors just above Greg&#8217;s knees. The assessment was designed to measure the symmetry of motion between Greg&#8217;s left and right legs to determine any differences which might lead to setbacks unless targeted with deficiency specific exercises.Â  The sensors measure the rotation, adduction/abduction, and flexion/extension of each leg above and below the knee.Â  In addition to the crucial range of motion-related data, the sensor also allowed me to look at the timing, tempo, and coordination of each leg during normal straight ahead walking and running.</p>
<p>Greg was given two walking tests at 3mph with a 5% incline and 4 running tests at other varying speeds of 6 mph, 7 mph, and 8 mph . Greg&#8217;s results showed an alarming disparity in the range of motion (ROM) between his legs with his right leg showing significant weaknesses above and below the knee.Â  Greg&#8217;s left knee showed increasingly large signs of fatigue and overuse resulting from compensations for the weaknesses and physical limitations of his right leg.</p>
<p>Test #2</p>
<p>For biomechanics testing #2, I placed 8 motion tracking sensors all over Greg&#8217;s legs, arms, hips and torso.Â  Each of these sensors would be give us valuable information about how Greg&#8217;s entire body responded to stresses and muscle imbalances.Â  Greg was asked to do simple moves including a functional movement screen referred to as an Overhead Squat (body weight only) and a single and triple vertical leap test.Â  The 3D-Motion Capture assessment confirmed the imbalances identified by his gait analysis and then some.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from his report delivered to and reviewed with the Portland Trailblazers medical staff.</p>
<p><strong>From Greg Oden&#8217;s Report of Findings August 25, 2008:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Excerpt #1</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Odenâs Right knee appears to have recovered from the surgery. Data indicates the ability to bear weight almost normally in the right leg&#8217;s Quadriceps and Hamstring muscles. However, a deeper look at the data indicates that Odenâs normal gait patterns have altered to compensate for weaknesses in his right lower leg.Â  And as a result, does not distribute weight appropriately throughout the entire right leg. To compensate for the original injury and lower leg weaknesses, Oden has started to bear at times as much as 144% of his weight on the left leg (Ex.: during running trial at 7.0mph for 15 seconds, ROM 10.8 degrees extension L compared to 4.4 degrees of extension R). To compensate, Odenâs right leg excessively internally rotates during extension (push off) at lower speeds. While at higher rates of speed excessively abducts and externally rotates indicating circumduction of the right leg. This action can lead to hip pain on the right side, lower back pain/injury and opposite side knee pain as rotational forces cause the opposite knee to twist and as a result may cause the quadriceps muscles to overload to resist the rotation. This could be the cause of the left leg Patella Tendonitis.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Excerpt #2</strong></em></p>
<p><em>When asked to jump, Oden proceeded to bear more weight evenly during take off, but landed with over 30% more weight on his left leg, demonstrating a conscious or subconscious lack of use of the right knee. The overloaded landing can cause significant stress and fatigue to the left quadriceps/patella tendon.</em></p>
<p>After reviewing the report with the Trailblazers medical staff, I came to several conclusions.Â  The problem might not be Greg.Â  I learned from the medical staff that they were already working on some of the exercises and drills which I was recommending for Greg. My response was simple&#8230;Greg&#8217;s ability to do any of the exercises correctly without hands on assistance was hampered by his own weaknesses.Â  Greg needed (as do many people undergoing rehab) one-on-one attention to detail as he performed each exercise.Â  For example: If the goal is to increase the strength in the weakest parts of Greg&#8217;s right leg, the more complex the exercise, the more he was able to compensate and work around actually isolating the weak muscles.Â  Greg needed someone to watch over each rep and exercise carefully to make sure he was doing each exercise correctly until all ofÂ  the muscles being targeted were able to contract on autopilot.Â  Surgery causes damage to nerves which take time to regenerate, affecting the way a person performs an exercise. Â  This is nearly impossible in a team setting and requires private one-on-one therapy with a therapist who understands how each segment of the body is supposed to move.</p>
<p><strong>From Greg Oden&#8217;s Report of Findings September 24, 2008:</strong></p>
<p><em>Based upon the analysis, our recommendation is the following:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Â Increase Overall Hamstring Strength</em></li>
<li><em>Â Increase R hamstring and Glute Strength</em></li>
<li><em>Â Improve R leg explosiveness</em></li>
<li><em>Â Increase L Gastroc, Soleus, Glute, Hamstring and Quad Flexibility</em></li>
<li><em>Consider a more efficient shoe designed to lift the entire foot to improve normal leg stride.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Greg&#8217;s case, every exercise or target area needing improvement on his list required slow, yet focused repetitions.Â  If Greg was asked to walk, run, squat or jump, he placed more of the load on his left leg than his weaker right leg.Â  I informed the medical staff that this overload would put Greg at risk for a major acute injury to his left leg.Â Â  Greg&#8217;s imbalance was so distinct that I even advised that staff that if he didn&#8217;t improve the weaknesses in the short-term and continue some of the rehab-like exercises for the entire season, his career could be at risk.</p>
<div id="attachment_206" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 293px"><a href="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/greg-oden-lies-on-the-floor-by.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-206" title="greg oden lies on the floor photo by Steve Benkam" src="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/greg-oden-lies-on-the-floor-by.jpg?w=283&h=282" alt="" width="283" height="282" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Career in Jeopardy after suffering a fractured patella.</p></div>
<p>And you can believe it or not, but the medical staff laughed off my recommendations. In fact, we spent nearly two hours at dinner with the medical staff questioning my results and looking for reasons to discredit the results rather than search for solutions to keep the team&#8217;s multimillion dollar athlete on the court.Â  At one point, one member of the medical staff informed me that Greg suffered from a true anatomical leg length shortness on the right side.Â  As a result of that diagnosis, Greg had been prescribed, by physicians, to wear a heel lift in his right shoe.Â  Well doc, I hate to be the one to tell you again, but the heel lift actually increases the load and the amount of anterior/posterior shear (forward/backward sliding) on Greg&#8217;s right knee, contributing to his need to undergo several micro-fracture surgeries.</p>
<p>The results of Greg&#8217;s biomechanics assessments created doubt in my mind about the leg length claims. However, I suggested an alternative to a heel lift if they truly believed that a shorter right leg was a contributing factor to his knee injuries.Â  The solution, for an athlete with Greg&#8217;s height and leg length, an entire shoe lift (orthopedic shoe on the right side) would reduce the sheer forces in the joint and keep Greg healthy while he continued the rehab.</p>
<p>You can imagine the laughter that filled the restaurant from the table.Â  &#8220;No one wears a shoe lift,&#8221; one staffer replied.Â  &#8220;That&#8217;s crazy. Where would we get one?&#8221;Â  To which I replied, &#8220;Hey Nike is Greg&#8217;s shoe sponsor and they are right down the street. I&#8217;m sure they could customize a shoe lift for one of their star athletes if it keeps him healthy.&#8221;Â  To my knowledge, no shoe lift was ordered for Greg.</p>
<p>Despite the medical staff&#8217;s objections to further testing, Assistant General Manager Tom Penn was sold on the results and wanted the entire team tested.Â  Over the next two weeks, we scheduled a visit to Portland to test the entire team at the start of the preseason.Â  Testing, ofÂ  those players not in camp or available at the time for biomechanics testing during my visit to Portland, would be completed during a practice session in Los Angeles prior to a preseason game with the Clippers.</p>
<p>After completing testing of the entire team (in Portland and LA) and a retest of Greg Oden in Portland, I was astonished at the results of the athletes on the Trailblazer teams. While some athletes demonstrated more biomechanical efficiency than others.Â  The results of several athletes stood out:Â  Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, and Joel Pryzbilla. Each of their results showed imbalances, which if gone untreated, would lead to long-term, career threatening, chronic knee issues among other random supposedly unrelated injuries.</p>
<p>Well you may not recall but in 2009, Joel Pryzbilla and Greg Oden both suffered patella or patella tendon injuries . The reports submitted to the team and its medical staff both specifically identified significant amounts of stress on each player&#8217;s patella tendon and knee joints as a result of compensating for opposite leg weaknesses and physical limitations.Â  From 2008 through 2012, all three players had each undergone at least one surgery each (that we know of).Â  Oden has had at least three major surgeries since 2008, and Brandon Roy is retired after undergoing at least three procedures since 2008.</p>
<p>Neither player consistently contributed significantly to the team as a result of the physical condition of their bodies.Â  Based upon my assessments back in 2008 and the marginal access I have had to follow their histories, each player&#8217;s the risk of each injury could have been significantly reduced or prevented all together.Â  So I say this to Greg , Brandon, Joel, and every other professional athlete&#8230;get a second opinion outside of the team. Take control of your body and your career.Â  Over the past two years, I have written about the risks of injuries associated with biomechanical deficiencies.</p>
<div id="attachment_207" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 320px"><a href="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/kneeprzybilla.jpg"><img class="wp-image-207 " title="kneeprzybilla" src="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/kneeprzybilla.jpg?w=310&h=254" alt="" width="310" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pryzbilla in pain after a ruptured patella tendon.</p></div>
<p>Strong egos and lack of information are catching up to athletes and changing if not ending careers in all sports.Â  Nicolas Batum, Pryzbilla, Travis Outlaw, among other Trailblazers, all missed significant time since their initial biomechanics assessments from 2008-2009 due to injuries which could have been prevented and were pointed out in their reports to the team&#8217;s medical staff.Â  Brandon Roy was forced into retirement because he was not given proper care for his injuries. Greg Oden&#8217;s career is at risk for the same reasons.Â  Both players could still get back on the court and yes, Brandon Roy&#8217;s &#8220;degenerative knees&#8221; can be healthy and he could play for 5-10 more years with the proper treatment.</p>
<div id="attachment_208" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 311px"><a href="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/brandon-roy-injury-surgery-meniscus-torn.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-208 " title="Brandon-Roy-Injury-Surgery-Meniscus-Torn" src="https://zigsports.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/brandon-roy-injury-surgery-meniscus-torn.jpg?w=301&h=268" alt="" width="301" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brandon Roy following a preventable tear to his meniscus.</p></div>
<p>The solution: more testing to obtain more objective information is the only way to insure the investment professional teams make in athletes.Â  Tom Penn should be applauded as an assistant general manager for trying to make a positive impact on the health of the team.Â  Instead, shortly after 2008, Tom was not rehired and currently works as an analyst for ESPN.Â  Sure another Greg Oden and maybe even another Brandon Roy will come along for Portland. In the future, athletes like Greg and Brandon will be labeled injury-prone or a bad risk (as they have been since the beginning of sports). The risk is not the investment in the athlete, its the investment in the care they get from the team which drafts or trades for them.Â  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sports Kinesiologist&#8217;s Advice: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wake up professional athletes as well as the agents and teams who care for them. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Paul Allen, this is your team and your investment is at risk! If you continue to do the same thing and get the same results&#8230;. I believe it is consideredÂ  the definition of insanity?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Athletes: Know your body, know yourself, and ask questions (even if if means getting an opinion outside of your team&#8217;s medical staff.Â  This is your career!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/mom_80s.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-6508 alignright" title="mom_80s" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/mom_80s.jpg?w=256&h=300" alt="" width="256" height="300" /></a>With Mothersâ Day approaching Iâm feeling a little sentimental. Iâve been thinking about some of the gifts my mom has given me. Not the baby dolls or bicycles, the Fair Isle sweaters or even the bright red stew pot I still use today. I could dwell on the fact that she didnât passed on her very long legs but I wonât.</p>
<p>Looking back, one of the best gifts my mother gave me was her enthusiasm for spirited conversation.</p>
<p>Dinner at our house served two critical purposes. It kept the family from starving and, more important, it brought us together every night. My mother was never particularly interested in cooking. I donât remember her spending long hours in the kitchen. She gravitated toward quick and easy recipes and didnât hesitate to throw a can of soup on a piece of chicken or into a pot of stew.</p>
<p>In spite of her indifference towards most things culinary, Mom was very keen about family dinner. For some of our neighbors, family dinner was a rare occasion, reserved for holidays or special occasions. Others raced through the evening meal and fled the table. Not so at my house, most evenings we hung out for a good hour, sometimes longer. The television was never on. Phone calls were only answered to take a message to call back later.</p>
<p>Every night we shared our news, victories, trials and tribulations. We discussed everything and anything. We talked about our day at school, our favorite books, celebrities and stars as well as the Boston Bruins and Red Sox. As we got older, political and social issues became key topics during our nightly conversations.</p>
<p>It was an exciting, turbulent time, a time of great change; kind of like now. We vigorously discussed the virtues and vices of the President and a whole host of politicians, public figures, crusaders and crooks. We deliberated over the war, civil rights, womenâs right and the environment. We shouted, we laughed, we jockeyed for position. We talked all at once, we interrupted each other in our excitement and enthusiasm. Somehow or other we managed to listen to each other (if only barely) and respect each other (if sometimes grudgingly).</p>
<p>Once in a <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bluemoon1.html" target="_blank">blue moon</a>, a subject was deemed off limits, inappropriate for my little brotherâs young ears. Those times were few and far between. For the most part it was no holds barred. My sister and I were free to discuss, rant and rave with the passion and intensity of idealistic teenagers. Mom insisted that we never argued. In her words, we discussed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Looking back, those dinners were tremendous confidence builders. I donât ever remember my mother telling me I was wrong. From time to time she cautioned me that a particular opinion could be unpopular. She sometimes warned that a certain stand could put me on the outs with friends or neighbors. Even when she disagreed, she never discouraged my youthful dance with new ideas. Within our protective family circle, I was able to test new insights and changing opinions. I learned to listen and scrutinize an idea before accepting or rejecting it. Those dinners helped me develop the self-confidence to speak up, share my ideas and stories and listen to others. I am forever grateful.</p>
<p><a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/susie_john_brenda.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6509" title="Susie_John_Brenda" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/susie_john_brenda.jpg?w=300&h=168" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>How did I thank her? When we were little, my sister, brother and I took turns serving Mom an English muffin in bed on Mothersâ Day. Later I sent cards and flowers (when I remembered.) Now itâs a plant and I invite the family over for brunch or lunch. All in all, I definitely got the better half of the bargain.</p>
<p>Thank you Mom and Happy Mothersâ Day! Bon appÃ©tit!</p>
<p><a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/onion_tart_02.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6512" title="onion_tart_02" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/onion_tart_02.jpg?w=300&h=240" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a>.<br />

<strong>Tarte Ã  lâOignon (Onion Tart) </strong><br />
<em>This earthy French tart is perfect for brunch, lunch or a casual supper. Give it a try on Mothersâ Day and enjoy!</em><br />
Serves 6-8<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
4 slices thick cut bacon (about 1/4 pound), chopped<br />
About 1 tablespoon butter<br />
2 pounds onions, cut in half lengthwise and sliced in thin wedges<br />
1-2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
2 teaspoons fresh thyme<br />
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
Savory Flakey Pastry (recipe follows)<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 cup sour cream<br />
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br />
Pinch nutmeg<a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cooking_lardons.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6513" title="cooking_lardons" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cooking_lardons.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet, drain on paper towels and reserve.</p>
<p>Add more or less butter to the bacon drippings to coat the skillet and melt. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and toss the onions with the bacon and thyme. Cool to room temperature.<a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cooking_onions_02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6514" title="cooking_onions_02" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cooking_onions_02.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>While the onion is cooking and cooling, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Line a 9 or 10-inch tart pan with the pastry leaving about 1/4-inch for shrinkage; crimp the edges. Cover the pastry and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and arrange the rack in the middle of the oven.</p>
<p><a href="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/onion_tart_05.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6515" title="onion_tart_05" src="http://susannye.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/onion_tart_05.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Put the eggs, sour cream, mustard and nutmeg in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Add the onions and bacon and toss to combine. Pour the onion mixture into the tart shell.</p>
<p>Put the tart in the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 30 minutes or until the custard is set and the top is golden brown. Cool for 5-10 minutes and serve.</p>
<p><strong> Savory Flakey Pastry </strong><br />
1 cup all-purpose flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) chilled butter, cut into small pieces<br />
3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening, cold, cut into small pieces<br />
2-4 tablespoons ice water</p>
<p>Blend the flour and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and shortening and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal.</p>
<p>Sprinkle with ice water, 1-2 tablespoons at a time and process until the dough comes together in a ball. Remove the dough from the food processor and flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?ref=opinion">This recent think-piece </a>in <em>The New York Times</em> argues that we have:</p>
<blockquote><p>At home, families sit together, texting and reading e-mail. At work executives text during board meetings. We text (and shop and go on Facebook) during classes and when weâre on dates&#8230;</p>
<p>Weâve become accustomed to a new way of being âalone together.â Technology-enabled, we are able to be with one another, and also elsewhere, connected to wherever we want to be. We want to customize our lives. We want to move in and out of where we are because the thing we value most is control over where we focus our attention. We have gotten used to the idea of being in a tribe of one, loyal to our own party.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the rituals my husband and I enjoy is my driving him to the commuter train station in the morning. It&#8217;s only about 10 minutes door to door, but it&#8217;s a nice chance to connect and chat before his 40-minute commute and a crazy life working at the <em>Times</em>, one with six meetings every day.</p>
<p>We talk a lot, usually two or three times, briefly, by phone and maybe an hour or two in the evening. That&#8217;s a great deal more than many couples, certainly those with multiple children juggling conflicting schedules.</p>
<p>But sitting across the table from someone, sharing a glass of wine or cup of coffee, seems to have become an unimaginable luxury. <em>How else can we ever get to know one another?</em> I&#8217;ve had two female friends tell me, only after many years of knowing them, that they had each been sexually abused as a child.</p>
<p>That took a lot of trust and courage. I don&#8217;t think most of us would want to share such intimacies only through a computer or phone screen.</p>
<p>I love road trips, six or eight or ten hours in a vehicle with my husband, or friends, or my Dad. You get a lot said, and the silences are companionable.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to San Francisco, (on Virgin Air, maybe the reason for such indie fellow travelers), my outbound flight had a career musician beside me, Homer Flynn, who has spent a long life making very cool music in a band called The Residents. Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Residents">Wikipedia entry</a> is huge! We had a great conversation, for more than an hour, about the nature of creativity, about managing a long and productive worklife, about inspiration.</p>
<p>On the flight home &#8212; 5.5 hours &#8212; I had a similar conversation with my seatmate, a visual artist a little older than I.</p>
<p>Ironically, she&#8217;d just opened and started to read a book about introverts and I figured she&#8217;d never want to chat. But we discovered we had so much in common we talked the whole way! She had even attended the same East Coast prep school as my mother.</p>
<p>Another flight, from Winnipeg to Vancouver, placed me beside a coach for the Toronto Argonauts, a professional football team. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlondo_Steinauer">Orlando Steinauer</a> and I had a great time comparing notes on the world of professional sport and professional writing. We found it hard to decide which is more bruising!</p>
<p><strong>As you can see, conversation is my oxygen.</strong> I love meeting fun new people and hearing their stories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why, after 36 years as a journalist, I still enjoy my work &#8212; and the comments I get here. I&#8217;m endlessly curious about people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you make time in your life now for face to face conversations?</em></strong></p>

<p>The historic walled city at the southernmost tip of Croatia is as exceptional from the ground as it is from the sky. Massive stone walls run high and low, encircling the Old Town of Dubrovnik and framing an uninterrupted course on the edge of the Adriatic Sea. Dotted with turrets and towers, the two kilometre-long climb reaches its peak at 25m, overlooking terracotta rooftops as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p><a href="http://stephaniecalvet.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/croatia_dubrovnik-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4163" title="Dubrovnik_The Great Wall-3" src="http://stephaniecalvet.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/croatia_dubrovnik-4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>Though built during the Middle Ages, the Great Wall has been reinforced throughout its history, and remains remarkably intact. Some of its fortresses and defensive towers serve as jumping off points for bathers and are even used as bars. Having a nighttime drink on the cascading rock edge is a delightful sensory experience. Itâs pitch black â just moonlight, candlelight, and the constant rhythm of the waves.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s one city I should go back to asap, it&#8217;s Lisbon. Man, I lied in my first sentence already, sorry peepz. Of course there are many other cities I should go back to asap. But if I had to choose one at this moment, it would be Lisbon. Damn, lied again. Okay, there are a few other cities that would beat the crap out of Lisbon, touristwise, but Portugal&#8217;s capital is lovely. And that&#8217;s the truth, I swear, your honor!</p>
<p><a href="http://theegotripper.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/lisbon2.jpg"><img src="http://theegotripper.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/lisbon2.jpg?w=710&h=947" alt="" title="Lisbon2" width="710" height="947" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765" /></a></p>
<p>All this lying is confusing me. Truth is: I like Lisbon. It&#8217;s a beautiful city with a great atmosphere, delicious food (AND REALLY REALLY GOOD COFFEE!), friendly people, loads of places to party, cool trams, hills, monasteries, towers, fado houses, beautiful parks, cathedrals, history&#8230; You name it. A lot of people I&#8217;ve talked to compared Lisbon to Barcelona. Maybe it&#8217;s because both cities are hip and trendy. Or it might be the location near the sea as well. Or it might be the inspiration you can find in both cities. </p>
<p><a href="http://theegotripper.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/lisbon9.jpg"><img src="http://theegotripper.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/lisbon9.jpg?w=710&h=471" alt="" title="Lisbon9" width="710" height="471" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-766" /></a></p>
<p>Lisbon is definitely worth your attention and if you can get a cheap flight (check out Brussels Airlines <a href="http://www.brusselsairlines.com/nl_be/book/flights/flyday.aspx" title="TGI Flydays" target="_blank">TGI Flydays</a>) and a conveniently located hotel, you&#8217;ll have an amazing time in Portugal&#8217;s capital. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Lynne Strang, Late Blooming Entrepreneurs</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1795" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://latebloomingentrepreneurs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photoelizabethardith-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1795" title="PhotoElizabethArdith (2)" src="http://latebloomingentrepreneurs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photoelizabethardith-2.jpg?w=300&h=219" alt="Elizabeth Erlandson and Ardith Stuertz" width="300" height="219" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Erlandson and Ardith Stuertz</p></div>
<p>Some of the entertainment industryâs biggest hits have been about enduring friendships.Â  Like Laverne and Shirley.Â  Thelma and Louise.Â  Kate and Allie.Â  And of course, Lucy and Ethel.</p>
<p>Now, meet Elizabeth and Ardith.Â  They havenât received any television or movie offers (yet), but theyâre enjoying life as best friends and business partners.</p>
<p>Known locally as âThe Licorice Ladies,â Elizabeth ErlandsonÂ and ArdithÂ Stuertz own <a href="http://www.licoriceinternational.com/licorice/pc/home.asp">Licorice International</a>, a Lincoln, Nebraska-based business that ships 10,000 candy orders annually and has an almost equal number of in-store sales. With 160 types from 14 countries, ErlandsonÂ and Stuertz have the largest selection of imported licorice in the U.S.</p>
<p>Licorice Internationalâs clientele tends to be older and includes some candy lovers with childhood memories of buying real <a href="http://www.licoriceinternational.com/licorice/pc/About-Licorice-d25.htm">licorice</a> from the corner drugstore (most âlicoriceâ candy sold in the U.S. these days actually gets its flavor from anise).</p>
<p>âNostalgia is the real product we offer our customers,â says Erlandson. âTheyâre 70 when they walk in the door and theyâreÂ 10 when they walk out.â</p>
<p><strong>Fundamentals for Success</strong></p>
<p>The co-owners attribute their business achievements to their strong work ethic and a desire to learn, as well as prudent fiscal management and a good staff (they have five full-time and four part-time employees).Â  In addition, both had good mentors earlier in their careers and came from entrepreneurial families.</p>
<p>At the heart of their success, however, is the fact that these friends â who have known each other for 22 years &#8212; work well together and have complimentary strengths.Â  ErlandsonÂ has marketing and communications expertise cultivated from 25 years as a professional writer.Â  StuertzÂ worked forÂ 23 yearsÂ with a heavy construction equipment auction company, where she was responsible for the accounting and human resources departments.</p>
<p>âWe admire and respect each other and know each otherâs core values,â says Erlandson. âIf one of us doesnât want to do something, we donât do it.â</p>
<p>âMoney is not at the bottom of it.Â  Our friendship is core,â adds Stuertz.</p>
<p><strong>Making It Happen</strong></p>
<p>For several years, ErlandsonÂ and Stuertz had a tradition of meeting on New Yearâs Eve to map a strategic plan for the coming year. Â That exercise led to their first joint venture:Â  a consulting practice that provided fundraising, administrative and other support for non-profits.</p>
<p>While the practice lasted only 12 months, it served an important purpose. âWithout that experience of working together for a year, we would not have succeeded later,â says Erlandson.</p>
<p>At ages 52 and 57 respectively, ErlandsonÂ and Stuertz became Licorice Internationalâs owners when they bought the mail order business from New York confectioner Larry Ring in 2002.Â  They moved the companyâs headquarters from Manhattan to their hometown of Lincoln, where they developed a website and began filling orders from their homes.</p>
<p>It didnât take long for their business to flourish.Â  By mid-2003, orders reached a level where the owners needed more space.Â  Within three and a half years, Licorice International moved three times, adding a retail operation along the way.Â  Its current location is a 4,450 square-foot facility with a store upfront.</p>
<p>Since its launch ten years ago, the company has had its ups and downs. Â While the recession affected its Internet business considerably, the retail shop has grown consistently.Â  It now provides approximately 40% of total sales, which have increased five fold since the business moved to its first commercial location in 2003.</p>
<p>âWe were able to start very economically by running the business out of our homes,â says Stuertz.Â  âSince we werenât sure how it was going to turn out, we did not go into debt and used personal resources.Â  It was a very wise thing.â</p>
<p><strong>A Can-Do Attitude</strong></p>
<p>Going forward, ErlandsonÂ and StuertzÂ want to extend to younger markets, so theyâve begun adding product variations that appeal to families with children.Â  They also plan to grow their current selection of gluten-free and sugar-free treats to accommodate more people with special dietary needs.</p>
<p>Now in their 60s, The Licorice Ladies say they have no current plans to retire and are âin it for the long term.âÂ  Given their can-do attitude, thereâs no reason to doubt them.</p>
<p>âWe are both big thinkers,â says Erlandson.Â  âBetween the two of us, we can implement just about anything.â</p>
