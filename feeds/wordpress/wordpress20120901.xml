				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/obamachair.jpg" alt="Empty Obama Chair, Clint Eastwood&#039;s arch-enemy" title="Contains nothing, mesmerizes all" width="264" height="286" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1233" />Behold the face of America&#8217;s newest sensation.  LOLcats, Kardashians, and the horrors of something calling itself &#8220;Honey Boo Boo&#8221; all took a back seat to the poor, defenseless chair that withstood a tongue-lashing from Academy Award Winner Clint Eastwood at the closing of the Republican National Convention, which in turn drew an awful lot of press to cover any number of foregone conclusions.</p>
<p>I refuse to watch the video on principle &#8212; the principle being, partisan politics don&#8217;t interest me.  This keeps me shut out of a lot of online discussions and ensures no one will ever pay me a steady income to become a TV pundit.  I&#8217;m fine with that, but it usually means I have to go slink off into a dark corner and find ways to entertain myself until politics go away.</p>
<p>My admittedly secondhand understanding of the situation, then, is that the 82-year-old director was invited to close the ceremony with no small amount of star power, somehow mistook the chair for President Barack Obama, and attempted to bully it until it cried.  I&#8217;ve yet to confirm if anyone involved in the incident referred this peculiar condition to Dr. Oliver Sacks.</p>
<p>Maybe this merciless haranguing was the most hilarious improv set of the year.  Maybe it was an unmitigated disaster, like the time Anne Hathaway and James Franco hosted the Oscars.  Maybe I&#8217;ve misread and Obama was actually standing off-camera on the other side of the chair, or had been shrunk with Pym particles and was resting comfortably under the chair.  All I know for sure is that this spirited but one-sided argument took over my Twitter feed Thursday night and effectively shut down all other topics and memes.  On Facebook, the empty chair emerged from its humble beginnings in Nowheresville and became the talk of the town, superseding the usual daily barrage of Photoshop yuks and Zynga proclamations.  This week, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/30/us-space-launch-probes-idUSBRE87T0CZ20120830" title="Nation Surprised NASA Can Still Afford to Do Stuff" target="_blank">NASA launched a rocket</a> bearing twin probes to study the Van Allen radiation belts (the real story here being: believe it or not, NASA is still in the launching business), but that link has now been kicked off all front pages in favor of headlines about verbally abused furniture.</p>
<p>Some people have joked about its unintentional symbolism.  Others applaud the moment as Eastwood&#8217;s best comedy gig since the flicks he made with that annoying orangutan.  Someone naturally registered &#8220;Invisible Obama&#8221; as a Twitter alias.  Rest assured our nation&#8217;s crack Photoshop gag specialists rushed to fill the chair with repurposed images of Kermit the Frog, the Sad Keanu meme, and Lord knows what other variations I&#8217;ve missed.  The Internet plans to milk this new, inanimate media personality for all it can, until the Chair gets greedy and begins demanding large paychecks to make forgettable cameos in terrible films.</p>
<p>Nothing I could write about anything right now could hold an audience&#8217;s attention a fraction as much as that now-legendary empty chair&#8217;s misadventure has.  I&#8217;ll just shut up and let the video roll below for the truly, insatiably curious who missed this unique spectacle.  I did watch a few seconds of it just to confirm that, of all the versions uploaded, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>&#8216;s version had the best screen resolution, but that&#8217;s as far as I went.</p>
<p>I salute you, empty chair.  Enjoy your fifteen minutes, and try to be kind to us little people during your wild ride on the shaky wooden coaster of fly-by-night stardom.  Remember, today&#8217;s celebrity is tomorrow&#8217;s Goodwill bargain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://drapersden.com/2012/08/08/airtimes-folly-the-awkward-technology-of-people-discovery/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/fYMRpiRSSaw/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>In Hollywood lexicon a <em>meet cute</em> is the serendipitous crash between strangers. Usually a man and a woman, the chance encounter ignites the plot and the ensuing laughter and romance. Jack stumbled upon a wilting Rose moments before she leapt off the (then intact) <em>Titanic</em>. Harry initially met Sally in need of a ride to New York City. And Sean Parker spawned his longtime business partnership with Shawn Fanning discussing computer security in a chat room.</p>
<p>The universe has an affinity for coincidence. So why not cull this cosmic co-mingling through technology? By matching strangers based on similarities and interests, companies like Mr. Parker’s <a href="https://www.airtime.com/about">Airtime</a> hope to harness serendipity.</p>
<p>Equal parts Skype and Zuckerberg, with a hint of eHarmony, Airtime hopes to expand and explode the social graph. Where social networks remain remarkably confined to coworkers, classmates and college buddies, people discovery offers a way of interrupting routine by using the gravity of shared interest rather than geographic contingency.</p>
<p>Airtime introduces us to “Talk to Someone.” This novel feature pairs up fresh faces using criteria like interests, location, and acquaintances. To protect against the wrong kind of people (think <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605530.html">Chatroulette</a>) and to ensure a healthy amount of privacy (you probably shouldn’t be using this), users remain anonymous to each other until an “+Add” request is sent and an acceptance made.</p>
<p>But isn’t “expanding the social graph” just a clumsy way of saying meeting new people? Aren’t people discovery apps, the ones that tell you if like-minded users are nearby, just a creepy kind of ice-breaker? (Text message: “Hey! My <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ambient_social_location_apps_will_be_consumer_duds.php">ambient GPS</a> mobile technology is telling me that you are also at this conference, let’s bust open our social graphs together…what’s your name?”)</p>
<p>To paraphrase the Easter egg at the beginning of <em>Fight Club</em>: couldn’t all this be replaced by walking up to a person and starting a conversation?</p>
<p>For the timid and the less extroverted, perhaps this kind of unplugged boldness is frighteningly difficult. But to sell an Apple-esque chatting service as a ticket to whimsical friendship seems misguided. The random delight of misadventure, the kind of accidental spark that we crave in monotonous modernity is precisely the kind of thing people discovery is not. In the process of gaining the digital grip, we simultaneously lose our human touch.</p>
<p>Still, Airtime, Highlight, Foursquare, and the Facebook-acquired Glancee, shouldn’t be seen as digital shields against rejection. That would be too harsh. The concept of social discovery—the exposure to things that fascinate—works quite well. When the discovery aspect turns on cultural and commercial products, as in Pandora, Netflix, StumbleUpon, and Twitter, users are willing to take risks, step outside ready-made preferences and cultivate an authentic taste.</p>
<p>But when the thing that is discovered is not a thing at all, but a human relationship, something like happenstance isn’t fostered. Rather, it is a contrived politeness like the paralyzing inauthenticity of a bad first date.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43359572">Marketed</a> as if a bubbly <a href="https://twitter.com/alexia/">Alexia Tsostis</a> or a BFF Justin Timberlake is just waiting for you to sign on, reality reminds us to expect a sea of woozy, disembodied, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/">unflattering faces</a>. As the editors of the literary magazine, <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/chathexis#fn7553889544ffc6293e2ef4">N+1</a> point out, it is impossible to maintain eye contact using video chat.</p>
<p>In the provocative and much talked about documentary, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuE98oeL-e0"><em>Catfish</em></a>, the nether realm of the internet persona is explored. The Facebook <em>meet cute</em> swiftly spirals downward, resembling a strange, perverse nightmare. More than one character realizes that to look into a person’s pixelated flesh is far from gazing into their eyes.</p>
<p>While people discovery may satisfy some urge to connect, the kind of serendipity they promise will rarely be found behind a screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our last trip, <em>finally</em>, we managed to catch some fledglings. We had been seeing them around for weeks, but as they didn&#8217;t seem to respond to playback, and they never flew the right direction when we tried to chase them into the net, we&#8217;d caught none.</p>
<p>On this last trip something had changed. No longer were all of the fledglings attended by their parents; instead, they formed foraging flocks of parents, attended fledglings, and apparently-independent fledglings. Attended fledglings are hard to catch because their parents lead them away from danger. Independent fledglings, it turns out, aren&#8217;t so careful. We set up the net where we observed the flock foraging, and within ten minutes the juncos drifted back into the area and resumed foraging.</p>
<p>BOAR was the first fledgling we caught.</p>
<div id="attachment_707" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/boar2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-707" title="BOAR2" src="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/boar2.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="611" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BOAR</p></div>
<p><span id="more-706"></span>He was molting his head feathers, transitioning from streaky juvenile to adult-looking bird.</p>
<div id="attachment_708" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/boar1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-708" title="BOAR" src="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/boar1.jpg?w=584&h=382" alt="" width="584" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The rough patch on his head is an area of new feathers growing in</p></div>
<p>Notice the streakiness in his head and the darkness of his bill: those are both ways that we can tell he is a juvenile.</p>
<p>Not long after we released BOAR, a fledgling flew up and landed <em>on top of our net</em>. Cheeky bird! It just about drove me crazy to see him sitting there, so close to being captured and yet uncapturable. Fortunately for my blood pressure, as soon as he took flight he flew into the net and we got him.</p>
<p>We banded him OORA because that seemed braggy and overconfident—a good name for a bird that would land on a net, then get caught in it.</p>
<div id="attachment_710" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oora1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-710" title="OORA" src="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oora1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="648" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">OORA</p></div>
<p><a href="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oora21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-711" title="OORA2" src="http://toughlittlebirds.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oora21.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="419" /></a>He hadn&#8217;t yet started to molt, so he looks like the standard junco juvenile: tan, streaky, no sharply contrasting colors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, he had feather mites. He was the first bird we&#8217;ve caught this summer to have visible feather mites. Feather mites eat feathers; birds defend against them by bathing in water and dust and by preening. Maybe OORA hasn&#8217;t learned proper hygiene yet.</p>

<p>Look at those tail feathers! Juvenile juncos grow their &#8220;adult&#8221; tail feathers right away, and don&#8217;t molt them until the next fall. Those are the tail feathers OORA will use to woo females and compete with males next spring, if he is male.</p>
<p>The last fledgling we caught this trip flew into the net while we were using playback to try to catch an adult male.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit.jpg"> </a></p>
<p>I went out a couple of weeks ago with the plan to take a picture I have envisaged for quite some time. In my city there is a place called Plac Wolności (freedom Square). Plac Wolności used to be an area like a market square, on the square is a Church and the Old Town Hall.</p>
<p>The modern day Plac Wolności is more of a Roundabout junction with a plinth and statute on the top. It is used as a meeting place for young people or tour groups.</p>
<p>I had always had two ideas for the picture but I also need a few conditions to be met as well before shooting.</p>
<p>First I didn&#8217;t want the image to be too busy with lots of people near the centre of the square as that is where I would be taking the picture. Secondly the picture would need to be taken when the sun is not in the higher points of its arc. The picture is to be a 360degree Panorama and if the sun is too high I would be shooting into it and blowing out the sky, but I did need a sunny day.</p>
<p>The shot i ended up taking was a 77 image panorama. I used the four sides of the plinth plus its corners as my view points. I divided each view point into 9 areas with each area overlapping by about a third. Before I took any pictures I used the manual focus to get a general focus of the buildings around the square and then did the same for the exposure.</p>
<p>The exposure was F4/60.</p>
<p><a href="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" title="Untitled_Panorama1-low-edit" src="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit.jpg?w=1024&h=178" alt="" width="1024" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first stage of my edit. It has taken a white to get to this point. Mainly because I had to work around the huge file size of 3.5gb. The image is 10inches by 70inches.</p>
<p>When the panorama stitch was complete, I first had to straighten the image. I used the puppet warp tool to do this. Once the image was straightened I decided to edit the picture in zones.</p>
<p>The first zone I am looked at was the sky. In the original stitch the clouds were just white and blown out. I went back to the original picture used and adapted them in Camera Raw and brought them into Photoshop and blended them in.</p>
<p>Once the sky was blended I turned all the layers into a smart object. I did this to lower the file size but also to make sure any edit I made was not destructive to the image. This smart object is like my negative now.</p>
<p>Next I created folders in my layers pallet and named them for the different parts of the image for example; &#8220;foreground&#8221;, &#8220;Building centre&#8221;, &#8220;sky&#8221; ect. I made separate level adjustments for the different areas. The image at the moment is at the point where I can objectively look at it as see what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Here are enlarges sections of the whole image.</p>
<p><a href="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-536" title="Untitled_Panorama1-low-edit-part1" src="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part1.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see from this first part the computer is not always the most intelligent person in the room. Part of the stone tiling in the fore ground has not matched up the same with the third lamppost from the left. Also when I used the puppet warp tool I bent some buildings slightly out of their natural shape.</p>
<p>This I will fix in the next stage.</p>
<p><a href="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-537" title="Untitled_Panorama1-low-edit-part2" src="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part2.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>One of the main problems with this part of the image is the Museum in the middle. The sun was just rising behind it so there was a bit of flaring on the front of the museum. This is why it is not a great idea not to shoot into the sun. This will need to be worked on.</p>
<p>Generally this part of the image is pretty good.</p>
<p><a href="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-538" title="Untitled_Panorama1-low-edit-part3" src="http://aperture64.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/untitled_panorama1-low-edit-part3.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="309" /></a></p>
<p>Thankfully this part of the image is good. There are some masking issues which I normally clean up next. The reason I work rough first and then clean second is that I am just trying to get a look of what the image is like and then perfecting it. If you spend a lot of time carefully masking just for it to be thrown away it is pointless. It is better I believe to see how it works and then perfect.</p>
<p>I do like the image but I will need to play with the colours and levels some more.</p>
<p>The next step is to go into the smart object and merge the layers and then duplicate it into a new window. I will do this so I can close my large file and work on a smaller one to correct stitching mistakes and clean the image. I will then add it to the smart object later.</p>
<p>After this I will correct the colours, tone and saturation of the image. For example the sky is not perfect and there are tones of grey that I would prefer them to be more white. I expect it will take me a couple more sessions to finish it.</p>
<p>It is great the image turned out well but I am not sure how I will print it and if I did where I would hang it.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>If you want to know how to take digital panoramas, I wrote a post called <a title="The world through a letter box frame." href="http://aperture64.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/the-world-through-a-letter-box-frame/">&#8220;The World Through a Letterbox Frame&#8221;</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">31 August</span> &#8212; Just back from a six-day escape to Vancouver and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, visiting much-loved family and friends in an area that always uplifts me.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;much-loved&#8221; for many reasons, but after all these decades recognize that one of them is the resonance added by sheer passage of time. Part of the worth is in the while &#8212; a concept I borrow from John Fowles, who first deconstructed &#8220;worthwhile&#8221; this way in his 1964 book of personal philosophy, <em>The Aristos</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-062.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1195" title="ripening blackberries" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-062.jpg?w=150&h=115" alt="" width="150" height="115" /></a>Count back on your fingers and, yes, I posted &#8220;King, Queen and Moose&#8221; not from Toronto, but from the home of my friends Sally and Owen in North Vancouver. I sat there at Sal&#8217;s laptop, looking out over their back yard to the fence dividing it from the trees and shrubs of Mount Seymour Provincial Park immediately beyond.</p>
<p>The shrubs include blackberry bushes, up against the fence. Which means ripening blackberries are more than a sign of changing seasons, they signal potential danger. Black bears love blackberries, and literally turn gate-crasher on occasion, once they&#8217;re that close to residential properties with other potential sources of food.</p>
<p>(Sally once emailed me the photo of a black bear foraging in their yard. All I could send in return was a raccoon sleeping in my birdbath.)</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-018.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1196" title="Old Buck Trail, Mt Seymour" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-018.jpg?w=224&h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>Of course the visit included some hiking about! You can&#8217;t be in British Columbia, halfway up a mountain, and not go walking. First target, Old Buck Trail, which sets off halfway up Mount Seymour Road. Various other trails split off, such as this Empress Bypass option, but I stuck with the main trail.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t brought my pedometer, and settled for a 90-minute outing instead right on Old Buck itself. First I went up (and in these mountain ranges, up is <em>up</em>), awe-struck by the huge stumps of long-ago trees. Yes, I&#8217;ve seen them before, but they never fail to move me.</p>
<p>Somewhere beyond here, short of the Baden Powell junction but not by much, I turned about.</p>
<p>At least as high as I went, the trail was much like this &#8212; a smooth, clear dirt path. <a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-017.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1198" title="path, Old Buck Trail, Mt Seymour BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-017.jpg?w=202&h=300" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Just as the ancient stumps move me, so do the great columns of contemporary tall trees. The path moves gently among them, and I think a bit about paths, and making one&#8217;s path (thank you, Antonio Machado), physically and otherwise.</p>
<p>I remember, too, that tai chi is sometimes described as &#8220;walking meditation.&#8221; I don&#8217;t specifically meditate when I walk, but I do usually feel myself expanding out into my surroundings, somehow.</p>
<p>Then, sometimes, the elegant columns of trees give way to great bursts of nature&#8217;s very own mixed media: rock and moss and other layered vegetation and spikey remnants of old logs and forest, forest, forest.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1200" title="Mt Seymour Park, BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-015.jpg?w=1024&h=1002" alt="" width="1024" height="1002" /></a></p>
<p>But no, I don&#8217;t spend the whole six days in the woods.</p>
<p>Soon I&#8217;m deserting this far corner of North Van for a visit to Vancouver proper &#8212; across Burrard Inlet by Seabus, then south on the Canada Line (built for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics), and out onto Cambie St. at Broadway. Where I grabbed this shot northward up Cambie, sightlines back to North Vancouver and the framing mountains beyond.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-022.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1201" title="Cambie &amp; Broadway, looking north to North Van" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-022.jpg?w=1024&h=570" alt="" width="1024" height="570" /></a></p>
<p>Mountains and ocean, Vancouver is the Rio of the north.</p>
<p>But even here, walking with my friends Louise and Rolf through residential streets over to Main Street and then south&#8230; even in this dense bit of cityscape, there&#8217;s still great exuberant nature. (When I lived in Calgary, a semi-desert climate, and came visiting, the sheer humid profligacy of Vancouver&#8217;s nature always smacked me in the eye and up the nose.)</p>
<p>My friends waited cheerfully while I eyed the detail of growth on city trees. Like this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-028.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1202" title="city tree, downtown Vancouver" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-028.jpg?w=1024&h=766" alt="" width="1024" height="766" /></a></p>
<p>We had lunch one place, lattes somewhere else, prowled shops with strong design sense&#8230; and finally good-bye and back north I went, retracing my way via the Canada Line to the Seabus again. Where I was charmed by these little girls, their noses pressed against the ferry&#8217;s front window, party balloons to one side.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-032.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1203" title="aboard Seabus, Vancouver" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-032.jpg?w=1024&h=681" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a></p>
<p>Another walk, still in North Van and on Mount Seymour, but setting out from the little community of Deep Cove.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-038.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1204" title="Sally on Baden Powell Trail" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-038.jpg?w=209&h=300" alt="" width="209" height="300" /></a> That&#8217;s Sally&#8217;s back, in an early stretch of our chosen hike, up the Baden Powell Trail to the Deep Cove Lookout. The lookout is aka Quarry Rock &#8212; indeed a succession of big old rocks, but no sign anywhere of past let alone present quarrying. So, go figure.</p>
<p>Sal characterized this as an up-and-down trail, probably an hour each way. The footing was at times smooth and the path gently curving, but in other places the path twisted narrowly among trees and boulders, intensely scored with tree roots and rocks.</p>
<p>It was also much less solitary than my Old Buck outing! Then again, a weekend morning vs weekday. More people than we really wanted &#8212; oh, the cherished illusion of being alone in nature &#8212; but at least everybody observed pretty good trail etiquette.</p>
<p>Even the dogs behaved themselves. Including a snowy white little pooch who clearly had been having a wonderful time in mucky streams. Her owner observed her four black legs, and quipped, &#8220;Her name is Emma, but we may have to call her Boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally there we were on Quarry Rock, looking over the Indian Arm inlet of the ocean, with the village of Deep Cove itself hidden away to the right.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-047.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1205" title="view from Quarry Rock" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-047.jpg?w=1024&h=585" alt="" width="1024" height="585" /></a></p>
<p>Going back down, I lost track for a moment. So many ups and downs enroute&#8230; where we really descending? Yes, we were. Sometimes on the twisty paths I described above, sometimes on stairways pressed against rock faces, like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-050.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1206" title="staircase on Baden Powell Trail, Deep Cover BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-050.jpg?w=1024&h=628" alt="" width="1024" height="628" /></a></p>
<p>Yah, finally, indeed down and walking along the Deep Cove beach, with all the boats bobbing in the water and great red and yellow blocks of kayaks set out, waiting their turn for some action.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-053.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1207" title="Deep Cove BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-053.jpg?w=1024&h=603" alt="" width="1024" height="603" /></a></p>
<p>We consider hanging around for Deep Cove Daze [<em>sic</em>], but resist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be all the usual late-summer, small-community mix of booths and games and noise and T-shirts and organizations with their <a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-055.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1208" title="flower bed, Deep Cove" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-055.jpg?w=150&h=145" alt="" width="150" height="145" /></a> tables&#8230; and it is tempting&#8230; but we have other plans.</p>
<p>Which involve lunch on a patio elsewhere, so it&#8217;s easy to leave. But not before paying tribute to this metric flower bed!</p>
<p>One last walk, days later and down in the Lower Mainland where I&#8217;ve joined family for the final few days of my trip. Karen and I head out to Watershed Park in Surrey, one that she and husband Tim know well, both on foot and on their bikes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m luxuriating all over again in the sights and smells and texture underfoot of these west-coast trails. Some of the scenes are the sort of thing I anticipate&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-061.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1209" title="pond in Watershed Park, Surrey BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-061.jpg?w=1024&h=675" alt="" width="1024" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>But some are not!</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-058.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1210" title="Watershed Park &quot;picasso&quot; graffito" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vancouver-058.jpg?w=765&h=1024" alt="" width="765" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>At first I tut-tutted, a graffito in such a setting. Then I realized I rather liked the face &#8212; just a bit Picasso-esque, don&#8217;t you think? And also realized it is if anything an improvement on the concrete ruin it adorns.</p>
<p>This last photo takes us back to West Coast Classic, and is a bit of a cheat. Well, only in time, not in place.</p>
<p><a href="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/surrey-nurse-log.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1211" title="nurse log in Watershed Park, Surrey BC" src="http://icelandpenny.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/surrey-nurse-log.jpg?w=1024&h=766" alt="" width="1024" height="766" /></a></p>
<p>I took this photo of a &#8220;nurse log&#8221; right here in Watershed Park, but some years ago. Karen had explained the phenomenon to me, that of an old rotting log nurturing new life, and I remember being so happy to find such a good example of it.</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;m home. Posting this from Toronto, and planning my next walk right here&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of my piece for the Guardian – <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/28/why-paralympics-wont-challenge-perceptions-disabled">‘Why the Paralympics won’t challenge perceptions of disability’</a> – I spoke about Sainsbury’s choice to use non-disabled David Beckham to front their Paralympics adverts. Justin King, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s wrote into The Guardian to respond:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/joy-drama-paralympics-opening-ceremony">Frances Ryan doubts that the Paralympics will alter society&#8217;s view of disability (Society, 29 August)). I disagree. Over 2.4 million schoolchildren have tried out Paralympic sports, such as sitting volleyball, as part of Sainsbury&#8217;s Million Kids Challenge. According to a YouGov poll we commissioned, over 75% of children want to play more Paralympic sports and 64% of parents believe it&#8217;s important for their children to watch the Paralympics and to learn more about the sports involved.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/joy-drama-paralympics-opening-ceremony">Watching the Games over the coming days will undoubtedly increase interest in these sports as people are inspired by the hard work, professionalism and skill of the athletes. Indeed, our polling shows that two-thirds of adults say they feel inspired by athletes with disabilities who train so hard to succeed at an international level.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/joy-drama-paralympics-opening-ceremony">Ms Ryan criticises Sainsbury&#8217;s choice of David Beckham as a Paralympic ambassador on the grounds that he is able-bodied. She misses the point. All our ambassadors – including Paralympic athletes Jonnie Peacock, Ellie Simmonds and Dave Clarke – demonstrate that skill, hard work and commitment unite <em>all</em> athletes. It is a powerful combination that is changing perceptions.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/joy-drama-paralympics-opening-ceremony"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Justin King </span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/joy-drama-paralympics-opening-ceremony"><em>Chief executive, Sainsbury&#8217;s </em></a></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m no expert in PR or the general rules of capitalism, but I’d say Mr. King was doing a good (and expected) job of defending his company. It was a defence though that was, at least partly, unnecessary. Forgive me, but I had said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/28/why-paralympics-wont-challenge-perceptions-disabled">&#8216;A unique event to showcase disabled sport can be spectacular. Unapologetic, it is disability pride, a refusal to be seen as vulnerable or hide in the shadows. But it needs to be one where a disabled person, rather than David Beckham, is the face of Sainsbury&#8217;s Paralympic adverts. And one where Royal Mail was always planning to celebrate Paralympics winners in the same way as Olympians, rather than changing its mind to produce a stamp for each individual or team ParalympicsGB gold medal win &#8220;in response to public demand&#8221;.&#8217; </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem was never Sainsbury’s then, but the society that makes a company feel it is necessary to lean on non-disabled celebrity to make a disabled event sellable. In this society, disability is ‘other’ and marginalised. It isn’t pretty or successful and it’s not a lifestyle the customer is thought to want to buy. What Sainsbury’s did wasn’t a sign of prejudice or willful exclusion. It was a reflection of the society they are working within.</p>
<p>Similar can be said for Royal Mail (though I have considerably less sympathy here). Rightly or wrongly, the original decision to celebrate Paralympians less than Olympians was made because a company thought this appropriate. They thought <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/08/post_13.html">excuses of ‘logistical and practical impossibility’ </a>in printing a large number of stamps would satisfy the public – and symbolic and literal inequality would be accepted. (It wasn’t, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/royal-mail-pressure-paralympics-stamps">and they u-turned suitably.</a>)</p>
<p>I applaud Sainsbury’s efforts to make Paralympic sport more mainstream. I share Mr. King’s pleasure that more children are participating, and perhaps more, their parents are understanding the importance. But it does no one any good to cite this as evidence of a vast shift in perception, or to ignore the fact a non-disabled face isn’t just <em>part</em> of an ensemble but out in front.</p>
<p>Could Sainsbury’s have scrapped David Beckham and focused purely on disabled athletes? Yes. Would this have had the same economic or commercial success? No. If this is ever going to change, considerable measures need to be taken. The first, as they say, is admitting you’ve got a problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thenarcissisticanthropologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/the_4c87e5_1609844.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-542" title="The_4c87e5_1609844" src="http://thenarcissisticanthropologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/the_4c87e5_1609844.jpg?w=280&h=300" alt="" width="280" height="300" /></a>Last night after a very long day of dealing with the laughable nuances of client service work, an email came through from one of my Canadian coworkers with this headline:  <strong>Canadian crime story: Police probing Quebec maple syrup heist worth up to $30-million.</strong></p>
<p>The email trail between a couple of folks went this way:</p>
<p><em>Canadian team member:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Serious journalism here guys.</p>
<p>From The Globe and Mail:</p>
<p>Police probing Quebec maple syrup heist worth up to $30-million</p>
<p><a title="maple syrup heist" href="//www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/police-probing-quebec-maple-syrup-heist-worth-up-to-30-million/article4510740/  Via The Globe and Mail news app for BlackBerry">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/police-probing-quebec-maple-syrup-heist-worth-up-to-30-million/article4510740/</a></p>
<p>Via The Globe and Mail news app for BlackBerry&#8221;</p>
<p><em>U.S. team Member:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;This heist is on par with the 1975 robbery at Willie Wonka&#8217;s chocolate factory when 300,000 tons of chocolate was siphoned off from the chocolate river.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Canadian team member:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We also had an issue with the Hamburgler in the 70s. Tough up here.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>U.S. team member:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that. The judge sentenced him to 5 to 10 years in prison, whichever came first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;and so on.<br />
Oh the giggles we get from crimes that seem just so ridiculous.  But WHY do crimes like a &#8220;maple syrup heist&#8221; seem so funny to us?  What are the qualifiers that make some form of deviance despicable and others laughable?  Is it because the tens of millions of dollars in stolen goods wasn&#8217;t a scarce natural resource with high monetary value like gold or diamonds or oil?  Was it because the stolen goods weren&#8217;t property of a government agency?  An item earmarked for high taxes?  Drugs?</p>
<p>Is it that we only associate &#8220;hard&#8221; criminals with deviant goods and violence?</p>
<p>Needless to say, somebody&#8217;s (or many somebody&#8217;s) livelihoods were most likely heavily affected by the loss of revenue that came from this crime.  People with families to care for and bills to pay.</p>
<p>But still we laugh about it.  Because it&#8217;s kinda funny even though we don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>As a sociology graduate student (yes&#8230;anthropologists and sociologists can play in the same academic pool)  my concentration was in deviant behavior.  I took many courses, read lots of books and wrote lots of papers on the subjects like juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, organized crime, the social construction of deviant behavior (like playing pool, frequenting soda fountains and listening to Jazz music!) and even hardcore stuff like serial murder.  I was going to be Clarice Starling from Silence of The Lambs before I chose a career in marketing.</p>
<p>My point is, I spent a lot of time examining how and why &#8220;deviant&#8221; or criminal behaviors emerge and how they get labeled as such by society based on the role they play as a part of the sustainable functioning of social systems.  But one thing we never talked about are the crimes that get relegated to the status of ridiculous and not noteworthy.   We don&#8217;t sit our kids down and say &#8220;it&#8217;s okay if you steal something nobody really cares about&#8221;.  We just say &#8220;don&#8217;t steal things&#8221;, because as a society and as humans we know it&#8217;s wrong to take things that don&#8217;t belong to you.</p>
<p>So I pose the question to my readers and ask them to put on their Anthropologist (from human cultural or behavioral perspective)  or Sociologist (from a human systems / organization perspective) and tell me what YOU think.  I&#8217;m really only a tongue-in-cheek narcissist (in case you hadn&#8217;t caught that yet) and really DO care about other people&#8217;s points of view.</p>
<p>At minimum I hope you enjoyed a few laughs.  But my sincere hope is to encourage some deep thought, because my wife would not think it was funny if someone stole her maple syrup.  It&#8217;s the only thing that makes her gluten free waffles worth eating.</p>
