				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a cliché of the western movie genre. The hero has lived through some adventure, and, when it&#8217;s over, he gets on his horse and rides into the sunset. I have watched that scene dozens of times, and it fascinates me every time.</p>
<p>What happens when they disappear over the horizon? What happens after the &#8220;The End&#8221; placard covers the screen? Does the hero take time off before finding another adventure? Does he die of wounds suffered during the movie? Does he live happily ever after in some frontier town?</p>
<p>All of those questions go through my mind because I have to know the rest of the story. It doesn&#8217;t matter how bad the movie is. I still want to know what happens after the credits roll. However, something else goes through my mind, as well. The &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; scene isn&#8217;t always the same.</p>
<p>One of the greatest &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; scenes doesn&#8217;t even have a horse. In <em>The Searchers</em>, Ethan Edwards spends years attempting to rescue his niece from her Comanche captors. When he returns with her, everyone goes into the house except for him. He turns and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aHf7VdOpsE">walks into the desert</a> as the door closes behind him.<a href="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-searchers.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3287" alt="The Searchers" src="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-searchers.png?w=300&#038;h=164" width="300" height="164" /></a></p>
<p>Where did Edwards go? Did he leave because most of his family was dead? Did he wander because there was no purpose in his life? All of the wars were over. Or, did he think back over the past years before turning around and coming back?</p>
<p>John Wayne walked away in <em>The Searchers</em>, but Clint Eastwood could be the king of &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; rides. In <em>The Outlaw Josey Wales</em>, he is bleeding as he rides away. Does he live? If so, then does he go back to the friends that he has gained throughout the movie? Or, does he disappear from history?</p>
<p>Sometimes, he completely disappears because we really don&#8217;t know what he is. In <em>Pale Rider</em>, Eastwood evaporates from the scene. Is he some kind of spirit or is he just a mysterious gunman?</p>
<p>Those were great, but my favorite Eastwood ending comes from <em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em>. Blondie leaves Tuco with a noose around his neck and gold at his feet. After an impossible rifle shot to save Tuco, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIhqi0kVxDQ">Blondie rides away</a> to one of the greatest movie scores of all time.</p>
<p>A more recent western has an &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; scene at the end. The difference is the adventure that precedes it. In <em>Cowboys and Aliens</em>, James Bond defeats aliens with the help of Indiana Jones. Oh, Boyd Crowder helps out, too. This time the hero is truly a loner. His wife is dead. His alien love interest is dead. He is considered dead. Heck, the dog doesn&#8217;t even go with him. In this one, the hero probably went somewhere and cried.</p>
<p>The cool thing about &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; scenes is that they are no longer reserved for westerns only. Remember what happened at the end of <em>The Dark Knight</em>? He agrees to be the fall guy and live life as a villain. Then, he hops on his jacked out motorcycle and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAj20UOc3DE">rides into a tunnel</a>. There is no sunset, but there is a cool speech and some kind of light up ahead. I hope it&#8217;s not a train.<a href="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-dark-knight.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3291" alt="The Dark Knight" src="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-dark-knight.png?w=300&#038;h=123" width="300" height="123" /></a></p>
<p>Everybody knows what happened to him after that because we have sequels now. There should not have been a sequel to this one. Wondering what happened to Batman was a lot better than knowing that he faked his death and ended up with Catwoman.</p>
<p>Ok, so John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, James Bond and Batman all have had great scenes to end movies. However my favorite &#8220;into the sunset&#8221; scene comes from a movie that isn&#8217;t very good. At the end of <em>Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man</em>, Don Johnson, as Marlboro, goes back to his roots and enters a rodeo. At the same time, Mickey Rourke, as Harley, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW64tq30egw">rides his motorcycle</a> into the sunset with an 80s vixen on the back and Black Eyed Susan playing in the background.<a href="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/harley-ending.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3294" alt="Harley Ending" src="http://surroundedbyimbeciles.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/harley-ending.png?w=299&#038;h=168" width="299" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Why is that my favorite? Because it&#8217;s the only one that seems like a happy ending. He&#8217;s not alone. He&#8217;s not wounded. And, there is no doubt that something good is going to happen further down the road.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Many cultural conventions appear like the result of historical accidents. The QWERTY – keyboard is a typical example: the technical requirements of early typewriters still determine the computer keyboard that I write this text on, even though by now technical advances would allow for a far more efficient design. Some culturally accepted oddities, however, appear to reflect the biological requirements of human beings. The way musicians are seated in an orchestra is one such case, but the listener is, surprisingly, not the beneficiary.</strong></h4>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;">When one goes to a concert one typically sees a seating somewhat like the one below: strings in the front, then woodwinds further back, then brass. What is less obvious is that, in general, higher pitched instruments are seated on the left and lower pitched instruments on the right. The strings show this pattern perfectly: from left to right one sees violins, violas, cellos and then basses. Choirs show the same pattern: higher voices (soprano and tenor) stand left of the lower voices (alt and basses). Why is that?</h5>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></p>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"></h5>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Symfonieorkest_Nijmegen.jpg"><img class=" " alt="orchestra; seating arrangement; Nijmegen; Nijmegen studenten orkest" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Symfonieorkest_Nijmegen.jpg" width="480" height="289" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An orchestra I have personally performed with.</p></div>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;">It turns out that this is not a historical accident but instead a biological requirement. Diana Deutsch has used a series of audio illusions which all showed a curious pattern: when you present two series of tones each to one ear, you have the illusion that the high tones are being played to your right ear and the low ones to the left ear. In case you don’t believe me, listen to this illustration of Deutsch’s scale illusion:</h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/C5xLOfUzM4M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;">Apparently, there is a right ear advantage for high tones. So, seating the higher instruments on the left side (as seen on the photo) makes complete sense as this way musicians on stage tend to hear higher tones coming from their right. However, from the point of view of the audience this is actually a really bad idea as their right ear advantage is not taken into account. It turns out that orchestra seating arrangements are not favouring the hearing of the audience or the conductor but instead the musicians!</h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;">The right ear advantage for high tones is even mirrored in musicians’ brains. We know that the right ear projects mostly to the left auditory cortex and vice versa for the left ear. So, one would expect that people who play high instruments have trained their right ear / left auditory cortex the most when they practiced their craft. These training effects should be mirrored in differences in cortex size. This would mean that people sitting on the left in an orchestra have bigger left auditory cortices. In a fascinating article Schneider and colleagues showed that by and large this is the case: professional musicians who play high instruments or instruments with a sharp attack (e.g., percussionists, piano players) tend to have greater left auditory cortices than right auditory cortices. Their figure says is all.</h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></h5>
<div id="attachment_1177" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 779px"><a href="http://brainsidea.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/brain_orchestra_seating.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1177" alt="Schneider; orchestra; seating; brain; Heschl's gyrus; primary auditory cortex; cortical size" src="http://brainsidea.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/brain_orchestra_seating.jpg?w=769&#038;h=602" width="769" height="602" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">How the brains are seated in an orchestra.</p></div>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></h5>
<h5 style="padding-left:30px;">The orchestra seating arrangement mirrors not only the listening biases of most human ears but on top of that the brain differences between musicians. By and large, the orchestra is organised according to biological principles. Thus, not all cultural conventions – like the seemingly arbitrary seating arrangement of orchestras – have their roots in historical accidents. Cultural oddities are sometimes merely down to biology.</h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is <i>-ist</i> the next <i>-ly</i> or <i>-ster</i>?</p>
<p>Does that make sense? How about this: After <i>e-</i> and <i>i-</i>, what’s next?</p>
<p>That might make more sense. With the <i>e</i> prefix (for <i>electronic</i>) on <i>email</i> came a welter of other <i>e</i>- branded items. And with Apple’s <i>iMac</i> and <i>iPod</i> and <i>iPhone</i>, there have come to be numerous other <i>i-</i> branded items wanting to ride the crest. It was the latest thing for a while. Once some brand leader comes along with a new prefix, expect a fad for that. So what next?</p>
<p>Likewise with suffixes. A few of us may remember <i>Friendster</i>, a proto-Facebook, and <i>Napster</i>, a music file-sharing network. They drew on a popular jocular <i>-ster</i> addition to names and nouns (“Hey, Rickster! How ya doin’?”), taken from the still-productive suffix as in <i>gangster</i>, <i>mobster</i>, <i>teamster</i>, and so on. A few other website names with <i>-ster</i> have also shown up, for example a speed-trap warning community, <i>Trapster</i>, and a tea-lover community, <i>Steepster</i>. There are other brand names such as the <i>Veloster</i>, a Hyundai car. And of course there are hipsters.</p>
<p>And there was <i>-ly</i>, as in <i>bit.ly</i> and various other websites – because <i>.ly</i> is the Libya domain suffix and domains registered to it are available for a reasonable rate and it allows formation of words such as <i>visual.ly</i> and <i>futurefriend.ly</i>, but also as a fad on the English suffix; it shows up in other domains such as <i>graphicly.com</i> and <i>optimizely.com</i>.</p>
<p>And now there is <i>-ist</i>, as in the whole chain of <i>-ist</i> websites for cities – my local one is <i>Torontoist.com</i>, but there’s a network, and it has clear hipster tones: <i>Gothamist</i> (New York is <i>Gotham</i> for geeks, fanboys, and other “in the know” people), <i>Austinist</i>, <i>DCist</i>, <i>SFist</i>, <i>Chicagoist</i>, and a few others. I am beginning to see other <i>-ist</i>s as well, perhaps spurred by the city websites. There’s <i>todoist.com</i>, a task manager. There’s <i>Eyeist</i>, an online photography review service. There’s <i>Contemporist</i>, about contemporary culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps next will be <i>-age</i>. It’s already popular for colloquial formations of mass nouns: if you can have <i>verbiage</i> and <i>sewage</i>, why not <i>feedage</i> (already the name of an RSS directory) and <i>trollage</i> (also in use, because <i>trolling</i> is not nounly enough, I guess)? What website and other brand names may show up with it?</p>
<p>I raised the question today on Twitter of whether <i>-ist</i> was the next <i>-ly</i> or <i>-ster.</i> A fellow Tweeter, @maxbaru, asked, “isn’t ist already a suffix in SE?” I answered, “Suffix, sure, but fadfix?” I clarified: “You know, affixes that are used faddishly in brand names. (Actually, I think I just made up the word &#8220;fadfix.&#8221;)”</p>
<p>You can find <i>fadfix</i> with a Google search, true, but not with this usage: there is a publicity consultant for fashion companies, and a Saudi finish building material company belonging to the Fadl Al-Ashey Group, and a lot of usages of <i>fad fix</i> (as in getting your fix of the latest fad). People who are not linguistics geeks are less likely to have <i>suffix, prefix,</i> and <i>affix</i> in their mind. But I think it’s a perfectly good coinage for the purpose at hand – a portmanteau of <i>fad</i> and <i>affix.</i> If <i>affix</i> is not a familiar term for you, I will clarify: it refers to any bits that can be attached onto words but can’t be independent words themselves. They can go at the start (<i>prefix</i>), at the end (s<i>uffix</i>), or even in the middle (<i>infix</i>) – though we don’t do infixes in English, just colloquial <a href="http://sesquiotic.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/tmesis/" target="_blank">tmesis</a>. As a bonus, <i>affix</i> is from Latin <i>ad</i> ‘to’ plus <i>fixus</i> ‘fastened’. So it would be <i>adfix</i> except there was assimilation in the Latin. In the Latin, though, not the English! We will not make <i>faffix</i> out of <i>fadfix</i>.</p>
<p>So fadfixes are any affixes used faddishly, especially for brand names. I wonder whether we might even include pseudofixes – not real affixes, but simply catchy replacements of existing elements, such as <i>X</i> in a million places where there might otherwise be <i>ex</i>, or the various replacements of <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> with <i>2</i> and <i>4</i> (such as in <i>In4mation</i>, <i>In4mants</i>, and even a Spanish website that uses the English replacement in the middle of a Spanish verb: <i>In4mate</i> – <i>infórmate</i> is “inform yourself,” but <i>incuatromate</i> is nothing…). Maybe, to be extra-hip, we can de-<em>X</em> the <em>X</em> and call those <i>fadfickses</i>. Or would that be just too fickle?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My best ideas come in the shower.  I will be in the middle of scrubbing suds into my hair, with bubbles flying and sodium laureth sulfate dangerously close to my eyes, when the perfect topic will appear, and then the words will start to flow.  I will know exactly how to begin, what should come next, and even an outline will begin to form in my mind.  My ideas begin developing quickly, and as I realize the writing potential that I have created with a few minutes alone, I frantically finish washing and wish that pens and paper were compatible with water.</p>
<div id="attachment_1156" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://emilyjanuary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/800px-showerhead.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1156" alt="From Wikimedia Commons" src="http://emilyjanuary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/800px-showerhead.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From Wikimedia Commons</p></div>
<p>This happens inevitably, and although the conditions are not conducive to writing, there is an element of the shower that promotes invention.  It also happens in the car, while I am driving children to and from school, ballet, and piano lessons, but only if the radio is off and my toddler is asleep.  This condition is quiet, and it allows me, as a writer and scholar, to meditate, to think, to invent, and to create.</p>
<p>This quiet is not perfectly still. There is usually white noise or a scenic view, but it’s silent enough to allow my mind to wander and to think.  I jokingly share my shower anecdote with my freshman composition students occasionally.  It comes out as a counter to their claims that writing at 3 a.m. on the day the essay is due is their best place and time to write.  They claim that their writing “flows” when they are under pressure, when a deadline is looming, and when their bodies are loaded with caffeine.  They defend procrastination vehemently, not realizing that writing is a process and that it best occurs over time, with thought, craft, care, revision, and thinking.</p>
<p>We try to engender such thinking in the classroom.  We read essays to lead up to each major writing assignment and then put pen to paper silently in class to respond to those essays.  We talk about the issues, looking for thesis statements, topic sentences, connections, and transitions.  We spend weeks doing this thinking, and then, it is time for invention.  I would love to encourage my students to go home and take showers while thinking about their essay topics.  However, even if assigned, this would not happen.  They do not see writing and thinking as enjoyable, but instead as a chore.  Their minds would wander and they would procrastinate.  So, we create that quiet in the classroom, where it is supervised and artificial, but it is there.</p>
<p>We spend a day or two drafting and brainstorming. I provide the questions and they write.  I suggest clustering their ideas, and they write.  I explain Peter Elbow’s concept of free writing, and they write.  They write silently, alone, in a quiet classroom, with only the sound of the building’s heating and air-conditioning system and the tick of the clock creating ambient noise.  Hopefully, their ideas are flowing and the environment, although quiet and sterile, is promoting that.  Perhaps the classroom does not promote ideas as inspiring or as urgent as my shower ideas, but it is a start toward creating a quiet place in which to meditate.  The location does not matter as much as the condition of that location.</p>
<p>My shower is not the only place that I find inspiration for my writing.  I have also used the quiet of my undergraduate university library and an old spiral bound notebook to let my ideas flow.  I sit on my bed at night after the children are asleep and jot down my many thoughts.  I carry a small notebook with me and write whenever a moment of inspiration hits me.  That’s usually when I’m walking through the tree-lined sidewalks of my current campus.  I use technology, my iPad, my computer, and my laptop, to write as I am struck.  I keep sticky notes and a pen in my car for inventive occasions as well.  And when I am reading, I write in the margins and on the end papers.  The mode of writing does not matter, but the conditions.  The conditions can strike at anytime, for quiet and meditation can happen at different points throughout the day.</p>
<p>But perhaps technology contributes to a lack of quiet, meditative conditions.  We are constantly connected through our phones, our iPads, our televisions, and our computers.  Some even sleep (or shower) with these devices.  There can be no quiet with such connectivity.  There is no chance to think, to relax, or to meditate.  Staring at one’s laptop screen in the classroom, despite the instructor’s best efforts to create a thinking atmosphere, may be just as intimidating or unsettling.  That blank screen may induce anxiety and the suddenly louder tick of the clock may magnify that feeling.  Are pen and paper better?  Are there more possibilities for healthy mistakes and free flow of thought on a notepad?  Is there something less formal and less demanding of perfection than a screen, which from the get-go displays an ideal form of typography and the serious feel of words in print?</p>
<p>Technology isn’t our only boon to writing and creating a quiet place in which to do so.  The busyness of our lives also encroaches on thinking time.  If we are never alone during the day, if we are never allowed a moment of just sitting, and if we can never find the right conditions for pondering, when will any thinking happen?  This is an issue often explored, from well-written essays in <i>The New Yorker</i> to complaints of friends and children being burned out from overachievement.  This busyness may also take away from the quiet moments of inspiration a writer can and should receive.</p>
<div id="attachment_1157" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 386px"><a href="http://emilyjanuary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/376px-shower_bath_ngm-v31-p335.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1157" alt="Public domain image from National Geographic" src="http://emilyjanuary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/376px-shower_bath_ngm-v31-p335.jpg?w=376&#038;h=599" width="376" height="599" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Public domain image from National Geographic</p></div>
<p>My shower is a haven of writing for me, despite its limits, because it is the one consistent place I am away from the technology and the busyness of my own life.  Although, I still don’t have a solution to writing while wet!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://whoisdamon.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the_dark_knight_rises_2012-wide.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-228" alt="the_dark_knight_rises_2012-wide" src="http://whoisdamon.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the_dark_knight_rises_2012-wide.jpg?w=548&#038;h=399" width="548" height="399" /></a></p>
<p>It’s almost Easter. So let’s talk about the Dark Knight Rises. I think it can help us understand a side of the resurrection that I’ve rarely heard talked about.</p>
<p>In the middle of the film Officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt; swoon ladies, swoon) asks Bruce Wayne about why he would wear a mask as Batman. Bruce tells him it’s to protect the people closest to him but then he hits on something that stuck with me more than anything in the film.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody. That was the point.<br />
<strong>Blake</strong>: Well, it&#8217;s damn good to see him back.<br />
<strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: Not everybody agrees.<br />
<strong>Blake</strong>: They&#8217;ll figure that out in the end.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of the Batman was never supposed to be idolatry of Batman. <strong>The Batman was supposed to only serve as a catalyst to spur everyone else into actually making a difference.</strong></p>
<p>I believe some people have made the same mistake with Jesus’ resurrection. It’s one thing to say you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. <strong>It’s another thing to actually live out the resurrection; to <i>be</i> the resurrection.</strong></p>
<p>Even before Jesus died he expected his followers to do more than just intellectually affirm him. He says in John 14:12:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So the point of everything he was doing was not so that we can idolize him and talk about how great it is, but so that we can be pushed to do <i>more</i>.</strong> There are so many ways to honor Christ and this is one of those ways. So believing in this Christ is so much more radical than simply “confessing with your mouth and believing with your heart that he is Lord”. It goes farther than that.</p>
<p>1 John 4:12 says:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.</p></blockquote>
<p>This type of belief in Christ requires action. It requires love; and without love, there is no God being brought to full expression because love is the only way to make that happen.</p>
<p>There’s a scene near the end of the gospel of John where Jesus is hanging on the cross and his mother and the disciple, John are standing near him. He says to his mother, “Dear, woman, here is your son,” and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And it says that John took her into his home from that time on. I believe this was Jesus doing the same thing I’ve been talking about. This was his mother and the disciple he loved the most standing here so both of them held Jesus closer than any of us. But Jesus is having them let go of him and turn to <i>each other</i>. <strong>He’s telling his mother “You were a mother to me while I was here but now you are a mother to <i>him</i>.” And he’s telling his disciple, “You served me while I was here but now you will serve <i>her</i>.” He was telling them “Let me go now, and go live out what I am.”</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, Batman has a very similar interaction with Commissioner Gordon before his sacrifice near the end of The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commissioner Gordon</strong><b>:</b><b> </b>I never cared who you were.<br />
<strong>Bruce Wayne</strong><b>:</b><b> </b>And you were right.<br />
<strong>Commissioner Gordon</strong><b>:</b><b> </b>But shouldn&#8217;t the people know the hero who saved them?<br />
<strong>Bruce Wayne</strong><b>:</b><b> </b>A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy&#8217;s shoulders, to let him know the world hadn&#8217;t ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Resurrection of Jesus serves as a symbol for us, telling us <strong>“Anybody can do this. Anyone can do what I do, in bringing God into full expression through love. Even a mother, even a disciple, even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy’s shoulders, to let him know the world hasn’t ended.&#8221;</strong> We live out the resurrection by bringing God into full expression through acts of love.</p>
<p>And this is what this world needs. We saw that even in the midnight premiere of the Dark Knight Rises with the horrific shooting in Aurora, Colorado. This world needs people willing to live out the resurrection in a radical way, even when there are people who disagree. But Bruce Wayne and Officer Blake address that as well:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Blake</strong>: Well, it&#8217;s damn good to see him back.<br />
<strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: Not everybody agrees.<br />
<strong>Blake</strong>: They&#8217;ll figure that out in the end.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I can be wishy-washy, but even for me, this Boston decision was such a mess. I ended up not going; considering there were several inches of snow across New England, blustery winds, poor visibility, and the fact that it would have taken 4.5 hours to get there with none of these factors, I think I made the sensible choice. (AWP was worth it if I got at least two days out of it, financially and temporally; if I&#8217;d had to stay over in some Holiday Inn in Connecticut and got one day, no.) Anyway. Better planning for next year!</p>
<p>Another week draws to a close in my poetic rut. It&#8217;s not just writing; everything seems to be escaping me. Ideas, energy, communication. Something in the planets or the weather or the water. I&#8217;m still taking off tomorrow, so I&#8217;m hoping that will do some good; I&#8217;ll have a mental health day at the cafe or something. Meanwhile, <a href="http://dversepoets.com">DVerse</a> was asking for poems about where we live; enough has been written about New York already (hell, by me, even), and at the same time, the paradox is that not enough has been written about New York. So, what the hell, here you go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to eat bacon until I feel better about myself&#8230; flawed plan? Possibly. But it&#8217;s a flawed plan with <em>bacon</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Rhapsody</strong></p>
<p>Every third day, the people unfortunate enough<br />
to own a car in Manhattan get up on this street,<br />
move everything to the other side for the sweeper<br />
hissing by, all that powerhose and bristle song<br />
that pushes cellophane and gravel and urine along<br />
determined and fierce, the men with naked feet<br />
at the brick-faced methadone clinic and doormen<br />
pressed and polished grumble to each other,<br />
why bother?</p>
<p>Tomorrow the street again turns brown and grey<br />
like every other day, tomorrow another aging hippie<br />
smokes hashish on her stoop and the super follows<br />
red-faced chiding, tomorrow there&#8217;s juvenile rats<br />
discovering trash and finch chatter in the narrow<br />
moats of saplings pierced through the cement,<br />
tomorrow a bell and a cab and a madman make<br />
a symphony, so what&#8217;s the use in pretending this<br />
could be anything else?</p>
<p>And the echo sidles up to say, because, because,<br />
it&#8217;s the gospel of transformation caught between<br />
two rivers, for a moment the street sheds rough skin<br />
like a serpent and this becomes an anywhere<br />
that is everywhere flecked with people who seem<br />
everyone, escaping the way unfletched arrows<br />
seek their liberty to alight where they please, when<br />
weathered pavement settles shrugs contradictory<br />
shoulders into place:</p>
<p>then in the cracks cries a ragged visionary<br />
give and take give and take give and take.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A stable one.  9-to-5.  With health insurance and a 401k.  GET IT NOW.</p>
<p>Stop angsting over whether your Art or your Muse will survive Selling Out.  Stop saying that your delicate artistic expressiveness can&#8217;t cope with an office job.  Stop being allergic to money and then wondering why you can&#8217;t make rent and your lights are always being turned off.</p>
<p>Please understand that I&#8217;m not angry, and I&#8217;m not yelling.  I&#8217;m Italian, and it&#8217;s how we talk when we get passionate.  We get loud, and we curse, and it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t hack a &#8220;soul-killing&#8221; office job?  You know what&#8217;s soul-killing?  Having to sell your instrument or live out of your car.  Believe me, the logic that office jobs and Working For The Man ruin one&#8217;s artistic creativity is a fiction created by idiotic trust fund kids with big ol&#8217; safety nets beneath them, or people with rich spouses who bankroll their personal experimentation while they pat themselves on the back for taking pretend &#8220;risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the rest of us?  Get a damn job.</p>
<p><em>A stable one.  9-to-5.  With health insurance and a 401k.  GET IT NOW.</em></p>
<p>The thing about this is that it means your artistic life will take longer to germinate.  You will need more of what the nuns used to call stick-to-it-iveness and what German Jews call <em>sitzfleisch</em>, the patience to just park your rump and work until something happens.  You will need more determination, more patience, more stubbornness, more ability to balance free time, and more appetite for hard and seemingly fruitless work than you otherwise would if you could &#8211;</p>
<p><em>&#8211; hit the lottery and &#8211;</em></p>
<p>&#8211; do your art 24/7.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing.  If you are in your 20s or 30s, I can guarantee you you will already need more of that than you currently think you&#8217;ll need.  Young people are hideously impatient and completely unaware of just how long almost anything takes to come to fruition.</p>
<p>So &#8230; if this is going to take 15 to 20 years of unrelenting effort <em>anyway</em>, why the hell not have a stable, safe indoors office job that pays reliably for all that time?   There&#8217;s a lot to be said for a good car, a grown-up sofa, and a real bed instead of a freakin futon, not to mention a savings account and a Roth IRA.</p>
<p>Just do it.  Get a goddamned stable career-oriented job.  Who <em>cares</em> if it has nothing to do with music, as long as you still have an instrument and free time in which to use it?  Stop being allergic to and feeling guilty for making money and then being mystified at why you are always hanging by a thread.  And stop using your art as an excuse for never getting your act together.</p>
<p>This has been building up for a while &#8212; it&#8217;s no one thing that brought it to mind, but &#8230; you just have to let things out eventually.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I came across this Solar System sampler in the Museum’s textiles store. It was uncanny &#8211; the arrangement of concentric rings was so familiar and immediately recognisable, but so strange when seen as a piece of Georgian embroidery.</p>
<div id="attachment_178" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 255px"><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0194.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" alt="Solar System sampler. T.92-1939" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0194.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300" width="245" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Solar System sampler. T.92-1939</p></div>
<p>The sampler is a piece of linen 35cm tall and 35cm wide, with the title ‘The Solar System’ followed by five lines of text. At the centre is a large diagram of the six innermost planets orbiting the sun. <span id="more-176"></span>At the bottom are two tables of data, either side of the date 1811. The design has been transferred onto the fabric with ink, creating a template for the embroiderer. However, only small areas have been completed in silk thread. Quite early in the project, this sampler has been abandoned.</p>
<p>The unusualness was reinforced by the other samplers in our collection, which bore familiar decorative alphabets and floral patterns. In the eighteenth century embroidery featured large in girls’ education. But practical uses like mending clothes and decorating soft furnishings paled in comparison to embroidery’s supposed moral benefits. Needlework required patience and concentration, and it kept women at home, focussed on a virtuous domesticity.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn1">[1]</a> Most other samplers of this time show suitably ladylike subjects.</p>
<div id="attachment_185" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 241px"><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0196.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-185" alt="Elizabeth Musto sampler. T.6-1935" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0196.jpg?w=231&#038;h=300" width="231" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Musto sampler. T.6-1935</p></div>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/history-of-samplers-18th-century/" target="_blank">V&amp;A website</a> for several excellent histories of samplers.</p>
<p>The turn of the nineteenth century was an extremely exciting time in all the sciences, including astronomy. New telescopes and methods in the hands of enthusiasts kept surprising the world with new discoveries. In 1781, England’s foremost astronomer-composer William Herschel confirmed the existence of another planet, orbiting beyond Saturn. He named the star after his King and patron, George III.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel-quote.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-181" alt="herschel quote" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel-quote.jpg?w=580&#038;h=139" width="580" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>Four more planets were discovered between 1801 and 1804: Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta. They were soon reclassified as ‘asteroids’. The census of comets, fixed stars and other galaxies also grew yearly.</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/detail.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-186" alt="detail" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/detail.jpg?w=266&#038;h=300" width="266" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>But the sampler doesn’t include new developments. Georgium Sidus appears over to the right without an orbit, as if it doesn’t quite have a place in the existing order. Its distance from the sun and duration of revolution were known by the mid-1780s, however they don’t appear on the tables. The asteroids don’t appear at all. Maybe the diagram for the sampler was copied from an older book, published before 1781. That might explain why the sampler wasn’t finished. Who, in 1811, would want to spend weeks or months working on a picture of the Solar System that didn’t include the newest, most exciting planets?</p>
<p>Women didn’t find it easy to participate in late eighteenth century science. Experimentation and discovery were not easily compatible with the ideals of domestic femininity – but there were women who rejected these social expectations and became active and renowned. Botany was dominated by female amateurs, and education campaigner Maria Edgeworth considered chemistry to be particularly suitable. In 1798, Priscilla Wakefield wrote encouragingly,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘there are many branches of science in which women may employ their time and talents, beneficially to themselves and the community, without destroying the peculiar characteristics of their sex, or exceeding the most exact limits of modesty and decorum’.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn3">[3]</a></p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_190" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 253px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel"><img class="size-medium wp-image-190" alt="Caroline Herschel" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel_caroline_1829.jpg?w=243&#038;h=300" width="243" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caroline Herschel</p></div>
<p>One of the most successful was Caroline Herschel, William’s sister, who performed her own observations and discovered a number of comets. She even earned her own salary of £50 a year.</p>
<p>Girls interested in astronomy, if they were from rich families, could have private lessons. In the 1760s and 1770s this was quite common among daughters of the Bluestockings. Anne Emblin, born 1753, was tutored by James Ferguson, who wrote an account of their lessons as a set of Dialogues.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ferguson-title-page.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-179" alt="ferguson title page" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ferguson-title-page.jpg?w=232&#038;h=300" width="232" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The lessons provide a very detailed introduction and explanation of astronomy, staged as conversations between a girl called Eudosia (meaning ‘good thought’) and her brother Neander (‘new man’) who has returned from university at Cambridge.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn5">[5]</a> Books, of course, were cheaper than tutors and Ferguson’s publication remained popular into the 1820s. Among the scientific talk of light particles and gravity, are commentaries like this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/why-do-you-sigh-eudosia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" alt="why do you sigh eudosia" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/why-do-you-sigh-eudosia.jpg?w=300&#038;h=266" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/too-common.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-182" alt="too common" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/too-common.jpg?w=300&#038;h=280" width="300" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Another contribution to the body of astronomy books for girls appeared in 1787. Richard Wynne wrote his Geography and Astronomy textbook in English, and then it was translated into French and Italian by his daughter Catharine.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn6">[6]</a> He explains:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wynne-preface.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-184" alt="wynne preface" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wynne-preface.jpg?w=300&#038;h=298" width="300" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>In the early 1800s there was a general fear for the morality of England’s young women. The recent French Revolution had overturned the monarchy, the church, the family and the whole established way of life, and the establishment were terrified that revolutionary spirit would erupt on this side of the channel. Any change seemed threatening. If young women started thinking of their own education and interests above the needs of the family and the nation, this would surely lead to moral deterioration, collapse and revolution!</p>
<p>The Solar System sampler was made in this context of heightened fear, which makes the choice of inscription very interesting. The lines of text are taken from John Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>These are thy glorious works, parent of good,<br />
Almighty, thine this universal frame,<br />
Thus wondrous fair; thyself how wondrous then!<br />
Unspeakable, who sittest above these heavens<br />
To us invisible or dimly seen<br />
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare<br />
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine</p></blockquote>
<p>An apposite choice to caption the frame of the heavens. But Milton’s work was fraught with moral ambiguity – he was a great English poet with a clear Christian message, but he was also a republican who supported Cromwell in the Civil Wars.</p>
<p>In the next decade, both the Solar System and John Milton were drawn into the mainstream of educational practice, and in the process sanitised and moralised. The Religious Tract Society commissioned Thomas Dick to write their first astronomy pamphlets in the 1820s. Their diagram, so similar to the one on the sampler, includes all the new planets:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/religious-tract-society.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188" alt="Religious Tract Society" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/religious-tract-society.jpg?w=300&#038;h=252" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>And in 1828 Eliza Weaver Bradburn published ‘The Story of Paradise Lost for Children’. This reduced version of the full text was framed as a mother telling Milton’s story, but avoiding the political aspects. This was a common method of introducing classical and literary works to children, especially girls, to avoid corrupting their virtue.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In these books, access to knowledge is mediated by the specialist brother or father, or the watchful mother, in the domestic context of the lesson. And the most prominent Georgian female writer on astronomy used the same format.</p>
<div id="attachment_189" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 237px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Bryan_(philosopher)"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" alt="Margaret_Bryan" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/margaret_bryan.jpg?w=227&#038;h=300" width="227" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Margaret Bryan, from the frontispiece of her book.</p></div>
<p>Margaret Bryan published three books of Natural Philosophy for ‘the use of schools and private families’, and she ran a small college for ‘young ladies’ in London. Teaching gave Margaret a way to write and publish scientific work, without threatening to overstep the bounds of ‘modesty and decorum’. The introductions to her books overflow with maternal sympathies and religious fervour. She assures her pupils that learning science will…</p>
<blockquote><p>‘arm you with a perpetual talisman, which… will secure you from all pernicious doctrines, and guard your religious an moral principles against all innovations. Omit no opportunity of applying the lessons they impart to perfect every thing that gives either value or grace to the female character… Cull the sweets of religion, as you rove through the flowery paths of Natural Philosophy’<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn8">[8]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Bryan’s descriptions of natural phenomena continually reinforce the domestic, conservative point of view:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘In the centre of the solar system… is placed the sun, like the father of a family, surrounded by bodies dependent on his emanations.  These are called planets.’<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn9">[9]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Marina Benjamin has written that Bryan’s references to herself as a mother, teacher, and amateur, and her overstated respectability and piety, made it possible for her to stretch the boundaries of acceptability in other ways.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn10">[10]</a> By being overtly, even overly, feminine, she could publish her own work. Indeed, Bryan was well-received and reviewed in astronomical journals. To speak as a woman in science, she had to find a different, feminine language.</p>
<p>Writing about women shell collectors and embroiderers, Ariane Fennetaux has made a similar point about crafts. They ‘allowed women to experiment with fields and ideas that were traditionally associated with masculine pursuits’.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn11">[11]</a> Women developed serious expertise in conchology while producing ‘feminine’ shell sculptures and grottos.</p>
<p>My experience of the uncanny with the Solar System sampler may have arisen from this same tension of scientific ideas in a craft form. This might also be a tension between what women wanted to do and how they had to do it &#8211; needlework was a way for this young girl to represent scientific, conventionally masculine ideas, without reproach. The resulting object refuses to fall easily into either category of craft or science, and simultaneously calls into question the associated ideas of what women should do and how they should do it.</p>

As we know, this name didn’t stick for long. Understandably, French astronomers after the Revolution refused to use the name of a monarch for a heavenly body, so ‘Herschel’ was tried for a while, but eventually ‘Uranus’ caught on.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently <em>New York Magazine</em> published <a href='http://nymag.com/news/features/retro-wife-2013-3/'>a long piece</a> about what it identifies as a trend of wealthy women who identify as feminists choosing not to work and instead to care for their children full-time. I&#8217;ve had a version this post sitting in my drafts folder since last spring, when some of these same issues popped up partly in response to the publication of Elisabeth Badinter&#8217;s book <a title="badinter book" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YO5CR1B5wtMC"><em>The Conflict</em></a>. I chose not to post it then mostly because, for good reason, it&#8217;s all so contentious. Maybe I&#8217;m less risk averse now. (Also for some reason I thought a good title would be &#8220;attachment parenting is a consumer good,&#8221; which is true, but man that&#8217;s a stupid thing to call a post about parenting on this internet.)</p>
<p>Katha Pollitt (who is right about everything), wrote <a title="pollitt column" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/167928/attachment-parenting-more-guilt-mother">a very good column in the Nation</a> last May about &#8220;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting'>attachment parenting</a>,&#8221; responding to a sensationalist piece in <em>Time</em> about the &#8220;mommy wars.&#8221; (I won&#8217;t link since it&#8217;s the worst sort of trolling link bait.) Pollitt&#8217;s point is similar to the one I was trying to make <a title="Sherry Turkle’s reproductive futurism" href="http://blog.tylerbickford.com/2012/05/16/sherry-turkles-reproductive-futurism/">in response to Sherry Turkle</a>, that most commentary about parenting and concern for children is really about disciplining adults—disciplining women—and that holds true for a certain version of attachment parenting.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m on record as thinking that claims that childrearing is a fundamental value are mostly just mechanisms for controlling women. But I do think we need a more complicated critique of things like attachment parenting that hopefully doesn&#8217;t require us to only value public activities and devalue private ones.</p>
<p>I want to highlight this point from Pollitt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Badinter blames intensive mothering for distorting feminism and pulling women back into the home. But <strong>one could also say it’s a socially approved way of withdrawing from a workplace that, in addition to all the usual sorrows and pains, has been sexist in general and hostile to mothers in particular, and of resolving the frustrations of the double day</strong> &#8212; women’s greater domestic burden. (These are also features of French life, despite France’s excellent daycare system.) America is famously unfriendly to mothers &#8212; no paid parental leave, a lack of affordable daycare, patchy after-school, long workdays, little vacation. Even legally mandated paid sick days are controversial. Individual mothers manage to negotiate these shoals &#8212; after all, most mothers are employed &#8212; but overall, lack of social supports is America’s way of telling them they don’t really belong at work. Their real job is at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the bolded part is pretty tremendously insightful, and I want to push on it point a bit, and also to question the implication that the specific reason to bemoan this state of things is that having a job is good in itself. Certainly we live in a society in which work is the primary source of social value, and there are very good reasons for valuing women&#8217;s participation there and for being strongly skeptical of attempts to encourage or really even legitimate a retreat to the private sphere that looks strongly like a retrenchment of gender hierarchies. (Pollitt: &#8220;As long as women’s primary focus is domestic, men will run the world and make the rules.&#8221; True story.) </p>
<p>But I also don&#8217;t think we can say enough that jobs suck. With a very small number of exceptions, jobs are alienating, humiliating, boring, stressful, time-consuming, unproductive, wasteful, physically and psychologically debilitating, exhausting, joyless, and terrible. Caring for children also sucks (because caring for children is work, and jobs suck), and it&#8217;s intensely wrong for folks like Turkle or attachment-parenting guru William Sears to tell women that their child&#8217;s well-being demands their complete sacrifice of time, attention, ambition, and individuality. I think maybe it&#8217;s also wrong to tell people they must have personal ambitions involving wage labor. Childcare sucks. Work sucks. We should revise our values around <em>both</em> of these things.</p>
<p>I think the issue is similar to a point David Graeber makes (<a title="graeber harpers" href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/01/0081344"><em>Harper&#8217;s</em> paywall</a>; <a title="graber full text" href="http://libcom.org/library/army-altruists-alienated-right-do-good">full text</a>; <a href='http://inequalityandsocialclass.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/army-of-altruists-graeber-harpers.pdf'>full text pdf</a>) when he compares enlisting in the army to getting involved in campus-based left activism: both decisions are about sidestepping the unfulfilling world of wage labor in favor of work that expresses one&#8217;s values. And both decisions are pretty easy to criticize as themselves alienated—I wouldn&#8217;t say that actively participating in US military hegemony is a great way to express one&#8217;s values, though I think I understand and respect the sense of solidarity and commitment to a (nationalist) community that such a choice expresses:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I always tell activists engaged in the peace movement and counter-recruitment campaigns: why do working-class kids join the army anyway? Because, like any teenager, they want to escape the world of tedious work and meaningless consumerism, to live a life of adventure and camaraderie in which they believe they are doing something genuinely noble. They join the army because they want to be like you.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how things like attachment parenting make sense to me, as an expression of noble purpose, purchased by relatively wealthy people the same way they purchase things like health care and education for loved ones. What&#8217;s being purchased is time away from work, and time focused on what they understand to be of much higher value: their children and families. Graeber again:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is really at stake here in any market economy is precisely the ability to make these trades, to convert “value” into “values.” All of us are striving to put ourselves in a position in which we can dedicate ourselves to something larger than ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Pollitt and Badinter that these parenting ideologies can be a real problem. But I also think that what we <em>want</em> is a world in which any person is free to reject wage labor, and I think that we want a world where care of any sort (for children, for the elderly, for other dependents, for oneself) <em>is</em> valued. We can and should be critical of the particular formulation of this value placed on the family (<a title="Sherry Turkle’s reproductive futurism" href="http://blog.tylerbickford.com/2012/05/16/sherry-turkles-reproductive-futurism/">again</a>, reproductive futurism is no good, or rather, it is all bad), but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right to say that acting on the value of intimate relationships over commodified relationships is necessarily bad. Rather, what I&#8217;d say we want is a world in which many <em>more</em> people are free to bypass wage labor and pursue the activities and relationships they value (and, of course, hopefully, for those values to themselves be valuable, where intimate relationships <em>are</em> but the gender hierarchies they presuppose are <em>not</em>). Similarly, here&#8217;s Peter Frase on <a href='http://jacobinmag.com/2011/01/hipsters-food-stamps-and-the-politics-of-resentment/'>hipsters and privilege</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The false (but not without a grain of truth!) intimation that hipsters are all white kids who are subsidized by their rich parents legitimizes this position, but even if it were accurate it wouldn’t make the attitude of contempt any more sensible. For even if creative and enjoyable lives are only accessible to the privileged, that’s not a damning fact about them so much as it is an indictment of a society that has so much wealth and yet only allows a select few to take advantage of it, while others are forced to waste their lives chained to their useless jobs and bloated mortgages.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, dropping out of the workforce in order to be able to spend time with people you love (or do any number of other things you might actually value and want to do) really is kind of <em>the goal</em>, and I think we&#8217;re missing something if we don&#8217;t recognize that this is <em>part</em> of what&#8217;s happening with things like attachment parenting. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite the same as the simple anti-politics of &#8220;choice feminism.&#8221; I&#8217;m interested in something more akin to the politics outlined in <a href='http://monthlyreview.org/2004/03/01/the-right-not-to-work-power-and-disability'>this amazing essay about work and disability</a> by Sunny Taylor. Taylor argues that disability activism has implications for many more people than those normally identified as disabled, partly because we will almost all be impaired at some point in our lives by illness or old age, but also because it entails fights for things like the right for <em>everyone</em> not to work: </p>
<blockquote><p>Western culture has a very limited idea of what being useful to society is. People can be useful in ways other than monetarily. . . . The same rule that often excludes the impaired from the traditional workplace also exploits the able-bodied who have no other choice but to participate. The right not to work is an ideal worthy of the impaired and able-bodied alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Valuing work too highly necessarily devalues care and intimacy and dependence, and certainly doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of room for the value of people who are unable to work or excluded from work. Or what&#8217;s almost the same thing, valuing work too highly can place such <a href='http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5452.html'>priceless, infinite value</a> on things like children and the family that they are all but value-less, so we get the reproductive futurism that we have, which is what leads to the current perversion in which actual care work is done for extremely low wages, or by mothers who are sacrificing significant earnings, social prestige, social insurance contributions, etc. One reason the parent-friendly policies Pollitt would like to see are missing in the States is precisely <em>because</em> work is over-valued here. The bizarre contradictions of a &#8220;family values&#8221; rhetoric that has no time for family-valuing policies like paid medical leave to care for dependents (like during the 2012 presidential campaign when <a href='http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/04/15/the_gendered_welfare_state_.html'>Mitt Romney was simultaneously claiming</a> the value of his wife&#8217;s role as a mother while arguing that a single parent&#8217;s focus on caring for their children denies them the dignity of work) make sense if fully distinguishing those spheres is the whole point of reactionary family values rhetoric. </p>
<p>This sort of parenting is interesting for how it involves many people who identify as liberal doing something that looks a lot like a more characterisitically right wing move—as Graeber puts it, it enhances the division between egoism and altruism (by enhancing the division between public and private), rather than trying to efface that division in the more traditional manner of the left. (<a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/02/homeschooling_and_unschooling_among_liberals_and_progressives_.single.html'>See also Dana Goldstein on the contradiction of &#8220;progressive homeschooling.&#8221;</a>) One response to that is just to say that these practices clearly aren&#8217;t recognizably liberal or left, and that&#8217;s right. But I think they are practices that can help expose or reveal where value is located in people&#8217;s lived experiences, and if I&#8217;m right to make these connections to Graeber and Frase and Taylor maybe that can also help reveal some intriguing points of odd commensurability between radical and reactionary cultural politics. Or something.</p>
<p>(For the record, the answer to all this is &#8220;<a href='http://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/09/15/silvia-federici-wages-against-housework/'>wages for housework</a>,&#8221; though as Federici argues, that&#8217;s not so much a policy solution as &#8220;the only revolutionary perspective from a feminist viewpoint and ultimately for the entire working class.&#8221; So let&#8217;s do that.)</p>
