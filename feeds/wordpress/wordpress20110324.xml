			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Tulum:</em></strong> And so here we are at the end of this journey &#8211; 5000 miles from London, where it all started, but we&#8217;ll do the final push from Mexico by plane.</p>
<div id="attachment_4391" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wandering.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4391" title="wandering" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wandering.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wandering around the world and all the way to Mexico</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">We&#8217;re finishing on the white-gold sands of Tulum, a stunning wild beach on the Yucatán&#8217;s Caribbean coast, where we&#8217;ve rented a stick and thatch cabin a few metres from the ocean. At night, the huge supermoon floods through the gaps in our cabin&#8217;s stick-sides and the roar and shhh of the waves lull us to sleep in our bed, which swings, suspended by ropes from the roof beam. Our little cluster of cabañas are separated from the big wide beaches by rocks, which protect our own secluded beach from other holidaymakers. We share our space with very few other people even when the weekenders descend.</p>
<div id="attachment_4392" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/localsbeach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4392  " title="localsbeach" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/localsbeach.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Local families visit the beach at the weekend</p></div>
<p>Tulum was, until relatively recently, a Mayan walled-city, the ruins of which stand on a prominent cliff overlooking the beach. With such a stunning location, it would definitely have been my city of choice as a Mayan. The fortified port city traded obsidian along river, road and sea routes (a shrine marks a break in the reef where canoes can pass through) and survived for at least 70 years after the Spanish arrived. It fell because of introduced diseases.</p>
<div id="attachment_4393" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/iguana.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4393" title="iguana" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/iguana.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Iguana clambering for flirty head-bobbing</p></div>
<p>In 2007, the Mexican government bought up privately owned Mayan sites and declared the area a national park. The few hotels and guesthouses located in this new park (ours included) are now the subject of closure orders and there is an ongoing court battle to settle the issue.<a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/rocks.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4394" title="rocks" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/rocks.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="The Mayans traded obsidian by canoes up this coast" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>We spend our time reading, staring into the advertiser&#8217;s perfect turquoise sea, bracing against sandblasting winds and enjoying the golden sun on our pale skin. Michelle returns home, leaving me a brick of a book &#8211; the perfect traveller&#8217;s present. And I prepare myself also for the comforts and entertainments of a Western metropolis, its speed and its anger and hostility, its wonderful anonymity but also (and in all senses) its coldness.</p>
<div id="attachment_4395" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/us-onbeach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4395" title="us onbeach" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/us-onbeach.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nick works out the self-timer on his camera</p></div>
<p>What a great adventure it&#8217;s been, these past 27 months and 2 weeks! What a lot of the world we&#8217;ve seen &#8211; 37 countries! &#8211; but what a great, great part we have still to see.</p>
<div id="attachment_4396" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ourhut.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4396" title="ourhut" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ourhut.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our stick and thatch beach home</p></div>
<p>It is time to go back &#8211; Nick knows this more than I, but my other travelling companion, my backpack, is also telling me. Over the last couple of weeks, one by one, my well-worn possessions have given up the fight as though they know their use is coming to an end: my t-shirts have become too raggedy to wear in public, my handbag has split so that it can&#8217;t be resewed, my knickers have holes, my scarf is lost, my hat string has broken and my much-scratched sunglasses snapped today&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_4397" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ourbeach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4397" title="ourbeach" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ourbeach.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our &#039;private&#039; little beach</p></div>
<p>Nick has been ready to return for a while, his bags are already packed in excitement, but for me it&#8217;s more difficult. To travel for this long, to live as a wanderer from a bag, from bed to bed, village to village, bus to bus, to rely on the hospitality and kindness of people we meet transiently and can never repay, is humbling and utterly exhilarating.</p>
<div id="attachment_4398" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/swinbed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4398" title="swinbed" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/swinbed.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the hanging swing-bed in our hut</p></div>
<p>The journey has taught me much. Before we set off, I&#8217;m ashamed to say that I even took a certain pride in my cynicism and hardness &#8211; after all, what decent journalist isn&#8217;t so equipped? &#8211; but having my cynicism met so often by open kindness, generosity and a &#8216;naïve&#8217; eagerness to help is rather like wearing armour to a beach party &#8211; inappropriate, to say the least.</p>
<div id="attachment_4401" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/chairs.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4401" title="chairs" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/chairs.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me and Nick go through our favourite memories from the trip</p></div>
<p>We have visited the most desperate slums, the poorest people &#8211; some of whom are literally starving &#8211; stayed in dodgy, grubby places with no security, and yet, despite our obvious wealth, nothing has been stolen from us, we have never been physically threatened or robbed. People have responded to their duty of hospitality and made us feel safe and welcomed.</p>
<div id="attachment_4399" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sunrise.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4399" title="sunrise" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sunrise.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise over the Caribbean in Tulum</p></div>
<p>Not that I&#8217;m now completely uncynical, only that now it&#8217;s not a forefront impulse when meeting strangers, even if it remains at the fore when dealing with governments and other bureaucracies. Every new friend we&#8217;ve made has opened a new place in my heart that turns out not to be as  full-up as I thought.</p>
<div id="attachment_4400" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 225px"><a href="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/favebeachcafe.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4400" title="favebeachcafe" src="http://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/favebeachcafe.jpg?w=215&#038;h=300" alt="" width="215" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the terrace of our favourite beach café</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot of other things, too, during this journey, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The poorest people are often the most generous</li>
<li>The world&#8217;s best breakfast is in south India: masala dosa</li>
<li>The best coffee is in Ethiopia</li>
<li>Every tribe has its own greeting method, from the Indian head-wiggle to the Guatemalan edge of hand-to-forehead &#8211; learning it makes you instant friends</li>
<li>But a smile is universal</li>
<li>The best fruit selection in in Amazonia (Columbia and Brazil)</li>
<li>The most consciously sexy are in Rio</li>
<li>The best place for an ordinary person to get a taste of filmstar celebrity is Bangladesh</li>
<li>The dandiest men are the Samburu tribe of northern Kenya</li>
<li>The best food is found at local eating holes, not tourist restaurants EXCEPT in east and central Africa, where foreign restaurants often provide the only decent meals and are wonderfully lacking in ugali</li>
<li>The best place to get laundry done is India</li>
<li>And the worst place to get laundry done is India</li>
<li>Best mangostines (my favourite fruit) are in Indonesia</li>
<li>There are always more stray dogs than seems possible and they start their barking just as you fall asleep</li>
<li>The worst driving is in Bangladesh</li>
<li>Tropical deserts get much colder than you&#8217;d imagine</li>
<li>There is no one cockier and more nimble than a developing-world bus-boy</li>
<li>Bed bugs haunt even the nicer hotels</li>
<li>Water purification tablets are your friend</li>
<li>Carrying cipro can bring a swift end to runnybum episodes</li>
<li>Always add at least 1 hour to all quoted journey times</li>
<li>NEVER try to outstare an Indian (you will lose)</li>
<li>Choosing your bus seat according to the sun&#8217;s passage can make for a shadier, cooler journey</li>
<li>An African bus-boy can fit in 6 times as many passengers than there are seats</li>
<li>Different societies have very different concepts of time and distance</li>
<li>Always carry emergency biscuits/fruit and water</li>
<li>Bolivians love a good strike almost as much as the French</li>
<li>People can and do carry impossible loads despite the laws of physics</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a religion, invent one</li>
<li>Likewise a spouse and children, if you are over the age of 25</li>
<li>Most of the world has black hair. People are very interested in other-colour hair</li>
<li>Travelling puts a lot of dirt under the fingernails</li>
<li>Speaking even a few words of someone&#8217;s language makes you a quick friend</li>
<li>A little (or lot) of brown-nosing at borders and embassies can smooth a difficult passage</li>
<li>Never start a conversation without the appropriate greeting first &#8211; it&#8217;s like shouting at an Englishman in German</li>
<li>The idea of travelling is alien to most people &#8211; they may feel sorry for you</li>
<li>Scorpions can appear from nowhere</li>
<li>You can never have too much patience</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t let a simple misunderstanding/miscommunication turn into an argument</li>
<li>Avoid shaming someone in their own country</li>
<li>Hot water is often just a concept hoteliers dream up but rarely a reality</li>
<li>Remember to charge your torch battery when it&#8217;s light outside</li>
<li>People are all the same and everyone is different</li>
<li>The world is a fantastically, fascinatingly big place</li>
</ul>
<p>Oops, too many already, I&#8217;ll stop here!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong><em>by Roger White</em></p>
<p><a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/weeee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-398" title="Weeee!" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/weeee.jpg?w=105&#038;h=150" alt="" width="105" height="150" /></a>Spring break was winding down and nothing of major importance in the house had been destroyed, the trees in our front yard had remained free of toilet paper, the police had not been called all week to my knowledge, and no one near and dear to me had been injured, died, gotten pregnant, or been hauled to the slammer, so as a reward the wife and I decided to take our lovely daughter and a friend of hers to the nearest Six Flags amusement park. Sweet Jehoshaphat, what a knucklehead idea that was.</p>
<p>First off, it was the last official weekday of spring break. And it is common knowledge that every set of parents in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and some regions of Guatemala clings to the belief that a weekday at a major amusement park will be considerably less crowded than a weekend day. We all truly think that we’re the crafty ones and will outsmart all those dimwits who go to the park on a Saturday or Sunday. Hence, everyone piles into the park on that final Friday, making the Six Flags experience not unlike rush hour on a Shanghai subway.</p>
<p>Using this reasoning, I would bet good money that the park is largely abandoned on any given Saturday. But don’t quote me on that.</p>
<p><a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/this-is-fun.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-399" title="Massive Crowd on Beach at Coney Island" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/this-is-fun.jpg?w=150&#038;h=117" alt="" width="150" height="117" /></a>Anyway, we elbowed our way in after almost an hour at the front gate only to find that waiting time for 99.38 percent of the rides was approximately three weeks. Additionally, lines for the bathrooms, concession stands, souvenir shops, park benches, first-aid stations, oxygen tents, and suicide counselors stretched from west San Antonio to one block from the Alamo. Just about the time we realized this, we body-surfed the crowd to a place called the Flash Pass Booth.</p>
<p>Are you aware of what’s transpiring at your friendly amusement park these days? For a fee—and I mean a big, fat fee—you can essentially pay to cut in line. And yes, the line to buy one of these legal cheating devices was down the hall, around the block, and straight on ’til morning. I fully expect within the next year or so that the corporate minds at Six Flags will open another booth at which you may purchase a Flash Pass to cut in line at the Flash Pass Booth. And so on.</p>
<p>Get this, they even have levels of cheating. A Standard Flash Pass is not much better than the common rabble. With a Gold Pass, you move darn close to the front of the line. Platinum—well, you’re practically Charlie Sheen here. You can ride twice in a row, kick dirt in the face of one schmuck of your choice still waiting in line, and get your shoes shined while you ride. I predict the eventuality of the Michael Jackson Pass or some such, wherein you own the damn park and can tell everyone to get lost. This pass, of course, will cost you approximately the Gross National Product of Great Britain.</p>
<p>The whole concept sickened me—almost to the point where we didn’t get one.</p>
<p>For a good chunk of our daughter’s college fund, we were given a handheld doodad that looked something like a blood-pressure monitor. In fact, it would be a good idea if this thing could double as one. Mind you, the wife and I passed on the Flash Pass; however, we didn’t want our daughter’s last official weekday of spring break to be spent standing in one spot in the hot sun for countless hours—which is basically what prisoners of war undergo. So off Lindsey and her friend went, happily cutting in line with the full consent and gratitude of park authorities. A democracy this wasn’t.</p>
<p>Now, it’s important that I mention here that to ensure that we didn’t run off with their precious Flash Pass device, the smiling Six Flags people held my driver’s license for the duration of our visit. Why is this important? Because lo and behold, after a nerve-wracking afternoon working our way through a jam of humanity more bunched together and hostile than a South American soccer match, my wife and I decided it was time for a nice, cold adult beverage. Ahh.</p>
<p><a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/catch-22.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-401" title="Catch 22" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/catch-22.jpg?w=100&#038;h=150" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>So, then we stood in line for a half-hour at the nice, cold adult beverage stand—only to discover that to purchase a nice, cold adult beverage, you MUST HAVE YOUR I.D. No exceptions. Not even for the Flash Pass doodad, which you leveraged your daughter’s future against to purchase in the first place. Plus I haven’t been carded since the Nixon Administration! Are you getting the picture of our day at the Disneyland of the Great Southwest?</p>
<p>After a short interim of choice, creative words at various decibel levels, I marched to our car (parked near the Alamo) to retrieve my wife’s I.D. Then and only then, after another 45 minutes at yet another libation station, did we get to sit down in the shade (night was falling by now), my wife with a luscious margarita, and me with a $9.50 Budweiser. At this point, price was no object. I would have sold my mother for a beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/must-have-beer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-402" title="Must. Have. Beer." src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/must-have-beer.jpg?w=150&#038;h=120" alt="" width="150" height="120" /></a>And now the topper. Just as we toasted one another with a long, heavy sigh, our daughter joined us, and in her exuberance, promptly spilled my wife’s frozen concoction all over the table. Oh well, there’s always Schlitterbahn.</p>

<p>Science is frequently too serious. All this stuff about a rigorous scientific method, uncertainty, facts and figures doesn&#8217;t leave too much room for fun. Since I&#8217;ve been so terrible at posting updates recently, I thought I&#8217;d post something a little lighthearted. So, basically I decided to trawl through the interweb to find some science-related videos that have made me laugh over the years. Here they are&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Look Around You &#8211; a wonderful, wonderful programme that spoofed those terrible 80s science videos we were forced to watch at school. All are amazing, but one of my favourites is the one on Water:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="306"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/e/bCWA7uevo_Q"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/e/bCWA7uevo_Q" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="306" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>2. Ali G talks to some experts about science and technology:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/e/eB5VXJXxnNU"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/e/eB5VXJXxnNU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>3. Carl Sagan keeping it real with his Science Symphony:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/e/zSgiXGELjbc"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/e/zSgiXGELjbc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>4. The Diet Coke &amp; Mentos experiment:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/e/hKoB0MHVBvM"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/e/hKoB0MHVBvM" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>5. And finally, some crazy Japanese people made some GIANT dinosaur robots:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever saved your money for what felt like <strong>forever and a day </strong>and bought something that struck you as exquisite and extraordinary? I&#8217;m not talking about gigantic purchases, either&#8211; like houses or yachts or Ferraris&#8211; I just mean basic, everyday things like a laptop, new glasses, or (in my case) a kick ass blender. Yes? No?</p>
<div id="attachment_1976" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9287.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976" title="DSCN9287" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9287.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vitamix Blenders: Sweet dreams are made of these!</p></div>
<p>When I still worked at the Office Job, I had an automatic savings plan set up <em>specifically </em>for this fantasy blender of mine. <em></em>Every paycheque, a small amount of money would be skimmed off the top and squirreled away into the &#8220;Vitamix&#8221; savings account. It took a long time to accumulate enough <em>dinero </em>for this blender, because they definitely aren&#8217;t cheap, but I did it and the Vitamix was finally mine! Come to mommy, little blender! The problem was, by the time I finally got my blender, I was too afraid to even use it, lest I blow the motor or otherwise ruin my Expensive Purchase right away. Totally. Defeating. The purpose.</p>
<p>I confess: Up until very recently, I had only used my Vitamix to make what amounted to two <em>very expensive </em>batches of Peach Bellinis. (So much for all those healthy Green Smoothies I had originally envisioned! <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) I am a somewhat rational being, however, so I buckled down the other day and resolved to learn more about this Magical Blending Machine. I know that a Vitamix can perform virtual wizardry in the kitchen&#8211; nut butters! soups! bread dough! freshly milled flour! regular ol&#8217; smoothies! delicious frozen cocktails!&#8211; and I figured that my reluctance to dabble in this black magic stemmed solely from my lack of practice in pushing the &#8216;On&#8217; button. (Really, could it get any easier than &#8216;On&#8217;?) Time to break in my Vitamix, baby.</p>
<p>The first task I assigned for myself was to make almond milk for our tea lattés. (I know, I know&#8211; what a hippy-dippy mission for a bunch of boho punks!! Bear with me.) Marty normally takes rice milk in his morning coffee, and I drink my herbal teas straight&#8211; like the tough-as-nails badass I truly am&#8211; but both of us enjoy some vanilla almond milk in the occasional tea latté. (Speaking of which: if you have a <a href="http://www.teaopia.ca/" target="_blank">Teopia</a> store near you, <strong>totally </strong>get some Coco Caramel Rooibos tea and make an almond milk latté with it. Or order that tea online. It is to die for.) I figured homemade almond milk was worth a try, and I even found an <a href="http://www.kimberlysnyder.net/blog/2008/06/06/megan%E2%80%99s-almondbrazil-nut-milk/" target="_blank">encouraging recipe</a> that said making almond milk from scratch was &#8220;easy&#8221;. What was there to lose?</p>
<p>It started out simply enough. I procured a cup of raw (not roasted) almonds and soaked them in a bowl of filtered water for about 8 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9259.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1977" title="DSCN9259" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9259.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The almonds softened and swelled up to nearly double their original size.</p>
<div id="attachment_1978" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9289.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1978" title="DSCN9289" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9289.jpg?w=500&#038;h=304" alt="" width="500" height="304" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The almond on the top was soaked</p></div>
<p>After they had soaked for a nice, long time (8 hours or overnight&#8211; whatever works for you), I rinsed them thoroughly and plopped them into my Vitamix with 3 cups of water. (The recipe calls for 3-6 cups of water, but I decided to go with the thickest option for my first go-round.)</p>
<p><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9292.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1979" title="DSCN9292" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9292.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>A quick flick of the &#8216;On&#8217; switch and about 20 seconds of high-speed whirring later, I had a frothy blend of&#8230; um&#8230; almonds and water.</p>
<p><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9296.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980" title="DSCN9296" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9296.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The next step was to strain this mixture through a cheesecloth into a new container, so I could separate the curds from the whey, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Enter my first error. </strong>If you ever decide to make your own almond milk in the future, <strong>do not </strong>pull your cheesecloth taut over the opening of a pitcher and hold it into place with an elastic band (like I did in the very top photo). This will leave your cheesecloth flush with the brim of your container, and the almond mixture will spill over the sides of the pitcher in about .001 seconds, leaving you with a goopy mess of runny almond paste to clean up. <strong>Don&#8217;t do it!</strong></p>
<p><strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1981" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><strong><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9299.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981" title="DSCN9299" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9299.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">Boo! Hiss!</p></div>
<p></strong>Attempt #2 at straining almond milk: I rescued as much of my almond mixture as I could and cut a new piece of cheesecloth. Thinking I had outsmarted those sneaky, dripping almonds, I lined the inside of a large plastic funnel with the cheesecloth and placed the funnel at the top of my pitcher. Then I poured in my blended almonds.</p>
<div id="attachment_1982" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9297.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982 " title="DSCN9297" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9297.jpg?w=400&#038;h=533" alt="" width="400" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can barely see it, but my funnel is propped inside the pitcher. You CAN see the thinnest-of-thin stream of almond milk dripping down from the funnel.</p></div>
<p><strong>Enter my second error. </strong>Trying to strain a bunch of blended almonds through a cheesecloth <em>and </em>a funnel requires patience. Lots of it. Filtered almond milk dripped from the bottom of my funnel at a <strong>painfully slow rate</strong>, which I guess makes sense when you think about it: Lots of almonds + Cheesecloth + A funnel with a small hole = Not a lot can get through all at once. I win basic physics! Or not.</p>
<p>I tried to expedite the process by giving my cheesecloth a little squeeze. This was not a fabulous idea and was actually my <strong>third error</strong>. I didn&#8217;t really secure any loose corners of the cheesecloth when I did this, so almond mixture oozed out over the sides of my cheesecloth and down into my funnel. Globs of almond grits then fell into the filtered almond milk before I could prevent it from happening, meaning that I had to start the process all over again. (Again.)</p>
<p>Ahem. Attempt #3 at straining my stupid almond milk: I lined the inside of a wire-mesh sieve with a new piece of cheesecloth. My sieve didn&#8217;t fit into the mouth of my pitcher (at all), so I had to play a little balancing game with it using one hand and pour my almond mixture into the sieve with my other hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_1983" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9298.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983" title="DSCN9298" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9298.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nice fit FAIL. The rubber handle on the sieve is relatively heavy, so it kept slipping down to the right hand side and causing general straining mayhem.</p></div>
<p>Using the sieve would have been the winning strategy if I had chosen a container with a wider mouth to rest beneath it. As it stood, straining the milk was STILL awkward because I insisted on catching the filtered milk with my cheap-ass, narrow-mouthed plastic pitcher. Heh. If you decide to make almond milk in the future, line a sieve with a cheesecloth and then just use a mixing bowl to catch your filtered milk! You can always put the milk into a pitcher <strong>afterward</strong>. (*She says, completely after the fact.*)</p>
<p>Things got easier after I squeezed the last few drops of almond milk out of the cheesecloth (and managed to avoid simultaneously squeezing almond meal into the precious filtered liquid). I rinsed my Vitamix container, poured the filtered almond milk into it, and added 1/4 cup of pitted dates, 1 Tbsp coconut butter, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. (The recipe also called for 1 Tbsp of lecithin granules, but honestly: who has lecithin just lying around? Not even I do, and I believe that says something. I left the lecithin out.) <em>Whir </em>went my Vitamix at high speed, and voila! I had a pitcher half-filled with homemade almond milk.</p>
<p>This morning was the true test. I checked on my almond milk in the fridge while I was making breakfast, and I was disappointed (but not surprised) to see that it had separated out into three distinct layers. (That is where the lecithin would have come in handy.) Not to worry. I just shook it up and added it to my Honey Chai Tea anyway after breakfast. Some stray almond grits instantly floated to the top of my cup, making it look like I had added curdled cream to my tea, but the milk actually tasted really good. I enjoyed the thicker consistency of the milk and felt proud of myself for making this &#8220;easy&#8221; recipe from scratch!</p>
<div id="attachment_1984" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9302.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984" title="DSCN9302" src="http://zonapellucida.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn9302.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The saddest/grossest looking cup of chai you&#039;ll ever see. I sprinkled some cinnamon on top, and then the mystery almond meal floating at the surface looked more deliberate. Heh. Despite its sketchy appearance, the tea and milk tasted really great. I swear!</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ll most likely attempt this almond milk recipe again, and when I do&#8211; I&#8217;ll be sure to use a mixing bowl underneath my sieve for straining purposes. I&#8217;ll also add a tiny bit less vanilla, because (as much as I love me some bourbon vanilla extract), I practically got drunk off of it when I had a few tablespoons of almond milk in my chai latté. Even 1tsp was a lot of vanilla!</p>
<p>My next Vitamix task will be to tackle some sort of flour: oat, rye, or maybe buckwheat flour for pancakes. I bought both a &#8216;wet&#8217; and a &#8216;dry&#8217; container for my Vitamix, so I&#8217;m really curious to see what this baby can do with some ordinary rye kernels!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I apologize for the delay. It&#8217;s been a crazy week. So, here I am, back from California, definitely a great place to spend a spring break. I didn&#8217;t have much time over there so I concentrated mostly on San Francisco alone, with a short trip a little north of the Golden Gate Bridge to the Muir Woods National Monument to see some of the tallest trees on Earth.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 343px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520776080/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img title="Golden Gate Bridge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5520776080_7003eefe4a.jpg" alt="The Golden Gate bridge in the Mist" width="333" height="500" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Foggy Golden Gate Bridge</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I have to say I was pretty impressed with the height of the trees. The Redwoods, of course, but also just in general. Our trees aren&#8217;t that tall on the east coast. The funniest sight (for me) was to see palm trees in backyards, because that was the moment I truly realized where I was.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 342px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520181787/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img title="Muir Woods" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5520181787_f6e74d76bc.jpg" alt="Muir Woods" width="332" height="500" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Muir Woods</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">One thing I loved about traveling at that time of the year is that everybody is somewhere in the south, like Cuba, Panama or Costa Rica and so the city is less crowded by tourists. That way, you can really appreciate the city in it&#8217;s day-to-day life with little interference from the tourists.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 342px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520777270/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class=" " title="Ferry Building" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5254/5520777270_66e8092f1b.jpg" alt="Ferry Building" width="332" height="500" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Local Produce Market At The Ferry Building</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">San Francisco is truly a colorful city. Literally. The houses are painted in so many shades of color: from magenta to yellow, but also in baby blue or in bright pink, sometimes even all those on the same front porch. But not only that, the people are also colorful in so many ways. Maybe a little crazy.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520184973/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class=" " title="Haight-Ashbury" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5520184973_1ec464e69d.jpg" alt="Haight-Ashbury" width="500" height="332" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Sample of the Houses in Haight-Ashbury</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It&#8217;s so beautiful in the distance too.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520777696/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class=" " title="Filbert Street" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5139/5520777696_bc4741840f.jpg" alt="Filbert Street" width="500" height="332" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On Top of Filbert Street</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">But then, as you can plainly notice from the last picture, San Francisco is also a city of many, many hills. For a person that truly enjoys walking around a city like me, it has both a positive and a negative side. Of course, walking up hills is fun and often rewarded with a great view, but even as much as I enjoy walking up and down, my knees don&#8217;t like it so much and after a day of walking, my feet are truly tired.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/5520777982/in/set-72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class=" " title="Lombard Street" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5179/5520777982_a81ba11a54.jpg" alt="Lombard Street" width="500" height="332" /></span></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lombard Street</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Nevertheless, as much as I loved the city, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like San Francisco could never be my home. It was fun to be there the time it lasted. But just as I felt before for Ottawa, for Boston and after, for Paris, I can&#8217;t live there. The only city I have traveled to and in which I could see myself living is Edinburgh in Scotland.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">That&#8217;s why I keep traveling whenever I can. I want to keep discovering the world and find which culture is the closest to my heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In the meantime, here are a few of my favorite pictures I took in San Francisco. For more, you can see my Flickr </span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurabgauvin/sets/72157626126328521/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">here</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

<p>My calendar tells me it is Spring.  It seems as though the sun is taking longer to set every day now.  We had a couple (teasing) days of beautiful 60+ degree weather last week.  There are even some flowers starting to poke up in our very dead looking garden. All signs point to Spring.</p>
<p>Except when I look at the forecast and I see snow.  Not cool, Mother Nature.  Not cool&#8230; They are calling for just a couple inches, but still&#8230; I&#8217;m so over snow.  I know that I need to remember that it is still March in New England, but after 80 inches of snow, I just want to put Winter in the past, at least for another 9 months.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of Polaroid cameras lying around my house unused for quite some time now. As with anything I have sitting around, I have the intent of using it&#8230; eventually. I had no idea if these cameras worked, nor did I know much about the nuances of each particular camera considering I just blindly purchased them from Goodwill over a year ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626272319366/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Polaroids" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5066/5554179034_1b1141beab_o.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>Most people wouldn&#8217;t even bother to buy such a thing. They would say it&#8217;s impossible to buy film for such a camera because Polaroid shut down all of its film production several years ago. That is, of course, unless you get lucky and score some film off e-bay, and this, as it turns out, is often hard to find, and it&#8217;s often very, very pricy.</p>
<p>So, aside from being an impulse purchase of an astounding $2.5o for one camera, and $3.00 for the other, why would I buy an out-dated unusable device like this? The short answer: Because they&#8217;re cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that they&#8217;re cool though. You see, film hasn&#8217;t gone out of style. In fact, I&#8217;d wager to say that it&#8217;s even making a comeback. <a href="http://wp.me/p11WDZ-3A">As I wrote last week</a>, there is a push for that &#8220;retro&#8221; look and feel regardless of whether or not the camera is actually film or digital. Even mainstream photographers are going after that &#8220;retro&#8221; look in their digital images. So it is no surprise when I began to dig a little deeper that I found out there <em>is</em> film still being produced for Polaroids.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="impossible project logo" src="http://shop.the-impossible-project.com/img/impossible_logo_s.gif" alt="" width="106" height="18" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com/">The Impossible Project</a> was started just as Polaroid was shutting down their last plant in (don&#8217;t ask me to pronounce this) Enschede, NL. Long story short, they have been preserving the tradition of analoge photography and, in doing so, have provided people the world over with the ability to still use their Polaroid cameras! You can find out more about their history and the film they produce at this <a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com/about/#production">link</a>.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I finally set out to invest in some film from them, and on Monday of this week it arrived. I purchased the <a href="http://shop.the-impossible-project.com/shop/film/spectra/fi_1200_1_softtone_edge">Softtone Edge Cut</a> for my Spectra and the <a href="http://shop.the-impossible-project.com/shop/film/tip_films/fi_sx70_1_px70_push_mum">PX 70 Color Shade Push</a>! for my SX 70 Land Camera. The first thing I did when it got in was to take some pictures to test it out. Using my trusty puppy, Spoon, as my model, I took these first two shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626272319366/"><img class="aligncenter" title="First shots" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5553594151_4a53b36834_b.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As you can see, the results were mixed. The Px 70 (left) looked cool, but it had a tear on the top of the image (the fine people at Impossible informed me later that this was common due to the thickness of the film and the camera&#8217;s rollers), and Spoon was blurry even with a flash. By contrast the Softtone was in focus, and I liked the color hue a little better on this one&#8230; granted, Spoon&#8217;s eyes were reflecting the harsh flash.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So I quickly realized that &#8220;Instant&#8221; didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;Easy&#8221;&#8230; not to say I followed that mentality as I shot, but that&#8217;s what I learned that day. Part of shooting with new film and a new camera is finding its limitations. This can be done a number of ways, but I prefer good old &#8220;trial and error&#8221; as my way of determining what will create a good shot and what will create a crappy shot. One thing I didn&#8217;t learn until I was on my last shot with the SX 70 was that the film ISO rating was ISO100&#8230; which makes total sense when you look at the images I captured (i.e. dense images that look &#8220;under exposed&#8221; without good lighting), but I wish I would have known that going into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The fun thing about mistakes with Polaroids, is you can find creative ways to capitalize on your errors, such as &#8220;<a href="http://shop.the-impossible-project.com/allabout/colorshade/">peeling</a>&#8221; the images. This is what I did with that blurry image of Spoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626330538630/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Peel" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5553198699_6c10187ba8_b.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;and that&#8217;s just a start. The other two peels I did were not quite as good, but they&#8217;re worth a look just out of the fact that they&#8217;re peels&#8230; and it&#8217;s cool!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m learning a lot. It&#8217;s a challenge to determine even at what distance an image will develop and how that image will come out when shooting in different lighting. Through the magic of the internet I discovered that my SX70 should be betwen &#8220;4-10 feet away from the subject&#8221; And, try as I might to repeat to myself that this is what I should do, I didn&#8217;t listen. So I made mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Mistakes with film are more costly than a mistake made with a digital camera where you can go, &#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ll just delete this and take it again!&#8221; As with any film, I may only have one chance to get an image that I want. However, unlike most films I can go and buy within 24 hours at a low cost, this film costs much more and requires me to pay international shipping charges (it came from the Europe!). That said, there may still be some advantages to waiting 3-10 days versus waiting 2-24 hours. Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here&#8217;s my math:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polaroid: Each shot costs me $3.78 ($68 for film + shipping/18 exposures)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s it for Polaroid&#8230; on the other hand with film&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>120mm B&amp;W Kodak film: $0.28 per exposure ($4.50 per roll, 16 exposures)</li>
<li> Add in development costs and you&#8217;re looking at about an extra $1.87 for a total of $2.15, which is still cheaper than a Polaroid!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s add in the fact that Time = $$$$ and that the hourly rate = minimum wage ($7.25), and keeping in mind this is for one roll (development through digital processing):</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Minutes of prep time</li>
<li>5 Minutes fooling with film in complete darkness trying to get it on a spool and off its film roll while removing tape from the&#8230; &#8216;doh! I dropped it! &#8230;from the reel.</li>
<li>20 Minutes of development</li>
<li>10 Minutes wash, hanging, and general cleanup</li>
<li>2 Hours (120 Minutes) dry time</li>
<li>5 Minutes separating images with scissors for scanning</li>
<li>20 minutes scanning</li>
<li>1 hour digital development for all images</li>
<li>Total Elapsed Time: 4.25 Hours ($30.81 total, additional $1.93 per image)</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we have an additional $1.93 per image for a total $4.08. And this is for a process that takes 4.25 HOURS (minimum) to complete as opposed to 4 minutes! This isn&#8217;t even taking into account what would happen if you print your film images versus scanning&#8230; Even as I type all this I realize that the point I was trying to make was moot once I added in development for film. Looking at it this way, the only real advantage with other analog films is that it&#8217;s easier to acquire.</p>
<p>This is exactly what made Polaroids so popular the first time around. You could capture an image and develop it instantly, saving you wait time and money. It&#8217;s funny then that over 60 years later we&#8217;re still in the same boat when it comes to Polaroid versus film&#8230; and in writing this I think I may have convinced myself to buy more film (go me!).</p>
<p>Now that my rabbit trail rambling is over, I think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VePxbFQ-qfw">Ron Burgundy said it best when he said&#8230; </a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s onward and upward to more of the good images. I&#8217;m falling in love with the Softtone for my Spectra. The color hue is very &#8220;yellow&#8221; but it picks up blues and reds quite well. I&#8217;m still working to get some of those images up, and I&#8217;ll make sure to update you all when I get more colorful versions of the Softtone posted. For now, take a gander at some of these:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626205328669/with/5552188012/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Out Of Service Station" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5551597969_a35f79d048_b.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="614" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626330538630/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Grazing At A Distance" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5552192582_b40944526b_b.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="614" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626205328669/with/5552188012/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Skyline" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5552188012_1397d62770_b.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="614" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christopholies/sets/72157626330538630/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Bahar" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5296/5551607649_51e85a7a35_b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="614" /></a></p>
<p>And, last, but certainly not least, the Impossible Project is doing this really cool cover thing for their PX70 films. If you order one, you&#8217;ll get a custom printed darkslide (that first piece of cardboard that ejects when you insert the film properly) like the one I got below. Honestly, this was the icing on the cake while unwrapping this film. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I pictured being a mom, I realized that it would be necessary to have rules of conduct for my child.  That being said, after over 6 years of being a mom, I have compiled a list of rules I never expected to need:</p>
<p>Do not cut the screen out of its frame in the window.  (The need for this one arose when she was 6.)</p>
<p>Do not put anything in your ear, including rocks, without consulting an adult first.  (Age 4.)</p>
<p>Do not put anything in your nose, including wooden sticks, without consulting an adult first.   (Age 4)</p>
<p>Which led to:  Do not put anything in any body part for any reason unless a parent says it is okay, with the exception of food or drink in your mouth.</p>
<p>Do not cook eggs on the stove without a parent&#8217;s presence and permission.   (About age 7:  this one is harder to justify because the one time that she did cook the eggs by herself, she did a good job and remembered to turn the stove off, which is more than I do sometimes!)</p>
<p>Do not try to pierce your ears with the end of a paper clip, even if it looks like an earring hole is there.  (Age 6 and 7).</p>
<p>The controls on the dashboard in the car,  including the radio, are MINE!  Please leave them alone.  (This has been a running battle ever since she was old enough to ride in the front without a car seat.)</p>
<p>Do not drag a dog into the bathtub with you.   (Age 6).</p>
<p>Do not dump the entire bottle of shampoo in the tub to use as bubble bath.  (Ages 6 through 8).</p>
<p>Do not dump the entire bottle of liquid soap from the sink in the tub to use as bubble bath.   (Ages 6 through 8).</p>
<p>Do not dump the entire bottle of conditioner in the tub for reasons I have yet to understand.   (Ages 6 through 8).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a good idea, either, to dump all of the bathroom dixie cups in the bathroom sink and then fill it up with water.  (Age 6, but she had help from a visiting 4 year old.)</p>
<p>Do not wash your hair with conditioner only.  (Age 8 through 9).</p>
<p>Soap <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> required for a bath to really be a bath.  (Age 5).</p>
<p>And, last but not least,</p>
<p>Paper is not a proper treat to give a dog.  (Age 9).  (Darwin and Mandy liked it  but at least Tyra was smart enough to say no.  I guess I should be grateful Kayla didn&#8217;t decide to hand out socks for all!)</p>
<p>Have a good day everyone!</p>
<p>Nancy</p>
