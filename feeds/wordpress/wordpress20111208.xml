<p>We were getting ready to go to school one cold Tuesday morning. We had the radio on, which was on most mornings. Beatle songs were playing. I think it was my Mum who said it first, “John Lennon’s been shot”.  It was 9th December 1980. I was nearly 10. I listened in for details. Was he going to be ok? What had happened? John had been in the news recently anyway as he’d just released a new LP and single after being hidden away for five years.</p>
<p>Then it was made clear. He was gone. My eyes welled up. I’d been a bit choked when Elvis had died three years earlier, but that was more of just picking up on the cultural feel that was around and watching the news. This was personal. I didn’t want to go to school. It didn’t seem right. Especially as they were playing non-stop Beatles and John’s tunes all day on the radio.</p>
<p>So I went to school on that cold and damp day, depressed and sad, with the tune of Woman playing in my head, thinking about Sean Lennon who was five years younger than me and wondered what he must be thinking.</p>
<p>In 1979 Beatlemania gripped me and my mates as the BBC broadcasted all the Beatles films: A Hard Days Night, footage of the Washington gig in 1964, the 1965 Shea Stadium concert, Help!, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine and Let it Be. (This was the last showing to date for Shea Stadium and Let it Be.) It was amazing. My friend Sean and I formed a band, calling it the Bronze Beatles. I had got a guitar the previous Christmas but couldn’t play yet and we made a drum kit from chocolate boxes, drew guitars and sang songs from Help! (Sean’s Dad had the LP). I wanted nothing more than to be a Beatle and live in Help!</p>
<p>That Christmas my brother and I got a tape recorder for Christmas. We had two blank tapes. I filled them up by recording my dad’s Beatle LPs and singles by placing the take recorder as close to the record player’s speaker as possible and telling my brother to be quiet.</p>
<p>In January 1980 my Mum and Dad hosted a Burns night super. My Dad had got some Highland music records and he wanted them on cassette tape to play in the stereo system they’d borrowed. He had to tape over my copy of Help! It would be five years later later before I’d saved up enough money to buy my own vinyl copy. But my Dad got me a tape of the Beatles Rock ‘n’ Roll Music volume two to make up for it which gave me some new songs I’d never heard before such as I’m Down, Any Time at All and the brilliant Hey Bulldog.</p>
<p>Up until then I’d only had access to a few Beatles tunes. My Dad had three Beatle LPs and I inherited (or rather, I sneaked out of his collection and into mine). There was <em>Beatles for Sale</em> (their 4th LP from late 1964), <em>With the Beatles</em>, their 2nd LP, from 1963 and <em>Revolver</em>, their 7th, from 1966. He also had the EP <em>Twist and Shout</em> which contained four songs stripped away from their first LP, <em>Please Please Me</em> and the singles <em>She Loves You, I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> and <em>Day Tripper/We Can Work it Out.</em></p>
<p>My Dad had a Bush single speaker mono record player. It played 45s, 33&amp;1/3s and 78 rpm records. You could stack up a few singles on the spindle and it would play one and then another would drop into place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aydinstone.com/john68-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="John Lennon 1968" src="http://www.aydinstone.com/john68-1.jpg" alt="John Lennon 1968 by Ayd Instone" width="240" height="251" /></a>I discovered the record player at a very early age and rifled through my Dad’s collection of records. He had a handful of singles, most from the early sixties. Quite a few LPs, mostly Johnny Mathis, Herb Albert, the odd Sinatra and Dylan plus a bit of classical. I ignored all these. I was drawn to those four faces that stared out at me from the gatefold cover of <em>Beatles for Sale</em>. I knew that they were the same faces as those on With the Beatles. I found out they were called John, Paul, George and Ringo, but there was nothing on the sleeve to say which was which so I had to guess. My mind worked out that since they looked younger on With the Beatles and that it was in black and white, it must be the first album, perhaps preceded by <em>Twist and Shout</em> &#8211; also in black and white, but smaller. Then must come <em>Beatles for Sale</em> because that was in colour and a gatefold. But what about <em>Revolver</em>? That was in black and white but looked quite odd. The music was slightly different too. It was 1973. I was nearly 3. I surmised that <em>With the Beatles</em> was the past, <em>Beatles for Sale</em> was the present and <em>Revolver</em> was from the future.</p>
<p>An earlier thought I had about the Beatles was that my Dad was John Lennon. The evidence was the photo on <em>Twist and Shout</em> looked just like him and the message of <em>We Can Work it Out</em>  I felt expressed he ethos of my Dad. That was obviously a short lived theory.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until around 1976 that I found out that the Beatles weren’t still together. The re-issue singles were in the chart, as was Lennon’s solo <em>Stand By Me</em> and <em>Imagine</em> singles. From that point, like every other Beatle fan in the world, I’d been hoping and longing for that reunion.</p>
<p>Years later we learnt that John had planned to visit the UK in early 1981 and the four Beatles had agreed upon a reunion recording, perhaps a performance too, that year and had sworn secrecy on the details. All hope was dashed with the news on that December day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aydinstone.com/john65.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="John Lennon 1965" src="http://www.aydinstone.com/john65.jpg" alt="John Lennon 1965 by Ayd Instone" width="120" height="165" /></a>I’ve read loads of accounts of the Beatles and their lives in the hundreds of books published on the topic. There is a strange feeling reading the details of that fateful day, about John’s sessions at the Record Plant studio, of the killer’s meeting with Lennon earlier in the day where he signed a copy of <em>Double Fantasy</em> (there’s a photo of the two of them together). As I read the details and it all becomes more and more real I start to feel as though I can change the outcome somehow, as if the history of has not been decided. I meet John outside the recording studio and urge him not to go home straight away that night, then I wait near the Dakota building as dusk falls and spot the killer, tackle him, call the police, anything.</p>
<p>But history doesn’t work like that. It felt as though there was so much more of the Beatles story to tell, so much more songs to come. As it must be the same as with anyone who loses someone, anyone, it feels as though we’re cheated by being given an alternative, grimmer history that the one we were promised. People older than me have said that the Sixties finally ended that day and the dreams of their youth were over. You can mourn a man you never met if what he stood for was an important personal idea. It was that idea that died that night.</p>
<p>Some people say the Beatles, and Lennon, aren’t important. They’re wrong. Derek Taylor described them as ‘the 20th Century’s greatest romance’ and he’s right. We still don’t know why or how it all happened, but it did, and for a short while, many, many people in the world shared something. It represented probably the last great collective memory, a potent beam of optimism, hope and fun, that touched so many lives in so many ways.</p>
<p>On 8th December 1980 the world was reminded that we are all mortal, ugly, vicious, spiteful and powerless. But there is still hope. We can still put on a Beatle record and find that the magic is still there, divorced from time and space, separated from the mortal men that created it.</p>
<p>There IS joy to be sought and cherished in life no matter what undesired twists and turns we face.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://abttorres.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/steak-strips-and-mashed-potatoes-photo-by-aileen-torres.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-337" title="Steak strips and mashed potatoes (Photo by Aileen Torres)" src="http://abttorres.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/steak-strips-and-mashed-potatoes-photo-by-aileen-torres.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">For the steak:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">1/2 steak (or a whole one, if you want a larger portion)<br />
1 garlic clove<br />
1/3 large onion<br />
5-7 grape tomatoes<br />
1 chipotle pepper</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Heat up your choice of oil in a medium skillet. Dice the garlic and sauté. Slice the onion into thin strips, and cut the grape tomatoes in half, then caramelize the onions and tomatoes.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Slice the steak into thin strips. Once you see the onions and tomatoes start to brown, add the steak to the skillet. Dice the chipotle and add. Cover the skillet and cook on medium heat for about 20 min. After 10 min., add a dash of red wine.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">For the potatoes:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">3 small red potatoes<br />
2-3 inches of pork belly<br />
1-2 garlic cloves<br />
1/3 large onion<br />
kale<br />
salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Cut the potatoes into quarters and boil them in a small pot. When the potatoes are soft, turn off the heat and mash them.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Dice the garlic and sauté in a large skillet. Slice the onion into thin strips and caramelize.  Slice the pork belly and sauté.  Chop the kale and cook until it wilts, then add the mashed potatoes to the skillet and mix the ingredients thoroughly. Add as much salt and pepper as you like.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Place the mashed potatoes with kale on a plate and shape into a round platform (see photo), then place the steak strips on top. Pour yourself a glass of red wine, and you&#8217;re good. Serves 1.</p>

<p>6. Take pictures wearing a lot of makeup and looking really preppy while simultaneously making a &#8220;hard&#8221; facial expression and holding up what they consider to be a gangster sign. Potential caption: &#8216;Straight thuggin.&#8217;</p>

<p>13. Express their distaste for facebook on facebook and threaten to leave facebook to their facebook friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December 3rd 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written on Day 3 at Velidhoo</strong></p>
<p>A shoal of banner fish glide a few feet away from me. Their striking colours of white and black making geometric patterns in the absolutely clear blue Maldivian waters. I reach out my arm to touch them, but they move away effortlessly. I regret that I&#8217;m only in snorkelling gear and unable to admire the brilliant abundance of sea-life in the depths they live in.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. My diving day will come soon.</em></p>
<p>As a part of <a href="http://www.tinyislandvolunteers.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Island Volunteers, Maldives,</a> we are expected to behave with decorum, and set an example for the island community we are based in. Our mission is marine conservation, but we are also expected to teach English and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Our welcome reception on 1st December on the island of Velidhoo, in the Noonu atoll, left nothing to be desired. Brad Pitt could not have elicited a more pompous ceremony. Our speedboat docked to the sound of loud-speakers and music, school children dressed in their best holding out garlands of sweet-smelling jasmine. Town councillors and other officials all lined up to greet the island&#8217;s first marine conservationists from abroad. Expectations are high but can we live up to it? By &#8220;we&#8221;, I mean Louise, Stefan, Penny and I, all UK volunteers.</p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9" title="The Welcome" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg?w=216&#038;h=300" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10" title="The Welcome 2" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>Getting to this island took all of 2 days from the UK. After a night in Male, Jo (a fellow Tiny Islands volunteer who I teamed up with at Gatwick) and I boarded a speedboat to Naifaru island where she disembarked to join the turtle project there. Another speedboat journey with the other three volunteers finds me on this 2500-populated island with gorgeous yet simple people.</p>
<p>We are put up in a 3 bedroomed house &#8211; perfect for the four of us as Penny and Stefan are a couple. The heat and humidity is made bearable by ceiling fans in every room, but the climate is stuffy and draining. I&#8217;ve settled down to the theory part of my of diving course, but the other three are already experienced divers, particularly Louise. As marine conservationists, we are expected to &#8220;fish-watch&#8221; and this is best done whilst diving at different depths.</p>
<p>The food is mainly Maldivian, with Indian, Chinese and European influence &#8211; it has not been disappointing so far. Incidentally, the restaurant we have our meals in appears to be the favourite meeting place of locals who gather there for coffee and &#8220;faur&#8221; (local snack made from betel leaves, cloves and nuts).</p>
<p>Its our third day, and we have just returned from a day&#8217;s picnic to a little uninhabited island, a reward for our first day&#8217;s hard sessions of snorkelling/diving the day before. Here, we were finally able to shed most of our restrictive clothing &#8211; Maldives as a strict Muslim country frowns on exposure. The reefs around the island are a snorkelers dream; coconuts straight off the tree are fresh and delicious, our fun only shadowed by unrelenting attacks from swarms of mosquitoes.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. Nothing can spoil this gorgeous day.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/on-the-boat-to-picnic-island.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11" title="On the boat to picnic island" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/on-the-boat-to-picnic-island.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15" title="IMG_3046" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Back at Velidhoo, we gather tonight with the heads of various clubs for a meeting to brainstorm on ideas on how to celebrate World Volunteering Day on Monday the 5th of December, ways of getting the whole community involved and becoming more environmentally aware. The local heads are eager and surprisingly full of ideas &#8211; an encouraging sign and positive move forward in the right direction.</p>
<p>I am content and raring to make an impact. The community is poised, full of anticipation, and set to advance thanks to the enlightened work of the <a href="http://www.velidhoofuturefoundation.org/" target="_blank">VFF &#8211; Velidhoo Future Foundation</a> who have teamed up with Tiny Islands and the <a href="http://lazygeckomaldives.com/velidhoo.html" target="_blank">Lazy Gecko Diving</a> Centre to raise standards of living and environmental awareness on the island. Together, we are committed to the goal of helping the town make best use its natural resources &#8211; the sea and the sun &#8211; to the optimal. The island has a beautiful future ahead, and can be an example to the rest of the country.</p>
<p><em>Our work is just beginning.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img title="Teaching is cool" src="http://miketidd.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/thumbs_up.png?w=439&#038;h=400" alt="" width="439" height="400" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘It isn’t what you say that defines you but what you do’ </strong></p>
<p>These are the wise words of Batman that every aspirational teacher should know.</p>
<p>Teaching is a<strong> popular profession</strong> for many graduates. Last year <strong>16, 845 people completed a secondary PGCE</strong>. The number of graduates completing PGCE’s has steadily risen over the last few years. It is a role that people find <strong>exciting, challenging and extremely stimulating</strong>. It is a profession where we are able to move people forward in their aspirations and assist their learning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was sad to read earlier this year that the number of<strong> teacher training places</strong> at universities and colleges is to be<strong> cut by one fifth</strong>. The Coalition wants more teachers to learn their skills on the job in schools rather than in training colleges. Now I agree that we should have more on the job training – it’s where I learnt my skills and it was where I did most of my learning– but fewer teachers and training opportunities? Universities and teaching colleges offer fantastic teaching expertise and facilities that should be further funded. This maybe in response to subject demand but I am sure we will need teachers in the future and these cuts maybe putting off hundreds of potential brilliant teachers.</p>
<p><img title="Teaching is cool" src="http://miketidd.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/teacher-training.jpg?w=500&#038;h=374" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.radipole.dorset.sch.uk/">Nicholas Hargreaves</a> of <a href="http://www.radipole.dorset.sch.uk/">Radipole School</a>, Weymouth says, ‘teaching is a wonderful career choice for anyone. From a young age several teachers and friends helped and encouraged me to aspire to become a teacher. To provide young minds with the knowledge, skills and passion to take control of their lives and become the experts of tomorrow. Personally it has given me the chance to inspire young people with my knowledge and expertise. Working with a group of like-minded teachers and young people is extremely inspirational. It is a role I have always been determined to succeed in and work hard for.’</p>
<p>The role teachers’ play in their local community is also central to a student’s development. <strong>Schools’ and communities must work collaboratively together</strong> for an area to benefit.<strong> Economic investment is a necessity</strong> with schools. <strong>Schools are the training ground for our future generations</strong> and they need to be at the <strong>forefront of technology</strong> for our young learners with the very best facilities for them to achieve their potential. The local community and schools’ must be incorporated into working together to <strong>create an ethos of self belief and to achieving their personal best</strong>. The community must be involved in their local schools creating community centres, so local people can benefit from the facilities and technology a school has. A community that sees the benefit of an education can help generate our leaders of tomorrow but they must work in partnership with the local schools. We as teachers are the facilitator of this role and can help enrich a wide variety of lives in the process. Working with the local community to enhance the school ethos and help an area develop.</p>
<p><img title="Teaching is cool" src="http://miketidd.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/spain-fieldwork.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Russell Wait</a>, <a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Curriculum Leader of Global Studies</a> at <a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Cove School</a>, Hampshire; ‘I was inspired by my secondary school Headteacher who encouraged me from the tender age of 12 to reach my aspirations and goals. I find that teaching is an ever-changing occupation that keeps you on your toes. To teach the future generation of Britain with a passionate voice can create change and can only be a benefit for the country’.</p>
<p><strong>Many professionals from industry are turning to a career in teaching</strong> because of the many benefits the role brings. They bring with them a vast range of experiences from industry that can only enhance the profession. Experience from outside the classroom and shared with the students is vital.<strong> Young people do need to have role models</strong> and even though they sometimes might not want to admit it, teachers are a very important one. It is very clear that many people want to train as teachers but cannot afford to take a whole year off for training. With the recent credit crisis it is understandable, but it does show that people do want to be teachers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, young people choosing to become a teacher may not get a job at the end of their training. If the government get their way we will all be working till at least sixty-eight &#8211; where is the opportunity for the young, fresh and talented teachers?<strong> We need teachers, inspirational teachers with new ideas and outlooks.</strong> <strong>Choose teaching &#8211; be a teacher!</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of shipwreck books out there and I have a teetering pile of them on my nightstand. I read and read but just can&#8217;t seem to make any headway&#8211;for every book I finish two or three more are published. Some are great, some are not. But all attest to the enduring lure of shipwrecks to readers, dreamers and bookophiles alike.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I finished<em> <a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/books_writings_books.htm#ShipAblaze" target="_blank">Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat </a></em><a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/books_writings_books.htm#ShipAblaze" target="_blank">General Slocum</a> by <a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/" target="_blank">Edward T. O&#8217;Donnell</a>, Associate Professor of American History at the College of Holy Cross. I had high hopes for this book, it being one of the few shipwreck titles written by an academic historian. In many ways O&#8217;Donnell did not disappoint. Thoroughly researched, <em>Ship Ablaze</em> tells the story of one of the worst maritime disasters in American history with intricate detail. O&#8217;Donnell situates the wreck, which claimed more than 1,000 lives, in the social and cultural context of turn-of-the-century New York City. We learn not only learn who the passengers on the steamboat were but also the repercussions of the disaster on the German community devastated by the fire. So too do we read about corrupt government agencies, the cutthroat news industry and the range of public, private and civic responses to a major disaster.  Indeed, <em>Ship Ablaze</em> is a fine example of what a shipwreck monograph can be. I only wish I could still watch <a href="http://shop.history.com/ship-ablaze-the-general-slocum-disaster-dvd/detail.php?p=68305" target="_blank">the <em>History Channel</em> documentary.</a></p>
<p>But there are limits to this kind of shipwreck book (or any &#8220;disaster&#8221;-specific book for that matter). Yes, shipwrecks are fascinating topics. Yes, they offer a unique window onto the past. Yes, they sell. But few answer the &#8220;so what&#8221; question. Why, besides bearing witness, should we care about this or that particular wreck? Most shipwreck monographs, like <em>Ship Ablaze</em>, are &#8220;insular&#8221; texts; or, to borrow a phrase from my advisor, they are &#8220;conversation enders&#8221; rather than &#8220;conversation starters.&#8221; The former are important for populating the past with names, dates and trends, but they tend to swerve towards chronicle rather than history. Conversation starters, however, are the stuff of history&#8211;books that suggest new ways of conceiving the past, books that raise more questions than they answer, books that make an argument that grates against others&#8217; conceptions of the past. When defending my dissertation prospectus I told my committee I wanted to write a conversation starter. Now I&#8217;m finding out just how difficult that is. I can see the appeal of writing a traditional shipwreck monograph.</p>

<p>At the start of the second set at Greenwich Village’s <a href="http://jazzgallery.org/">Jazz Gallery</a> last week, pianist <a href="http://www.krisbowersmusic.com/">Kris Bowers</a> was playing for a packed and eager house.  A packed, eager, young, and particularly diverse house, to be more exact, with a look, vibe and mood much closer to a college music festival versus what the typical jazz audience tends to resemble.  For a brief moment, I thought I was having auditory hallucinations with the amount of hoots and hollers being emitted from young, female voices.  It is a rare occurrence within the jazz club setting.  In Bowers’ performance debut as a leader, that would not be the last series of eyebrow-raising observations for the evening.</p>
<p>Bowers’ band for the evening was an assemblage of up-and-coming fresh faces in jazz with saxophonists Kenneth Whalum III and Godwin Louis, trumpeter Mike Cottone, bassist Earl Travis, and drummer Joe Saylor, with special guest vocalist Jehbreal Muhammad. The band of twenty-somethings played with a fire and focus beyond their years, performing an impressive amount of original material.  Bowers, who is an orchestrator, founder of an <a href="http://campusounds.com/">online music company</a>, and appears on the most significant hip hop album of the 2011, closed the moving set with a song from Bon Iver, the cutting edge indie-folk band, which was been recently riddled with Grammy nominations.  At twenty-two years old, it would be impossible to prognosticate a journey that is just beginning, but it is clear that Kris Bowers is setting a precedent of individuality, pushing the jazz envelope with a fierce, yet understated momentum.</p>
<p>If I’ve misled you to believe that his musical boundlessness and vast experience compromise his significance as a bonafide jazz musician, let me set that record straight nice and early.  He is a tremendous pianist, with a world of history under his fingers, and a conspicuously original sound, balanced by mature restraint.  He’s a bad cat.  He convinced a panel of pianistic paramountcy (which included Herbie Hancock, Ellis Marsalis, Danilo Pérez, Jason Moran and Renee Rosnes) of just that, taking first place at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition earlier this year, beating out some of the best undiscovered pianists in the world.  An experience Bowers described as nothing short of nerve-racking, “I was nervous, definitely.  Because you know, those were like all of my favorites [on the judging panel].  I hadn’t really met any of them&#8230;I knew Jason but other than that I hadn’t met any of them, so to be playing all this stuff that I pretty much got from most of them [laughs] I was trying to&#8230;play the best that I could.”</p>
<p><a href="http://alternate-takes.com/2011/12/06/on-the-rise-a-conversation-with-kris-bowers/krisbowersrockrollhallfamehonorsarethazihcseggwpyl/" rel="attachment wp-att-1907"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1907" title="Kris+Bowers+Rock+Roll+Hall+Fame+Honors+Aretha+ZIhcsEGgwpYl" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/krisbowersrockrollhallfamehonorsarethazihcseggwpyl.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Like most musicians on the New York City jazz scene, Bowers hails from outside of the five boroughs.  Los Angeles, specifically.  Initially studying classical music, Bowers made an organic transition to jazz, which he studied at both Colburn School for Performing Arts and Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA).  After graduating in 2006, Bowers moved to New York, continuing his studies at the Juilliard School.  “The jazz scene in LA&#8230;I mean it’s kind of sad.  It’s pretty bleak,” says Bowers who is now a second-year master of music degree student in the Juilliard Jazz program.  “Mostly because of the geography of the city.  It’s so spread out, it’s kind of hard. Like, we don’t have an area like the Village where there’s a bunch of clubs you can go around to, and to get together to play&#8230;it can take an hour to drive to somebody’s house, [for example].  And then unfortunately, a lot of the clubs are closing down, like The Jazz Bakery.  There’s just not many places to play out there.  I think most of the people want to come to New York once they feel like they’ve gotten to a certain level, or feel like they’re ready.”</p>
<p>Bowers’ New York state of mind has proved a to be a wise one many times over.  If you’re going to be in the right place at the right time, New York is always a good place to start.  Twists of fate work their magic best in The Big Apple, as Bowers explains how a chance subbing gig landed him on the Kanye/Jay-Z <em>magnum opus, Watch the Throne.</em>  “Casey [Benjamin]  plays with Q-Tip and he was on tour with [Robert] Glasper, and he recommended me to do this gig at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival, and it just so happened that at that gig, there were special guests like Busta Rhymes, Black Thought, Monie Love, and Kanye, and at the time they were finishing up a couple tracks from <em>Watch The Throne</em> that Tip was working on, and they wanted me to play some string parts on one song, and to write some piano parts on this other song, so it kind of all happened in a matter of days.”</p>
<p>The idea of writing string parts on a hip-hop album was likely intriguing, as you can add budding film scorer to Bowers’ resume.  “That’s something I definitely want to get into, honestly more than playing&#8230;especially eventually,” admits Bowers.  “I’d love to be able to dig into that.  I’ve always admired the role that music plays in a film and how it helps tell the story and how great music can enhance a film and bad music can ruin a film&#8230;just how much power the music has.  And also that it’s a literal translation of emotion; trying to compose and trying to write music that sounds scary, or sounds like this person is falling in love, or this person is angry&#8230;”</p>
<div id="attachment_1918" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://alternate-takes.com/2011/12/06/on-the-rise-a-conversation-with-kris-bowers/krisb_at/" rel="attachment wp-att-1918"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1918" title="KrisB_AT" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/krisb_at.jpg?w=238&#038;h=300" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Gianina Ferreyra</p></div>
<p>With so many facets to Bowers’ career, and his expansive musical inclinations, it’s exciting to think about what is in store in terms of his debut album, scheduled for an early 2013 release on the Concord label.  “I have a couple of ideas, a couple of special guests brewing who are pretty awesome,” says Bowers who is currently forming his band, something he is particularly thoughtful about.  “The main thing I’m going for with the band is that I want to feature a band full of guys in our generation. Just because I feel like a lot of these guys with their first albums, it’s just [about] names and they have these veterans, and that’s understandable&#8230;but I feel like playing with the people I’m friends with and who I know is going to put as much energy [into the record] as possible.  They’re not just doing it for a paycheck.”</p>
<p>He elaborates further taking a cue from a master with whom he shared recent company.    “Like Herbie’s debut album <em>Takin’ Off</em>.  He had Dexter Gordon &#8212; he was a veteran &#8212; but everybody else on the record was around Herbie’s age. Even though now they’re jazz legends, at the time they were just like one of Herbie’s contemporaries, so I feel like what I want to do is play with people who are <em>my</em> contemporaries.”</p>
<p>There is certainly no shortage of worthy peers for Bowers to choose from.  The well of young talent in jazz today is startling; most notably on Bowers’ own instrument, particularly as it pertains to African Americans.  Not in the last fifteen years (at least) has there been such a surge of rising Black pianists, all making their mark in the same generation.  Bowers is in great company with the brilliant likes of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Sullivan-Fortner/4301839">Sullivan Fortner</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127032469">Christian Sands</a>, <a href="http://firehouse12.com/performers.asp?id=39477">David Bryant</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaWhite.MusicPage">Joshua White</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/artists/91420634/jonathan-batiste">Johnathan Batiste</a>, to name a few.  “It’s pretty great,” says Bowers of the strong representation.  “I remember even being in high school and kind of realizing that there were like three black kids in the jazz department&#8230;in an arts high school&#8230;in LA.  And when you think about the fact that this is our music&#8230;so yeah, it’s pretty great to see some young, Black piano players and all be kind of on the rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>And climbing fast.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;">There was a story read to me as a child, about a grandmother who rides a motorcycle. I was never envious of the little boy in the story, because I knew that he was wrong for thinking his grandma was the coolest grandma in the world. His grandma couldn&#8217;t be the coolest grandma in the world because mine was. She has the mouth of a sailor and the dirtiest, funniest, sense of humour. Anyone who has spent any amount of time with her, can&#8217;t help but love her. My friend Jessi, upon hearing I was visiting my grandma this weekend, said, &#8221; Doris! Tell her I say Hi and I love her.&#8221; My grandma, Doris, just has that type of magic. She is literally one of a kind. </div>
<div style="text-align:center;"> </div>
<div style="text-align:center;">Grandma has always been the most encouraging of me and my crafting, so I couldn&#8217;t go visit without a little homemade something. I had picked up this little paper mache elephant at Michael&#8217;s a while back, not knowing what he would become, but unable to resist his dollar price tag. When I went downstairs (to my dungeon craft area) to whip up a little something for Grandma, the little elephant practically honked at me. He would easily become the perfect addition to my Grandma&#8217;s elephant collection. She has the elephant figurines scattered around her apartment, always facing the door, as per the superstitions that this positioning allows them to protect the home. All of her elephants have trunks pointed upward as well, because if an elephant&#8217;s trunk is downward, then all it&#8217;s luck scatters away, but an upward trunk stores the luck for the recipient, in this case Grams.</div>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-elephant.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-689" title="grandma elephant" src="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-elephant.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="278" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">Keeping in mind, that a white elephant is the luckiest of all, I decorated the elephant. I used leftover magazine cutouts from <a href="http://tobefrankblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/first-diy-flower-pots/">this project</a>. I chose shades of blue and turquoise and I modge podged them to the top and around the front. Then I painted the remainder of the elephant white. He was perfect. I knew she would love him and she did. I hope there are more similarly priced animals like this at Michael&#8217;s as I&#8217;d love to decorate other ones to use as tree ornaments.</div>
<div style="text-align:center;"> </div>
<div style="text-align:center;">My visit to grams, was atypical. Some of her magic is veiled by her illness, but I was happy to spend the weekend cleaning and cooking for her. I made her chicken soup, as soup is one of her all time favorite meals, along with chicken cutlets, spinach, and roasted root veggies. I couldn&#8217;t tell you how the soup or cutlets tasted, since I still don&#8217;t eat meat but as always, she loved everything I made for her, even if she didn&#8217;t eat nearly as much as usual. I froze some large portions for her and my grandpa to eat at later dates. I&#8217;m sure she appreciated the present &amp; future home-cooked meals even more than the crafted elephant.</div>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" title="grandma pot" src="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-pot.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="424" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">While there, I came across several  crafted-by-me things; a relatively recent mermaid painting, a mermaid card, a necklace, and this beautiful hand painted pot. Judging by the crude depiction of her, my grandpa, flowers, and the sun, I made the pot circa 1998 or 1997, when I was eleven or twelve.  And there it was, on her screened in porch, with a plant thriving in it, twelve or thirteen years later. I had to take a picture because it was just so sweet.  On the top, it reads, &#8220;World&#8217;s Greatest Grandma,&#8221; which she was then, still is today, and always will be, even when all the paint has cracked off the pot and I&#8217;m a grandma myself.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_473" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 567px"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/radiosilence-by-tatiana-plakhova.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-473   " title="RadioSilence by tatiana plakhova" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/radiosilence-by-tatiana-plakhova.jpg?w=557&#038;h=742" alt="" width="557" height="742" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">RadioSilence, by Tatiana Plakhova</p></div>
<p>Our world is all but digitized. Analogue is becoming a thing of the past, and will likely die with my parents generation, or my own. It will be seen as something collectible, cool, retro, and unique, but nevertheless, dead. Yes, people still flip through books, buy records, and learn instruments, but for how much longer? The pushing of tactile buttons, pulling of levers, and turning of knobs, is about to disappear. Soon the distinction between being online and offline will fade. There will be no offline, and thus, no online. Everything and everyone will be forever connected. If we want to disconnect, we&#8217;ll have to painstakingly go out out of our way to do so.</p>
<p>If you are like me, then you feel amiss when you can&#8217;t get online. Usually it happens when visiting parents, grandparents, or rural friends. On one occasion – before I bothered to turn on my laptop – I asked someone what their Wifi password was. They stared at me blankly for a few seconds, before uttering, “Wifi?” The horror. The horror.</p>
<p>But, honestly, there is a certain anxiety that comes over people in my generation when we can’t connect. Technology critics and primitivists usually claim that this anxiety is innately bad, and stems from my generation&#8217;s need for instant gratification. But what&#8217;s so bad about instant gratification? Should I have to work to find the information I want, or need, when it is conveniently at my fingertips? Shouldn&#8217;t information be easy to access?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/mays_8.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-522 aligncenter" title="mays_8 by butdoesitfloat" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/mays_8.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>Then again, maybe I am too &#8220;connected&#8221;. Half of my daydreaming is spent in my head, the other half online. To an outsider – typically someone over forty – it must look strange. Blue links highlighted. Flashing windows. Twenty tabs open. Music playing. Headphones on. Lukewarm coffee on desk. Occasionally, I feel less like a person, and more like an amoeba that feeds on tweets, notifications, and followers.</p>
<p>Enter my parent’s generation. The first thing to notice is their sociality. Older people are always talking, or always listening. Rarely are they absorbed in some task on a computer, hunched over with a stiff neck and squinting eyes. (That is, unless they are trying to find the vexatious, &#8220;forward to all&#8221; button). Older generations can get lost in a conversation; yet, their conversations lack something. They tend to get stuck on bits of information that, for the life of them, they cannot remember.</p>
<p>Who was that actresses name? What was that restaurant in San Francisco called? How can we get to the freeway from here? Questions always linger when talking to older people. This isn&#8217;t because they have bad memories – though they certainly can – but, because they aren&#8217;t whipping out their phones, or flinging open their laptops. There is an odd elegance to this. I have to remind myself that for my parents, the world isn’t about information, or, &#8220;instant gratification&#8221;. My mother spends her time watching classic films, visiting family, and reading books. My father rides his mountain bike, shoots guns, and fixes things. <del>I can’t tell if he particularly enjoys this last activity, as much of the time it is littered with “fuck”, and “god damn it”.</del> (Edit: he claims he only cusses when he can&#8217;t fix things).</p>
<p>My parent&#8217;s generation have a laudable simplicity about them. They are sometimes frustrating, asking us to hook up their internet for fix their computers, but those things are essentially foreign to them. Our parents don&#8217;t really belong in the digital world, they just visit it. They are record players, and we are iPods. Besides, I can&#8217;t pretend I&#8217;m entirely used to our digital world either. I still remember the days of connecting to the internet through screeching analogue dial tones, so that I could work on my geocities website into the tiny hours of the morning, or until someone called and I was disconnected. Sometimes I have to remind myself that my generation was the last to grow up before the Internet became truly monolithic. From now on, children will grow up in the shadow of that monolith. While it may be frightening, I think younger generations will be fine. My niece and nephew&#8217;s computer skills already rival their parents, and none are over the age of six.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/old_recorder-by-but-does-it-float.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-524" title="Old_Recorder by but does it float" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/old_recorder-by-but-does-it-float.jpg?w=367&#038;h=490" alt="" width="367" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>So, how is my generation – the information generation – handling things? How can we begin to answer this question? Information is violently changing our lives. The Arab world has ignited with social protests, <a title="partially catalyzed by social media" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/25/twitter-facebook-uprisings-arab-libya" target="_blank">partially catalyzed by social media</a>. WikiLeaks has released over 400,000 confidential government documents. The Occupy movement is still going strong, <a title="with rallies being organized online and through social media" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-elder/occupy-wall-street-and-social-media_b_1077047.html" target="_blank">with rallies being organized online</a>. <a title="The first digital currency, bitcoin, showed signs of being practical, and used on a wide scale" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/1" target="_blank">The first digital currency showed signs of being practical</a>. For the first time, Artificial Intelligence is being used widely, <a title="(even if it is rather silly)" href="http://shitsirisays.com/" target="_blank">(even if it is rather silly)</a>. And, somewhere, a twenty-two year old kid writes a blog post about all of it, which could be seen by millions. (I said <em>could</em>.)</p>
<p>My generation is starving for useful, thoughtful, intelligent, and inspiring information. If we want to learn how to do something &#8211; <em>anything &#8211; </em>we can google it, and be on our way; there&#8217;s even a <a title="how-to-do-everything podcast" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/" target="_blank">how-to-do-everything podcast</a>. If that weren&#8217;t enough, Wikipedia has an entry on just about everything, with all links eventually leading back to philosophy. We can learn about the fundamental stuff of the universe – or whatever philosophers ramble about &#8212; with a few mouse clicks. For those of us that don&#8217;t like reading, there are infographics and videos on every topic out there. When we aren&#8217;t absorbing information, we&#8217;re expressing ourselves by the millions, through sites like DeviantArt, Flickr, Tumblr, Etsy, WordPress, and more. Perhaps we are too entitled, too lazy, or too impatient, but, we aren&#8217;t stupid. I don&#8217;t accept that. We have access to more information than any other generation, and we are using it. We are becoming smarter with the information we are using, even if much of it drips through the cracks of obnoxious YouTube videos and incomprehensible memes. Perhaps I&#8217;m being sophomoric, but I think the internet is fundamentally good, because knowledge is fundamentally good. Maybe that crazy greek bastard was onto something when he said, “The only good is knowledge, the only evil is ignorance”. And, if you don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m talking about, just google it.</p>
