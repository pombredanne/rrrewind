				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://theunconventionalhousewifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sm_overload.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1075" title="sm_overload" alt="" src="http://theunconventionalhousewifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sm_overload.jpg?w=196&#038;h=300" height="300" width="196" /></a></p>
<p>About a month ago, I made a life altering decision. While on paper it sounds petty, simple and mundane—it was quite the opposite in all actuality. In an effort to decrease stress and create an opportunity to spend time with my family, I became disconnected. I have closed my personal social media accounts (Facebook, Google+, etc). I have not blogged, nor have participated in any major online activity—this includes checking my personal email. While at the time, I was honestly attempting to isolate myself due to many personal and family issues. I have since realized this decision was surprisingly life changing.</p>
<p>My life of cyber detachment all began after a trip to the doctor’s office to discuss the onset of migraine headaches. While I joked regularly about my headaches with my husband, making comments about my personal diagnosis and impending death, I truly did not think these were related to anything substantial. I figured it was stress. I am a fulltime student, who works fulltime and often volunteers part-time—this along with my many other roles in life, I expect to be stressed occasionally. When I started experiencing headaches, I did not think much about them. That was until other symptoms occurred with these headaches.</p>
<p>As I lay in bed one evening, experiencing a headache, my husband kissed my forehead. With a surprised look, he informed me that I was burning up. This occurred on more than one occasion—before I knew it every headache was accompanied by a fever. I finally went into the doctors. It was here I was informed they were going to run every possible test and send me in for an MRI and later a CT scan. I was informed at the time that they were checking for bleeding and/or tumors. While this was stressful and a bit scary, I was pleased that my physicians were taking my headaches seriously and ruling out all possibilities.</p>
<p>After all the tests were complete, I was cleared of any major issues. However, I must endure a few more tests and manage the outcome which has been a complete mixture of ailments—the perfect storm so to speak. While the outcome was a huge relief, the entire process made me want to change certain aspects of my life, especially as the impending couple of weeks led to numerous other stressful events.</p>
<p>Within a short period of time my husband was rear ended, my youngest daughter became very ill (she does not have health insurance either), there was a loss in my life and we had to endure a huge financial setback from another issue. With a life in chaos, I just began to close all the doors to a cyber existence which no longer seemed to reflect any reality or provide any solace.</p>
<p><a href="http://theunconventionalhousewifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/6a00d8345158a169e20120a5226cac970b-800wi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1068" title="6a00d8345158a169e20120a5226cac970b-800wi" alt="" src="http://theunconventionalhousewifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/6a00d8345158a169e20120a5226cac970b-800wi.jpg?w=300&#038;h=268" height="268" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>I started with shutting down my Facebook page. Within a week, I was surprised at the amount of time which this created and the lack of stress which I endured from not being “connected.” I found all of the people in my life that mattered (loved ones, friends, etc), were quick to make contact with me or vice versa. Then I slowly shut down all of my other accounts. I said goodbye to Flickr, Pintrest, Skype, Yelp, Blogger, Stumble Upon, LinkedIn, and Tumblr. I deleted a majority of my online subscriptions, which included Groupon, Seattle Weekly Coupons, and Living Social. None of this was easy, but it was completely freeing.</p>
<p>Now that the initial shock and withdrawals have subsided, I am content with this new life which involves reading books (not just textbooks), hanging out with my family or friends, and most of all being able to participate in artistic activities again. In looking back I could not believe how much of my life was being dictated by social media. In my virtual world life was peachy keen. Yet reality told a different story. Not only was I spending roughly 4-6 hours a day on some social media site, I would do so to my own detriment. Getting behind on school work or being completely distracted with Facebook while being engaged in some other activity, or worse staying connected while trying to actually socialize (with real people). In the end it was exhausting and completely unfulfilling.</p>
<p>While I have come back into the cyber-blog world, I have opted to stay away from other areas of social media. No more personal Facebook pages and Google+ accounts, or the likes. No more hanging out on my email all day and being available for IM chats. At one point I went as far as to say I wanted to cancel my cell phone and stick to chatting on landlines, but my husband nicely informed me that this was the line. I agree with the latter.</p>
<p>While I am thrilled to be blogging again, I am more excited with the numerous opportunities my disconnected lifestyle has provided.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Ahh Halloween is upon us again. What a nostalgic time for parents. Pumpkins, hayrides, and apple picking. Memories of dressing up in costume, trick-or-treating, haunted houses, and oodles and oodles of goodies and treats. Halloween parties galore! At school, at home, and at the neighbors! Wonderful memories and experiences that we eagerly and excitedly want to pass on to our children. I mean, why wouldn&#8217;t we? Our kids should be able to go door-to-door and stuff their faces with candy and chocolate and cookies just like we did when we were young. Halloween is a tradition, people. One day out of the year spent supporting and encouraging poor dietary habits amongst our children can&#8217;t harm them, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The problem is that for most children in the US it&#8217;s not just one day, it&#8217;s every day. Every day our children are bombarded with ads for crap food and sugary drinks. Fundraisers at school for cookie dough, frozen pizzas, potato chips, and chocolate candy. Sponge Bob and Dora spewed all over every fruit gummy treat in the store. Colored food products targeted to children around every corner. From <a href="http://newhealthom.com/2012/05/23/petroleum-coal-tar-and-popsicles/" target="_blank">popsicles</a> and colored goldfish crackers to Fruit Loops cereal, yogurt, and M&amp;M&#8217;s. The brighter the better, right? For marketing, yes. For our kids&#8217; health, not so much.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Recent studies linking food coloring to hyperactivity and ADHD in kids is causing some experts to call on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/30/134962888/fda-probes-link-between-food-dyes-kids-behavior" target="_blank">FDA</a> to ban foods containing them &#8211; or at least require a warning label. The<a href="http://www.cspinet.org/new/201006291.html" target="_blank"> Center for Science in the Public Interest (CPSI)</a> says the dyes are a &#8220;<a href="http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/food-dyes-rainbow-of-risks.pdf" target="_blank">Rainbow of Risks</a>&#8221; for children and can cause allergic reactions, hyperactivity, and even cancer. I must point out that 1 in 17 children have allergies in the US, 1 in 10 have ADHD, and 1 in 5 are obese. Despite those concerns, manufacturers put about <em>15 million pounds of eight synthetic dyes into our foods each year</em>, according to the group. <em>Per capita consumption of dyes has risen five-fold since 1955, thanks in part to the proliferation of brightly colored cereals, fruit drinks, and candies pitched to children.</em></p>
<p>Paralleling these findings, between 2001 and 2007, the number of 2-to-5-year-olds on anti-psychotic medications for behavioral problems doubled. A <a href="http://www.healthinschools.org/~/media/Files/psychotropic07.ashx" target="_blank">2007 study</a> found about 1 in 70 preschoolers was taking a psychotropic drug such as a stimulant, an antidepressant, a mood stabilizer, an anti-psychotic, or an anti-anxiety drug. According to the  National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/mental-health-medications/complete-index.shtml" target="_blank">NIH</a>): About 1 in 5 children ages 13-18 has some sort of mental disorder, be it anxiety, mood, or disruptive behavior disorder. The New England Journal of Medicine <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/health/17obese.html" target="_blank">reports</a> that for the first time in two centuries, the current generation of children in America may have shorter life expectancies than their parents.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think our children deserve better. Countries in the European Union (EU) have banned most dyes and require labeling of foods containing particular synthetic dyes linked to behavioral problems in children. The Mars Company has removed all artificial dyes from Starburst Chews and Skittles, and has begun removing all dyes from M&amp;M&#8217;s in the UK, but not in the US. Requests for a <a href="http://www.healthyschools.org/documents/food_dyes-CEH_2-09.pdf" target="_blank">UK ban</a> followed more than three decades of growing science associating exposure to food additives with a heap of potentially serious problems in children including not only hyperactivity, but also cognitive disturbances and compulsive aggression; asthma, hives, and allergies; and irritability and poor sleeping habits. Many usable alternatives clearly exist, but the US hasn&#8217;t decided to take action just yet. I wonder how many more chronically ill children it will take before the FDA steps up in this country?</p>
<p>Not just on Halloween this year, but <em>every day</em> ask yourself how you can contribute to creating a healthier environment for our children. Start with avoiding synthetic dyes by reading labels and choosing organic products. Organic standards prohibit the use of these dyes in products bearing the USDA Organic label and use natural food colorings from beets, carrots, seaweed, spinach, grapes, turmeric, and blueberries. Oh and&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">BOO! WAKE UP! The kids are counting on you!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">to. happy. healthy. days. ahead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My paternal grandfather’s sister, Mandy Foster, was a madam in Eureka, California during prohibition.</p>
<p>Family history says she worked out of The Vance Hotel, but this is highly unlikely and honesty requires me to confess that I come from a family of notorious liars and storytellers.  I’m not apologizing for this genetic trait. On the contrary, I’m thankful for the tendency, but I have learned to fact-check before I put something on paper and claim it as truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://pamelafosterspeakerwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hchs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-314" title="hchs" alt="" src="http://pamelafosterspeakerwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hchs.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" height="216" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>So, on a recent trip to Eureka, I spent a few hours at <a title="Humboldt County Historical Society" href="http://www.humboldthistory.org/">The Humboldt County Historical Society </a>in the hopes of coming up with proof of family legend.  Linda DeLong, the gracious and helpful curator of the genealogy room, pulled collections and books on that era of Eureka history.  There was even a booklet specifically about prostitution in the county.  A thin collection of newspaper articles and personal accounts to be sure, but good information and, really, prostitution might be the oldest profession but it’s never been one written about or recognized by polite society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only reference I found to Mandy Foster, was her obituary.  And, as you might suspect, the family did not see fit to supply the newspaper with information about how she earned her living.  She died, by the way, in a sanitarium in Petaluma.  The newspaper doesn’t report that she died of syphilis, but that’s what I’ve always been told.</p>
<p>So, while I did find entertaining articles about Mandy’s grandfather, Merritt Curtis Foster, the stage coach driver and early settler in Freshwater, California, I found no written evidence of my Aunt’s line of work.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter.  I have proof.</p>
<p>You see, as a young woman, I resembled Mandy.  Looked enough like her that, four or five times in my twenties, rheumy-eyed men approached me with the same tired line.</p>
<p>“You look like someone I knew a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Now, even in my twenties I wasn’t THAT gullible and the first couple of times it happened I asked, “Ah huh.  And who might that be.”</p>
<p>The answer was always a variation of, “A beautiful, generous young woman name of Mandy.”</p>
<p>At that point I would share my maiden name with the old guy.  Three of the five times it happened, tears actually ran down the wrinkled cheeks of these old men. They always bought me a drink or two, three of them kissed my hand graciously before saying goodbye.</p>
<p>The second proof of Mandy’s profession is the monkey fur coat that was reportedly a gift from Tom Mix.  No, we don’t still have the coat in the family.  It was cut into squares and made into throw pillows. (Yes, that’s right, we’re the family on Antiques Roadshow that paints over the Rembrandt and reupholsters the priceless chair)  My mom had one of the pillows on our coach when I was a kid.  It smelled like pee and Dad’s dog, Tricksy, ate it.</p>
<p>So, while I did not find written confirmation of the family stories that my great-aunt Mandy was a madam on the Eureka waterfront during the wild and wooly days of prohibition, I do have tears of nostalgia in the eyes of old men and the clear and smelly memory of a monkey fur coat.</p>
<p>Really, what more proof could I want?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When this past summer began, it seemed only a matter of time before the repressive Syrian regime fell and was replaced by a diverse assortment of disorganized but enthusiastic Syrian rebels in a democracy. Since then, the situation has deteriorated. Syria&#8217;s rebels, with minimal aid from the international community, have instead accepted the arrival of extreme Islamists carrying the experience, weapons, and tactics of a decade of insurgency against America and allied nations. This will certainly bolster the fight against Bashar al-Assad, but it will not bring victory to the people.</p>
<p>There was a time when we would commit to a foreign intervention without a realistic understanding of the consequences, simply because it seemed right to do so and it could lead to a better future. That was Iraq. We don&#8217;t do that anymore. So let us look at what would happen if action were taken in Syria.</p>
<p>Who are the rebels? Politically, it would be easy to point to the National Syrian Council. They have a nice <a href="http://www.syriancouncil.org/">website</a>. They certainly argue a great deal. However, they are fractious, disorganized, and generally <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/14/why-hillary-clinton-snubbed-the-syrian-national-council-on-istanbul-visit.html">ineffective</a>. They cannot be considered to be in command of the Free Syrian Army. For that matter, the FSA cannot be considered to be in command of the FSA. It is merely an umbrella organization, not an organized military command. Weapons are often <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2012/09/201292619552391971.html">homemade</a>; rebel units have fundamental differences in ideology that make for tension and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/opinion/western-intervention-in-syria.html?_r=0">uncooperative </a>chaos. There are brigades of rebels defending their families and homes from a brutal and coercive regime that abducts innocent men and women to be tortured and willingly slaughters children. However, there are also brigades of jihadists and extremists, <a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2012/10/28/269152/alqaeda-call-foments-terror-in-syria/">foreign insurgents and al-Qaeda terrorists</a>. If al-Assad is defeated, there is little question but that the country will quickly be mired in a second civil war, this time between the various units of the FSA. The lessons that Egypt offers does not offer much optimism for the triumph of moderate democrats determined to build a free, inclusive Syria. Even though Morsi has been surprisingly moderate, it cannot be denied that the political victory of the Muslim Brotherhood was not what was envisioned when the US stepped up to support the Egyptian people in Tahrir Square. In order to ensure a moderate democratic outcome, a massive ground intervention would be needed to unseat al-Assad and put down the inevitable insurgency from the thwarted jihadists.</p>
<p>No one is willing to do that. Turkey is Syria&#8217;s neighbor and has the most responsibility of any nation to intervene. It refuses. The European Union won&#8217;t &#8211; even if they could do it without US military support, which they could not. Russia is blocking efforts by the international community to stop the violence, save for ineffectual UN negotiation efforts. China is supporting Russia. Gulf Cooperation Council countries are supporting the rebels, but they are limited in what they can do beyond supplying money, equipment, and weapons. Israel could do much more, and some have noted that Israeli intervention could topple al-Assad and create a friendly Syria that would help isolate Hezbollah from Iranian support. However, this would be a long shot, as Israel really doesn&#8217;t have the troop numbers to control the situation on the ground. They could topple Assad, but could not dictate what happens next. The US could, but only at great financial cost, loss of American and Syrian lives, tremendous strain put on the US military, and with a considerable political cost both at home and abroad. In the midst of dealing with a slow economy, high unemployment, and fiscal uncertainty &#8211; not least of which is the upcoming axe of sequestration to the Defense budget &#8211; America is not willing to start another Iraq &#8211; and that is what it looks like a full-scale intervention would likely become. It is difficult to muster much enthusiasm for a good deed in a part of the world where they are especially quick to be punished; particularly when one can see the punishment to come in even a cursory glance at the convoluted situation.</p>
<p>What is to be done in Syria, then? Intervention is out, even if Russia were to relent in its opposition in the UN. Al-Assad is a monster and has lost the credibility to lead the majority of his people. However, he is not about to step down &#8211; the consequences of losing are likely death for him. If jihadists come to dominate  the FSA, the same will be true for the Alawites. They will be at grave risk. The best outcome would be for the moderate Syrians defending their families and homes to defeat al-Assad, push out the extremists, and form a peaceful, democratic Syria. But they don&#8217;t seem to be able to do so. The US and GCC countries can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/middleeast/cia-said-to-aid-in-steering-arms-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all">supply</a> arms, equipment, food, and diplomatic and mediation support, but that has yet to net anything remotely like the optimum result sought. Even if the US began to include arms with the equipment it is currently supplying, it still would not guarantee an end to the violence.</p>
<p>The war will continue. The regime will not surrender. The Syrian military has yet to collapse as predicted. The FSA will continue to fight. The foreign insurgents and extremists will especially not stop, and will use car bombs, suicide bombers, and IED&#8217;s to kill large numbers of government forces and equally large numbers of civilians. And the international community will do as much as it feels it can do in the situation and <a href="http://www.rand.org/blog/2012/10/hands-off-syria.html">under the circumstances</a>: not a whole lot.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the situation is hopeless or will stagnate. Any little thing can decisively alter a situation. That could happen in Syria. Indeed, one cannot but hope it does; the situation is a sad one, and every day more innocent people suffer and die. However, such changes are by their very nature almost impossible to predict. (Though we do know that use of chemical weapons has been promised to result in an immediate US military response and could thus qualify as somewhat predictable, that is not the sort of change that anyone wants to see and is unlikely in the extreme.) More likely is the West using its influence to strengthen moderate FSA elements and suppress extremist groups; <a href="http://www.rand.org/blog/2012/07/al-qaedas-war-for-syria.html">covert action</a> is also not out of the question, though none has appeared to take place thus far.</p>
<p>As things stand, Syria faces an endless war: if the regime crushes the FSA, an insurgency will continue the violence; if the FSA prevails, another civil war will result. If it sounds like Iraq vs. Afghanistan, then there should be little surprise the world is not rushing to intervene. Until something changes, expect the US and its allies to focus on supporting moderate elements of the FSA, fostering political unity, and driving towards the democratic endgame as fast as the inevitably slow pace of such an <a href="http://www.rand.org/blog/2012/10/hands-off-syria.html">approach</a> allows. It may be slow, but it is better than endless war, and for all the blood that has been spilled, the Syrian people deserve a better end to this war than simply more of the same.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you Google Orthodox Feminism, or some derivative there-of you will be initially greeted by <a href="http://www.jofa.org/index.aspx" target="_blank">JOFA</a>, but after that things get dicey. For some reason, even amongst many modern women, the idea of feminism and orthodoxy appears to be an oxymoron. I know women who learn text intensively (including <em>gemara</em>) who refer to it with a joking tone as though it were impossible that an Orthodox woman could also identify as a feminist.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to any of our long time readers (and even those who have only recently joined us) that I strongly identify as a feminist. I have written about many topics surrounding this in the past, including my support of JOFA, but it is time to be more direct.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>I am an Orthodox Feminist.</strong></p>
<p>I do not find these two things to be at odds with one another. Feminism to me has always been about opportunities being available for a women to make choices about how to live various parts of her life. Not having to be &#8220;equal&#8221; to a man, but in her own unique womanly ways. Not in any specific way, but in a way which is personally relevant and meaningful. I felt that way at thirteen wearing a <em>talit</em> and reading <em>torah</em>, and I feel that way at thirty wearing a <em>tichel</em> and learning <em>talmud</em>.</p>
<p>To loosely quote a rabbi I know here: if women can be brain surgeons, why can&#8217;t they lead <em>kiddush</em>? [Of note, a woman leading <em>kiddush</em> is totally ok according to the Shulchan Aruch (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 271:2</em>).] I am sure that he is not the only Rabbi I know who has made an observation of this sort, but the analogy is particularly striking. In an era where women can follow their passions to be whatever they chose, be it a stay at home mom, work at home mom, or full time career woman in nearly any field &#8211; why can we not empower women in Judaism similarly? There is not one mold for us all to fit into, but lets figure out what the options are (and within <em>halacha </em>for those to whom that is important) and keep the conversation productive and proactive.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 347px"><img title="orthodox feminism" alt="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcmajuxzMw1rjhpt8o1_500.png" height="243" width="337" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo posted to http://jofaorg.tumblr.com/ &#8211; Post by Melissa</p></div>
<p>Simply put, I have a unique contribution, and I want the opportunity to make it. I don&#8217;t want to be a man, but I want to learn, grow, educate, and inspire to my fullest capacity. I know that I can make an impact, I just need to be able to keep breaking down the mental barriers that even other women have around it.</p>
<p>We are our own best friends and worst enemies. If we do not empower ourselves and each other, we will never be able to find the happy balance where women are educated and empowered within the confines of <em>halacha.</em></p>
<p>We cannot continue to find orthodoxy and feminism to be oxymoronic and dichotomous. We have to embrace them together if women are ever going to feel good about being themselves within a traditional/<em>halachic</em> experience of Judaism. So take some time to actually listen to the women around you, not just the words that they say but what they aren&#8217;t saying and what they are doing &#8211; you may be surprised how many Orthodox Feminists you really know.</p>
<p>{{Two important links: A <a href="http://jofaorg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> new Tumblr started by JOFA </a>where you can submit your own responses about why you think we need Jewish/Orthodox Feminism, and a <a href="http://blogs.forward.com/sisterhood-blog/164634/confessions-of-an-orthodox-feminist/" target="_blank">recent post on The Forward&#8217;s Sisterhood Blog</a> where one woman shared her battle to find her footing as an Orthodox Feminist in America.}}</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc05670.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4286" title="SONY DSC" alt="" src="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc05670.jpg?w=680&#038;h=452" height="452" width="680" /></a>What is your current desktop wallpaper? Mine used to be whatever cool picture of people, flowers or animals (mainly cats) I recently took but I decided that since I spend so many hours a day looking at my desktop screen, a little more thought should go into my choice. So I went on a hunt for original desktop wallpapers but I simply couldn&#8217;t find any that I really, really like AND that are free. There is always some small detail that just isn&#8217;t quite right, usually a cheesy quote or a less-than-ideal colour scheme. To cut a long story short, I decided to become good at making my own desktop wallpapers :) I have quite a long list of ideas that I want to try out at some point, including purely graphic-based designs, but I thought I&#8217;d first dive into my craft supplies, style a pretty &#8220;texture&#8221; on a canvas and photograph it. Read on for a quick tutorial:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ybl-002.png"><img class="aligncenter size-680 wp-image-4287" title="ybl.002" alt="" src="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ybl-002.png?w=680&#038;h=227" height="227" width="680" /></a><strong>Create a texture</strong><br />
First, choose a canvas for your wallpaper, for example coloured paper, fabric, concrete or wood. If you can&#8217;t find a canvas with the perfect colour, mix up some paints and paint a white piece of paper. For decorating, sequins, beads and glitter are a good place to start, but you can pretty much use anything from fabrics to small objects like leaves, gummy bears, sea shells, feathers&#8230; The only thing to consider is how strong your camera&#8217;s resolution is because the picture you take will be stretched to fill your screen and macro shots of smaller objects might turn out a little blurry on your screen unless they have a very high resolution. Take pictures in the largest size your camera is capable of shooting and, if you can, in a RAW format. Alternatively, try to use a larger canvas if you are decorating with small objects like beads, so you can take the picture from further away. Go as minimalistic or colourful as you like, but make sure that your overall image isn&#8217;t too &#8216;busy&#8217;, you still want to be able to see your desktop icons (onsider leaving at least one quarter of the picture plain).<a href="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc05641.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4288" title="SONY DSC" alt="" src="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc05641.jpg?w=680&#038;h=452" height="452" width="680" /></a><strong>Experiment with lighting and angles</strong><br />
If you want to use lighting effects to amp up your texture, try to find natural light sources. I photographed my canvas in front of a small window so the sequins would be partially lit from behind. Angle-wise, you can&#8217;t go wrong with a standard bird&#8217;s eye view pic, but also experiment with other perspectives. If your camera allows you to adjust the focus, try a couple of shots with a defined focus in the middle/front, then a couple with a larger depth of field to give you lots of options to choose from at the editing stage. Remember to avoid macro shots unless your camera has a very high resolution.<br />
<a href="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-27-at-14-13-02.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4285" title="Screen Shot 2012-10-27 at 14.13.02" alt="" src="http://intomind.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-27-at-14-13-02.png?w=680&#038;h=425" height="425" width="680" /></a><strong>Editing</strong><br />
Now comes the fun part (at least for me :)): Use any photo editing software to quickly polish your pictures and create just the look you were going for. If you have photoshop you can completely transform your image, add lighting effects, change the colour scheme, blur or sharpen sections, but even a few basic touch ups like adjusting the contrast, brightness or hue can give your photo a bit of extra oomph. I used Photoshop Elements to up the contrast, decrease overall saturation and increase and darken the blue tones. Also, consider adding text: inspirational quotes or lyrics in a pretty font on a plain canvas can be a nice, calming combination &#8211; perfect for a desktop wallpaper :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">This time it was no hype. Sandy rampaged through New York, New Jersey and the rest of the Northeast. It&#8217;s still active and we are updating live.The damage in the city has been enormous, including massive flooding everywhere, collapsed buildings, generator malfunctions in hospitals, multiple fires, city-wide blackouts and explosions in electric plants. Some of the subway system may be offline <em>for a month</em>. And yes, mortal victims too.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Gizmodo&#8217;s servers, located in a data center in Lower Manhattan, were knocked out too, but this article contains all the updates since the moment of the city shutdown. <em><strong>Refresh for updates&#8230;</strong></em></p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Update 6: Latest NOAA warning as of 11:25PM</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A LARGE AND RECORD SETTING STORM, WITH WIDESPREAD WIND DAMAGE, INLAND AND COASTAL FLOODING, AND BEACH EROSION. THE COMBINATION OF THE HEAVY RAIN AND WIND WILL CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. AT THIS TIME, THE MOST LIKELY TIME FRAME FOR THE WORST OF THE RAIN AND WIND LOOKS TO BE MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THIS MEANS THERE IS STILL TIME TO PREPARE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jmubethechange.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/camillewaysidesml.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9986" title="camillewaysidesml" alt="Roadside sign commemorating Hurricane Camille in Nelson Co., Va." src="http://jmubethechange.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/camillewaysidesml.jpg?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a>Power.</p>
<p>We are drawn to it as surely as moths are drawn to light. All of us. And right now, we’re living a demonstration of that. None of us can control a hurricane like Sandy — or any hurricane for that matter. Such unbridled power provides endless fascination in large part because it is out of our control. We can only react, as the university is doing today by closing in an abundance of caution in the face of Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>In August 1969, another powerful hurricane arrived in Virginia. Hurricane Camille came ashore in Texas. It ambled up through the Ohio Valley becoming “just” a tropical storm before making a right turn toward Virginia. Colliding with another water-filled system, Camille settled down on the other side of the Blue Ridge Mountains from Harrisonburg in Nelson County.</p>
<p>Stefan Bechtel, author of <i>Roar of the Heavens</i>, describes the devastating result:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>Almost completely without warning, and within the space of eight hours, one of the heaviest rainfalls ever recorded on earth — billions of tons of rain — cascaded down these mountainsides, turning these lovely crags and streambeds into a terrifying effective drowning machine for all life below. Humans, animals, trees, boulders, houses, cars, barns and everything else were swept away in a fast-moving slurry, a kind of deadly earth-lava that buried everything in its path. </i></p>
<p>When the storm was over, 150 Virginians were dead. Whole communities had disappeared. “The rains fell so astoundingly hard that it was nearly impossible to breathe, or to hear anything above the deafening roar. So much water crashed from the sky that the entire veneer of a billion-year-old mountain range simply sloughed away.&#8221; Bechtel writes.</p>
<p>Unlike today, there was no CNN in 1969 Virginia, no early warning system, no cell phones or Internet. Today, Bechtel points out, news crews would be on the scene instantly. The people of Nelson County, however, were caught unaware, devastated and isolated — for days no one else knew that their world had been upended. Some communities, like Massie’s Mill, were completely cut off. Bridges, roads, including Route 29, were impassable. In one night, Camille changed their lives and the landscape of their world forever.</p>
<p>Camille even altered the way geologists look at change. “One geological study later concluded,” Bechtel writes, “that about two thousand years of erosion had occurred in that single night in Nelson County. And almost forty years later, mountainsides scoured clean and reshaped by that calaclysmic (sic) event are still clearly visible.”</p>
<p>Nelson County blogger, <a href="http://suzicate.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/the-courage-to-continue/" target="_blank">Susan Carter Payne</a>, whose niece Jennifer Payne is a JMU senior, remembers what it was like. In a first person account, she writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>I was barely six years old and about to start first grade when Hurricane Camille hit. I was fortunate that I did not lose anyone I loved. However, I remember the devastation well. I remember the water, the mud and debris, and the smell. The smell of death. The smell of pungent raw earth. The smell of exposure, collapse, and decay. A stench I will never forget. I remember the recurring nightmare of a spinning house in a downpour of rain. I remember getting a tetanus shot. I remember the immediate fear of the “Army men” and the tanks of strange bleach water they offered me to drink. </i></p>
<p>Change is often spurred by events out of our control, by forces so powerful that we can only react: Creeping poverty, disease, civil war in  foreign nations, political unrest — or a Frankenstorm, as Sandy has been dubbed. As we watch this storm&#8217;s progress with the luxury of modern communication, we also have the job to react responsibly in its path — and compassionately and unselfishly in its wake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jmu.edu/stories/bethechange/disaster-relief.shtml" target="_blank">Jon McNamara (‘05)</a> with the Virginia Red Cross is in the eye of the storm, so to speak. (See the story about Jon on the JMU website.) We think about friends and family in the storm’s path. My niece in NYC who lives blocks from the evacuation zone. A friend whose most recent Facebook post was simply “evacuating.” The young mother suddenly confined to an evacuation center with three very lively children. Or the parade of utility crews in trucks heading into the red zone to help with the consequences.</p>
<p>The devastating power of a storm is uncontrollable. What <i>is</i> within our control is how we react. Susan Carter Payne also writes:  <i>For as little as I actually experienced during this catastrophe, I can only imagine the painful memories of those who endured immeasurable pain and tragic loss. Courageous seems too simple of a word to describe these people. But this is why I don’t look to famous athletes or Hollywood celebrities as my heroes…I need look no farther than the people of Nelson County, Virginia. The heart of Nelson is where true courage resides.</i></p>
<p>Thus it is with the courageous — those who suffer cataclysmic change and who react the right way to it — those who use power and its mayhem wisely. Our job — as a community that believes in the mandate of positive change — is to clean up, to restore, to heal, to lift up and to befriend — and that effort should be no less powerful than any given storm.</p>
<h5><i>I strongly recommend Stefan Bechtel’s book, </i>Roar of the Heavens<i>, which John Grisham describes as “a riveting account of what it was like to live through the most intense hurricane ever to strike the U.S. mainland.” It&#8217;s a great read.</i></h5>
