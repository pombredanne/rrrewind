			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1394" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1394"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1394" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>To mark Australia Day today (a special wave to all my Australian readers!!), I thought I&#8217;d share a few more pictures from my recent trip back to Australia.</p>
<p>Whenever I&#8217;ve travelled any distance in Australia, I&#8217;ve been constantly reminded of the awe-inspiring diversity of the spectacular landscape there; from tropical azure reefs to beautiful rainforests, from arid red deserts to white sandy beaches, sunburnt plains to luscious green hills, bustling cosmopolitan cities to tiny outback towns (population: 12). It always will be one of the things I most appreciate about the country in which I grew up.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1391" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1391"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1391" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 5" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-5.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1389" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1389"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1389" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 3" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>On my second to last day there, all I wanted to do was take a trip to one of the magnificent wine regions for a last dose of Australiana before hopping on the plane back to &#8216;Ol Blighty. The Barossa Valley, less than an hour&#8217;s drive from the city of Adelaide, is universally accepted as one of the world&#8217;s best wine regions. All the big names are here, as well as countless tiny, but wonderful, boutique wineries; if you&#8217;ve ever had a good Australian wine in your life (if not, I suggest you rectify this immediately!), chances are that it&#8217;s from precisely this spot.</p>
<p>But more than a wine-lovers paradise, it is simply the most breathtaking landscape. The leisurely drive around around the valley feels like a moving postcard, with the landscape changing every few minutes from flat roads flanked by lush emerald vineyards as far as the eye can see, to red earth, to rolling sunburnt hills and native scrub, to tiny German-settled towns perfect for a spot of antique foraging or a feast of local produce.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1390" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1390"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 4" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-4.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1393" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1393"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1393" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 7" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-7.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1388" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1388"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 2" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-2.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s just something about this place that reminds you to have a change of pace. The air feels different (somehow warmer and cleaner), the trees sway on winds that seem as lazy and syrupy as the gorgeous wines produced here, the native birds and butterflies flit happily about, and the countryside seems to just ask for you to throw down a blanket, spread it with a picnic of local gourmand delights, and lie back and just gaze at the fluffy clouds through a canopy of green vines for a few blissful minutes.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1392" href="http://agirlastyle.com/?attachment_id=1392"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1392" title="A Girl, A Style_ Barossa Valley 6" src="http://agirlastyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-girl-a-style_-barossa-valley-6.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>Do you have a place you love to go for a change of pace or a beautiful scenic day trip? I&#8217;d love to know!</p>
<p>Love, Miss B xx</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">She&#8217;s kept her public image pretty clean so far, but now Anne Hathaway is going to get dirty &#8211; Gotham City dirty, that is.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Except for a romance with an Italian real-estate developer who was charged with  fleecing investors out of millions , Hathaway has always kept the public&#8217;s attention focussed on her acting, not her life.</p>
<p>Her acting will <em>definitely </em>be in the spotlight soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Comic book fans are territorial when it comes to the portrayal of their favorite characters, even villains. Michelle Pfeiffer was an acceptable Selina Kyle in <em>Batman Returns, </em>but Halle Berry was given a Razzie award for her 2005 portrayal that appeared to drown the hopes for a Catwoman franchise once and for all.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the phenomenal success of Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Batman series, Catwoman will return to tease Christian Bale when <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>in 2012.</p>
<p>She&#8217;ll be joined by Brit actor Tom Hardy who&#8217;ll be portraying one of Batman&#8217;s most formidable and complex foes, Bane.</p>
<p>Arguably Hardy&#8217;s role will draw the most attention, as Bane has appeared before in the abomination that was 1997&#8242;s <em>Batman and Robin, </em>in which the character was portrayed as a hulking thug barely capable of stringing two words together.   <img class="alignright" src="http://superherouniverse.com/wiki/images/9/98/RobertSwenson-Bane.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="230" /></p>
<p>Critics and fans were not impressed.</p>
<p>As for Hathaway, she does have one strong voice in her corner. Julie Newmar, considered by many to be the greatest Catwoman of them all, tells The <a id="itxthook0" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=30497#">Los Angeles<img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/mag-glass_10x10.gif" alt="" /></a> Times<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2011/01/catching-up-with-the-original-catwoman-julie-newmar.html#more" target="_blank"> All The Rage</a> blog that she approves of her latest successor. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to be marvelous,&#8221; says Newmar.</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged">
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 185px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77266473@N00/398451322"><img title="Julie Newmar as Catwoman" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/398451322_5797a3e829_m.jpg" alt="Julie Newmar as Catwoman" width="175" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Chris D 2006 via Flickr</p></div>
</div>
<p>Nolan, Hathaway and Hardy have a chance to do right by these great characters, a sentiment they&#8217;ll be hearing in the near future if they head to the convention circuit to plug the upcoming film. Comic conventions, especially the <a class="zem_slink" title="San Diego Comic-Con International" rel="homepage" href="http://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>, can make or break a film&#8217;s chances of generating a positive buzz before hitting the multiplexes.</p>
<p>I know Anne Hathaway has worked for Disney and is used to crowds, but if she hasn&#8217;t hit Comic-Con before, then she&#8217;s seen nothing yet. With massive crowds exceeding 125,000 over four days, the event is so popular that 4-day passes with access to Preview night for the 2011 Convention sold out two hours <strong>before</strong> the 2010 convention closed.</p>
<p>Even with a cat&#8217;s nine lives, Halle Berry wouldn&#8217;t make it out alive.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://audubonguides.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc_0137.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Often just visible from the beaches and cliffs of the Bay Area as they rise above a thick marine fog, the Farallon Islands lie roughly 30 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge, and are therefore at least as distant from the consciousness of most of the region’s 7 million residents.  Since moving to the city of San Francisco about a year and a half ago, I had often squinted into that distance, imagining a remote paradise obscured by the gray, and scheming about how I might get there.</p>
<p>The incredible biological diversity now found on the Farallons belies a history of exploitation; 19th century fur traders all but extirpated populations of the northern fur seal, and as San Francisco’s urban population grew, egg collectors decimated colonies of seabirds that nest on the islands’ steep, rocky outcroppings.  Given that the Farallon Islands are home to the United States’ largest seabird breeding colonies south of Alaska, the economic potential for egg collectors in the 1860s was so compelling to certain Bay Area entrepreneurs that an epic rivalry between the Pacific Egg Company and some rogue collectors developed.  The most vicious episode in the Farallon Egg Wars (as they are now known) resulted in the death of at least two men!</p>
<p>Since the Farallons were designated a National Wildlife Refuge in 1909, I wasn’t so concerned with renegade egg poachers packing pistols as with run-of-the-mill seasickness when I boarded a small boat owned by the San Francisco Bay Whale Watching Company last July.  The swell and chop around the islands are legendary, but the relatively calm seas that morning were only the beginning of our good luck.  After passing under the bridge and out of the bay, we paused momentarily to watch sea lions and harbor seals in repose below the Point Bonita lighthouse, and headed for open water.  </p>
<p>As we approached the islands, one creature after another surfaced nearby, appearing with the transient splendor of fireworks.  Nobody knew where to look first as blue, gray, and humpback whales spouted, breached, and spyhopped so close that the mist of whale breath was overwhelming, and inspired me to coin a new term—whalitosis.  Closer to the rocky, guano-stained shores we began to see <a href="http://audubonguides.com/species/Birds/Common-Murre.html">common murres</a>, <a href="http://audubonguides.com/species/Birds/Pigeon-Guillemot.html">pigeon guillemots</a>, several species of cormorants, and the species I was most excited about all day—<a href="http://audubonguides.com/species/Birds/Tufted-Puffin.html">tufted puffins</a>!<br />
<img src="http://audubonguides.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc_0125_3.jpg" alt="" /><br />
A pair of these seldom-seen stunners in their summer plumage landed in the water just in<br />
front of the boat and puttered about briefly before taking off toward the smaller offshore islands.  A group of five or six Risso’s dolphins, marbled gray and white, rode noiselessly beside us as we moved toward several spouts in the distance, hoping for another whale sighting.  We turned off the engine to observe several <a href="http://audubonguides.com/species/Mammals/Humpback-Whale.html">humpback</a>s a few hundred yards away, and held our collective breath as they swam closer and closer, under the boat and back again.  The marine biologists on board speculated that these two were beginning some kind of mating ritual as they somersaulted and dove in unison, winding their enormous bodies around one another for over an hour as we watched, voyeur-like.  As the whales slowly drifted away toward some other pursuit, we reluctantly made our way back under the bridge, glowing international orange through the fog.  </p>
<p>Though I would have loved nothing more than to go ashore and see the Farallons from another perspective, I understand why I can’t. This is absolutely a place that belongs to the whales, dolphins, gulls, and guillemots, who claim their wild domain with raucous cries and the pungent smell of centuries of inhabitance, occasionally gracing us with a glimpse of their everyday, though it always seems extraordinary.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon00.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon00" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon00_thumb.jpg?w=326&#038;h=486" border="0" alt="lennon00" width="326" height="486" /></a></p>
<p>Up until last year, Japan was the home of the first John Lennon museum to be officially authorized by Yoko Ono. Housed inside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama_Super_Arena">Saitama Super Arena</a>, the 1,500-square-meter museum opened on October 9, 2000, the 60th anniversary of Lennon’s birth. It closed on September 30, 2010, when its exhibit contract with Yoko Ono expired. Over its 10-year existence, a total of about 610,000 visitors came to visit the museum.</p>
<p>I am a *huge* Beatles fan, so I made a point of visiting the museum back in 2006, just before I left Japan to start graduate school. Given how busy I was at that time, my photos from the museum remained buried in my Flickr account, untagged and untitled. Since the museum is now closed to visitors, I thought now would be an opportune time to dig them out and share them with all of you.</p>
<p>The museum housed all kinds of musical instruments, clothes, and music and lyrics from all periods of Lennon’s life; about 135 items were obtained from Yoko Ono for display. The paths took you around nine different zones from “Childhood Memories” to “The Beatles” and “Love and Peace” and finally to “Household Husband.” I was familiar with many of the pieces—thanks to my obsession with <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles_Anthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></em>—but it was incredible to see some of this memorabilia up close:</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon7.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon7" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon7_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon7" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon5.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon5" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon5_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon5" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>The museum did an excellent job of showcasing various notes and scribbles done by John Lennon. It felt very intimate to see working drafts of songs that would later become such international favorites, to note the words the Lennon had second thoughts about or last-minute changes in songs. I snapped a shot of the lyrics to “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(The_Beatles_song)">Julia</a>”:</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon1" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon1_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon1" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>Several iconic pieces were also on display, such as Lennon’s famous white piano:</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon3.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon3" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon3_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon3" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>They also exhibited a pair of his iconic glasses, which became associated with Lennon after he wore them in the film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Won_the_War">How I Won The War</a></em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon8.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon8" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon8_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon8" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that, since the museum was authorized by Yoko Ono and constructed from materials that she donated, it does tend to present a somewhat Yoko-filtered picture at times. As <a href="http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=428&amp;pID=1919#ixzz1C0SsFkni">Japan Visitor</a> points out, “the first attraction, a 7-minute movie of John Lennon&#8217;s life, makes no mention at all of his first marriage to Cynthia Powell. John&#8217;s relationship with Paul McCartney also gets minimal exposure. On the other hand, Yoko Ono&#8217;s life and works &#8211; even pre-Lennon &#8211; get very extensive coverage.” I don’t necessarily think that this detracted from the museum, but it was interesting that there was a sizable area dedicated to works of art by Yoko Ono near the end. I actually thought it was fun to see some of these pieces, some of which I had seen or read mentions of in other works about Lennon’s life. Many of the art pieces were interactive. For example, visitors were meant to climb to the top of the staircase below. At the top, a single tiny word was illuminated on the ceiling: “Yes.”</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon2.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon2" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon2_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon2" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>Another simple work featured only the numbers “1980.12.08”—white digits on a white background. It memorialized the date of Lennon’s death: December 8, 1980.</p>
<p><a href="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon4.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="lennon4" src="http://amoderngirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lennon4_thumb.jpg?w=646&#038;h=433" border="0" alt="lennon4" width="646" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>The final room of the museum was a space for solemn reflection—not necessarily on the sadness of Lennon’s death, but on all the challenges faced by the world, including those such as war that Lennon railed against during his lifetime.</p>
<p>The museum also had a couple of other features that I really enjoyed. The first was a a listening room, complete with comfy couches where you could relax and listen to your favorite Beatles or Lennon CDs on headphones. They had all of the albums available for check-out at a desk, so you could simply grab one and spend as long as you liked looking out the windows, drinking coffee, and listening to great tunes. The second feature was a great gift shop (an essential part of any good museum). I picked up a fabulous book called <em>Ai: Japan Through John Lennon’s Eyes</em>, which contained the notes and pictures that Lennon created when he was learning the Japanese language. I wish I had my copy on hand; I would scan a page or two to share with you. But I thought it was really neat—Lennon would write down various Japanese words and draw a (usually amusing) sketch to go along with it. It provided an interesting glimpse into how he looked at the world—and it was actually kind of useful for language learning.</p>
<p>In any case, I’m sad that the museum is no longer with us. When asked about her reasons for letting the contract expire, <a href="http://www.spinner.com/2010/02/05/john-lennon-museum-in-japan-closed/?loc=interstitialskip">Yoko Ono said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“John Lennon&#8217;s destiny spanned the whole world. His spirit came alive through movement, and without movement, it dies. If the Museum which houses his spirit never moved, it would be a grave, not a Museum. John does not have a grave. When he passed on, I publicly announced that I would not be holding a funeral for him. I did so because I knew his spirit would live forever.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, perhaps we’ll see the museum move to another city elsewhere in the world. <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3dxiDjsN2TmWF7JoxhEwNeUVpoA">Some sources</a> indicate that there were plans in the works to create a similar museum after the items were returned to Yoko Ono. And the annual visitor figures for the Saitama museum <em>had </em>been declining; by 2010, there were only about 30,000 visitors per year, compared to 124,000 in the year the museum first opened. So, maybe it was time for the museum to move on. In any case, I’d like to think that other people will have a chance to enjoy this great memorabilia one day.</p>

<p>Last week, I talked about setting goals. We discussed rather large, longer-term goals and how to be effective when setting them. However, one of the key components to achievable &#8220;big&#8221; goals is a clear understanding of the many &#8220;small&#8221; goals that comprise them.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Well, for example, I&#8217;m currently revising my very first <a class="zem_slink" title="NaNoWriMo" rel="homepage" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> manuscript by using <a class="zem_slink" title="Holly Lisle" rel="homepage" href="http://www.hollylisle.com/">Holly Lisle</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://howtoreviseyournovel.com/?rid=839" target="_blank">How to Revise Your Novel course</a>. This is a massive undertaking, one which I&#8217;ve been working on for the better part of a year, and a project on which I have a long way to go. So the question is: How do you manage to keep moving along when faced with such a huge prospect?</p>
<p>The answer lies in taking one small step at a time and rewarding yourself when you do. A couple years ago, I learned this technique from Holly (she is a wealth of information for writers; if you haven&#8217;t checked out her site yet, go do it now!). In her article on how to maintain your writing discipline, as well as every other bit of chaos that intrudes on your life, she suggests making a sort of &#8220;to-do&#8221; list. But this isn&#8217;t your ordinary, fridge to-do list; this is the mother of all to-do lists.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not as frightening as it sounds, and it actually works a lot better than just scribbling some notes to yourself on a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>First of all, you&#8217;ll need a corkboard, or some other board to which you can attach index cards. Obviously, you&#8217;re also gonna need some index cards. The amount doesn&#8217;t matter, as you&#8217;ll just replace them when you need new ones, and anyway, they&#8217;re cheap. In her lesson, Holly advocates using different colors for different tasks, but I don&#8217;t usually bother with that unless I feel a real need to prioritise.</p>
<p>So, make three cards: one that says &#8220;Do,&#8221; one that says &#8220;Doing,&#8221; and a third that says &#8220;Done.&#8221; Pin them (or use a magnet or whatever) across the top of the board to form three columns.</p>
<p>Now, take any index card and write today&#8217;s date in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the card, write the date by which you wish to complete this particular task. Then, on the index card itself, write something you need to do. The trick is to make it measurable and to make it manageable. For instance, &#8220;Finish revision&#8221; is not a good one for the reasons we discussed last week. However, &#8220;Finish revising Chapter 13&#8243; is. Lastly, write a line near the bottom of the card where you will eventually write the date of actual completion.</p>
<p>You can use these cards for anything you need to get done. For instance, here is mine for my students&#8217; French homework that I need to grade.<a href="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/photo-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-116" title="Grade French homework card" src="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/photo-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>(My cards happen to be red only because they were left over from something else; the color doesn&#8217;t mean anything here, although you could assign writing-related projects to green, real-life chores to red, etc.)</p>
<p>You should only make enough cards for the next week or so. Then, once you have them made, pin them up in the first column under &#8220;Do.&#8221; As you work on your projects, move them across the board to the other columns. Be sure to put it under the &#8220;Done&#8221; card when you are actually done! This visual signal is more rewarding than you might think, and it gives you a real sense of accomplishment to see them pile up on the right side of the board.</p>
<p>Once you have started some more cards under the &#8220;Do&#8221; column, discard the old done cards as you need space, or if you have recurring things such as &#8220;Grocery shopping by Saturday,&#8221; you could start its march across the board once more.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of my current to-do board (sorry the quality isn&#8217;t very good at all):</p>
<p><a href="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/photo-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-117" title="To-Do Board" src="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/photo-2-e1296091768154.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been too long since I&#8217;ve used this handy tool for, but every time I keep it up, I feel much more productive and I can stop stressing about what I need to do since it is all right there to look at. Also, by assigning the dates by which I need to finish certain tasks, I am assured that I can be free to write since I know I will have to do other things by X date.</p>
<p>I hope this technique helps you stay organised and efficient! What methods do you use to stay on track? How would you modify this board for your particular needs?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I write this, our backyard is covered in several inches of snow. It began about 3:00 p.m. this afternoon and didn&#8217;t stop until this evening. The snow fell fast and heavy and all the tree branches are outlined in white (a feast for the eyes, but not so good for the trees). Photographic opportunities abound tomorrow morning! Until then, I offer up some color from my garden last spring to contrast the white on white wonderland out there now. Could the <em>Farmer&#8217;s Almanac </em>really be correct? It is really only 52 days until spring?</p>
<p>This &#8216;Nelly Moser&#8217; Clematis has been growing over our tiny backyard pond for more than nine years. In the spring of 2008 it had its most prolific blooming period ever. I wrote about it on this blog <a href="http://cindydyer.wordpress.com/2008/05/08/about-a-boy-and-his-blooms/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

You don’t have to. Review these ten easy steps to improve time management and once you’ve applied them, you should experience a significant reduction in stress. You’ll also be one step ahead on the path to personal and professional excellence!</p>
<p><strong>1. Set goals</strong></p>
<p>Set goals, both at work and at home, to determine exactly what it is that you want to achieve. You will use these goals later to help prioritise and decide what tasks and activities you should work on, and in which order.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Plan</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important steps to improving both personal and professional time management is planning.</p>
<p>When planning your schedule, be realistic: what can you really achieve with each time slot during your day? Be sure not to over-commit yourself to others, which will cause unnecessary stress. There is a limit to what you can get done each day. Use your goals and priorities to ensure you have enough time for the things you absolutely must accomplish during each week.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to leave time each day to handle the unexpected. Things come up, and your schedule must be flexible enough to handle changes without causing additional stress.</p>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<p><strong>3. Prioritise</strong></p>
<p>Write your goals on a list you can keep close at hand during the day, at least until you grow accustomed to your new system. Assign incoming tasks according to a priority system: 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C, or even a colour system. Use whichever you prefer, and add as many levels of importance as you think you need, without overcomplicating the system. Unnecessary complication can add to stress.</p>
<p>When preparing your weekly schedule, make sure the tasks you work on during the day are the ones with the highest priority. Fill in time blocks to complete these tasks first, then move to your second priority. If you still have time (keeping in mind to leave contingency space for the unexpected), then move on to your third category. If not, see if you can delegate the task to someone else. If not, avoid committing to the task.</p>
<p>Remember: each time you are given a new assignment, analyse it for importance and prioritize it accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have an existing task or to do list for this week, prioritize it now.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Set deadlines </strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve got your goals, priorities, and schedule clear, review your deadlines. Chances are, you’ve already been given deadlines for most of your tasks. If not, make your own, taking into consideration your priority criteria. If you let tasks float around without being formally added to your schedule, odds are you’ll procrastinate on them and they won’t get done until you’re asked about them…and by that time, you’ll most likely be expected to deliver ASAP, causing unnecessary stress.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep an activity log</strong></p>
<p>During your first week with your new system, keep an activity log. This is a valuable tool that can help you understand how you spend your time. Set up a quick Excel sheet (or use a simple piece of paper) with four columns: Time (of day), Activity, Duration, Priority, and Energy. As you work on each task throughout the day, simply note down the things you do as you do them: what time of day it is, a brief description of the activity, how much time you spent on it, what priority rating you give the task, and your energy level while you worked on the task.</p>
<p>Once the week is over, use the log to look for ways to avoid wasting time and effort during the week. Also note what hours of the day you are most productive, taking into consideration your energy level. This can help determine when you perform at your best and help you organize your day to take advantage of your natural highs and lows in energy. Some people naturally work better in the morning, and others in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After you’ve noted which are your best hours, be sure to schedule your most challenging tasks for the times of day when your own energy level is highest. If you don’t take this into consideration, you may end up scheduling tasks that require high levels of concentration during hours when you’re naturally at an energy low. This can lead to unnecessary stress. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. End procrastination…now!</strong></p>
<p>You’ve already made sure that each task has its own deadline, so you’re clear about when things are due. Don’t delay tasks that you perceive as less desirable until the last minute. They won’t disappear on their own, and you’ve got to get them done at some point, so it’s best to just get them over with. The peace of mind you’ll get from completing what you perceive to be a less desirable task will help reduce stress and will help you move on with the rest of your tasks.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an email in your inbox that you’ve read and re-read, go straight to it and reply the next time you’re checking your mail. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Minimise distractions</strong></p>
<p>Distractions can keep you from working on priority tasks. You know what they are: email, instant messaging, phone calls, the internet, co-workers, or a noisy environment. Keep a week-long interruption log, similar to your activity log. Make note of Time (of day), Interruption, Duration, and Priority (which of your goals did it affect, and what is the priority of that goal?). Once the week is over, use the log to look for ways to avoid interruptions during the week, thus reducing unnecessary stress. Also note what hours of the day you receive the most interruptions. Take this into account when planning your weekly schedule.</p>
<p>To avoid email interruption, try to minimize the number of times a day you check your email, reading and replying to e-mails in blocks only a few times each day. Be sure to notify your boss if you have one, and other co-workers of your new policy. See if you can reduce email time to three blocks each day: morning, when you get in, before or after lunch, and just before you leave. Again, be sure to take into consideration the priority of each email before dedicating time to it. And, keep your personal email separate from your professional email by using separate accounts and folders. Disable all email alerts, such as pop-ups or sounds to reduce the temptation to check constantly.</p>
<p>If you aren’t required to use instant messaging at work, then don’t. Set up your messenger so that it doesn’t automatically log on when you start your computer, or set your status to invisible. Only use it when you need to reach someone, then immediately change your status or get offline. If you must use an IM system at work, try keeping your status to Busy to discourage unimportant messages. The same goes for Skype.</p>
<p>Do you really need to answer the phone as it rings, or can you use voice mail to treat it as you do your email? Some jobs require that you be always available by phone. Take some time to think about your job and the type of calls you receive. Are they all urgent and important? Are they all in your top priority status? If not, try letting some calls go directly to your assistant if you have one, or to voicemail. See how that works for you. The same goes for your cell phone and Skype. This is especially useful if you are on a deadline or working on a task that requires maximum concentration.</p>
<p>How much do you use the internet while you’re at work? Do you really need to? If you need to browse the web for research or information, be sure you stick to that and don’t get distracted by social media or random browsing. If you use a feed reader to browse work-related news, review your feed list regularly to delete feeds that don’t directly relate to your top priorities.</p>
<p>Are co-workers interrupting you on a constant basis? If you work in an open office environment, try using headphones with nature sounds or calm, non-distracting music. This can help you create your own peaceful micro-world, and make co-workers think twice before speaking to you. If this is not effective, speak respectfully and directly with the person about the issue. If you have a closed office with a door, you might also want to schedule an hour a day when you simply close the door. If you’re a manager, you don’t want to abuse your closed-door hours, but an hour a day should be enough to give you some extra concentration time. Be sure to make this during the hour of the day when you’re naturally most productive.</p>
<p>Try to minimise the number of times that you change between types of tasks. This can help improve concentration. For example, rather than replying to emails constantly throughout the day, schedule it in blocks as mentioned above. Do the same for other types of tasks that you perform repeatedly throughout the week.</p>
<p><strong>8. Plan for mini-breaks</strong></p>
<p>You know you’re not a robot, so don’t act like you are. Everyone has natural highs and lows in energy levels, as you’ve already noted in your log. If you plod through your tasks without a single break, odd are you’ll burn out even faster, and it will take you longer to complete each task. Just a five minute break can be effective. Be sure to get up from your desk or work area once each hour (set an alarm if you need to remind yourself and don’t find it distracting, or plan to take a mini-break between task types), get a glass of water, and stretch a bit before returning to your work area. Something as simple as drinking a glass of water will rehydrate you and can give you an extra energy boost. This can make a huge difference in fully taking advantage of time by keeping energy levels at their max and reducing stress.</p>
<p><strong>9. Avoid sleepiness</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to get enough sleep each night. Different people require different amounts of sleep. If you’re unsure how much you need, keep a sleep log and track how much you slept each night during the week and what your energy levels and productivity were like the next day at work. Sleepiness can lead to unproductive work days and distraction, causing stress as you realise how little work is getting done.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still feeling tired at work, go outside for a walk as part of one of your mini-breaks. This will help you get some fresh air and move around, which may help increase your energy levels and productivity.</p>
<p><strong>10. Watch what you eat and drink</strong></p>
<p>When you don&#8217;t drink enough water throughout the day, you quickly become dehydrated, and you may not be able to think clearly and focus on your work. There are a couple of ways to stay hydrated: either keep a large water bottle on your desk, and drink it regularly throughout the day, or integrate water drinking into your hourly mini-break.</p>
<p>What you eat may also influence how tired you feel throughout the day. Avoid heavy lunches, and be sure to bring snacks for mid-morning and afternoon. In the same way that dehydration can lead to drowsiness, so can hunger. A small snack of fruit and nuts can bring your energy level up in a way that won’t leave you crashing later, as sugar or caffeine can.</p>
<p>Does all of that sound easy enough? It’s a step by step process, so it’s easy to make huge changes in time management one step at a time. Let me know if you try this system, and how it works for you. Also be sure to comment if you have any additional tips.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">My 4 year old daughter is a clever, smart, and overall incredibly intelligent child.  She knows her letters and sounds, can read and write simple words, and has even madeup some pretty funny jokes all by herself.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Every time she gets ahold of my binoculars she insists on holding them backwards (so that things seem far away instead of closer) AND THEN she walks into things because they look so far away.  Every.  Single.  Time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_770" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://blockader.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/140-01.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-770" title="140-01" src="http://blockader.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/140-01.jpg?w=210&#038;h=271" alt="" width="210" height="271" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">.</p></div>
<p>I think, if I can make just one person in the world laugh each day, then that&#8217;s one person each day that I made laugh in the world.</p>
<p>In the broad scheme of things, as the way the world turns, that may not seem like much of a big deal.</p>
<p>Yet, for that one person laughing, it could mean a world of difference  in whatever they are dealing with that day.</p>
<p>If that one person who I have helped feel better is then inspired to share a smile, lend a helping hand, encourge, befriend, laugh outloud or brighten the lives of those around them, then, in that small, tiny way, the world becomes a better place.</p>
<p>And if those feelings bloom, take root and catch fire from there, spreading from person to person, in spite of difference, opinions, beliefs, traditions, customs, prejudices, barriers, borders and hatreds, it can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>So making one person laugh can make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>But today, if I can make you laugh, and put a smile on your face, then that means the world to me.</p>
