<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The Mail on Sunday&#8217;s front page from 16th December 2012</em></p>
<p>There are three factors which define my response this story. I am a human being, a Goth, and a Journalist.<br />
As a human being, I abhor and reject the horrific violence committed in Newton, Connecticut. As a Goth, I abhor and reject any association with my subculture, and fear the demonizing effect of headlines like this. As a journalist, I abhor and reject the kind of &#8216;journalism&#8217; that has led the Daily Mail to such knee-jerk reactionary headline writing. The Goth tag has been attached to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2248645/Nancy-Lanza-Mother-murderer-Adam-Lanza-avid-gun-collector-taught-sons-use-firearms.html#ixzz2FQ8yifA7" target="_blank">this story</a> because of the following quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Catherine Urso, who was attending a vigil Friday evening in Newtown said her college-age son knew the killer and remembered him for his alternative style.</p>
<p>&#8216;He just said he was very thin, very remote and was one of the goths,&#8217; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>A second-hand recollection from someone not even involved. The implication is that the world is struggling to try and understand what could motivate such a crime, and the Daily Mail &#8211; with characteristic unfeeling insensitivity &#8211; has chosen a marginalized and misunderstood group to &#8216;take the blame&#8217;. Ironically, the Mail has previously written about <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2063122/Attacked-goth-Thugs-stamped-Melodys-face-times--looked.html" target="_blank">attacks on Goths</a> in a supportive light, especially the tragic case of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1017121/Jailed-life-Binge-drinking-feral-thugs-kicked-death-gap-year-student-dressed-Goth.html" target="_blank">Sophie Lancaster</a> who was killed in an unprovoked assault in 2007. Since then her mother and others have worked tirelessly to promote diversity and tolerance; the S.O.P.H.I.E. charity <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesophielancasterfoundation/posts/10151200655853871" target="_blank">released a statement</a> in response on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>The demonisation of subcultures, in this case goth/gamer/alternative does nothing to help anyone understand why Adam Lanza woke up on Thursday and killed 20 people including his own Mother. Our frustration at this lazy journalism, where they are quoting distraught ex pupils and neighbours because they have no facts is made worse by the fact that the readers of the articles may well believe what they see and not challenge it, leading to yet more prejudice and fear.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/978-1-86189-301-7-frontcover.jpg"><img class="alignleft" id="i-98" alt="Image" src="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/978-1-86189-301-7-frontcover.jpg?w=268&#038;h=377" width="268" height="377" /></a>Crucially, the Daily Mail failed to interview any representatives from the Goth subculture about their reactions. All responses, including what you are reading now, have been self-motivated &#8211; because for some reason, the majority of the mainstream media of the <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/article4700544.ece" target="_blank">United Kingdom</a> and<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/15/conn-gunman-recalled-as-intelligent-but-remote/" target="_blank"> the United States</a> will not give us a voice.<a href="http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10112091.Mum_of_murdered_teenager_Sophie_Lancaster_slams_US_killer_s__goth__label/" target="_blank"> Notable exceptions exist</a> amongst unbiased, regional media but the large part the Goth culture is sorely unrepresented in the press. When we are portrayed, observes <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/english/profiles/Catherine-Spooner/" target="_blank">Dr Catherine Spooner</a> of Lancaster University (author of several social studies of the Goth culture), it is through a veil of journalistic interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>‘Goth’ is sometimes used in high school slang as an insult or as shorthand for kids perceived as outsiders or weirdos, regardless of whether or not they self-identify as Goths or have any affiliations with the Goth scene. By labelling Lanza as a Goth on the basis of hearsay, apparently objective journalism ‘fixes’ this loose, slang use of the term, converting it into a firm evocation of a specific subculture and identity.<br />
Many readers will not discern that this process of fixing has taken place, and therefore this loose term takes on the status of ‘official’ knowledge: Lanza was a Goth and Goths are weirdos and outsiders.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It goes without saying that the evidence for the former is flimsy and the latter becomes self-fulfilling for those doing the labelling. This may seem a minor detail beside the larger fact of the tragedy. But scapegoating Goths is not going to help matters and may, in fact, cause further harm.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This view is concurred by <a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/sociology/people/paul_hodkinson/" target="_blank">Dr Paul Hodkinson</a> of Surrey University &#8211; another social scientist &#8211; who expands on the newspaper relationship with the<a href="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/51ycnavhctl-_sl500_aa300_.jpg"><img class="alignright" id="i-93" alt="Image" src="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/51ycnavhctl-_sl500_aa300_.jpg?w=312&#038;h=312" width="312" height="312" /></a> Goth Culture.</p>
<blockquote><p>Newspapers like to develop familiar stories with familiar characters and will sometimes filter the information available in order to do so. So the reason they have picked up on use of the word ‘goth’ here is that, for them, it acts as the perfect narrative device to render the killer as deviant, different, other – external to normal society and not one of ‘us’ – and imagined ‘normal society’.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Paradoxically, however, the reference to things like goth may also serve to enable the development of a different angle of engagement, based on engaging the fears of parents  and others over the possible links between dark subcultures their own children may have contact with and this sort of violence.</div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>In our discussion, I asked Dr Hodkinson if he could expand on this &#8216;different angle&#8217;, in terms of the fears being developed by parents of Goths now faced with the possibility of association between this crime, and their own children. He responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;there is  little evidence of any link to the goth scene and, even if there were, there’s certainly no evidence that the goth scene would encourage anyone to behave in such a way. In this article the term goth really has been put into the headline here purely as a means of drawing in more readers for the reasons I previously gave. They don’t even purport to be presenting a serious article about the dangers of the goth scene – they’ve just mentioned the term because it embellishes the profile and makes good copy.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems clear that the labelling of him as a goth is based on minimal evidence. More importantly, the issue of whether he identified as a goth, a gamer, a nerd or anything similar is almost certainly irrelevant to determining the cause of the horrible events that took place.</p></blockquote>
<p>I questioned Dr Hodkinson&#8217;s conviction that, in the face of the beliefs broadcast by the Daily Mail, The Sun and the FOX Network, any motivation for Lanza&#8217;s murder-spree could not include his subcultural associations.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think what I’d briefly say is that there is no evidence that they have a negative influence of the kind discussed. Millions of people are goths, gamers, ‘geeks’ etc across the world. Aside from anecdotal speculation in relation to the occasional isolated incident such as this, I’m not aware of any evidence that, amongst these millions of people, there is any substantial problem with violence. In the case of goths, evidence points towards an emphasis in the values of the group towards non-violence and, as I’m sure you know, goths are much more likely to be the subject of violent attack than the perpetrators of violence.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bwr2.jpg"><img class="alignleft" id="i-111" alt="Image" src="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bwr2.jpg?w=230&#038;h=303" width="230" height="303" /></a>As mentioned above this has been the case, with the stories of assaults on Goths as reported by both the Daily Mail and <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/justice/1098999/Teenagers-to-face-sentence-for-murder-of-goth-Sophie-Lancaster-in-Bacup-Lancashire.html" target="_blank">The Sun</a>. This time however, the reporting of these two papers has been met with disbelief, sadness and hostility by the culture. Well-known DJ and promoter <a href="http://www.martinoldgoth.co.uk/" target="_blank">Martin &#8216;Oldgoth&#8217; Coles</a> responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>One passing comment about him being a loner &#8216;like the goths&#8217;, has been seized upon and used, in my opinion, maliciously by two of the UK biggest &#8216;news&#8217; papers (The Sun and Mail) purely in order to create a shock headline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin observes some of the underlying issues that have surrounded other tragic shootings which have lacked any &#8216;Goth&#8217; angle.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you read about his background, and in particular his day to day behaviour it just points to the fact that what the US [needs] is not only tighter gun control &#8211; to prevent things like assault rifles being obtained so easily (who really needs one to &#8216;defend&#8217; themselves or their property?) &#8211; but better mental health care. I firmly believe that had this guy been given proper treatment then this would never have happened, and it helps to highlight that so people get the help they need.</p></blockquote>
<p>He firmly believes that the media&#8217;s performance is crucial to understanding crimes like these.</p>
<blockquote><p>The media has fueled this kind of thing, 100%, and I feel is totally to blame for sensationalising the idea that doing this will have you going out in a &#8216;blaze of glory&#8217;, with all the worldwide fame that comes with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concluding firmly, Martin states:</p>
<blockquote><p>This guy did not attack anyone because of the music he listened to, he resorted to murder as never got the help he needed and had easy access to lethal weapons in a world where violence of this kind makes you famous, gets you noticed in a world that I&#8217;m sure he thought didn&#8217;t care.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/photo-credit-holly-fairclough.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" id="i-133" alt="Image" src="http://tychoanomaly.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/photo-credit-holly-fairclough.jpg?w=301&#038;h=443" width="301" height="443" /></a></p>
<p>I also e-mailed Rosie Garland, better known as<a href="http://www.rosielugosi.com/wp/" target="_blank"> Rosie Lugosi</a> &#8211; singer with legendary Eighties dark rock band <a href="http://www.marchviolets.co.uk/" target="_blank">The March Violets</a>, as well as an award-winning poet, author, and sought-after compère. Her prompt response to my questions about her feelings on the reporting simply said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So &#8211; the Leveson Enquiry into improving press standards is clearly having a massive effect on the tabloids.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/liisa-ladouceur/adam-lanza-goth_b_2316144.html" target="_blank">Goth community online has united</a> to <a href="http://louderthanwar.com/why-is-connecticut-killer-adam-lanza-being-called-the-goth-killer/" target="_blank">condemn the portrayal of the culture</a> by headlines like this. The quotes used above were taken from responses gained within hours of publication by the Daily Mail and other outlets, none of whom had researched the scene or interviewed any relevant commentators. An <a href="http://db.tt/Cd54L8kh" target="_blank">e-mail to the Daily Mail asking for comment</a> to be used in this article remains unanswered after a day, in comparison. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>The Goth culture so rarely hits the headlines for the best reasons. In this case, blame has been laid at a subculture&#8217;s door when no proof has been obtained &#8211; an act that goes beyond &#8216;lazy&#8217; journalism and into the realms of downright dangerous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0121.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2286 aligncenter" title="The Sitting Buddha" alt="The Sitting Buddha" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0121.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our second day in Bhutan began with breakfast at the hotel and a drive up the mountainside near Thimphu. Fin was taking us to see Bhutan&#8217;s sitting Buddha &#8212; what will soon be the largest sitting Buddha in the world at nearly 170 feet tall. Bhutan is so small, and yet this Buddha is SO big &#8212; facing east, overlooking the valley and enormous in scale as you begin to approach it. The mountainside has been carved away and flattened out, with a massive expanse of concrete where the Buddha sits at the west side. The Buddha emanates good energy and happiness to everything in the vicinity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2235" alt="The Sitting Buddha" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan013.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Construction of the sitting Buddha is an exercise in international cooperation &#8212; funded by a Singaporean, constructed by Indians, with metal work completed by Chinese and land supplied by Bhutan. The project was started about six years ago and is nearing completion, although quite a bit later than expected. The Buddha was created in China and shipped to Bhutan in pieces, where it has been welded together on site.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0141.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2300 aligncenter" title="The Sitting Buddha" alt="The Sitting Buddha" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0141.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The cone-shaped third eye at the forehead is five feet across and encrusted with diamonds. The hair is deep sapphire blue, the face with well-defined features and a gaze that looks past you toward the edge of the mountain. In the Bhutanese sun, the entire Buddha glows brightly against the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2237" alt="The Sitting Buddha" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan015.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0161.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2304" alt="Thimphu" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0161.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>From the site of the sitting Buddha there&#8217;s a terrific view of Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan. From here, we were headed across town to the hillside on the north side of the city to do a morning hike at Sangaygang.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0171.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" alt="Sangaygang" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0171.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The hillside at Sangaygang has been joyfully overtaken with prayer flags strewn in every direction. From here, the trail climbs steeply up and leads to several monasteries and meditation sites in the hills.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0181.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2307" alt="Sangaygang" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0181.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The current king&#8217;s residence, Samtenling Palace, isn&#8217;t far from here &#8212; we were able to get a glimpse through the trees. According to Fin, the fourth and former king (Jigme Singye Wangchuck or K4, as he&#8217;s known) is 57 years old and enjoys mountain biking on this trail. No wonder &#8212; it&#8217;s great single track with wide open views of the valley. Bhutan definitely has the terrain to become a world-class mountain biking destination of the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2308" alt="Wangditse Goemba" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0191.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>At the top of the hill we reached Wangditse Goemba, founded around 1750. A large prayer wheel stands at the south side, with prayer flags staked along the edge of the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0201.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2309" alt="Wangditse Goemba" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0201.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>

<p>All over Bhutan, groups of 108 tall white prayer flags mark significant locations and memorialize people who have passed away. In Mahayana Buddhism, 108 is an auspicious number referencing 108 volumes of the Kangyur &#8212; a collection of the words of the Buddha. White prayer flags symbolize air, while blue, red, green and yellow symbolize space, fire, water and earth. Traditionally, mantras were printed on prayer flags with wood blocks. Wind spreads the peace, goodwill and blessings of prayer flags to everyone and everything around them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan023.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2245" alt="The Takin" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan023.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>From Sangaygang, we drove down the hill and stopped to see Bhutan&#8217;s national animal &#8212; the takin. Thimphu has a takin preserve (free admission), with fenced acreage on which they can roam with barking deer. Takins are strange looking animals. Legend has it they were created when Bhutan&#8217;s Divine Madman put the head of a goat on the body of a cow and brought his new creation to life.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0451.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2311" alt="Bhutanese architecture" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0451.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>A new building at the takin preserve will open someday as a museum and visitors center. It was amazing to see such beautiful new architecture, with ornamental spirit and exquisite hand-painted detail. Traditional artistry is very clearly valued, preserved and passed on throughout Bhutan.</p>

<p>Departing the takin preserve, we stopped to watch this young woman weaving on a loom. She displayed stacks and stacks of colorful raw silk and cotton scarves she had created while overseeing the entrance to the preserve. I picked up a little souvenir for myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0251.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2315" alt="Thimphu Royal Golf Club" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0251.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Back on the road, we drove into downtown Thimphu for lunch, passing the Royal Thimphu Golf Club along the way. Quite a few golfers were out on the course enjoying the sunshine amidst a few deep water hazards.</p>
<p>We ate lunch on the top floor of a building downtown &#8212; fried dumplings, buckwheat noodles, potatoes, vegetables and the usual Bhutanese chili-cheese combo. Fin, owner of <a title="Bridge to Bhutan" href="http://www.bridgetobhutan.com/" target="_blank">Bridge to Bhutan</a> who had accompanied us for our first 24 hours in Bhutan, introduced us to our official guide and driver who would take us from there. We were sad to see Fin go, but Kinga and Kumar were fun, well-educated companions from whom we would learn even more about life in Bhutan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan026.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2248" alt="Thimphu Post Office" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan026.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>After lunch, Kinga and Kumar escorted us to the bank and the post office &#8212; the latter being well worth a stop on anyone&#8217;s itinerary. Bhutan has a rich history of stamp production, with elaborate and beautiful stamps from the past several decades celebrating everything from Olympic sports to aviation to Bhutanese folk lore to butterflies of Bhutan. Best of all, you can have your photo taken and printed on Bhutanese stamps you can use on the post cards you send home! So cool! Check the mail, mom, but it might take a few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0271.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2317" alt="Jungshi Handmade Paper Factory" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0271.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>After the post office, we were off on an afternoon tour of Thimphu which started with the Jungshi Handmade Paper Factory. Housed in a one-story white building, the operation begins outside where fibers are soaked, boiled and cooled, then dumped in a heap on a table inside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan028.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2250" alt="Jungshi Handmade Paper Factory" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan028.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan030a1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2318" alt="The grinder" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan030a1.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The fibers are processed into pulp using an old grinder. The pulp is poured into a sink where it&#8217;s spread onto a screen, then the screen is lifted out and the paper is placed in a stack where it releases water and dries into sheets.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0311.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2319" alt="Spreading the pulp" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0311.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>

<p>When dry, the paper is hung up one piece at a time, brushed off and stamped with a logo. Jungshi has a small paper shop on site where you can buy the paper, posters and journals they produce.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0371.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2323" alt="Archery competition" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0371.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Leaving the paper factory, we made an impromptu stop at an archery range where an afternoon competition was taking place. In retrospect, the 20 minutes we spent here is one of my favorite memories from the entire trip. Archery is Bhutan&#8217;s national sport, practiced with great enthusiasm all over the country.</p>
<p>About two dozen archers were at the north and south ends of the archery range which was 140 meters long. (What a VAST distance to cover with a traditional bow and arrow, not to mention the tiny target which is about the size of a dinner plate.) Archers at the south end of the range took turns shooting while archers at the north end stood behind concrete walls, out of danger, waiting to see if their arrows hit the target. When the archers at the south end had finished, the archers at the north end similarly took their shots.</p>
<p>When we arrived, an archer at the south end had just hit the target near us which brought about a synchronized &#8220;dance&#8221; with singing and shouting by all the archers at the north end of the field. Quite a production, no doubt steeped in years and years of tradition.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0381.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2324" alt="Archery competition" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0381.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>After the dance, the archers at the north end took turns shooting their arrows. Ready, aim, fire&#8230; then they each waited for shouts and hollers to see if they scored.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan039.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2261" alt="Archery Competition" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan039.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan040.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2262" alt="Archery Competition" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan040.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0411.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2325" alt="Archery competition" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0411.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>If I ever return to Bhutan, I hope to spend more time watching archery. It&#8217;s fun, spirited and pretty incredible to see these sharp shooters in action, even as an occasional dog wanders in front of the target. Just two Bhutanese athletes competed in the 2012 Olympic games &#8212; both female, and one of them in archery. It&#8217;s a sport loved by men and women alike.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0421.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2327" alt="Trashi Chhoe Dzong" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0421.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The sun was setting and that was our cue to get to the Trashi Chhoe Dzong for the changing of the guard &#8212; newly implemented since last year&#8217;s wedding of King and Queen Wangchuck. We walked to the far end of the dzong where soldiers were assembling to march out and lower Bhutan&#8217;s flag.</p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0431.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2328" alt="Trashi Chhoe Dzong" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0431.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0441.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2329" alt="Changing of the Guard" src="http://compassandcamera.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bhutan0441.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>In a ceremony that lasted about 15 minutes (I&#8217;m hoping to get video up soon!), a monk led the procession from the dzong to the flag, then the flag was lowered, rolled, carried inside and stowed until the next morning.</p>
<p>I reflected on the day&#8217;s events over dinner at the hotel. We had canvassed Thimphu from morning to dusk, capturing many moments of daily life in Bhutan that didn&#8217;t seem all that different from my own life: hiking, golf, archery, paper making, the post office and bank, a dzong, the takins and one big, giant Buddha (okay, that part was very different). It was all foreign, yet not unfamiliar. Fascinating, yet similar. Strangers, yet people who are just like me and you. It was a day of adventure for sure, yet just an ordinary day in the life of Bhutan.</p>

Bhujodi, a small village about ten kilometers east of Bhuj is inhabited by several craftsmen who specialize in hand-loom weaving. Besides the fact that artisans welcomed us to their homes as if we were family, they shared their knowledge with passion and without a second thought about selling anything to us.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving05/" rel="attachment wp-att-317"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-317" alt="weaving05" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving05.jpg?w=590"   /></a>First we meet Narayan-bhai and his son. They specialize in the manufacture of woollen carpets. Today it is a bit special, they are preparing for Diwali, the Indian New Year, so are coating the walls of their home with a mixture of mud, lime and cow-dung.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving08/" rel="attachment wp-att-320"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-320" alt="weaving08" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving08.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>However seeing our excitement to watch the looms work, they settle down at their looms and start weaving a carpet. Although I&#8217;ve seen weaving work before, I am fascinated! Beyond the technical moves that are impressive, the complexity and beauty of the machine leaves me speechless. All these lines, these regular movements, these colors &#8230; create an atmosphere that is truly mesmerizing!</p>
<p>They have 2 looms, fully manual. The one that Naryanbhai uses</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving01/" rel="attachment wp-att-313"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-313" alt="weaving01" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving01.jpg?w=590"   /></a>and the other handled by his son:</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving02/" rel="attachment wp-att-314"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-314" alt="weaving02" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving02.jpg?w=590"   /></a>My wife and I sit there for a long time just watching them work. Most of their production is for a client from Finland! They take about 1 day to make 1 carpet.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving03/" rel="attachment wp-att-315"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-315" alt="weaving03" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving03.jpg?w=590"   /></a>They are proud to show that they have designed a carpet with three different types of wool: camel, black sheep and white sheep.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving04/" rel="attachment wp-att-316"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-316" alt="weaving04" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving04.jpg?w=590"   /></a>They say they love the creative side of their craft, but do not have enough time to truly experiment since they need to produce carpets for the Finnish which are large orders and are always the same : gray and white&#8230;&#8221;european tastes!&#8221; they say.</p>
<p>And then there is Purushothambhai. If you can read the name correctly the first time you win a silk shawl <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  We had not even planned to visit his home, he catches us on the streets and says &#8220;come and see, I have something to show you.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving10/" rel="attachment wp-att-322"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322" alt="weaving10" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving10.jpg?w=590"   /></a>He begins by showing us a series of very finely woven shawls with a mixture of silk and cotton, then take us to his loom. It is much narrower than Naryanbhai because it is used to make scarves and shawls but it is equally impressive.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving07/" rel="attachment wp-att-319"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-319" alt="weaving07" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving07.jpg?w=590"   /></a> The thread is much thinner, and the weaving takes longer. Depending on the type of pattern, a piece can take up to 1 month. The method for doing this kind of pattern is inexplicable in writing, it has been a good half an hour to figure out how he is doing it! Purushothambhai is first and foremost an artist, he creates his own designs, his own forms &#8230; He sells his works everywhere in India, at exhibitions and events related to crafts.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/312/weaving09/" rel="attachment wp-att-321"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-321" alt="weaving09" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving09.jpg?w=590"   /></a>He tells us this moving story of how he once set off to create his &#8220;best&#8221; piece, he had already given three months of hardwork into it and while it was still on the loom and nearly complete, an insect ate into it. This piece hence will never get sold. But will remain with him to tell his story.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeinkachchh.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/the-challenge-of-eating-less-but-better/weaving11/" rel="attachment wp-att-327"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-327" alt="weaving11" src="http://madeinkachchh.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/weaving11.jpg?w=590"   /></a>To be able to feel the connection between knowledge and the product is really a unique experience, it gives a new perspective on the value of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;The industrial era&#8221; helped us make a bunch of objects accessible in large numbers and at a price much more affordable than products that are &#8220;handmade&#8221;. This is what allows us to not have to save for two months to buy a pair of trousers, that I personally find quite handy &#8230; However, this &#8220;progress&#8221; has totally engulfed our concept of the &#8220;value&#8221; of things.</p>
<p>There is little or no information on the conditions under which the products we use are made, by whom, with what, with what impact on the environment and on society more generally. Take the time to take this step to &#8220;understand&#8221; a product, to look at it differently and go back again to the challenge of <i>eating &#8220;less&#8221; but &#8220;better&#8221;.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="July 2006 020 Cloud Painting by Fractal Artist, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8720628@N04/2217496745/"><img class="alignright" alt="July 2006 020 Cloud Painting" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2148/2217496745_0eab774af3.jpg" width="245" height="184" /></a>Dreams are a funny business.  Some people spend their whole life chasing, reaching out, trying to get them, but rarely are they a catch-all to happiness if reached.  Some people are empowered by their dreams.  They can rejuvenate and re-energize.  Others grow bitter and despondent at the things in life that never were or never will be.</p>
<p>As kids we dream of the world.  I remember when I was young.  My dad had a map of the United States hanging in his shop.  In my mind, through my young eyes, it&#8217;s still ten feet across, but in reality I&#8217;m sure it was much less.  San Francisco, New York, Miami, Texas.  They were like faraway treasures only seen in movies.  Our town wasn&#8217;t even a faint dot on the map.  Population 1,200 doesn&#8217;t show up at that scale.  The Grand Canyon, giant redwood trees, the rolling ocean, and the Empire State Building filled my imagination.  The world seemed endless.  And I hadn&#8217;t even begun to think beyond the U.S.</p>
<p>By 23 I had talked my way into a 16-day, solo motorcycling camping trip for my final three credits of college.  I dipped my toes into the Pacific ocean, gazed across the Grand Canyon, and drove through the smoldering heat of Death Valley in late June and the snow-capped Rocky Mountains near the top of the world.  I&#8217;d lived in Florida for a year and moved back to the Midwest.</p>
<p>Once grown, everything shrinks.  Sometimes, so do our dreams.  But dreams are important, and we should never stop dreaming.  They can free us us from our routine and rut of life and set us on the most amazing new paths.</p>
<p>A few years back I read of a middle-aged couple who sold their house, their belongings, everything but the clothes on their back.  They packed up their motorcycle and set out to live life on the road, experiencing the world together.  They were true romantics.  They were dreamers.  The world is full of them.</p>
<p>I remember flying home for my sister&#8217;s wedding.  We stopped by the local bar, the only bar really in a town of 1,200 people.  Kids I&#8217;d gone to high school with drank beer and did shots and cracked jokes.  I drank in silence.  I thought of something I&#8217;d heard someone ask once, &#8220;Would you rather work one job for thirty years or thirty different jobs for one year each?&#8221;  Those people there seemed to be of the former.  I was the latter, and it all seemed so sad.</p>
<p>A year later I moved back home and realized I&#8217;d had it wrong.  They just had different dreams.  Family glued it all together in my mind.  Nieces and nephews ran rampant.  I got a job, one I could call a career.  I got promoted.  I got promoted again.  I bought a flat screen television.  And a car.  And worked 60 hours a week, spending my nights watching reruns of <em>The Daily Show</em> or <em>Keeping up with the Kardashian</em>s or some <em>Seinfeld </em>episode for the sixth time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never contemplated suicide, but that isn&#8217;t the same as embracing life.  Or not wishing for death.  An old friend complained to me out of the blue, saying he would never kill himself, but that he could understand the appeal.  I understood.  Weeks before, my back a total mess, almost 400 pounds, spending ten minutes crawling ten damn feet to the bathroom on my hands and knees and hoping I wouldn&#8217;t shit myself, thoughts like getting robbed or in an accident or having a <a title="The Green Light" href="http://changeforayear.com/2012/11/21/the-green-light/" target="_blank">heart attack</a> went through my head.</p>
<p>In the dark, left alone with only myself, it seemed like a good way to go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d stopped dreaming.  Or I&#8217;d grown up, my dreams faded as if written long ago in pencil.  That happens to many it seems.  As a child those dark nights&#8211;all alone&#8211;had burst with adventure and possibility.  At what point does excitement fade into bitterness?</p>
<p>I contemplated quitting my job.  I shaved my head.  I continued burying myself in work and McDonalds and television.  I&#8217;d buy an extra value meal, a shake, a few burgers, then go home and try not to think about anything.  Again, I&#8217;d gotten it all wrong.</p>
<p>What is that old quote?  There are three types of people in the world: those that do, those that watch, and those that wonder.  That&#8217;s bullshit.  I don&#8217;t buy it.  There&#8217;s only one type at the core.  When you really boil it down to what we&#8217;re all after.  We&#8217;re all dreamers.  Some dreams have changed.  Some have got smaller.  Some people have just stopped dreaming altogether.  I had given up.</p>
<p>I want to dream again.  Not little dreams of a new car or a new job or a giant house or even winning the lottery.  Those are small dreams.  I&#8217;m talking <em>big</em> dreams.  Dreams that will truly change my life.  Dreams that will bring true happiness.  Those big dreams all start on the inside.  Those are dreams about changing yourself.  About overcoming your fears.  About accepting not who you are but who you know you can be.  Dreams that start with the knowledge that when reached, won&#8217;t bring you happiness, but knowledge that the joys and experiences along the journey are what life is about.  Those are the dreams that reinvigorate and re-energize.  Those are the adventures I used to dream about as a kid.</p>
<p>Tonight, laying awake in my bed, only silence and darkness around me, I&#8217;ll once again dream.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Midlife Crisis Crossover was launched April 28, 2012, as a creative attempt to do something different with my spare time, my ostensible talents, and four decades of accumulated monumental mistakes and mental minutiae.  Though it wasn&#8217;t my first blog, it was my first time attempting a blog without an immediate support system or preexisting audience.  The MCC experience has been eight curious months of dedication, persistence, failures, sleep deprivation, loneliness, stubbornness, prayer, and occasional wild luck.  Over the course of the first 240 posts I&#8217;ve discovered new peers, made new friends, learned new things about myself and HTML, improved 2% at photography, and remembered one or two stylistic rules I&#8217;d forgotten since college, with several more still repressed and yet to be rediscovered.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1233" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 274px"><img src="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/obamachair.jpg?w=590" alt="Empty Obama Chair, Clint Eastwood&#039;s arch-enemy"   class="size-full wp-image-1233" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The infamous empty chair, a.k.a. &#8220;Obamachair&#8221;</p></div>The WordPress.com <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/writing-challenge-wrapup/" title="WP Weekly Writing Challenge: Wrap It Up" target="_blank">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> has encouraged us to look back at our year and remember where we&#8217;ve been.  Even before I began assembling my MCC year-end lists, I already knew which post would top most of them:  &#8220;<a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/09/01/the-day-an-empty-chair-ruled-the-internet/" title="The Day an Empty Chair Ruled the Internet" target="_blank">The Day an Empty Chair Ruled the Internet</a>&#8221; was the watershed event that drew the most Likes, Comments, and Shares (and nearly the most traffic) of anything else I&#8217;ve written this year, arguably even in my full thirteen years of Internet participation, thanks in large part to its &#8220;Freshly Pressed&#8221; status that saw it spotlighted for all WordPress users to see over Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>For its outstanding achievement of Attracting an Audience, &#8220;Empty Chair&#8221; is the first and only entry in the MCC Hall of Fame, even though it was about political events and my incredulous disdain for same.  If we set it  aside in a class by itself, my memories of 2012 look like so:</p>

<p>I conclude from these results that I must now attend GenCon every year for the rest of my life, or at least repost photos from my previous GenCons and turn MCC into a <em>real</em> party.</p>
<p>Those same five posts also constitute my Most Popular Posts of 2012 in terms of traffic, except the order becomes 5, 2, 1, 4, 3.  Believe it or not, GenCon traffic at its height even trumped my &#8220;Empty Chair&#8221; traffic, thanks to shots of a very special gathering of <em>League of Legends</em> cosplayers, indisputably the greatest gamers of all time.</p>

<p>Conclusion: people love photos.  Creative captioning helps, not to mentioning posting them during prime Internet usage hours instead of in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>In a very special category of its own:  the hardest post to write all year was &#8220;<a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/07/21/aurora/" title="Aurora." target="_blank">Aurora.</a>&#8221;  It wasn&#8217;t the greatest epic ever, but writing it while stifling emotional reactions kept me up till after 2 a.m.  In retrospect, I&#8217;m saddened that my reaction to Newtown has been muted by comparison, possibly even repressed.</p>
<p>Speaking of things that haunt me:</p>
<p><strong>MOST HATED POSTS:</strong></p>
<p>These are the five most recent posts to elicit zero Comments, zero Likes, and zero reactions from the Viewers at Home. None of them even got so much as a token pity-Like.  These all occurred before &#8220;Empty Chair&#8221;, kept me humble, and probably ruined my mood the next day.  They were either lousy, offensive, useless, or just published under a bad sign.</p>
<p>1.  <a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/08/12/wizard-world-chicago-2012-photos-part-2-of-5-sci-fi-actors-ahoy/" title="WWC 2012 Part 2" target="_blank">Wizard World Chicago 2012 Photos, Part 2 of 5: Sci-Fi Actors Ahoy!</a></p>
<p>Readers love convention costume photos.  Pics of the actors and comics creators, not so much.</p>
<p>2.  <a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/07/23/dark-knight-rises-in-three-hours-batman-will-rise-but-results-will-vary/" title="My DKR review" target="_blank">“Dark Knight Rises”: in Three Hours Batman Will Rise, But Results Will Vary</a></p>
<p>My movie reviews are often too long and laborious, even when I break them down into bullet points.</p>
<p>3.  <a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/07/22/how-not-to-respond-to-aurora-a-plainspoken-primer-for-pundit-pretenders/" title="How Not to Respond to Aurora" target="_blank">How Not to Respond to Aurora: a Plainspoken Primer for Pundit Pretenders</a></p>
<p>Too soon.</p>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love an Internet opinion that represents an extremist minority?  Answer: <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>5.  <a href="http://midlifecrisiscrossover.com/2012/06/24/pixar-to-spend-billions-making-350-versions-of-monsters-u-one-for-each-billy-crystal-ad-lib/" target="_blank">Pixar to Spend Billions Making 350 Versions of “Monsters U”, One for Each Billy Crystal Ad-Lib</a></p>
<p>When I put more work into the title than into the post itself, you can just tell.</p>
<p>We close the MCC Year in Review with two photos.  The first is my hands-down favorite moment of the year, previously presented in 2012 Road Trip Photos #17 &#8212; standing 14,000 feet above sea level upon scenic, thin-aired Pikes Peak.  This too-brief moment resembled absolutely no other minute of my life.  Highly recommended.</p>
<p><a href="http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr51/MagicNumberSix/Vaca2012/zIMG_0916_zpsc7b830ee.jpg"><img src="http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr51/MagicNumberSix/Vaca2012/zIMG_0916_zpsc7b830ee.jpg" width="614" height="377" alt="me on Pikes Peak" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>The other photo has never been posted on MCC until now, because I&#8217;ve had trouble finding a premise.  My favorite photo that I personally took this year was at my wife&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s college graduation party.  Her amazing, craft-minded boyfriend designed a super-sized Jenga set that stood over five feet high with its base, made entirely from wood blocks scaled to exacting proportions.  If we&#8217;d been careless, this thing could&#8217;ve injured or killed someone.  </p>
<p>We were careful, but sooner or later someone had to lose.  The impact was jarring, but a blast to watch.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 625px"><a href="http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr51/MagicNumberSix/IMG_1255.jpg"><img src="http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr51/MagicNumberSix/IMG_1255.jpg" width="614" height="461" alt="Mega-Jenga" class /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mega-Jenga endgame!</p></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping Mega-Jenga isn&#8217;t symbolic of my future writing adventures.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!  See you in 2013.</p>

We make lists to commemorate the end of a crappy year, and then we make new ones to overload ourselves with selfish hopes for a new one. I for one, love this tradition, and plan on sharing my morsels of self-loathing with you!</p>
<p>2012 was no highlight of my life; I didn&#8217;t achieve a coveted trophy or pop out a baby. My year consisted mostly of dieting, dating, and then a long dry stretch of celibacy which included learning how to cook. I didn&#8217;t learn how to &#8220;act like a boss&#8221;, though I did finish Mass Effect 3 five times before realizing that freewill is a lie, and that the ending will never ever <em>ever</em> change.</p>
<p>I could use this opportunity to toot my own horn, but what fun would that be? It is the holiday season, after all,  and no one wants to hear about how perfect someone else is as air hockey. So, as my gift to you, I will spotlight my failures for your amusement. Here are the top 5 goals I had for myself in 2012 &#8230; and how I failed at them epically. Because everyone loves a hot mess.</p>
<h2>Goal 1: Lose the love handles &#8230; and hate handles, and butt handles, and every other handle</h2>
<div id="attachment_3405" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sallyedelsteincollage.com/content.html?page=6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3405" alt="I'll start my diet tomorrow ..." src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/better-living-through-bigbi.jpg?w=300&#038;h=263" width="300" height="263" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ll start my diet tomorrow &#8230;</p></div>
<p>Every year, I vow to lose weight. And every year, I gain it. 2012 actually started out successfully; I lost 20 lbs and was feeling like a proper sexy beast. I could wear pants without having a muffin top, and people started mistaking me for a <del>hand model</del> person who could go without an oversize hoodie. I was running regularly, something my lazy bum didn&#8217;t even do in high school, and I was feeling good about myself. I hoped I would run into my ex, the one that called me fat every which way without actually saying the word, and let him feast his eyes on my lack of lumps.</p>
<p>But then, after a failed move to California, I fell back into bad habits. See, I either <em>don&#8217;t eat</em> or I eat everything. There is no in between with me. Normal, healthy eating just isn&#8217;t something I can do. And so I either gain or lose. This time, I gained. I gained back everything I lost, and almost crept my way back up to my highest weight.</p>
<p>Of course, now I&#8217;m back to trying to get rid of it. The cycle repeats itself. And of course, I&#8217;m swearing that this time, I <em>won&#8217;t gain it all back</em>. You know that saying, &#8220;The definition of stupid is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results?&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s why I never got into Harvard.</p>
<h2>Goal 2: Move to California</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3408" alt="loser" src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/loser.jpg?w=197&#038;h=300" width="197" height="300" />I got this brilliant idea in my head in January 2012: I was going to get rid of most all of my belongings and move to California to reconnect with my older sister. It was going to be amazing, I tell ya! Palm trees and sunshine!! I was going to meet celebrities and buy Louis Vuitton and things were going to be merry.</p>
<p>I sold most everything I owned, jumped on a train, and began my 2 week venture to Southern Cali. Out of <del>fear</del> respect for my sister, I won&#8217;t tell you the details about just what exactly went wrong &#8230; just know that it did. There <em>were</em> palm trees and sunshine and <em>deadly sexy </em>men &#8230; but alas, it just wasn&#8217;t enough to fix what was broken.</p>
<p>Coming home with my tail between my legs was humbling, to say the least. Another one of Loony&#8217;s big moves, and another one of Loony&#8217;s &#8220;Um, I have to move back home for awhile&#8230;.&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Goal 3: &#8216;Date&#8217; someone</h2>
<div id="attachment_3412" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 245px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3412" alt="Just a quiet July night for The Wilson's...." src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/86061042848971877_vg1qgjtv_c.jpg?w=235&#038;h=300" width="235" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jon and Mary&#8217;s first date went smoothly, to sat the least.</p></div>
<p>I am not much of a &#8220;dater.&#8221; I either get into a full-fledged relationship with someone or things remain very&#8230; casual. I don&#8217;t do dinner-and-a-movie nights, or what-bar-should-we-hop-tonight things. It&#8217;s usually just  &#8221;lets move in together&#8221; or &#8220;my bed or yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in light of the breaking up with my ex (we gave it a horrifying &#8216;second go&#8217;), I decided that I would spice things up in 2012 and try <em>dating.</em> I wanted nothing serious; no games or drama or window-spying. Just something normal.</p>
<p>Things went okay, for a bit.</p>
<p>Guy #1, after one late night date of playing Skyrim, decided he wanted me to meet his mother. After a second date of roller skating, I called it quits. It, according to him, made me heartless.</p>
<p>Guy #2 was adorably quirky. Another nerd type &#8211; knew the ins and outs of WOW &#8211; but this time, devilishly charming and handsome. We spent long nights talking for hours; it felt incredibly raw and natural to be around him. But he, too, ended up wanting more than I wanted to give at the time &#8230; and so things fizzled and burnt out.</p>
<p>Guy #3 was some kind of gangster dude from California. Did I mention I lived in a ghetto? We didn&#8217;t really &#8220;date&#8221; so much as stand outside looking at star constellations with his iPhone, while he was taking a break from his crack addiction. Oh, I didn&#8217;t mention that part? Oops. Needless to say, it didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p>The dating game was interesting, but it didn&#8217;t lead to any keepers.</p>
<h2>Goal 4: &#8216;Date&#8217; no one</h2>
<div id="attachment_3415" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3415" alt="I bought it on sale for $1.99" src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/spinster-title.jpg?w=300&#038;h=202" width="300" height="202" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I bought it on sale for $1.99</p></div>
<p>So I failed at the dating game, and I decided to stop dating/seeing/snoring with people all together. I would be a celibate lady that would wash her sorrows down with a glass of red wine, as she sung her cats to sleep at night. I would &#8220;find myself and love myself and learn how to ride a unicycle&#8221; before trying to date again. Plus, I was getting fatter, and I didn&#8217;t want to explain my fake &#8220;oh yeah, i have this weird water retention&#8230;&#8221; disease to a dozen minds.</p>
<p>For nine months, yes <em>nine months</em>, I have been without the intimate company of another. I have dried up like a cactus and learned how to stop sucking my belly in. It has, to be honest with you, been fabulous. I have no one to worry about, to deal with. I can quit shaving my legs for months and not care. I can sleep in without having to jump out of bed at 3am to do a full face of makeup before the dude wakes up. It has been marvelous. A non-failure for this list. There is only one human in this world that I have to think about or worry about &#8230; and that is myself, which is probably for the best.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it does get a little lackluster and lonesome &#8230; but I realize that the only thing  &#8221;dating&#8221; has ever given me was giving up on my dreams. I live for myself and myself only, and move in the direction of my goals. If someone comes in and wants to be a part of that, taking me as I am, then I won&#8217;t close myself off to it &#8230; but otherwise, this spinster is a content one.</p>
<h2>Goal 5: Start a blog</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3418" alt="1270887-lunatic" src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1270887-lunatic.gif?w=300&#038;h=150" width="300" height="150" /> So I lied. This list isn&#8217;t <em>all</em> failure. I actually did start a blog, this blog, and have enjoyed the experience. I may have become rather flaky as of late, but I swear my heart is still in it. For so long, I have had all of these random thoughts just jumping and bouncing around in my head. I have been crazy; been called crazy. I have laughed and cried and suffered and triumphed. I have been in therapy, on medication, on drugs and drowning in alcohol. And all the while, the noise and thoughts in my head were trapped.</p>
<p>And then I started blogging. Nonsense. There is no theme, no trend. Sometimes I am up. Sometimes down. But I can sit here, looking at a blank screen, and feel <em>comfortable</em> and <em>open</em> to discuss whatever it is that I am thinking. I can finally get these thoughts <strong>out</strong>.</p>
<p>I call myself a lunatic because I wanted to take some of the power away from those who have called me names, and the stigma attached to mental illness &#8230; but the community and those of you that I have gotten to know, have made me feel the opposite of all that. I have been welcomed; I have been cared for. Random emails asking if I am doing okay. A few funny pictures to brighten my day (that rhymes!). Maybe being crazy isn&#8217;t so bad after all.</p>
<p>I want to make a small, teeny tiny dent in letting people know that its okay to talk about mental issues. That things don&#8217;t need to make sense. That we all have worth, no matter our faults or mistakes, or belief in the opposite.</p>
<p>2013 can be a change. If you or someone you know suffers from a mental illness, reach out. Don&#8217;t be afraid anymore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2">I came across <a href="http://zenhabits.net/28/" target="_blank">this article from zenhabits</a> a few days ago and thought, hmm, I&#8217;m sure there are a couple of pretty good life tips my loved ones have shared with me that are worth sharing with everyone, too.</span></p>
<p>And then I stumbled upon the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/writing-challenge-wrapup/" target="_blank">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> last night, and it was as though God him/herself summoned me to write this post. </p>
<p>Or maybe it was just the WordPress team.</p>
<p>The point is &#8211; lists, we gotta love &#8216;em.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received many advices in my life. Some have been forgotten, and a very selected few are treasured. This 2012, I found myself doing a lot of reflecting and through those moments, I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;ve been following these words of encouragement pretty diligently.</p>
<p><a href="http://mrtplus.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/why-you-fail-at-lean-product-development/"><img src="http://manishad.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fortunecookie.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="fortunecookie-many-receive-advice-profit" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1482" /></a></p>
<p>Here are 6 everlasting advices I made full use of in 2012:</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#1 &#8211; Make Your Bed</strong></font></font></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recall the moment he said it to me, but the look on my father&#8217;s face was probably the sternest I&#8217;d ever seen him. I had just freshened up on a lazy weekend morning and sat next to him for a cuppa when he asked if I had made my bed. I said yes, as I usually dusted and folded my blanket (my idea of making my bed) before stepping out of my room since my sister had no domestic helper.</p>
<p>He then decided to go on and tell me how important it is for one to make their bed in the morning. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first duty of the day,&#8221; he said. According to him, it&#8217;s a good sign to how the rest of your day is going to go, because if you can&#8217;t even fulfill the first duty &#8211; making your bed &#8211; how do you expect yourself to go on and accomplish other things in the remaining hours of the day?</p>
<p>Talk about setting standards, ei?</p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I made my bed! I&#8217;ve been slacking off on this ever since shifting to the new house (our domestic helper likes to spoil me, I don&#8217;t know why!), but I still make it a point to make sure my bedroom is kept neat at all times.</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#2 &#8211; Know Your Worth</strong></font></font></p>
<p>This one goes back to the year 2007. I couldn&#8217;t make up my mind regarding a full-time position offered to me even before graduation. I called my mother to ask for her advice, half expecting that she would say something like &#8220;up to you&#8221;, because my parents allow me to be independent like that.</p>
<p>To my surprise, she told me that the offer didn&#8217;t seem like it was going to be worth my time. She told me that I had to know my worth and if, and only if, I thought that it was reasonable enough &#8211; considering that it was my first job &#8211; I should take it. She somehow hinted that I wasn&#8217;t very deserving of such a menial role in said company.</p>
<p>I thanked her, hung up and rejected the job offer. I&#8217;ve never looked back at my decision with any sort of regret. Mums do know best.</p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I shifted professions. I had two job offers that came in before I left Waves, but I decided to go with this one because I knew it was challenging &#8211; a new field but with supervisors who allowed me the flexibility of time and understood my want to go home to my family without carrying work back. I&#8217;m blessed.</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#3 &#8211; Wash The Dishes NOW!</strong></font></font></p>
<p>This tip is also mentioned in the zenhabits article (link above). I was bestowed with this wisdom from a dear friend, and although I must point out that it&#8217;s a very Asian-centric philosophy, it made total sense to me (oh wait, I am Asian &#8211; haha!).</p>
<p>Basically (yes, I used this word), we all live and work to fill our rice bowl, i.e. put food on the table, to fill our tummies. If a person refuses to wash their rice bowl after devouring their meals, leaving the rice bowl sticky and icky, how will more rice get filled in an already dirty bowl?</p>
<p>I know, I know, it sounds rather far-fetched, but like I said, it made sense to me. And besides, I like washing dishes. True story.</p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I still make it a point to wash my dishes immediately after every meal. Again, our helper in the new house just loves snatching my plate from my hand even before I get up from the table but I think she, being trained by my mother, lives by the same principle in life.</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#4 &#8211; Slow Down</strong></font></font></p>
<p><a href="http://myquoteshome.com/it-does-not-matter-how-slow-quotes-about-wisdom/"><img src="http://manishad.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/cute-confucius-quotes-sayings-wisdom-motivational-best.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="cute-confucius-quotes-sayings-wisdom-motivational-best" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1469" /></a>To say that I&#8217;ve slowed down altogether would be telling a lie, because I&#8217;m just punctual and rushy (don&#8217;t forget paranoid!) by nature. Thing is, my need for speed (heh) has started to show its effects on my health, so I&#8217;m doing my best with taking things slow.</p>
<p>I do however, believe that there is no need to slow down my speed of thinking. In fact, I think that as I age, I start to realise how many things I&#8217;m missing out in life. I aim to catch up with the stuff I&#8217;ve always wanted to do but never got a chance to &#8211; it&#8217;s just that instead of rushing and then falling off track halfway, I&#8217;m going to work on them steadily and complete the journey eventually. Confucius said it best.</p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I&#8217;ve stopped multitasking too much. I enjoy walking home from the train station instead of taking the bus because I feel like there&#8217;s no hurry to get home anymore. I will spend that extra hour watching aimless Indian melodramas on TV so I can spend time with my mother instead of surfing Facebook. And I&#8217;ve stopped expecting people to deliver things as fast as I do, too.</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#5 &#8211; Take Responsibility</strong></font></font></p>
<p>I learnt about the theory of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">diffused responsibility</a>&#8221; during my time spent as a Psychology student. It is, in simple words, the passing on of responsibilities without actually knowing if someone else is going to do the action or not. </p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I&#8217;ve started to be more responsible for my own actions. I pick out my own mistakes, make my own decisions, and as much as possible, stick to them. I carry out my daily responsibilities and although I&#8217;ve started making little efforts to help others, I still have a long way to go. I suppose I assume less, now.</p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#088a85"><strong>#6 &#8211; Shoo Away Negative Energy</strong></font></font></p>
<p>Credit for this one goes to my late cousin. He always had a carefree nature, telling his family members to stay away from negative people and detach yourself from bad emotions. He constantly reminded us to live by the day and always taught us that laughter was the best medicine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1438" alt="negative thoughts meme" src="http://manishad.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/22935394.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p><strong>In 2012</strong>: I&#8217;m still a pessimist at times, however, I believe that my outlook on life is lightening up, so to speak. Now that I&#8217;m assuming less, I find myself being less of a victim of other people&#8217;s whiny rants and baseless arguments. The feeling is a breathe of fresh air, I tell you.</p>
<p>And because it&#8217;s the season of giving, here&#8217;s a <strong>bonus word from my favourite cartoon character</strong> (please excuse the vulgarities).</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='420' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PqlSs49fSds?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><em>What words from the wise do you cherish?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">In the past, most things that you owned were built to last. Household goods were expensive, and you looked after what you had, repairing things and maintaining them. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, new industrial processes and new materials – plastic especially – began to change that. One of the first and best known examples is the Dixie cup, invented in 1907 in response to a health scare about shared tin cups used at public water fountains. Vending machines with paper cups were a much more hygienic solution. Today, we get through billions of paper and plastic cups every year, 146 billion in the US alone.</p>
<p align="left">It’s a funny thing, disposability. One-use items are often more convenient. You don’t need to wash them and put them away, or worry about breaking them, and they’re more hygienic, especially for medical equipment. On the other hand, it’s far cheaper to own real things and re-use them. Objects built to last are always more satisfying to use, they have weight and body and we can take pride in owning them. You don’t really own a disposable item, you just use it. Then there’s the waste. Sometimes it’s a palpable sense, when you gather up paper plates at the end of a party perhaps. Usually it’s not, and the problem of <a href="http://makewealthhistory.org/2007/11/11/the-landfill-problem/">landfill</a>, off-gas and<a title="The North Atlantic garbage patch" href="http://makewealthhistory.org/2008/03/31/the-landfill-continent-that-dwarfs-the-united-states/"> sea plastic</a> happen far away and without thought.</p>
<p align="left">Each of us has negotiated our own compromises here. I take my mug with a lid to the coffee shop at the station, but I gather from the friendly Welsh man who serves me that this is unusual. We use real nappies on the boy. And yet I will read a newspaper and it won’t cross my mind that I’m consuming a one-use disposable item. I don’t take a plate to the pizza place down the road, although it’s less than a minute’s walk away and the thought has crossed my mind.</p>
<p align="left">We all draw our lines somewhere, deciding what is acceptable and what is wasteful. The idea of ‘disposable fashion’ seems a step too far for most of us. Or perhaps one-use <a href="http://www.wineinnovationsltd.com/" target="_blank">prefilled plastic wine glasses</a> with tear-off foil lids – surely that’s crossing a line somehow.</p>
<p align="left">I’ve been thinking about disposability because I read a reference recently to a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xlYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=throwaway+living+life+magazine+1955&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHXujAGwx8&amp;sig=49S9FfiD1CXQz5SFxSkJiFrlp3Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FTHQUNWsLKm00QWjqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=throwaway%20living%20life%20magazine%201955&amp;f=false" target="_blank">1955 article in Life magazine</a> called ‘Throwaway Living’. I was curious and I looked it up.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10770" alt="disposability" src="http://makewealthhistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/disposability.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p align="left">It’s a neat cultural artefact, evidence of the excitement around plastic (see also <a href="http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.html" target="_blank">Disney’s plastic house of the future </a>exhibit). The article is all about liberation, “the objects flying through the air in this picture would take 40 hours to clean – except that no housewife need bother. They are all meant to be thrown away after use.”</p>
<p align="left">The picture includes familiar items like cups, foil trays, paper tablecloths and disposable barbecues. Other things didn’t catch on, like throwaway vases and flowers, buckets, or disposable guest towels. The picture also includes disposable duck and goose decoys in the bottom right, and I couldn’t tell you if those still exist or not.</p>
<p align="left">What’s interesting to me is how our attitudes towards disposability have changed and continue to change. Here is a carefree, celebratory feel to throwing things away that might make many of us feel uncomfortable now. It looks naive, maybe even reckless. The idea of being able to eat off disposable plates and throw them away was thrilling and futuristic. Now it seems lazy, although only if we were cooking for ourselves and serving it up onto paper plates. (If it’s a takeaway, it’s okay to eat off disposable dishes – that’s one of the unspoken moral codes of disposability.)</p>
<p align="left">Plastic bags are one of the areas where our attitudes are changing at the moment. There is a growing awareness that our plastic bag use is excessive, and that we throw away far more than we need to. In the last few years supermarkets have started offering recycling services. More of us take our bags to the shops, or chastise ourselves for forgetting. Enlightened places like Wales and Ireland have banned the use of free plastic bags and cut the use of them dramatically. Tabloid newspapers have run campaigns on plastic bags, a sure sign of a changing moral norm.</p>
<p align="left">We still throw away too much, but our attitudes towards disposable things are changing and maturing. I may shake my head at those pre-filled wine glasses, but a glance back at that Life article shows where we might have been.</p>
