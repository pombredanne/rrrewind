				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Over at The Daily Post they&#8217;ve submitted a writing challenge that I felt the need to participate in. You can read all about it (or participate as well!) <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/writing-challenge-starting-over/" target="_blank">here</a>. The prompt is &#8220;Starting Over.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="http://officialmattroberts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/convenience.jpg?w=720" alt="convenience"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322" /><br />
Henry was standing at the door to an all night convenience store. The door was all glass except for the metal frame and the metal handle that stuck out like a giant sideways L. There were stickers all over the door showcasing some tobacco or alcoholic product that was sold inside.</p>
<p>Henry held onto the handle and had a feeling rush over him. That feeling. The one that makes you forget everything for just a second and you question what it is you&#8217;re doing and where you&#8217;re at. Henry had that feeling before, and deja vu, it seemed as if it had happened in this very spot at exactly this moment. That&#8217;s how deja vu works, right?</p>
<p>He opened the door and went inside. The bell above the door jingled and the clerk looked up to see who had just come in. Henry nodded to the clerk and began walking, almost on instinct, towards the back of the store. It was when he was looking on the shelf while walking to the back that he realized what he had come in for, and that feeling he had outside went away.</p>
<p>He had come in for some diapers. His wife had sent him because she thought she had had enough but ran out. Lucky for them this convenience store was just down the street and it was open all night. This wasn&#8217;t the first time they had to make a trip like this. Their baby Kevin was only four months old and they were still getting used to having him in the house.</p>
<p>There was a jingle from the bell above the door and someone else came in. As far as Henry knew this new customer and himself were the only two in the store besides the clerk. It was a Tuesday night after all, so no big surprise there.</p>
<p>Henry looked at the small selection of diapers on the shelf and tried to remember which one his wife had sent him for. His wife&#8230; she popped into his head suddenly and she was crying. Henry&#8217;s face reflected his concern for her, his sadness for her. He wasn&#8217;t sure why, but he felt her pain although he didn&#8217;t know what her pain was for or why it was there. He didn&#8217;t even know how the thought popped into his head. He had just been joking with her before he left to get the diapers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why he couldn&#8217;t remember which diapers to get. They had been joking after she told him what kind. He had been giving her grief about running out of diapers and she was making fun of his age and saying how he should be in diapers himself. He was only four years older than her, but she jokingly made fun of his age all the time.</p>
<p>The two laughed at one another and kissed before he walked out of the house twenty minutes prior. He had walked to the store since it was so close and the neighborhood wasn&#8217;t so bad that he felt threatened walking there at night.</p>
<p>Henry heard a commotion near the register but he disregarded it. It sounded as if the cashier and the other customer knew one another and were in a heated argument. Their talking had snapped Henry out of his trance and he got back to why he was there.</p>
<p>He looked at the diapers, thought of calling his wife (although she would no doubt make fun of his memory and his old age for forgetting what brand, or for not knowing what diapers his own child wore) but put his phone away. He grabbed one of the packages and went to the back of the store for a soda. The commotion at the register continued to grow louder and over the store&#8217;s speakers CCR was playing their hit &#8220;Commotion,&#8221; which Henry thought was ironically funny.</p>
<p>He pulled a bottle of Mt. Dew out of the cooler and let the door slam shut. He began walking to the front of the store when the commotion he had been hearing died.</p>
<p>He walked out from between two aisles and saw the other customer, a man wearing a black leather jacket and ripped jeans. His shoes seemed to be rather old as well. He had on a dirty maroon knit cap and his facial hair was a few days old. The man looked at Henry and Henry nodded to him. The man turned back to the counter quickly. &#8220;Come on, hurry up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank the cashier, whom Henry had known from coming into the store off and on, stood up from behind the register and was stuffing something into a bag. He looked at Henry with worry on his face. The other customer looked back at Henry and then again at Frank and slammed his hand on the counter. &#8220;Hurry up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry couldn&#8217;t tell what was going on, but suddenly the man lifted his other arm and he was holding a gun. Henry fell into that feeling again, as if everything he had done that night up to that point wasn&#8217;t there anymore. None of it was on his mind. He felt confused about the situation, as if it were a dream. Something that had happened long ago, but that he was reliving in the present. Something that no matter what happened he wouldn&#8217;t be able to stop.</p>
<p>Henry just stood there watching as Frank was robbed at gun point. Henry realized without realizing it that Frank was stuffing money into the bag. He didn&#8217;t look at Frank again though, he just stared at the man in front of him with the gun.</p>
<p>That man turned and saw Henry staring at him. &#8220;You saw nothing pal!&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry instinctively shrugged.</p>
<p>The man turned to Frank again and snatched the bag out of his hands. A few dollar bills floated from the bag to the floor.</p>
<p>The man turned to the door and then stopped. Henry didn&#8217;t hear him so well but he was sure he heard the man say to himself, &#8220;Oh fuck it.&#8221; The man spun around, lifted his gun and fired at Frank. Frank flew backwards from the shot, slamming into a cigarette display. Cigarette packs fell from the shelves they were stocked on as Frank&#8217;s body slid down the display until he was no longer visible from where Henry was.</p>
<p>In slow motion Henry witnessed this all taking place. He once again saw his wife crying hysterically. Sobbing. He felt so bad for her, yet so alone. Because he couldn&#8217;t do anything to make her feel better. She was his life, and she was holding their four month old son, rocking him back and forth. Why was he seeing this? She was in such a good mood when he left.</p>
<p>In the continued slow motion, Henry looked from the cigarette display over to the man at the door holding a bag of money and a gun. The man had the gun pointed at Henry. Henry frowned. There was a flash.</p>
<p>He just wanted to rub his hand on her face, let her know everything was going to be okay. He felt bad that he couldn&#8217;t get the diapers to her in time. He hoped their son, Kevin, didn&#8217;t make too much of a mess.</p>
<p>A mess&#8230; Kevin&#8230;</p>
<p>Henry was standing at the door to an all night convenience store. The door was all glass except for the metal frame and the metal handle that stuck out like a giant sideways L. There were stickers all over the door showcasing some tobacco or alcoholic product that was sold inside.</p>
<p>Henry held onto the handle and had a feeling rush over him. That feeling. The one that makes you forget everything for just a second and you question what it is you&#8217;re doing and where you&#8217;re at. Henry had that feeling before, and deja vu, it seemed as if it had happened in this very spot at exactly this moment. That&#8217;s how deja vu works, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thenarcissisticanthropologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/paparazzi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1495" alt="paparazzi" src="http://thenarcissisticanthropologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/paparazzi.jpg?w=690&#038;h=517" width="690" height="517" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by defining the word fetish, lest everyone think we are discussing a different kind of topic.</p>
<p>According to the Merriam Webster online dictionary, fetish is defined as:</p>
<p><em>a</em> <strong>:</strong> an object (as a small stone carving of an animal) believed to have magical power to protect or aid its owner; <em>broadly</em> <strong>:</strong> a material object regarded with superstitious or extravagant trust or reverence</p>
<p><em>b</em> <strong>:</strong> an object of irrational reverence or obsessive devotion</p>
<p>In the United States and most developed countries, celebrities tend to become the fetish object:  idolized,  revered as almost supernatural superheroes and held to extraordinarily high standards by right of their profession in the public eye and the often super-human paycheck that comes with it.  Celebrities have always been a central focus in consumer culture:  used as marketing tools to convince people that some of their magic-dust will rub off on them if they purchase a product they use publicly or speak for in an ad.</p>
<p>As a public we mostly presume the right to know anything and everything we want about celebrities as we feel it is their obligation to disclose their private lives because they &#8220;put themselves out there&#8221;.</p>
<p>The truth of it is, celebrities are working stiffs like the rest of us.  They do a job, whether it be acting, modeling clothes or playing a sport (let&#8217;s stick with the entertainment-oriented celebrities for the sake of this argument).  They are selling a product: their labor or looks or skill.  They are doing it for love and / or profit.  At the end of the day, the deal they are signing on for, in theory, is to co-opt their image or their skills.</p>
<p>However, in what may be an unpopular argument, I need to point out the fact that celebrities do not sign on to co-opt their personal lives any more than someone who works at a bank or a shipyard.  In most workplaces, we have an unspoken (and sometimes bespoke) rule that our personal lives stay at home when we are at work.  We do our jobs, we choose if we want to put pictures of our families on our desks or share stories about the weekend, but are not expected to make our personal lives part of our work lives.  It&#8217;s why there are designated work hours.</p>
<p>So why do we feel that celebrities owe us something more than what they get paid for?  Why do we feel that they have an obligation to let us in to their private lives?  And in the case of Jodie Foster and other celebrities who happen to be gay or lesbian, why do we feel like they ought to publicly pronounce their sexual orientation to the American public or be ridiculed as a fraud?  Speaking as flag-flying member of the GLBT community who has put in the time as an educator and activist and continues to donate time and money to related causes that promote equality and tolerance, I wholeheartedly say:  leave the celebrities alone!</p>
<p>Jodie Foster makes a few great points in her now all a-Twittered Golden Globe Speech:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/pzfEBGN2jSw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>I think it&#8217;s about time that we stopped trying to consume celebrities&#8217; personal lives and just allowed ourselves to be customers of the work they produce &#8211; enjoying it in perspective.  If a celebrity&#8217;s sexual orientation is something they want to share because doing so helps them point to their true north, then so be it.  However, everyone should be able to reserve the right to control the labels they want associated with their metaphorical price tag.  Let&#8217;s allow a celebrity&#8217;s value to be defined by their work and the points of view they choose to put out there for public consumption, just as we allow the value of our brands to be defined by their set of distinct benefits: from what they do to what they publicly stand for.</p>
<p>We should be wary of the concept of privacy being for sale, lest we lose ourselves to a voracious culture of consumption rather than  finding ourselves in a culture of appreciation for the beauty and potential of our human existence.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s let the famous people keep their personal lives private.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a “special” shelf on my bookcase at home.  Not just <em>any</em> book is allowed on it.  In fact, the criteria is pretty specific: it’s reserved solely for the books in the <em>Wheel of Time</em> series.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bookcase.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="bookcase" alt="bookcase" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bookcase_thumb.jpg?w=699&#038;h=401" width="699" height="401" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>See that empty space there at the end?  My shelf is incomplete.  It’s <em>always </em>been incomplete.  Because <em>the series</em> has always been incomplete.  Since the summer of 1991, when a friend – my high school best friend – let me borrow his copy of “The Eye of the World”, I’ve been waiting, as patiently as possible, for the final book in the series.  Waiting for <em>Tarmon Gai’don</em>, the final, epic battle between the forces of Light and Shadow to be fought.</p>
<p>Well, the end has finally – <em>finally</em> – come.  Tomorrow, <span id="more-4741"></span>January 8th, 2013, the 14th book in Robert Jordan’s <em>Wheel of Time</em> series, “<a href="http://www.tor.com/features/series/a-memory-of-light">A Memory of Light</a>,” will be released.</p>
<p>The shelf is <em>finally</em> going to be full.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to express exactly how much I’m looking forward to this book, and yet how sad I’m going to be when I read the final pages.  On the one hand, holy hellz, It’s. Finally. Teh. Endz!  Fans of the series like me have been following the story for more than two decades, feverishly devouring each new volume as the tale progressed, often times with the inching speed of a caterpillar, towards what we all <em>hope</em> will be a rewarding, climatic Final Battle.  That’s a long time to wait for something you knew was coming in the very first book.  So, yay for the reaching the finish line.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading this series for most of my adult life.  Actually, if <em>adulthood</em> starts at 18 years old, make that my <em>entire</em> adult life.  I&#8217;ve known and loved these characters – both their endearing traits and their irritating ones (and yes, just like real people, they have both) – longer than I&#8217;ve known my wife, my children, almost all of my coworkers, and many of my friends.  And when I finish reading “A Memory of Light”, those characters’ journey will be finished. For the first time then, I’ll have to walk the path of my own life knowing that I’ll never again hear the voices of <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Rand_al'Thor">Rand al’Thor</a>, <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Perrin_Aybara">Perrin Aybara</a>, and <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Matrim_Cauthon">Matrim Cauthon</a> speak new words.</p>
<p>As you can tell, I&#8217;ve been feeling a bit contemplative about the whole thing, so last night I decided to revisit the books that have been waiting to become a completed set for years.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/eye.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="eye" alt="eye" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/eye_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first book.  I didn’t actually read <em>this book </em>first, though, because, as I said, the first time I read my friend’s borrowed copy.  I received this hardcover copy as a gift, years later, to complete the hardback set.  I did go back and read it, though, when I re-read the full series several years ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hunt.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="hunt" alt="hunt" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hunt_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This one, the second book in the series, is the one I typically say is my favorite.  It’s the first book I ever stayed up all night to finish, even though I had to be a work at K-Mart at 9:30 in the morning the next day.  I worked in the hardware department then.  All I remember of that day in the store was being ridiculously slap-happy.  I’m pretty sure I mixed some paint for customers.  Odds are pretty good that they got something more “Molasses Daybreak” than the “Robin’s Egg” they wanted.  Whatever. I’ll still contend that was better customer service than you can get at K-Mart now.</p>
<p>This is also the first book in the series to give me a lump in my throat the size of Manhattan – and nearly cause a quite unmanly fit of full-blown crying.</p>
<p>No can prove anything.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/shadow.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="shadow" alt="shadow" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/shadow_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This one came out when I was but a mere co-op, writing and executing software test cases.  I wouldn’t meet my wife for another 5 years.  Now I’m the most senior software developer in my department, have been married for 12 years, and have four kids.  Oh, my, how things have changed.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/winters_heart.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="winters_heart" alt="winters_heart" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/winters_heart_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Being so attached to a series that you’re willing to hang onto for 14 books over the course of 20+ years is not <em>all</em> fun and games.  Some of the books seemed like they did more running-in-place than advancing the overarching plot.  When I read this one, though, I thought we were <em>finally</em> taking our first steps down the path to the Last Battle.  As it turns out, I was mostly wrong; we still had some inching yet to do even after it.  Regardless, this was also the one where the Something Remarkable and Major I forecasted would happen years in advance finally <em>actually </em>happened.</p>
<p>That made me feel pretty smart.  But did I get so much as a golf clap?! <em>Noooooooo</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tgs.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="tgs" alt="tgs" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tgs_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This one, book 12, was really the beginning of drive to the big, all-encompassing conflicty battle of Good vs. Evil at the end of the series.  It’s also the first one not written solely by Robert Jordan, who lost his own final battle with a rare cardiac disease following the publication of book 11.  Fantasy author <a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/">Brandon Sanderson</a> was hand-picked by Mr. Jordan’s widow, Harriet, to complete the series.  This book depicts one of the most powerful and satisfying battle scenes I’ve ever read, which had been building since book two.  It was, truly, one of those F$*K YEAH! kind of things.</p>
<p><a href="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/towers.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="towers" alt="towers" src="http://puddintopia.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/towers_thumb.jpg?w=454&#038;h=454" width="454" height="454" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This is book 13.  It <em>finally</em> tied up that one seemingly-over-but-we-all-knew-better sub-plot that’s been finished but not yet <em>complete</em> since…um….*thinks back*…book four.  Also, when I got to the last twenty pages of this book, I started to nurse that special kind of quiet, simmering frustration that eventually builds to near-incoherent rage because I <em>knew</em> the story, the-whole-ball-of-wax-plot, finally stood on the precipice…</p>
<p>…and I’d have to wait two more years to finally go over that cliff.</p>
<p>Well, those two years have come, and gone.  One way or another, I’ll be joining all the characters I&#8217;ve know for so long as we all go careening over the edge.  Truth be told, I half expect that I’ll be nursing a familiar Manhattan-sized…no, make that Texas-sized…lump in my throat for the duration of time it takes me to read it.</p>
<p>I’m excited like a kid on Christmas Eve, and yet my heart is heavy knowing the end of it all is finally here.</p>
<p>One way or another, tomorrow my shelf is going to be complete.</p>
<p>Pud’n</p>
<p>PS: Now that I&#8217;ve shared a few of the ways the Wheel of Time series touched my life, how about you? Do you have any memories made special because of the series across the past two decades?  What about another series? We&#8217;d love to hear!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://entmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lancearmstrong.jpg" width="501" height="375" /></p>
<p>I am in the process of writing a dissertation on the power of sports.  A timely topic considering that each season seems to bring a new story from sports that easily transcends the fun and playfulness that sports is intended to be.  When I first started researching for this project, the NCAA was finalizing their investigation into Penn State University and inflicting harsh penalties on a state sponsored institution that was involved in an unfathomable scandal that involved child rape and molestation.  All along this time, there have been countless stories from Major League Baseball regarding players who used steroids and other performance enhancing drugs.  There has been a major labor dispute in the National Hockey League which finally has been resolved, following a major work stoppage and costing millions of dollars in lost revenues for local businesses.  And these are just a few of the major national headlines . . . there have been many others that haven&#8217;t garnered the national attention.</p>
<p>Sports, as I am in the process of arguing, is a spiritual power.  It casts a shadow of power over all facets of life.  Sports are beautiful, life-giving, healthy, fun, and created by God.  But what have they become?  Lance Armstrong and his PED scandal is the stuff of soap operas &#8211; the kinds they can&#8217;t show on network television.  Dan Wetzel&#8217;s article has a really insightful perspective of the whole situation <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/questions-oprah-should-ask-lance-armstrong-230849439.html">here</a>.  In it, he goes on to state: &#8220;Armstrong isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad guy for doping. He is a bad guy for the way he used his immense power, fame and fortune to attempt to ruin anyone who dared to speak the truth to his avalanche of lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sports creates quite a dilemma when it comes to ethics.  It&#8217;s OK to fake like you are going to hand the ball off to a player, and then actually pass, or even more overtly, have you ever watched a team that&#8217;s really  good at running the triple option?  Deception is at the heart of most sports.  Deception, though, must be kept within the boundaries of play.  It&#8217;s not OK to slip a player off the slideline just before the snap and then throw him the ball &#8211; this is against the written rules of football (illegal participation foul for those officials out there &#8211; of if you&#8217;re feeling generous, 5 yards substitution penalty before the snap).  There are those unwritten rules of the game like not stealing the signs from the catcher from second base and kicking the ball out of bounds in soccer when a  player is injured . . . but how does all this fit into the larger ethical framework of the world?</p>
<p>MLB was apparently dirty for more than 20 years.  Players doping, injecting, and bulking up without any media scrutiny at all.  Watching home run chases and records falling, spectators fully suspended their disbelief &#8211; we were living in the age of incredible athletic marvels!  Truly God had blessed us to live in that time.   Cycling, it appears, followed the same course of action.  We love to see athletes at the highest levels.  After all, &#8220;Records are made to be broken,&#8221; we say.  But are there records that will never be broken &#8211; can&#8217;t be?  Without some kind of artificial help?  And is that artificial help always wrong?  Is it always unethical?</p>
<p>Those questions require more time and space than I intend to offer here, but I will say that Lance Armstrong represents a great case study for this tension.  Without his cheating, his philanthropy would have never come to fruition.  No yellow bands.  No cancer support network (at least not Live Strong).  And it catches all of us in quite a conundrum.  What are we to make of it?  If we can&#8217;t at least acknowledge our part in helping create the monster himself, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll never come to terms with the truth.  Lance Armstrong represents what we have done to sports . . . we have elevated it from the purpose it was created to serve &#8211; fun, pleasure, enjoyment, leisure, and have made it into a monster that dwarfs its powerful head into economics, medicine, politics, education, and everywhere in between.  Lance Armstrong deserves his share of negative attention, punishment, and the lot.  But he is not the only one to indict here.  Those of us who are insistent upon creating gods out of athletes.  Those of us who will enjoy the athletic events . . . and then ask questions later.  Maybe if we paid more attention to those who came in last place instead of obsessing over those who finish first we could solve some of our own problems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a teacher in middle school who used to say the only thing in life we <b>have</b> to do, is die.</p>
<p>As a kid, it’s unknowingly easier to understand this concept. Rather than do things because we feel we <b>have </b>to, for the most part we do them because we <strong>want</strong> to. We dream of becoming an astronaut, ballerina, or movie star, and unaware of the “realities” of life, believe that one day we will achieve these dreams.</p>
<p>As we get older however, we’re bombarded with distractions&#8211;from the media, our jobs, our teachers, even our families&#8211;that make us believe these dreams are made for someone else&#8211;that they’re too outrageous and unachievable for ourselves. And before we know it, we find ourselves swept up in the trivial things we do day to day. Waking up on time, getting to class or work, running errands, watching TV, making dinner. Suddenly, it’s easy to believe we <b>have </b>to do these things. But actually, we don’t.</p>
<p>No matter what we do in life, the end result is the same. We die. Death; it’s the great equalizer. The one thing we all <b>have</b> to do. Everything else simply fills the time.</p>
<p>Knowing that this life will end leads me to believe that the only thing we all <b>want</b>,<b> </b>while we have this time,<b> </b>is to be happy.</p>
<p>So we can choose to be happy one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By doing what we are told we <b>should </b>do.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center">OR</p>
<p align="center">   2. By doing what we <b>want </b>to do (and sometimes these things align with what we’re told we should do-like getting a college degree or falling in love, for example).</p>
<p>Choosing option #1 can be easy, falling into the pre-determined track of life that has been laid out before us. Go to school, get a degree, find a job, get married, have kids, and one day retire to an over 55 living community in Florida. I’m sure there are people who do get fulfillment out of leading this type of life, but I know that there are others who do not. And since you’re still reading this I know I’m talkin’ to you!</p>
<p>That’s why we have choice #2. However, choice #2 requires some work. We must accept that we will die, and then strip away distractions to look within ourselves to see what <i>we</i> want out of life <i>right now, </i>regardless of what anyone else may say. It requires being honest with yourself to see what really lies within. I don’t think it’s easy. I think it takes dedication to yourself and the dreams you had as a little boy or girl. Once we acknowledge our mortality, it’s easier to go after the things we truly want in life.</p>
<p>Many of us have ironically read Robert Frost’s poem, “The Road Not Taken” in our school years. Frost writes of “two roads diverged in a yellow wood” and the narrator must decide which path to take. Ultimately he chooses “the one less traveled”. I distinctly remember my teacher emphasizing how important it was to take this road “less traveled” in our lives and to not blindly follow others in their choices. We were encouraged to make our own decisions, even if they were less popular. I’m sure others who have studied this poem have been told something similar. Ironically however, as I’ve experienced myself, if we do take the road less traveled, or make a third road of our own-by taking time off of school, or not going to college at all, for example-it’s frowned upon. Frost ends his poem by writing that taking this road less traveled “has made all the difference”.</p>
<p>So here’s what I say; let us make a conscious effort every day to be the judge of what will make our lives fulfilling to ourselves. Let us judge our happiness by our own standards rather than others- a kind of “happy relativism”. Let us not allow others to define what will make our lives meaningful. I think it’s something we must work on every day, but eventually it can become a lifestyle. And let’s see just the difference it can make.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://weoccupyjesus.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/robot_costume_uyen-thai.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-6803" alt="Image" src="http://weoccupyjesus.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/robot_costume_uyen-thai.jpg?w=590" /></a></p>
<p>So, I have this Jesus bobble-head. It&#8217;s ridiculous really. It sits on the desk across from my bed, looking at me with its goofy messianic expression. My wife hates the thing. However, there&#8217;s really no getting rid of it. I mean, you can&#8217;t throw away Jesus. That&#8217;d be disrespectful. Almost as disrespectful as&#8230; a Jesus bobble-head. So I keep it, partially because it&#8217;s hilarious, partially because I like sacrilegious things. The other day it was doing its bobble-thing and I said, &#8220;Look honey! We&#8217;ve been waiting on a move from the Lord, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; She put her hand over her face, fighting back both horror and laughter. Man, I love that thing.</p>
<p>I remember the whole &#8220;Jesus is my homeboy&#8221; t-shirt craze about a decade ago. It was all edgy, you know&#8230; because Jesus wasn&#8217;t supposed to be&#8230; urban? I&#8217;m not sure. All I know is that it created a backlash of opposing t-shirts and bumper stickers with the rebuttal of &#8220;Jesus isn&#8217;t my homeboy. He&#8217;s my king!&#8221; Oh, and no one will ever forget that song that came out with the audacity to proclaim &#8220;I am a friend of God.&#8221; Phhssst. God has no time for friends. I don&#8217;t know why, but that song &#8220;Yes lord, yes lord, yes yes lord&#8230;&#8221; got thrown under the bus at the same time. But we could talk about bad Christian music all day. The point is that all of a sudden it was taboo to convey Jesus as anything less than a fourteenth century feudal lord.</p>
<p>Now, I do understand there is a thing called reverence. Certain things are indeed sacred to many. This should be respected. We Occupy Jesus is all about bringing much needed positive PR to the legacy of the Jesus narrative. I am in full support of religious freedom of expression. I admit, there is a lot of expression going on. When you look online, there is a plethora of crude and satirical representations of Jesus, including Raptor Jesus, Zombie Jesus, Alien Jesus, Gay Jesus, and the most bizarre of them all&#8230;</p>
<p>White Jesus.</p>
<p>We must stop this madness!</p>
<p>But when I look across to my bobble-head savior, I think to myself&#8230; &#8220;That&#8217;s not Jesus.&#8221; Obvious, of course, but important to note. I&#8217;m not making fun of <em>actual</em> Jesus. I&#8217;m not reducing any literal notion of the historical and/or theological Jesus to a childish toy. It&#8217;s just a dumb bobble-head. And to my embarrassment, it&#8217;s also the &#8220;White Jesus&#8221; model.</p>
<p>When I go online and witness the circus surrounding the person of Jesus, I rarely think these depictions represent anyone&#8217;s real thoughts concerning the man from Nazareth. At best they are an example of an overactive sense of humor, and at worst they are examples of a sheer disbelief in Jesus and/or religion. I don&#8217;t think Jesus would take it personally (but White Jesus would be pissed). Do Christians really think Jesus&#8217; temper is raging out of control due to this sacrilege? Are people really going to hell because they make an internet meme, or merely laugh at one?</p>
<p>I make fun of many Christian things all the time. I try (keyword: try) to tone it down around those who are easily offended. I don&#8217;t make fun because I think Christianity is wrong, or dumb. I just see past the veils of religious theatre that put Jesus on stage as something he is not. If your Jesus gets offended by &#8220;Homeboy&#8221; t-shirts, well&#8230; your Jesus is just as comical as raptor Jesus. If your Jesus gets angry when Project Runway comes on the air, your Jesus is more ridiculous than Alien Jesus.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my Jesus is the real Jesus! The one true Jesus! The alpha and the omega!&#8221; you say. &#8220;You shall bow down and respect him!&#8221; you say.</p>
<p>We need to be honest with ourselves. Christian or not. Theist or atheist. Our ideas of Jesus are merely that&#8230; ideas. I&#8217;m not saying Jesus isn&#8217;t real. I&#8217;m saying every conception of him we hold is essentially our own. It is much like a memory. We can remember countless moments from our past, but they are merely re-creations of a former reality. The church, Christianity, our religions, our beliefs, they are built upon those former things.</p>
<p>When a ridiculous version of Jesus is mocked, it is the absurd idea that is under siege, not God or his son. My bobble-head pokes fun of society and its fixation with making Jesus so commercial. That is what is being ridiculed, not Jesus himself. To suggest such trivial things are cause for eternal retribution truly offends me, because this also suggests Jesus somehow represents the self-absorbed, those preoccupied with t-shirts instead of humanity.</p>
<p>What is most offensive is Robot Jesus, the same old, tired, mechanical Jesus that the fraudulently pious wind up and clap their hands to each week. Robot Jesus does what you want him to do, what you expect him to do. You can dress him up however you like. You can put him away when you&#8217;re sick of him.</p>
<p>You can also flip the switch on his back from <strong>love</strong> to <strong>kill</strong>.</p>
<p>If you value and respect what Jesus stood for, we ask you to join us here at We Occupy Jesus. We have plenty of robots to smash.</p>
<p>Would you like to borrow a hammer?</p>
