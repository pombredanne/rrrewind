<p>Hello!  I am so excited to introduce you to <a href="http://braveintuitiveyou.com" target="_blank">Flora Bowley</a>!  She is an amazing painter who paints with intuition and a beautiful outlook on life.  Her work can be seen in homes, galleries, hotels, businesses (like, say, Rachel Ray!), around the world.  Flora has recently published a book called <a href="http://braveintuitiveyou.com/shop/my-book/" target="_blank">Brave Intuitive Painting</a> and teaches workshops and online classes about painting and art.</p>
<p>I love getting inside the mind of artists I respect.   Flora was super generous with her time and has answered some questions for us!  Enjoy!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3727" alt="Flora Bowley Artist and Painter.   Interview on Beautiful Hello Blog" src="http://beautifulhello.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/flora1.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p><strong><em>When did you begin creating artwork?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think I was born holding a crayon. Ha! No really, I have always  been creating in some way or another.  As a kid, I was really into  making &#8220;sculptures&#8221; and jewelery out of mud, sticks and seaweed.  I  even used to try and sell them which I find really funny&#8230;always  the entrepreneur.  I was also very into watercolors, markers,  crayons as a kid&#8230;pretty much anything that made color.  In high  school, I was admittedly the art teacher&#8217;s pet.  I assisted her in  hanging all the shows and somehow convinced the principal to let me  hang out in the art room for large parts of my day.</p>
<p>Honestly though, I never grew up thinking I could make a living as  an artist. I thought that honor was reserved for about ten people  in the world and surely I was not one of them.  So, I entered  college thinking I would become a graphic designer.  I will always  be grateful to my drawing teacher who, after observing my use of  color during a figure drawing class, pulled me aside to tell me  very pointedly, &#8220;You are a painter!  You must paint!&#8221;  From that  point on, I took as many painting classes as possible.  I had my  first show at a coffee shop when I was 20 and sold a number of  pieces.  That is when some sort of light bulb went off for me and I  decided I could actually make a living as an artist.  That became  the goal and I never looked back.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you describe your creative process?</em></strong></p>
<p>My creative process is extremely intuitive, forgiving and  free-flowing. I allow my paintings to emerge naturally by building  up many layers or acrylic paint.  I never start with a plan,  because it&#8217;s simply more interesting to me to NOT know what is  going to happen before it&#8217;s actually happening.  This allows for so  much more freedom and the ability to improvise and be spontaneous.    At any given moment, anything is possible and there is really no  way of making a &#8220;mistake&#8221; which I love!  If I don&#8217;t like something  I&#8217;ve done, I simply cover it up or transform it in some way the  next time I add a layer.   I always work on more than one painting  at a time so the layers have time to dry while I&#8217;m working on the  other paintings.  I also rotate my canvas many times and radically  change the color scheme throughout the process just to keep things  fresh and unexpected.  The whole process becomes kind of a metaphor  for living where bravery, playfulness, curiosity, honoring  intuition and being open to change are greatly rewarded.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3728" alt="Flora2" src="http://beautifulhello.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/flora2.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p><strong><em>What inspires you in your day-to-day life as an artist?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gosh, so many things inspire me! I&#8217;ve always been really inspired  by the natural world and the cycles of life found there.  Things  like seed pods, cocoons, sprouts, blooms, branches and birds have  been themes in my work for many years.  I&#8217;m also really inspired by  music and I have a really hard time painting without it.  I allow  the rhythms, beats and lyrics to literally move my body and brush  around the canvas.  Music helps me get out of my head and into the  rest of my body which is so helpful in my process.  Lately, I&#8217;ve  also been really inspired by geometric shapes, graffiti, feathers,  shamanic symbols and florescent colors.  I like finding inspiration  in unexpected places too, like reading between the lines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any tips for overcoming &#8220;creative blocks&#8221;?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes!  I teach painting workshops all around the world, so helping  people through creative blocks is one of my specialties.  I believe  most creative blocks happen when we forget to trust ourselves.   When we start to question what we are doing, why we are doing it  and what to do next, we remove ourselves from the creative  flow&#8212;the intuitive place where we KNOW what to do without  over-thinking.  For me, this &#8220;knowing&#8221; place is deeply connected to  our soul which is deeply connected to everything around us.  When  we open ourselves up to this connection and feeling of belonging,  trusting our inner voice and intuitive urges becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Some ways I help people find this connection is through intention,  affirmations, ceremony, breath, movement, music and poetry.  I also  have my students paint with their eyes closed or with the  non-dominant hand to help them free up. I encourage my students to  &#8220;dance&#8221; the paint across the canvas as they follow along to an  awesome song. There are so many ways to access this place of  freedom, but it all comes down to TRUST&#8230;and momentum <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3731" alt="Flora Bowley Artist and Painter.   Interview on Beautiful Hello Blog" src="http://beautifulhello.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-22-at-10-04-48-pm.png?w=720"   /><br />
<strong><em>What advice do you have for marketing yourself as an artist?</em></strong></p>
<p>The first thing I would say is to focus on creating the work and  developing a style for a good while before you start to focus on  marketing.  I&#8217;ve noticed lately, that a lot of people are anxious  to create a business out of their art before they have really  developed themselves as an artist.  I think this is a major pitfall  and probably the source of a lot of frustration.  Although I did  start having shows early on, I also worked as a waitress, massage therapist and yoga teacher for many years as I was learning about  paint and finding my voice.  Slowly, I worked my other jobs less  and less as my art started to support me more and more.  It was a  VERY gradual process over the course of many years and I&#8217;m grateful  for that process.</p>
<p>When you feel authentically ready to show and promote your work, I  suggest putting together a really simple and beautiful website that  highlights your work in a non-distracting way.  Blogging is also a  great way to share your story and keep things fresh for people who  are interested in what you are doing.  There are so many ways to  connect online now through social media, etc.  It&#8217;s an amazing and  powerful time to be an artist as the world is literally at your  fingertips!  But again, doing the work in the studio should be  taking up more time than doing the promotional work on your  computer.  At least that&#8217;s my opinion.</p>
<p><strong><em>What advice would you give to young artists starting a career in art?</em></strong></p>
<p>I would say much of what I said in response to the marketing  question, but I would also add that passion, dedication and belief  in what you are doing are the key ingredients to success.  If you  are not extremely passionate about making art, it&#8217;s probably not  the best career option for you.  It&#8217;s certainly not an easy way to  make a living, but if you <em>have to</em> create art to feel like  yourself, that is a very good place to start!</p>

<p>Thanks Flora!  That was so insightful and encouraging.  I can&#8217;t wait to get out my brushes and start painting with a little less stress and more expression.   Check out more of Flora&#8217;s extensive portfolio <a href="http://braveintuitiveyou.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mashable recently published an article called <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/50-things-replaced-technology/"><strong>50 Things Replaced By Modern Technology</strong></a>. As I looked through their list of things people don&#8217;t do anymore, I definitely felt feelings of nostalgia bubbling up. Some of the things, however, I was not sad to see phased out as modern technology evolves. One example is #22 on Mashable&#8217;s list: &#8220;Renew your car registration by visiting the DMV.&#8221; Thank goodness things like renewing your car registration are now made easier by filling out an online form instead of waiting five hours at the DMV. On the hottest day of summer. When the building has no AC and you&#8217;re sandwiched between the sweaty guy who doesn&#8217;t know what deodorant is and the poor woman juggling three screaming children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sentimental person, so I decided to make my own list of things [on Mashable's list] that I wish WEREN&#8217;T replaced by modern technology. Check it out below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-fed-2136290.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-809" alt="print photography" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-fed-2136290.jpg?w=240&#038;h=160" width="240" height="160" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#1: Print photographs.</span></strong> I love printing photos, and I still do. Though it&#8217;s faster to upload an album onto Facebook than wait a day to receive my printed copies, there&#8217;s nothing quite like holding the actual photos in your hand and flipping through them as you remember the good times they hold. Shopping for the right frame for each photo is fun as well. Also, you can&#8217;t stick your Facebook photos on your wall to decorate your home (at least not yet).</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#2: Handwritten letters.</span></strong> When I was little, I used to write letters to my best friend, who lived a whole hour away from me. Granted, we saw each other pretty often, about once a week. But it was still nice to go through the mail as a kid and get excited when something came addressed to me! Wall posts and direct messages on Twitter just aren&#8217;t the same. One thing I realized is that waiting for someone to respond with a hand-written letter really teaches a kid patience. It&#8217;s not like today, where you start to freak out when it&#8217;s been two hours and your friend still hasn&#8217;t responded to your email. Aren&#8217;t other people on email 24/7 like I am?</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#3: Make mix tapes. </span></strong>This was like the ultimate sign that a guy liked you&#8230;in middle school. He&#8217;d hand you a mix tape full of the good stuff, like K-Ci &amp; JoJo, Monica, Boyz II Men, maybe throw in some Savage Garden. Back then, that was practically the same as asking you out (lucky guy, he didn&#8217;t actually have to vocalize that he liked you, just make a mix tape). The thing I miss about this is that people would take time to think about what songs to put on the tape, and how to make it obvious enough that they cared for the person.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#4: Check a map before or during a road trip or vacation. </span></strong>I have mixed feelings about this one. If we&#8217;re talking about technology like a GPS that just tells you where to go, then I wish maps weren&#8217;t replaced by GPS systems. However, I&#8217;m fine with Google Maps. Mostly what I hope doesn&#8217;t happen to youth growing up in a technology-driven generation is that they don&#8217;t learn to read maps. I think knowing how to read maps is a crucial life skill and parents should teach their kids (or themselves) how to do so, even if it&#8217;s on an iPhone 5.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#5: Develop and send off film for photographs. </span></strong>This kind of ties into #1, but when I read this one, I remembered the days when I&#8217;d wind the film in my camera so it wasn&#8217;t exposed, then pop the back open and stick the roll of film in an envelope at Costco to be developed. A few days later, those rolls of film would magically turn into photographs that I could then put into awesome new frames!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-cordless-phone128302.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-808" alt="cordless phone" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-cordless-phone128302.jpg?w=154&#038;h=231" width="154" height="231" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#6: Remember phone numbers. </span></strong>In elementary school, I could remember a good 5-10 of my friends&#8217; phone numbers. Now, I can remember maybe two numbers. When I was little, I didn&#8217;t have a cell phone, so I&#8217;d pick up the kitchen landline after school, dial a number, and start chatting away. I realize I had just seen them at school, but sometimes you can&#8217;t explain why you do things as a kid.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#7: Make a photo album. </span></strong>Making a scrapbook also goes with this one. Uploading an album online takes minimal effort. But the effort that goes into making a photo album or a scrapbook pays off when you flip through them years later. Not only can you put photos, you can also add ticket stubs, letters, stickers, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#8: Send love letters. </span></strong>My elementary school boyfriend would write me letters, which he&#8217;d then give to his friend, who delivered them to me. I guess there&#8217;s a good and bad side to having physical letters which you can save. Obviously we&#8217;re not together anymore, but back then I&#8217;d read and re-read his letters until the paper was super wrinkled. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a nice keepsake, and physical love letters are something you can look at without having to turn on your computer first.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-epic-fail-grade140436.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-807" alt="stockvault handwriting" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-epic-fail-grade140436.jpg?w=169&#038;h=240" width="169" height="240" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#9: Hand-write essays and school work. </span></strong>I really, really hope hand-writing never gets fully phased out. Sometimes, when I haven&#8217;t written with a pen for a while and then I do, it&#8217;s super embarrassing. It&#8217;s like what I&#8217;d imagine a first-grader&#8217;s hand-writing looks like. Another reason why kids should still hand-write essays and school work is so that they can fully appreciate how good they have it with modern technology at their hands.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#10: Keep a personal diary. </span></strong>I&#8217;ve got a collection of journals/diaries at home (no, I won&#8217;t tell you where) dating from sometime in middle school to college. I used to write in them before I went to sleep. Mostly about guys I liked and how emo I was. But it was incredibly therapeutic and a great way to get my thoughts out of my head so I wasn&#8217;t consumed by them. Also a good way to practice my hand-writing. The danger of keeping a personal online diary is the potential for it to be hacked and your secrets exposed to the world. Or even an accidental publishing as &#8220;Public&#8221; instead of &#8220;Private.&#8221; Of course, with off-line diaries, you also run the risk of your younger siblings finding them and reading them secretly (true story).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a kid, I used to play with action figures in the bathtub. This was probably a ploy by my mom to get me clean, and I guess it worked. I’m not sure how many other kids did this, or to what degree it really matters whether or not it was in the bath.</p>
<p>Well, let me rephrase: I used to play with He-Man and Skeletor action figures. By play, I mean clacking two plastic forces together &#8212; the good guy and the bad guy. Because good conquers evil, the good guy pounded the bad into submission, sending him by my hand to splash and sink.</p>
<div id="attachment_37" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_012809a.htm"><img class="size-medium wp-image-37" alt="An action figure of He-Man from the relaunch of the Masters of the Universe series.  Image from Captain Toy - click image for source and accompanying review." src="http://girlsincapesmag.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/review_motuc1_1.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An action figure of He-Man from the relaunch of the Masters of the Universe series. Image from Captain Toy &#8211; click image for source and accompanying review.</p></div>
<p>It’s not that I didn’t want Skeletor to win, or that he didn’t have the potential to do so. I was conditioned to believe that because he was the bad guy, he had no right to win. He was evil and therefore morally incorrect. He-Man fits the mold of the stereotypical Super-Male, muscle-bound and showing it. And while Skeletor was well-equipped with muscles, he was scrawny in comparison. It was a losing battle as far as he was concerned. Skeletor was destined to be beaten.</p>
<p>You might also notice the villains in most superhero shows are unusually smart and creative. What is this teaching children? I believe the message is that a smart and imaginative man will always be considered the “bad guy.” It is these subtle inferences that find their way into our child’s brain with each piece of media he or she comes across. It is only now that I realize how easily media influences a child and also shows me how difficult it may be to intervene once the idea has caught on.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – I’m not making a case for evil. As children, we are blank slates to be written upon. The brain is in the process of determining what is important and what can be discarded. While this of course is not all bad, our childhood innocence is taken for granted by authority figures as we take it all in.</p>
<div id="attachment_38" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.animationvalley.co.uk/he-man.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38" alt="He-Man production cel featuring villain Skeletor.

Click image for source, which has cels available for purchase." src="http://girlsincapesmag.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/heman-skeletor.jpg?w=300&#038;h=230" width="300" height="230" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He-Man production cel featuring villain Skeletor. From Animation Valley. Click image for source, which has cels available for purchase.</p></div>
<p>The Super-Male is burned into our minds at a very young age through television, elementary schooling, and athletics. There is very little we can do as children to prevent ourselves from becoming what society desires.</p>
<p>That’s why we as adults must go directly to the source and extinguish it. The first solution is reducing disproportionate bulk on figures of male superheroes. Every superhero I can think of is so disproportionate and impractical &#8212; muscles that would explode the organs within and heads the size of peanuts &#8212; it’s no wonder we have men shooting for impossible body types, showcasing how our society values strength, not intelligence, in a man. Instead of only focusing on the strength of a super hero, he should also be valued for his mind. Maintaining the status quo perpetuates the association of intelligence with evil.</p>
<p>Second, I believe all things must be in balance. Children’s toys are not the main argument: I was influenced most of my life by these same types of action figures, and I think I turned out all right. The difference that was made was the integration of creativity and literature in addition to the occasional crime-fighting hero. I can’t say with certainty that most men have action figures and athletics to look to for emotional and developmental help. We must provide following generations with choices involving not only strength and hyper-masculinity, but also art, intellect and shameless sensitivity. It is imperative that we stress the importance of individuality at an early age in order to stop the mass production of the hopelessly Super-Male.</p>

<p>Ancient Egyptian writers depended upon chisels and stone as the medium for their hieroglyphics.  I’m sure many of them embraced the advances in technology that introduced other resources for their passions.  Yet, I imagine there were some who struggled to move forward gleefully.</p>
<p>There was a time when pads of yellow paper graced nearly every table top of our home, patiently waiting for any random thoughts of gibberish to find its way onto a meticulously clean surface.  With my companions, a smooth writing pen and lined paper, I delight in sitting cross-legged on my couch or out on the deck, scribbling away with the security of knowing I can rip off a page, crumble it and have a clean slate ready for my next attempt. </p>
<p>Much like reminiscing through old photographs, I can pick up a journal or notebook stuffed with pages of deep thoughts, easily revisiting my attempts to imitate Robert Frost <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/robert-frost/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poemhunter.com/robert-frost/</a> or Erma Bombeck <a href="http://www.ermamuseum.org/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ermamuseum.org/home.asp</a>.  Sometimes, the words I scripted are buried so deep in the recesses of my mind I don’t recognize the words, yet I always know they are mine because of the handwriting.  </p>
<p>It isn’t that I don’t know the capabilities of the black box that had been assigned its own room in the house for many years.  My job required extensive knowledge of numerous, ever-changing, complex programs, including the infamous MS Word.  Perhaps the challenges forced upon me daily formed a callous on my brain that makes it too painful to imagine drafting my work on my computer.  </p>
<p>Seldom did I take the time to store my creations electronically.  The few that made it through the final stages of editing onto the complex contraption were lost when the hardware failed.  (Thank goodness for my archaic backups!)  The thought of composing something while sitting at the keyboard was as foreign the thought of writing a romance novel.</p>
<p>My daughter frequently reminded me of the century we now live in and the advances in technology that she believed would make my life easier, if only I would try something new.  The way she rolled her eyes when I’d pick up a tablet and began writing reflected her frustration in my failure to listen.  Bless her heart.  Instead of nagging endlessly, she generously provided me with a laptop upon my retirement.  “You can use it anywhere, mom.  You’ll love it.”  </p>
<p>So I tried sitting cross-legged on the sofa with the slim blue device balanced on my lap.  That lasted about ten minutes before the phone rang and I had to untangle my legs from the wire to get across the room to the phone.  What wires you say?  The one attached to the mouse of course.  Yes, I know others may use the one built into their machine, but using the touch pad doesn’t work for me because I keep resting my thumbs as I ponder my next line.  If you have never been gifted in this ability, let me describe what happens next.  The perfect words you struggled for fifteen minutes to compose transform themselves into paragraphs and sentences for which they were not intended.  The time it took to find and edit them is just long enough for the thought to pass and there you sit staring at the screen again. I fixed the problem by disabling the gizmo – ok, I had to have help with that too.</p>
<p>I often found myself reverting back to paper and pen.  It wasn’t until I decided to write my first novel that I considered the time-consuming effort it would take to write a 50,000 word manuscript and then transpose it onto the computer.  One day, after much deliberation, I relented and established a work zone in my dining room where I began typing and editing the dozens of pages I had written before coming to my senses.  </p>
<p>I opened the French doors leading onto the deck and felt a delightful breeze drift in.  The chirp of a nearby cardinal provided for an opportunity to procrastinate and it wasn’t long before I ventured out onto the deck with all tools in hand. My fairybook visions of spending the next few hours accomplishing great things dissipated in seconds. The gentle wind turned into a gust and blew my stacks of paper high into the sky.  With arms flailing, I scrambled urgently to retrieve the papers in flight for fear of a neighbor stealing page 10 of a best seller.</p>
<p>Once I even tried taking my laptop on a daytrip to the river where my husband docked his boat.  He often liked to visit for hours with a friend who lives there.  What a great opportunity, I thought.  I&#8217;ll be inspired as the river carries barges through the lock and dam.  Surely a poem or some type of masterpiece was waiting to find its way into my laptop.  I proudly headed to the lovely swing where I had often written in my small journal.  </p>
<p>I shifted the mouse and pad from my leg to the bench of the swing.  I tried numerous positions to no avail.  I decided to remove the accessory and use the touchpad.  Try as I might, I could not remember the sequence of steps my friend had shown me to reactivate the function.  By the time I successfully retrieved the info from my wary brain, the battery died on the laptop.  I bit my lower lip to keep from screaming and quietly closed the lid and stood up, dropping the mouse and pad at my feet.   Anger turned into tears as I gathered all of the pieces and headed back to the car. </p>
<p>My frown turned into a smile when I opened the door and glanced down at the yellow pad and Cross pen that patiently waited for my attention.  In one hand, I tossed the laptop on the seat and with the other, I embraced my faithful companions, hugging them close as I strolled back to the wooden swing and settled in for a lovely afternoon.</p>
<p>The transition from rock to paper to laptop has not been easy for some of us.  Still, there are benefits to each.  Had it not been for the stones that ancient Egyptians carved, much of history would have been lost. Yet hieroglyphics presented many challenges, especially in portability.  Paper is readily available, portable and can be treasured for many years, yet it is fragile and fades in time.  A laptop stores immense amounts of data, offers unlimited features that transform the written word into works of art, and advances nearly daily in new technology, but with the touch of a delete key, a year’s worth of work can be forever lost into space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken small steps to embrace the wonders of digital technology, but I doubt I will ever relinquish the comfort of paper and pen.  </p>
<p>Can you relate?</p>

Boy Examples: Wrangler, Trick, Track, Cannon, Knight.<br />
Exceptions include: Joy, Hope, Iris, May, June, Daisy. <em>Don&#8217;t get too exotic with your flowers&#8230;your kid shouldn&#8217;t be named Hibiscus or Anthurium.</em> There are no exceptions for boys except maybe August. Maybe.</p>
<p>2. Avoid names of continents, countries or cities.<br />
Girl Examples: Africa, Europe, Italy, Wales (that one&#8217;s for more reasons than one).<br />
Boy Examples: Scotland, Denmark.<br />
Exceptions: There are a lot of exceptions. One of my sorority sisters is named Britain and I think that&#8217;s delightful. Someone else I know is named Sicily. But don&#8217;t call them Zimbabwe or Seattle or something, cuz that just sounds weird&#8230;and sounds like you&#8217;ve decided any word that exists can be a name.</p>
<p>3. Don&#8217;t turn your girl-child into a stripper. You shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to name your kid Chastity, because even if she&#8217;s the most chaste girl in the world, everyone will think she&#8217;s a dirty tramp.<br />
Girl Examples: Verity, Charity, Trinity, Cinnamon (fun fact: I had a hamster named Cinnamon. Yep, just ruined it for you).<br />
Boy Examples: Well, don&#8217;t name your boy after a girl stripper, cuz that&#8217;s just wrong. And don&#8217;t name him Magic Mike.<br />
Exceptions: There are <em>no </em>exceptions.</p>
<p>4. Don&#8217;t go all Gwyneth Paltrow on your kid.<br />
Girl Examples: Apple, Orange, Banana, Pear, Peanut, Flute, Lute&#8230;the list goes on.<br />
Boy Examples: Rocket, Explosive, Banjo, Guitar, Picolo.<br />
Exceptions: If Gwyneth Paltrow <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> like it, you can use it.</p>
<p>5. You are not a flower child, and neither is your one-second-old baby.<br />
Girl Examples: Wind, Flower, Breeze, Whisper, Peace, Love, Mist.<br />
Boy Example: Random, Earth, Strength, Virility, Rain.<br />
Exceptions: Skye might be acceptable, but only if they grow up to be super awesome.</p>
<p>6. Never, EVER, name your child after where they were conceived. Ever.<br />
I met a girl named Kastle once and she said it was because right before she was born her parents went to this Italian castle and stayed there and loved it&#8230;I guarantee they did the don&#8217;t in there and she is the product of their sordid night on a bed made of stone. Don&#8217;t do it.<br />
<em>On another note, don&#8217;t tell your kid where they were conceived. </em></p>
<p>7. After I&#8217;ve said all this, try not to name your kid the same thing as everyone else they&#8217;ll grow up with. It&#8217;s annoying growing up and being known as &#8220;Morgan F&#8221; because there are 5 other Morgans in your class. I&#8217;m not going to give examples, because they&#8217;re so obvious. Also, I feel like I&#8217;m going to offend everyone I know if I do.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a million exceptions and I&#8217;m a jerk about names, but a great rule of thumb is <em>DO NOT NAME YOUR CHILD ANYTHING SARAH PALIN WOULD NAME HERS. Except Piper, cuz that&#8217;s cute.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sitting in a local coffee dispensary, writing the first draft of a blog post in my <a title="Moleskine" href="http://www.moleskineus.com/largeruled.html" target="_blank"><em>Moleskine</em></a> notebook and enjoying a latte (full caffeine, whole milk, five packets of raw sugar &#8230; I&#8217;m hardcore like that, it&#8217;s just the way I roll). This particular establishment had once been known as a meeting place for lesbians; but over the years the herd has thinned and rather than a flock of femmes or a bevy of butches you&#8217;re more likely to see a gaggle of high school girls being incredulous and astonished about <em>everything!</em>, or important business men taking important business calls about important business things and ignoring the barista who&#8217;s trying to take their order, gathered at the watering hole.</p>
<p>So it came as no surprise when I heard two young lesbians at the table next to me lamenting the decline of &#8220;our&#8221; coffee shop from lesbian hot-spot to gay-friendly neighborhood joint.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sucks,&#8221; said one to the other. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing but fucking straight people here anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I glanced up at them, smiling in commiseration, she turned to me and said, &#8220;Oh, sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; I replied, assuming she thought she&#8217;d disrupted my writing or offended me by swearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like I have something against straight people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at her, momentarily confused, until what she was saying finally hit me. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m gay!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now she was the one who looked confused. &#8220;You are? Wow, I totally couldn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,” her friend chimed in. &#8220;Me neither. Totally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly I was stricken with writer&#8217;s block and my latte tasted of despair. Totally.</p>
<p>That evening I recounted the disturbing episode to a friend. “No wonder I can&#8217;t meet anyone,” I whined. “My own people don&#8217;t even know I&#8217;m one of them!”</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were gay when I met you either,&#8221; she confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;You&#8217;re straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first saw you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I thought you were a soccer mom or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://puckerupbuttercup.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/0011-soccer-mom.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-402 alignleft" alt="0011 Soccer Mom" src="http://puckerupbuttercup.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/0011-soccer-mom.jpg?w=720"   /></a>I looked around for a vial of poison to drink, an asp to press against my breast or a windswept cliff upon the moors from which I might throw myself. Alas, there were none.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t misconstrue any of what I&#8217;ve said as a disdain or contempt for the heteronormative community. I love my Straights! I am like the Kathy Griffin of lesbians … except I don&#8217;t do stand-up, make a lot of money, piss off celebrities, my mother isn&#8217;t an alcoholic and I look <em>way</em> better when I&#8217;m not wearing make-up.</p>
<p>I know a lot of gay people say things like &#8230; <em>There&#8217;s a guy at work who&#8217;s straight</em> or <em>I had a straight roommate in college once</em> or <em>I think Chelsea Handler is <strong>so</strong> funny! &#8230; </em>in an attempt to &#8220;relate&#8221; to heterosexuals. And I&#8217;m sure when we do, it sounds just as ridiculous as meeting someone who&#8217;s Japanese and blurting out, &#8220;I love origami!&#8221;</p>
<p>But my experience is a little different. In the summer of 2010, three weeks after my 17-year relationship imploded, a car accident left me with an ankle too badly broken to even hobble. Since neither my Ex nor I enjoyed hiking, camping or wymyn&#8217;s music festivals, we&#8217;d drifted apart from most of the lesbian-couple friends we&#8217;d once had (for those who don&#8217;t know, <em>The Rules of Lesbian Relationships</em> state that once you enter into one, you must phase out activities that involve things such as fun, in favor of forced marches and sleeping in the dirt). So when it ended I found myself separated from the lesbian herd, stranded in the vast desolation of South Orange County. I was lost and alone.</p>
<p>But then a kind woman found me. She took me in and gave me a place to sleep, she fed me, she bathed me, she got me drunk. I ate at her table, I played with her children and she made me feel like part of her family. There were social gatherings with friends who were fun and friendly and got me drunk. Eventually, she even stopped locking up her jewelry when I was alone in the house.</p>
<p>That woman was a heterosexual.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not shocked that straight people don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m gay. Typically the only indicator I display is the silver ring on my right thumb &#8212; not the most conspicuous piece of signage.  A few years ago however, when my hair was short, they were much more adept at picking-up on my lesbianisoty, sometimes saying, &#8220;I knew it! My gaydar&#8217;s always been really great!&#8221; And by &#8220;gaydar,&#8221; I can only assume they meant guessing that inch-long, purple, spiky hair might be favored by lesbians, because they were <em>really great</em> at doing that! It&#8217;s weird though, now that my hair is longer and blonde and I&#8217;ve learned to use some basic tools (blow-dryer, round-brush, thing that&#8217;s a blow-dryer and a round-brush combined together), I don&#8217;t meet as many straight people with really great gaydar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really all that surprised when other gay people don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m a lesbian because I&#8217;m not the best at just spotting other gay people, either; and I usually have to do the eye-contact thing. My lesbian-detection abilities are weakest at the bank or Target or a shopping mall &#8212; places that I think of as <em>out of context. </em>So it stand to reason that there are others like me who have trouble getting a signal in certain areas. But when I&#8217;m in a recognized lesbian-zone (eg, hiking trails, softball fields, The Home Depot) &#8212; places that are <em>in context</em>, I&#8217;m a little bewildered. Has my lesbi-mojo slipped so far that even in a lesbian(ish) coffee shop I&#8217;m undetectable to other lesbians?</p>
<h3>The eye-contact thing &#8230;</h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; is when two gay people see each, their eyes meet and in that moment, however brief, a message passes between them saying, &#8220;Hello. I see that you are gay. I too am gay.&#8221; I&#8217;ve describe this &#8220;telepathy&#8221; to heterosexuals who also claimed to have it, they are mistaken however. They may correctly identify someone and think &#8220;Hello. I see that you are lesbian. I am one of those straight people who can tell.&#8221;  But, straight people make accurate guesses based on outward appearance, while gays can do it without such signs. Also, the lesbian looking back at you is thinking, &#8220;Wow, good guess. Were my cargo shorts your first clue?”</p></blockquote>
<p>And now that we&#8217;ve got my mojo all beat down and weak, let&#8217;s throw that soccer mom comment at it and see if we can kill it, shall we? But don&#8217;t jump to any anti-soccer mom conclusions about me just yet. The truth is I like soccer moms. <em>A lot</em>. I have this image of a tired woman schlepping around her screaming brood and their tangled accumulation of sports equipment, turning up the stereo in the minivan to try and drown out the incessant noise and the voice in her head that won&#8217;t stop asking <em>is this the life you always dreamed of?</em></p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just a romantic, or maybe I watch too much porn, but I want to take Soccer Mom away from all that. If it&#8217;s the former, then I&#8217;ll meet her at work or perhaps the gym, she&#8217;ll find me witty and charismatic and strangely intriguing. We&#8217;ll become fast friends and there will be a montage of us walking on the beach with our pants rolled up to the knee, laughing together over drinks and one where we both reach for something at the same time, our fingers touch, our eyes meet and then we both look quickly away, played over a song like Corrine Bailey Rae&#8217;s <em><a title="Put Your Records On" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWyD98rd14" target="_blank">Put Your Records On</a></em>. Eventually she&#8217;ll confess that she has feelings for me but that it&#8217;s too complicated because of the kids and the custody fight with her bastard of an ex-husband. She&#8217;ll say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I just can&#8217;t do this&#8221; and walk out of the apartment, leaving me standing there feeling hurt and alone &#8230; only to burst back through the door a minute later saying, &#8220;Who am I kidding?&#8221; as she throws her arms around me and kisses me (dear heterosexuals, you&#8217;ve just been introduced to the basic plot line of almost every lesbian romance movie on the market &#8230; we have movies too, and they&#8217;re just as cheesy as yours!). If it&#8217;s the latter, I&#8217;ll show up at her house to do some repair work inexplicably wearing 5” pumps and carrying a toolbox full of sex toys (there&#8217;s a <em>Snap-on Tools</em> joke in there, but this post is already getting too long), and we will commence to fuck like monkeys as soon as the <em>bowchicabowow</em> music starts (dear uhhh &#8230; oh hell, you all already know &#8230; everyone watches this crap).</p>
<p>So you see, my anguish has nothing to do with an aversion to either heterosexuals or mother&#8217;s of children involved in organized sports. It&#8217;s that I now feel my self-image is distorted and my self-perception on par with that of Donald Trump. By allowing my hair to grow did I inadvertently don some kind of lesbian cloak of invisibility? Did the time I spent living with the heterosexuals alter my chemical pheromones that alert others gays to my presence among them? Do I not exude the aura of self-assured, devilishly-charming lesbian romance-movie character I imagine? After living in South Orange County for so long could I have absorbed the appearance and mannerisms of a soccer mom without even realizing it? Is it possible that the <em>Stepford Wives</em> phenomenon rumor is actually true?</p>
<p>My mind reels with self-doubt, unanswered questions and thoughts of the <em>Wahl</em> clipper gathering dust on the top shelf of my closet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://her30s.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dep_8500539-barber-hair-salon-hairdresser-icon-symbol-sign-pictogram.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-247" alt="dep_8500539-Barber-Hair-Salon-Hairdresser-Icon-Symbol-Sign-Pictogram" src="http://her30s.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dep_8500539-barber-hair-salon-hairdresser-icon-symbol-sign-pictogram.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a>When I was a kid spirals would cascade out of my scalp in the most unruly way driving my mother crazy. Being a straight haired woman herself, she had no clue as to how to care for a daughter with this type of mane. She was convinced, despite my screaming and countless tears, that she could brush my hair and have it sit atop my head in an organized fashion. Of course this is not the case with curly haired girls as the cardinal rule of having healthy curls is, “Thou shall not brush curly hair.” When my mom grew tired of dealing with this “problem,” she simply took me to the salon and had the hair dresser cut off all of my curls. It sounds traumatic but having short hair was quite liberating.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My mom and I went to the same salon for over twenty years at least twice a month if not weekly. My mom would get her hair and nails done and I would maintain my short hair by getting it trimmed, cutting in layers and sometimes making the fatal mistake of cutting in bangs that I would then have to hide by pasting down with gel or wearing head bands even when they were out of fashion. It was fun to feel transformed and renewed even if my mom and I left the salon looking exactly the same, which was most often the case. When our hair dresser’s husband passed away, she suffered through a period of mental illness and had to close down her shop. That is when my hair began to grow down my back, the long forgotten spirals returned, and my mother by then an older lady on a tighter budget, began to do her own hair. It was the end of a tradition, more evidence that time had passed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a woman in her thirties I have no hair dresser to call my own. As a result I have been to a different salon every single time I have needed a haircut since 2007 and still have not found someone I can pay a return visit to. I went to the young gay guy who was skilled and gentle to my tender head but worked in a location too far away. I went to a woman who gasped when she saw my hair and said that whoever had cut it last left one side 2 inches longer than the other, (I think that might have been me…Who knew!?). I went to a lady recommended by a co-worker who was sporting various colors and various hair lengths in a jumble that almost made sense as a fashion forward hair style. That should have been my clue, the haircut she gave me left me with more split ends than I walked in with. And finally, last night after work I walked into a salon in a shopping center in North Hollywood where I experienced the cutest and the worst hairdresser of them all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This young man of bulky, clumsy hands and gentle soul was experiencing his first day as a professional cosmetologist. He was nervous, concerned and every time he asked me a question it came out as if it had been rehearsed. He excused himself to the back room and left me mid hair cut various times to consult with someone. He worked slow and meticulously with sweat pouring down his forehead even though we were in a temperature controlled environment. His big hands got tangled in the knots in my hair and he actually cut his own finger instead of my hair. He came back with a band aid on that pulled my hair out even more as it stuck to the adhesive. I felt like a little kid again getting her hair brushed by her mother. Even though I was in pain the entire time and a simple trim took over an hour, I was rooting for him the entire time. At the end I told him he had done a good job and left him a generous tip. This morning I noticed he left one thick strand on the right side longer than the rest of my hair. I will either be cutting that piece myself, or combing it to the other side…</strong></p>

<p>Before: I jumped into the pool and swam to the other side.</p>
<p>After: I glanced briefly at the water before jumping in. The sun glistened through the windows and onto the surface of the pool, casting light grey shadows on the bottom of the pool with little twinkling stars floating on the surface. No one had broken the perfection of the top of the water yet, although two red and white lane ropes ran from end to end cutting the pool into thirds. It was like they were part of the pool structure though, immovable and permanent, red on the ends with white in between. The water moved ever so slightly, shifting the twinkling stars around like little buoys. In a few minutes the sun would move and be gone from the surface but in the meantime I dawdled in an effort to prolong the beauty. From my left I heard a &#8220;splash!&#8221; and in that instant, the water went from serene to beaten. Splashy, angry little waves struck the edge, and several &#8220;sloops&#8221; were heard as the first waves were sucked into the filters. The lane ropes helped to calm the waves but they would not halted. &#8220;Slap, slap, slap,&#8221; went the arms of the other swimmers as they began to jump in in droves now, one after the other. It was time.</p>
<p>I chose to jump in the pool, deciding it would be preferable to get my feet wet first rather than my head. In that split second in the air before hitting the water, I cringed at the thought of being cold, and wondered what was in store for us in the pool today. Then the feeling was gone. My feet hit, enjoying the cold water, but as it rose to my chest I felt the chill. After my face hit the water, I allowed my body to sink to the bottom. As my feet hit the tiny tiles on the bottom, I shifted into gear; it was time to work. My feet pushed off the bottom, thrusting my body to the surface into a horizontal position. My head cradled in the wave I was creating in front of me, my feet propelling me forward with their constant flutter, and my arms creating ovals through the air and water. As I approach the wall, I shift my stroke slightly, pull harder underwater and force myself around in a somersault. Pushing off the wall is the best part of the length; using the force of your biggest muscles, the body is propelled much more quickly and out you go, streamlined and ready to take on another length. As I push off the wall, the swimmer behind me is entering it, pushing me to go faster in the next length to avoid the dreaded touch of the swimmer behind on my feet. Looking ahead as I glide forward, I can see the other bodies moving through the water, with their shadows visible on the pool bottom. The lane ropes stretch from end to end, looking endless, appearing to stop only when you are touching the wall. Back and forth, back and forth we go. Shifting my gaze from the bottom of the pool to just in front of me, I know where I should be looking but can&#8217;t resist the temptation to stare at the shadows and light dancing on the bottom.</p>
<p>Over and over again the arms and legs of the swimmers are drawn through the water, each one purposeful and beautiful and unique. It takes less than 15 metres to get into the rhythm and to hear the beauty of the noise, everyone being in a slightly different spot in their stroke but coming together into swimming symphony. In each moment, someone is starting a breath, another is finishing, a few are stealing a glance onto the pool deck, but all of us swimming. Each of us alone in our thoughts but together in the pool making beautiful music.</p>

<p>I scratched the surface of the bar with my thumbnail to see what the wood looked like before beer, vomit and oil from its patrons’ hands had coated its surface. My own beer had gone relatively flat. It probably hadn’t been stored properly to begin with. I watched Dale, the bar keep, swipe the silver surfaces of the countertops with a wet and filthy rag. I wondered why he bothered?</p>
<p>He had an affinity for country music sung by sorrowful women and I knew he was singing it in his head while he pretended to work.  As I watched him, he glanced up casually before letting his eyes fall back to his hands. Then he lifted his eyes with deliberate slowness, like some irresistible force was summoning them. Whatever was holding his interest was directly over my left shoulder. Not wanting to inflate the ego of whatever newcomer had just strolled through the doors, I allowed a solid beat to pass before looking up into the mirror that hung over the vast collection of liquor bottles.</p>
<p>A flash of red caressing long legs. It was all I needed to see before my heart froze. Before my chest ached. Before I had to grip the edge of the wooden bar and stare at the ground.</p>
<p>I felt her survey the room like I would have felt her hand slide across my back. Part of me wanted desperately to turn and face her. My shoulders were fighting me, trying to turn of their own accord in her direction. But, I couldn’t. I couldn’t allow myself to fall into this pit again. I knew what would happen if I did and the bottom was not where I wanted to end up.</p>
<p>The scent of her soft sweet perfume lapped over me along with the voice of the singer that flowed from the speakers around the room. The song fit. I wasn’t sure why but it felt right, like it was singing to me. Saying something for me that I couldn’t say for myself. And just as suddenly as I had been lost in my memories, she was sitting next to me, smiling, asking Dale for a Grey Goose martini. Dale complied without resistance and I wondered how he could betray me. Its not like he didn’t know who she was, we had come here for years before… before what had happened to us. He should have turned her away. He should have been a friend and spared me from myself. But he wasn’t my friend; He was a bartender. I couldn’t fault him for it; it was the reason I showed up at the dingy bar every night. Because I didn’t want the company of friends. Not their kindness or their questions. I wanted an empty bar with bad lighting and sad music.</p>
<p>I could feel her watching me then and I looked up to take in the perfect shape of her face. She smiled, the same smile I knew so well and I felt the pieces of my heart splinter into smaller shards. She was talking to me. I could see her lips moving, red full lips, with flashes of white between them. I smiled; I couldn’t help myself. It was a relief to see her. And then I was lost. That quickly. I couldn’t stop myself. I reached up to stroke her face and her skin was soft against the tips of my fingers.</p>
<p>The harsh smack of her response rung in my ears. My face stung and my neck ached as the force of it knocked me backwards on my stool. I grappled with the side of the bar and air as I watched its feet lift up off of the ground. It took all my focus to keep me upright. And when I looked back at her, her face had changed. It was rounder and the eyes were brown. The red dress was gone, replaced by a faded black one. Her face was indignant and her mouth moved releasing unintelligible garble.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her.<br />
It had never been her.</p>
<p>My wife was gone.</p>
<p>Dale watched me, his eyes understanding but not forgiving. I scrambled off of my bar stool and headed for the door. But I couldn’t completely leave. I had seen her in there. My wife had been there, right there. I let my face fall into my hands and felt the familiar sway of my body back and forth. The brick on the wall lifted my shirt and scraped my back as I slid to the ground. My hands filled with salty tears and my own sobs echoed off of the walls of the alleyway. I went through that night again. For the millionth time and let the <i>ifs</i> wash over me. <i>If</i> I hadn’t had those last five drinks… <i>If</i> I had rolled down the window… <i>If</i> we had been fighting and she had leapt out of the car at a stoplight… <i>if</i> … <i>if</i>…. <i>If</i>…. Then I heard Dale comfort the woman still left behind in the bar.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about him. He’s crazy, but harmless.” And he was right. I am crazy. And it was exactly what I deserve. I deserve to be hungry. I deserve to be cold. I deserve to have the scent of urine on my clothes. I deserve it. All of it. I let my body continue to rock and ignored the flesh rubbing off on the bricks. Tomorrow, I decided as I swayed and caught the eye of passerbys, my sign will read &#8220;BROKEN.&#8221; Because I am.</p>
