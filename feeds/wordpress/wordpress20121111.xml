				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>She was calling, she said, from the bowels<br />
of a library on a college campus where<br />
she hid each night and slept among the stacks.<br />
She’d been living that way for years, moving on<br />
when she was discovered to someplace else where<br />
she would blend in with the scenery<br />
and pass undetected among the young.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRZyxNvs8NX8Ybr1QxEfqt10G6Hvq_nnxTSuXqZ3o7iWR_PzXgGBQ" height="183" width="275" /></p>
<p>I heard her out. She’d reached my name after<br />
running through the directory, alphabetically.<br />
Apparently no one in the a’s or b’s or any of the c’s<br />
before me had done so. It was a strange tale she told,<br />
how she’d been cheated  of her inheritance—<br />
money her father had left her&#8211;by a trustee, distant<br />
and cold, far off in California.  She said she had<br />
no money to live on, or even fight with, because of him.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTzGObB4IPqDQCpQHWtEEQOtTFXcJSr-KHdWfiJAMVy26NxBCqP" height="198" width="254" /></p>
<p>I called the fellow, a reasonable sort.<br />
He thanked me for my concern and the<br />
attention I’d given his ward, but he said she was<br />
off her drugs, the police had been alerted.  They knew<br />
she’d come East and were looking for her<br />
but they hadn’t found her yet.  There were too<br />
many libraries for her to hide in in this City of Books,<br />
a place such as Borges imagined where for every</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQPCIhrqDn4HtlGzAJLmsMiAKutgfSTDThlL_yKN4NnD91OmuR" height="218" width="232" /></p>
<p>rational line there were rows of senseless cacophony,<br />
a library that was the universe, the librarians in suicidal<br />
despair.  I rolled over in bed to answer the phone<br />
and heard her voice again, more desperate than before.<br />
They were closing in, couldn’t I help?<br />
She asked.  What had the trustee said?<br />
She wouldn’t say where she was—perhaps I’d turn her in.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTD85JFiGYV8QGrEgMPMPIoWO7hNXph0Z_kv-wroU6jepZ2p-e8sw" height="240" width="210" /></p>
<p>I don’t recall exactly what I told her other than<br />
to say I couldn’t help her that day; another woman<br />
—the one who would become my wife—<br />
awaited me at the church.  She was not the sort who’d<br />
tolerate a groom who’d dare to show up late<br />
to his wedding and hers, and so I demurred.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS8uVjnpVSCY9nhs3yAZTbr9IlcPhdv-eCPKLSTnq5IYKIhNhjz" height="259" width="194" /></p>
<p>You’ll have to try the next name on the list<br />
I said.  But you’re the only one who’s talked<br />
to me yet, she said, and those words rang in my head<br />
like overtones of plainsong, Gregorian chant echoing<br />
in the chancel up to the apse, as I repeated my vows,<br />
facing the light streaming through a stained-glass window<br />
thinking of her disordered mind, which kept her running<br />
as I prepared to settle down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://bluebirdblvd.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mohairsweaternationalarchief.jpg"><img src="http://bluebirdblvd.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mohairsweaternationalarchief.jpg?w=590" alt="" title="MohairSweaterNationalArchief"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14492" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font size="2" color="black"></p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, when I am dreaming,</strong> I find myself standing in the costume shop of the university theater department.   A dressmaker&#8217;s dummy stands in front of me, and I hold a pair of shears in my right hand.&nbsp; What I am doing is what I learned to do that summer I interned for the costume department:&nbsp; I am draping a garment from muslin and pins and hope, using a beautiful drawing rendered by the resident costume designer.</p>
<p>The dream reminds me of something essential that I try to carry in my front pocket every day:&nbsp; To learn, you must jump and you must fall.&nbsp; Again and again, you fall, learning something new each time about how to jump.&nbsp; And when you&#8217;ve fallen and learned enough times, something beautiful in you will lift up with practiced wings and fly mad, wild circles around your heart.</p>
<p>What I forgot the first year that I studied design (and sewing and drawing) was how to fail, and how to learn from failure.  It happens so easily.&nbsp; By the time I turned twenty, I was a minor championship dancer and a published student writer.  (My work was included in a professional anthology, even.)&nbsp; I had awards and trophies and prize-ish gewgaws tucked away in a closet. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had worked at these things for years and years, and, in time, had learned how to be good at them— up to a point.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been ages since I tried something new.&nbsp; And if you&#8217;re not trying new things to some degree all of your life, you will forget what &#8220;new&#8221; feels like, and &#8220;new&#8221; feels like failure and misunderstanding and frustration and success and flying and the best dessert you have ever eaten in your life.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another catch that most people miss.&nbsp; I may have missed it had I not had a college-level refresher course in failure.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how to succeed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When you work at something you love</strong> for a long time, it is easy to become complacent.  You know a few fancy-ish tricks.  People like a certain way that you do what you do.  If you go on long enough repeating a tried and true formula for making art, what you love about making art will grow thin, and the art itself will wilt, and eventually, stagnate.  </p>
<p>Even when you do learn a discipline in a deep professional way, you have to keep trying new things within your chosen discipline— and <i>fail</i> at them.&nbsp; Fail until you succeed.&nbsp; And when you do finally succeed, you will create <i>new</i> variations on that idea, allowing you strike upon something you <i>don&#8217;t</i> know how to do, and you fail at <i>that</i>.&nbsp; On and on.</p>
<p>You see, this is the way new art gets developed, and the route new ideas must travel deepen and grow. In all art forms, you learn every trifling rule and lump of esoterica about the disciplines you love, and once you know them like you know your own fingertips, you break those rules and throw out that esoterica while you make something new. &nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s art.&nbsp; That&#8217;s writing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s dance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s photography.&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s <i>life</i>, to be quite frank.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What happened to me that first year</strong> I studied sewing is that I didn&#8217;t fall into my failure and learn from it as fully as I could.&nbsp; I <em>winced</em> through it.&nbsp; <em>Cringed</em> through it.&nbsp; And <em>whined</em> a bit, I&#8217;m afraid to say.&nbsp; The mistakes felt personal.&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t personal.&nbsp; They were ordinary mistakes.&nbsp; I had no idea that failing was ordinary anymore.  So when the costume designer stood in front of me on the first day, and said, &#8220;Are you better at algebra or geometry?&#8221;— I nearly fainted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither.&#8221; &nbsp;(Was this a mistake?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t do math!&nbsp; Oh my gosh, this was a mistake!)</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you had to choose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geometry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In patternmaking terms, that means you&#8217;re a draper.&nbsp; Those who excel at algebra are flat patternmakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The designer then steered me toward a dressmaker&#8217;s dummy, handed me some long pins, a length of muslin, and a pair of sewing scissors.&nbsp;&nbsp; After an intense five-minute lesson, she passed me a rendering (drawing) of a costume she wanted me to make.&nbsp; She showed me the fabrics we&#8217;d be using and waved me in the direction of the cubby where more muslin was stored.&nbsp; &#8220;Drape a pattern,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now?&#8221;&nbsp; I balked, swinging the scissors too close to my knot of dyed black hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drape?&nbsp; <i>Now</i>?&#8221;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>She stared through me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, okay, okay.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using steps from her five-minute lesson, I found the grain of the muslin and pinned the fabric to the dummy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stepped back and peered at the costume rendering laid out on the table.&nbsp; The drawing the costume designer made was so beautiful I was afraid to touch it with my clammy hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; A flapper dress.&nbsp; A fabric for the top, a fabric for the bottom.&nbsp; Top, sleeveless, slight scoop to front and back of neckline.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathered hip-length skirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden zipper on the side.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.&nbsp; The scissors trembled in my hand.&nbsp; Stop it, I said to myself, silently.&nbsp; Just stop.&nbsp; It&#8217;s <i>muslin</i>.</p>
<p>And I made one cut, and pinned it.&nbsp; Then another, and pinned it.</p>
<p>Five hours passed.&nbsp; I had draped the top, front and back (messily), marking with fabric pencil where the zipper would go.&nbsp; I had started draping the skirt, which had those evenly placed gathers.&nbsp; I put my supplies away,  and went straight to work at the coffee shop downtown.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I came back the next day.</strong></p>
<p>The designer lifted her eyes from the designs she was examining on the cutting table.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was always working, in one way or another.  Even when she was standing still, she was working.&nbsp; &#8220;Finish the skirt, then make the flat pattern with brown Kraft paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a <i>pattern</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a pattern.&nbsp; You studied patterns all last year.&nbsp; Mark the center grain line on each piece, add two inches for the seams, and indicate the place where the zipper goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pattern?&#8221;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing.&nbsp; This professor knew better than <i>anyone</i> how badly I&#8217;d done the year before in my design studies.</p>
<p>Again, she stared through me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, okay, okay.&#8221; I waved my hands around, marking my face with a fabric pencil by accident.</p>
<p>In another five hours, I finished draping the skirt, marked all of the pieces on the dummy, took out the pins, grabbed the brown Kraft paper and an ordinary pencil and made a sewing pattern.</p>
<p>Then I went home, changed for work, and went to my job at the coffeehouse.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The third day,</strong> the designer looked up from the complicated suit she was making and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to start on the dress today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a <i>dress</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes to the ceiling. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to argue anymore.&nbsp; I started towards the fabric wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;BUT—!&#8221; She raised a finger.&nbsp; &#8220;But, we&#8217;re going to have my assistant cut out the pieces from your pattern with the <em>real</em> fabric because the fabric is expensive and your cutting skills&#8230;.”</p>
<p>Our eyes collectively flicked to the sharp scissors in my hand.</p>
<p>She finished her thought, &#8220;&#8230;need work.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get to your fabric issue another day.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On and on it went</strong> the length of the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, the designer made me deal with some new challenge that had previously frightened me.  Every day, I became a little less afraid.&nbsp; At the end of the summer, we prepared to put on our last repertory production.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the shoes for the Emperor, Courtenay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I patterned them, but I didn&#8217;t cut them out yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going downstairs for the dress rehearsal.&nbsp; Get A— to cut the pattern.&nbsp; You sew the cut tops onto these Chinese slippers in the next ten minutes, or the Emperor will go on stage shoeless for the performance tomorrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>A— pounced on the pattern.&nbsp; I grabbed up the Chinese slippers.&nbsp; After A— cut each piece of the pattern in brocade fabric, she threw the pieces over to me and I pinned them onto the inexpensive cotton slippers, whipping the fabric down with thread and a curved needle.  A new intern thundered down to the theater with the finished shoes.  </p>
<p>The Emperor did not go barefoot for his performance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I blinked,</strong> and the next semester started.&nbsp; I went to see the costume designer.&nbsp; Though my drawing skills and my sewing skills had improved drastically due to her no-nonsense, can-do-it attitude, I had begun to feel conflicted about what I was doing.&nbsp; I missed writing.&nbsp; There was <em>so</em> much more I wanted to learn, to do, to make— with words.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both writing and design required all of you, I felt.&nbsp; I asked her what to do.&nbsp; By then, I was unafraid to ask her any question.&nbsp; The designer had modeled a full compliment of qualities I admired, personally and professionally, and her attentions had helped me grow up a little bit more without fully realizing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until that day we stood in her studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; &#8220;I have a question for you, and I want you to give the first answer that comes to mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;&nbsp; I braced myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were aware that you were going to die in two years, what legacy would you want to leave behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>I blurted, &#8220;I want to write a novel!&#8221;</p>
<p>The designer had a cat&#8217;s smile.&nbsp; A secret within a secret.&nbsp; In my mind&#8217;s eye, more than a decade later, that designer&#8217;s smile glows in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, you must learn to write a novel,&#8221; said the designer.&nbsp; &#8220;This is what I think you should do next to get there&#8230;.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Today, I sit</strong> at my desk writing, as I do every day.  </p>
<p>I am a professional writer and photographer.&nbsp; Many mentors helped bring me to this place, but in my most confused year, one woman gave me a simple map to help me find my way back to place where I had set my greatest passion down in the road.&nbsp; (Did I mention that the award-winning costume designer was <i>also</i> an award-winning writer?)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the designer&#8217;s guidance that fall and spring, I wrote a one-act play. &nbsp;&nbsp;My junior year, I started to write for pay for magazines and newspapers, then bigger magazines, larger newspapers.  And I <i>did</i> write a novel in undergraduate school, three drafts over two years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, I went to graduate school, and wrote a second novel, five drafts in two years.</p>
<p>And here I am writing to you, now.*<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do you see</strong> the underlining of this story?&nbsp; Do you understand why now I will walk into that basic quilting class next week with finer graces?&nbsp; I have remembered a thing in telling you this story today, a gift someone gave me once, when I did not know what direction I would or could turn and my whole life skittered out in front of me unsure and hopeful, a gift in the shape of a question—</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick.&nbsp; You have two years to live.&nbsp; What do you most want to do?&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Jeremiah Watt</p>
<p><a href="http://sustainableutah.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/blackfoot.jpg"><img id="i-164" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://sustainableutah.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/blackfoot.jpg?w=373" /></a></p>
<p>Flipping through travel planners and vacation ads, southeast Idaho sounds much like the glorious west of old. A wild untarnished space, home to elk, moose, deer, and many other species of wildlife, with hundreds of miles of rivers and creeks, all bursting with wild native trout. It is. Or at least was<i>.</i></p>
<p>Currently, it’s home to 17 Superfund sites, thanks to phosphate mining giants Simplot, Agrium, Monsanto and others. The phosphate here is primarily used as fertilizer and the herbicide RoundUp. 16,987 acres have been mined with an additional 7,340 acres slated for development. In addition 15,000 acres have been leased and 50,000 acres are identified as containing economically viable phosphate reserves. In total 2,500 square miles – an area larger than Rhode Island &#8211; have the potential to be permanently scarred or destroyed from the effects of <a href="http://www.cariboucleanwater.org/selenium_map/%EF%BB%BF">phosphate mining</a>. Ninety-five percent of this land belongs to you and I.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual scarring and permanent destruction of entire habitats the environmental degradation due to selenium poisoning (a direct result of current phosphate mining technology) is stark. More than 600 head of livestock have died, 160 miles of streams are poisoned and Yellowstone cutthroat trout populations are declining in impacted streams.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.greateryellowstone.org/">Greater Yellowstone Coalition</a> is working to protect southeast Idaho’s waters, wildlife, and wildlands. Highest on their list of streams to protect is the Blackfoot in the heart of southeast Idaho’s mining district. It and its ecosystem are facing immediate peril with the current onslaught of phosphate mining and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>The photos below provide a sense of the impacts to this area.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is much to <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Open-City-Novel-Teju-Cole/dp/1400068096">Teju Cole’s debut novel <i>Open City</i></a>, but there is also little to it.  It’s a book of wandering ruminations without much of a narrative arc, and it ends as delicately and unobtrusively as it begins. Filtered through the perceptions of Julius, a Nigerian born-and-raised psychiatrist on his residency in New York City, <i>Open City </i>is a thoughtful journey into the impressions of a observant, sensitive, but emotional reticent character as well as into the nature of a city known for brashness and ambition but predicated on cooperative, <i>laissez-faire</i> individual self-interest.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Open City" alt="" src="http://tjhoiland.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/open_city_-_teju_cole.jpg" height="432" width="286" />Mostly, the novel consists of Julius’ thoughts, reactions, and observations of the city set during habitual long walks, his interactions with the people in his life (who tend to vanish, gradually, one by one), as well as reminiscences of his African youth. Not a whole lot happens, plot incident-wise, outside of Julius’ vaguely-reasoned holiday in a wintry Brussels (which has dire consequences for a troubled patient of his) and a tense reconnection and confrontation of past wrongs with a woman he knew in his teenage years in Nigeria. But once the reader settles into the rhythm of Cole’s prose, it can be a revealing journey through a poetic vision of modern life.</p>
<p>Like his protagonist, Cole was born in Nigeria and moved to America in the early ‘90s, where he is now employed as an art historian. I became aware of <i>Open City</i> through a blog mention of <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole">Cole’s Twitter account</a>, which he <a href="http://rosslangager.com/2012/02/11/sidslangs-best-of-twitter/">employs almost exclusively to characterize microcosmic human fates</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole/status/266616208672030720">tragic irony</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole/status/264689019873542144">droll humour</a>. A whole novel predicated on this sort of approach, which reflected Cole’s evident sensibilities on a novelistic scale, seemed a very promising prospect to me.</p>
<p>That <i>Open City</i> does not quite meet these expectations likely says more about the expectations than it does about the book itself. It’s an odd book; certainly well-written, carefully considered, and (despite its calm lack of incident) never dull or meandering. Cole’s narrator alter-ego is not as clinically detached as he may seem; indeed, he often enters into conversation with strangers and makes strong impressions, and does have close friends upon whose acquaintance his personal qualities are imprinted.</p>
<p>But, as Cole writes about late in the novel, Julius constructs himself as the hero in the story of his own life, even though he is sometimes far from heroic. He is removed from the consequences of his action not by emotional detachment so much as by narrative omission. Cole repeatedly pulls off a neat trick of eliding the importance of key developments by slipping them in between Julius’ lengthy reveries about paintings or photography or classical music or politics.</p>
<p>Sex, love, death, break-ups, and accusations flit by like darting sparrows or fleeting breezes, while the quotidian minutiae that generally escape notice take up the lion’s share of his prose’s attentions. Julius has more to say about Gustav Mahler’s late years than he does about his estrangement from his mother, and this psychiatrist never analyzes what is wrong with that. This beautifully-curated subtlety and indirectness turns a novel that might merely have been called insightful into a work that feels more timeless and zen. Cole’s city may be open and inviting, but his central denizen is closed. That powerful contrast stands firmly at the centre of his cool-headed but still strangely empathetic novel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you don’t know what I mean by vinyl, it’s what we used to call records &#8211; LPs, 45s and 78s – albums with big twelve inch square covers.  Vinyl sales are growing while <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577184973290800632.html" target="_blank">CD sales are shrinking</a>.  Why would a retro technology <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/11/2794676/vinyl-records-making-a-rapid-comeback.html" target="_blank">make a comeback</a>?  Audiophiles have always claimed that vinyl had a superior sound, but many audio engineers also claimed that was silly too.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Well, enough people to keep a retro technology alive.  Enough people to entice me into thinking about moving into the future by returning to vinyl records.</p>
<p>I have a few friends that extoll the virtues of vinyl.  And on the web I’ve read many enticing essays about the superiority of vinyl.  These fans chronicle a never ending quest for the perfect sound, claiming they hear more than us pedestrian CD and MP3 listeners.  Their extreme love for music is infectious.  So I have to wonder, has music listening become too easy?  Has convenient and abundance ruined our passion for songs?  Maybe a rare 12” vinyl treat is the natural way to acquire new music.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Gave Up LPs The First Time Around</strong></p>
<p>I gave away all my LPs when I started listening to subscription music on Rhapsody.  I had over 1,500 CDs, and a four foot wide shelf of LPs left.  My LPs had survived several house moves, often never even getting listened to in some places.  When I moved to this house, I decided not even to unpack them.  Since a new generation of music technology was coming out, subscription music, I could get rid of albums that required technology two generations back to play.</p>
<p>I bought a USB turntable to convert my albums to mp3 that weren’t available on CD or Rhapsody, but that turned out to be too much work to be worthwhile.   Plus, the scratches, pops and skips got recorded and that only emphasized the lameness of vinyl.  LPs were out-of-date technology, so why not let it go?</p>
<p>Then I met a Katrina refuge and she lamented losing all her albums, so I offered her mine, and threw in the turntable.  That was about six years ago.</p>
<p>Also, there’s another “thing” that killed LPs a very long time ago.  We stopped listening to music together.  Digital music is great for personal music.  We’ve all retreated from reality with our noise cancelation earphones.  I wrote about this five years ago, “<a href="http://jameswharris.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/why-has-listening-to-music-become-as-solitary-as-masturbation/" target="_blank">Why Has Listening to Music Become as Solitary as Masturbation?</a>”</p>
<p><strong>Is It Crazy To Think About Going Back to Vinyl?</strong></p>
<p>Recently a friend, Doug, mentioned a song he wanted to find, “Stoney End” by Linda Ronstadt.  I checked <a href="http://www.musicstack.com" target="_blank">MusicStack</a> for him and found the album it was on, <a href="http://www.musicstack.com/album/linda+ronstadt+and+the+stone+p/stoney+end" target="_blank">Stoney End</a> by Linda Ronstadt &amp; The Stone Poneys (Pickwick SPS-3298).  It turns out Doug already had this album but not the turntable to play it on.  I was tempted to order it for myself thinking it might be fun to listen to a record I can no longer buy from 1972.  There have been many times lately where I’ve wanted to hear a song I remember only to discover that it never made it to the CD world, and isn’t on any of the music subscription services.</p>
<p><a href="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ronstadt_linda_the_stone_poneys_stoney_end_lg.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="ronstadt_linda_the_stone_poneys_stoney_end_lg" alt="ronstadt_linda_the_stone_poneys_stoney_end_lg" src="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ronstadt_linda_the_stone_poneys_stoney_end_lg_thumb.jpg?w=404&#038;h=433" height="433" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>Now here’s the thing.  If I was willing to download illegal music I could probably find anything I wanted on the Internet because I’ll bet aficionados have ripped pretty much everything to .mp3, or so I would think.  However, I have no idea how to search for stolen music, nor do I want go down the dark alleys of the internet looking for out-of-print music.</p>
<p>What are my options if I want to hear long forgotten songs?  First, I could wait and eventually they might show up on subscription music sites.  Second, I could buy the original vinyl recordings used.  Or, third I could just let them stay forgotten.</p>
<p><a href="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/on-the-flip-side-ricky-nelson.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="On the Flip Side - Ricky Nelson" alt="On the Flip Side - Ricky Nelson" src="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/on-the-flip-side-ricky-nelson_thumb.jpg?w=404&#038;h=404" height="404" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>I used to own <em>On the Flip Side</em> LP but gave it away when I gave away all my LPs.  I’m starting to regret that, but at the time it was a pain to maintain LPs and the stereo equipment to support them.  I also figured one day everything would show up in digital on subscription music services.  Another album I just had to hear again was <em>Never Going Back to Georgia</em> by The Blue Magoos.  I tracked that one down about a year ago and my friend Lee gave me an old turntable to play it on.  I even had to buy a cheap pre-amp because my modern day receiver no longer supports turntables.  I now have a library of 1 LP.  Talking to Doug about albums that never made it to CD makes me want to buy more.</p>
<p><a href="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/never-going-back-to-georgia.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="Never-Going-Back-To-Georgia" alt="Never-Going-Back-To-Georgia" src="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/never-going-back-to-georgia_thumb.jpg?w=404&#038;h=404" height="404" width="404" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Vinyl is a Costly Addiction</strong></p>
<p>The trouble with returning to vinyl is it&#8217;s an addiction.  I was just reading on Amazon about a guy buying a $400 turntable and really loving it, and then his customer review had an update at the bottom saying he had just bought a $900 turntable.  He also warned buyers:  “$400 for the turntable is just a drop in the bucket, plan on spending double to triple that to get EVERYTHING you need. Nice phono preamp, carbon fiber brush, alignment tools, decent plastic lined sleeves for all that new vinyl you about to buy, tweaks, gadgets, cleaning supplies, etc&#8230;”  He also said, “Plan ahead and budget for a record cleaning machine, after you own a few albums you will want it. Even brand new sealed vinyl has dust and will crackle and pop” and “50 year old used records sound like&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;50 year old used records.…”</p>
<p>Reading reviews of turntables makes me wonder if I even have the technical skills to set one up, adjust it, and know if it’s playing correctly.  The audiophiles make it sound worse than rocket science.  And that knock against 50 year old records dings my enthusiasm because the records I want will all be 30-50 years old, or even older.  Another fear is getting addicted to 78s.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting</strong></p>
<p>I think buying vinyl also appeals to the collector in us.  When my friend John wrote about <a href="http://chimeradave.blogspot.com/2012/11/john-lennons-jukebox.html">John Lennon&#8217;s Jukebox</a>, I immediately wanted to track down and buy those 40 singles that were Lennon&#8217;s favorite songs.  Vinyl lovers often have whole walls of albums.  This isn&#8217;t a bad hobby, but it could become an obsession.  I can see myself getting up early to hit the garage sales every Saturday morning, and constantly visiting the used record stores, and Goodwills, hoping to find some elusive gem.  Or getting hooked on Ebay.</p>
<p><strong>Nostalgia</strong></p>
<p>I think the main appeal of wanting to return to vinyl is nostalgia – I want to go home again – to my teen years when I loved buying LPs.  Or I just want to hear songs again that I haven’t heard for 40-50 years.  I’ve done this a few times in my life already.  I first heard <em>On The Flip Side</em> when it was shown on <em>Stage 67</em>, a show from the 1966-1967 television season on ABC.  About twenty years ago I thought of that show and tracked down a used soundtrack of the show.  I actually loved the album, and played it several times, but eventually forgot about it.  I was into CDs then, and CDs were much easier to deal with.  But when I gave away my LPs, I did take the time to record <em>On the Flip Side</em> to MP3, and it’s playing while I type.  So I still have it as two long MP3s, each a whole recording of a side.</p>
<p>To be honest, hearing <em>On the Flip Side</em> playing now is a nostalgic rush, but I doubt I’d want to play it over and over.  Maybe once every five years.  And my mp3 recording reminds me clearly of the flaws of vinyl because I hear the pops, skips and clicks that disappeared with the invention of CDs and mp3 files.</p>
<p>Would <em>On the Flip Side</em> be more wonderful if I was playing it on a good turntable hooked up to a great stereo setup, with perfectly configured speaker spacing?  I don’t know.  I’d have to spend quite a bit of money to find out.  And if I spent all that money and I loved it, would it mean I’d start searching out more old albums?  How many are lost in my memories?</p>
<p>I have a complete set of Th<em>e Rolling Stone</em> magazine on DVD, and I’m amazed by all the albums reviewed that I never heard of, or played or have even seen since.  It might be great fun to start in 1968 and see how many albums I can find that deserved to be rediscovered.  Or is that bullshit?  Shouldn&#8217;t everything worth listening to already be reprinted and available today on CD or subscription music?</p>
<p>And would I end up like the other vinyl addicts, always wanting more expensive turntables, cartridges, styluses, pre-amps, receivers, and speakers?</p>
<p><a href="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/man-from-uncle-1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="man-from-uncle-1" alt="man-from-uncle-1" src="http://jameswharris.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/man-from-uncle-1_thumb.jpg?w=404&#038;h=409" height="409" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the albums I fondly remember did have CD reissues, but strangely enough some like <em>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</em> or <em>Our Man Flint</em> didn’t seem to have the exact cuts or cuts in the same order as my memory.</p>
<p>I think the urge to buy LPs is to hold the same cover and to listen to the same cuts in the same order that I played them 40-50 years ago.  Is capturing this past worth all the effort?  And if I was to be truly faithful to the past, shouldn’t I seek out an old console stereo like I had as a teenager, or even a portable record player like I started out listening to when I was 12?  Why spend hundreds for turntables that didn’t exist in 1965?</p>
<p><strong>Getting Old and Sappy</strong></p>
<p>I think what I miss the most is shopping at record stores and playing my new discovers for my buddies.  Or even going to record stores with my pals, and spending a couple hours deciding how to best spend the two dollars I had burning a hole in my pocket.  For $10 a month today I get access to more albums than any record store I’ve ever been in.  As a kid I could only afford to buy one or two albums a week.  When I first started buying albums, when I was 13-14, I had to mow lawns, babysit or go without lunch at school to get LP money.  Maybe those treasures that were so hard to come by back then, are now the same treasures I seek to find now?  Maybe they need to be just as hard to come by again to get the maximum fun?</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ll go back to vinyl or not.  I’m awful tempted to buy myself a $216 turntable at Amazon, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT-LP120-USB-Direct-Drive-Professional-Turntable/dp/B002S1CJ2Q/" target="_blank">Audio-Technica AT-LP120</a> and give them a try.</p>
<p>JWH – 11/9/12</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who are here strictly for the writing tidbits, I promise they&#8217;re in this post. Don&#8217;t let the first part fool you.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Saying that you&#8217;re an overachiever often feels a bit like a humble brag.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is, but sometimes it&#8217;s honestly a problem. It&#8217;s a crippling desire to succeed, at the expense of all that is good in the world.</p>
<p>My name is Melanie Rio, and I&#8217;m an overachiever.</p>
<p><a href="http://inkedoutloud.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/zitsoverachiever.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-419" title="ZitsOverAchiever" alt="" src="http://inkedoutloud.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/zitsoverachiever.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Personally I sort of blame my parents for instilling in me the desire for perfection from a very young age. Once upon a time when I was in fifth grade, I told my mother I got a 95% on a test. I was pretty pleased with that until she said, &#8220;Well, maybe if you had studied it would have been a hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before you judge my mom (whom I love dearly) too harshly, let me say this: She was right. I rarely, if ever, studied for anything until I got to college. I&#8217;m fortunate in that I retain information very well and am generally a good test-taker and essay writer &#8211; which meant that I floated through elementary and middle school without having to try very hard (except in math. Dear Lord, mathematics ate my soul). My mother saw no reason to settle for a 95% if I could try a little harder and land a hundred &#8211; I think it irked her that I didn&#8217;t, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>In high school the desperate overachiever began to emerge, because education suddenly mattered. How you perform in high school determines where you go to college, which determines where you to go grad school, and how successful you&#8217;re bound to be later in life. At least, that&#8217;s how I perceived it. I took every AP and Honors class I could get into, took a few additional ones online, was a teaching cadet (our version of a TA), was on the board of directors for a non-profit theatre company, wrote and directed my own show and took the SAT while I had the flu. All in the name of being accepted to the only university that had become, for me, synonymous with academic success (it was Boston College if anybody&#8217;s wondering; I did get in but I didn&#8217;t end up there, because oh hey, $54,000 a year is A BOATLOAD OF MONEY). And now that I&#8217;m three years through my college education (holy crap, when did <em>that </em>happen?) I&#8217;m beginning to realize that being an overachiever may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>What brought this on?</p>
<p>Well, yesterday I was supposed to register for classes for my next semester at UNC. This process is notoriously difficult and almost nobody gets everything (or sometimes anything) they need on the first go. A few forward-thinking students have even invented a drinking game where you do a shot every time Connect Carolina crashes.</p>
<p><a href="http://inkedoutloud.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/35zyvu.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-421 alignright" title="35zyvu" alt="" src="http://inkedoutloud.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/35zyvu.jpg?w=350&#038;h=234" height="234" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>I had the perfect schedule all picked out an arranged. Five minutes before registration, all the classes I wanted were still open, and I was feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>T-minus thirty seconds to registration, they changed the time of the class my whole schedule was hinging on and all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>I spent the next hour and a half frantically scouring the Carolina website for other classes that could fill the suddenly enormous gap in my schedule for next semester. If this seems over-dramatic, it really wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why: Yesterday I figured out that in order to fulfill of my requirements before graduation, I have to take twelve different classes in two semesters or less.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you have two demanding majors, a freakishly specific minor, and got Shanghaied into the honors program your freshman year.</p>
<p>Basically, academic death.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently having to apply to the dean for permission to enroll in more than the permissible number of classes so I don&#8217;t crash and burn next year.</p>
<p>This is a really long way of explaining that sometimes overachieving SUCKS.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the writing part comes in.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time on the NaNo Facebook forum, you might have noticed that there are people WHO HAVE ALREADY FINISHED THEIR NOVELS. It&#8217;s day nine.</p>
<p>These people, though they probably don&#8217;t mean to, can pretty easily make everyone else feel like being on track isn&#8217;t quite good enough (this is also what the American education system does; if you don&#8217;t graduate high school with at least five college-level classes under your belt, you&#8217;re considered sort of sub-par. How messed up is that?).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, having a cushion is nice. Once I&#8217;ve met the arbitrary 1,667 word quota for the day, I don&#8217;t just stop if I&#8217;m on a roll. I keep going until I get to a place where it feels natural to stop. So instead of the minimum 15,000 words required for today, I&#8217;m sitting on about 26,000.</p>
<p>Should that make you feel bad if you&#8217;re just over 15K, or even a little behind?</p>
<p>Listen up, children:</p>
<p>HELL NO.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a champ for even tackling this crazy thing called <a title="About NaNoWriMo" href="http://nanowrimo.org/en/about" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>: you&#8217;re writing, you&#8217;re getting words on paper, so who cares what everybody else is doing?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also good to bear in mind that quantity is no indication of quality &#8211; in fact, more often than not, the two have an inverse relationship. So don&#8217;t let somebody else&#8217;s staggering (and possibly exaggerated) numbers knock you off your high horse.</p>
<p>Being able to write a lot in a short space of time doesn&#8217;t prove anything &#8211; except that you have a lot of free time. So don&#8217;t let the overachievers get you down. Chances are, they&#8217;re losing sleep and pulling their hair out because they bit off more than they can chew.</p>
<p>Trust me. I speak from experience.</p>
<p>So keep trucking, and ignore everyone else&#8217;s wordcount. It&#8217;s not a race. You worry about you.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, not all French people live in country chateaus or tiny (but charming!) garrets in Paris. Just like in the US, a large portion of the population lives in the suburbs.</p>
<p>During my stay, I&#8217;m living in a suburb of Toulouse called Tournefeuille. If you are like I was and are curious about what French suburbs look like, search no further.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/001-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-861" title="001 (3)" alt="" src="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/001-3.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>My street looks like all the others in the area: most houses are one story with a large wall/fence in front. Cars usually park on the sidewalk as driveways are very small.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/003-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862" title="003 (2)" alt="" src="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/003-2.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>In my neighborhood in the US, Vlad always commented on the paradox of Americans having perfectly manicured lawns, and yet keeping their shutters and curtains closed. (&#8220;Why do you spend so much time on your yard if you can&#8217;t even see it?&#8221;) I had never noticed this before, but day after day in my neighborhood his observation proved to be true. Being the philosopher that he is, we expounded upon this observation and decided that this paradox belies an interesting American characteristic. On the surface, from the outside, Americans like to look as perfect and welcoming as possible. And yet, the windows to their house, and therefore to their lives, are closed. The more I thought about it, the more I realized there was some truth in our little musing.</p>
<p>At my university in the US, I live in the exchange student residence hall (how I met Vlad) and spend a lot of time with foreign students at the Language Institute. All my non-American friends say the same thing: <em>Americans are very friendly, yet hard to befriend</em>. A Malaysian friend put it this way: &#8220;A stranger in the US will ask you how you are doing, whereas in Malaysia they won&#8217;t, but they don&#8217;t actually want to know how you&#8217;re doing. That took me some time to get used to; in the beginning people would ask how I was, so I told them. Then I began to realize people don&#8217;t really care, they just expect me to say &#8216;Fine, and you?&#8221; An Italian student lamented &#8220;All my friends here are foreign. It&#8217;s hard to befriend the American students; they already have their own friends. When they learn I&#8217;m an exchange student they don&#8217;t want to make the effort since they know I&#8217;m leaving soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what could houses in the French suburbs say about France?</p>
<div id="attachment_863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/002-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-863 " title="002 (2)" alt="" src="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/002-2.jpg?w=576&#038;h=432" height="432" width="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Where I live</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s right: there&#8217;s a big wall up. Some people who come to France say that the French can be cold and unwelcoming. But in France it&#8217;s just not culturally expected to interact with strangers. My friends think Vlad is so shy and timid, but really he just doesn&#8217;t know how to make &#8220;small talk&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s not done in France. If you have a conversation with a French person, it will be meaningful, an exchange of ideas, a way to truly get to know the other person. Anything less is seen as unnecessary. &#8220;Chit-chat&#8221; is just a waste of words. But once the effort is made to form a true relationship, the metaphorical &#8220;opening the gate&#8221; if you will, you are welcomed into their life &#8211; open windows and all.</p>
<div id="attachment_864" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/004-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-864" title="004 (2)" alt="" src="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/004-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=272" height="272" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My name <em>à la française</em> on the mailbox</p></div>
<p>So that&#8217;s my suburbs theory: Americans seem very friendly and open, but there&#8217;s still a barrier to cross to form a friendship. That barrier can be surprising due to the initial appearance of welcome. The French aren&#8217;t open to the whole world, but once a relationship is formed, you are let into their lives.</p>
<div id="attachment_865" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/080.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-865" title="080" alt="" src="http://emilytoulouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/080.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset in Tournefeuille</p></div>
<p>Do you think there could be a connection between houses and cultural characteristics? Do you have similar impressions of the Americans or the French?  Which way of life do you prefer? I personally like the American friendliness, but at the same time I&#8217;m not naturally inclined to small talk either; I prefer silence or a meaningful conversation. As with everything, I think the answer lies somewhere in between. What do you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a rare day that I actually make a contribution at work, and today is not going to be one of those.  Instead, it&#8217;s time for Pie Chart Friday, keeping with the wholesome theme of the week.</p>
<p><a href="http://catsinyourpants.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pcf.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-658" title="PCF" alt="" src="http://catsinyourpants.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pcf.png?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Let me expound a bit on my beautifully expressed pie chart so you can understand my rationale and don&#8217;t just think I&#8217;m a drug addict:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bath Salts</strong>: I really have no idea what this is but it quite literally turned a Miami man into a flesh-eating zombie.  Since I&#8217;ve always wondered whether&#8211;as a zombie&#8211;I would maintain a certain level of decorum and dress (I&#8217;m undead but my style doesn&#8217;t have to be) this would let me test out that theory.  Just keep your face away from me, and your Fendi.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salvia</strong>: Likewise, I&#8217;m out of the loop on what this is exactly, and it&#8217;s legality in many states counts against it in my book (yawn) but I have a killer Miley Cyrus impression that I&#8217;m dying to try out, after I get my hands on a pair of clippers and make a similarly horrible decision to the one she made with her new shitty haircut.  To be clear, I have made that horrible decision before but it was college so it didn&#8217;t count.  This time, it will.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meth</strong>: It would be bittersweet to be on meth because if I were this blog wouldn&#8217;t have been written, as I would have been too busy bangin&#8217; heaters and doing hobo laps in front of the 7-11.  Six hours later, all my work projects would be done and my bathtub would probably look like I don&#8217;t pee in it every morning.  Not that I necessarily do &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beer</strong>: Any pothead with a junior high education will tell you that alcohol kills far more people a year than weed.  And any amateur to professional drinker would respond with, &#8220;go fuck yourself, burnout.&#8221;  It doesn&#8217;t get any better than beer, although I am surprised that there aren&#8217;t drug-infused beers.  Just think&#8211;Meth Drool Brown Ale, Cocaine Blanca, Miller Heroin Life.  My first billion: check.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Haribo gummy candy</strong>: If you don&#8217;t think sugar is a drug you haven&#8217;t seen me in withdrawal from gummy candy.  It&#8217;s ugly and I will eat your face off sans bath salts if you&#8217;re standing in the way of me and the Kroger candy aisle.  Addiction isn&#8217;t pretty and this particular addiction looks like a pair of stretch pants and a third grade party.</li>
</ul>
