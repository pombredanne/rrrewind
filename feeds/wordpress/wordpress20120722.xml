				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That right. I said it.</p>
<p><em>Blogging scares me.</em></p>
<p>This blog, this place that was created to be a bright and shiny window to my deepest, innermost thoughts, was born almost a month ago. And I have yet to make and publish* <strong>one single post</strong>.</p>
<p>*publish being the key word. I&#8217;ve written thousands in my head.**</p>
<p>**<em>only slightly exaggerated.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I haven&#8217;t been laughing. Or loving. And Lord knows I&#8217;ve been eating. Life has still been happening here. And it has been (mostly) wonderful.I am 100% sure that this severe-lack-of-posting funk has nothing whatsoever to do with me having nothing to say, but rather everything to do with the irrational, unexplainable, cold sweat/makes-me-want-to-puke/sudden-loss-of-brain-funtion inducing fear that I am met with each and every time I put my fingers to the keys.</p>
<p>After spending a few weeks believing that I was clinically insane and needed to be medicated (<strong>heavily)</strong>, I finally realized that <em>I am terrified of you. Yes, you, dearest potential reader(s). </em>Not in a &#8220;people scare me&#8221; kind of way, but more so of the idea that you will come, you will read, you will see the truest form of me, you will leave, a<strong>nd.you.will.not.care.</strong></p>
<div>Yup. That&#8217;s it.</div>
<p>The &#8220;not caring&#8221; is what has me stuck like a stick in mud. I can barely stand the thought that nobody is going to care about anything that means everything to me. The questions that have been rolling around in my mind and driving me mad is, <em>Why should you care? What about the ramblings of a senior citizen teenager with the soul of an eighty-seven year old woman would ever posses you to keep reading for a single moment longer? Much less return for seconds and thirds?*</em></p>
<p><em>*fourth and fifths seemed gluttonous</em></p>
<p>In the end, it was agonizing. Let me repeat <strong>a-g-o-n-i-z-i-n-g</strong>. Warring internally with myself, trying to figure out how in the world I was going to present myself as this humorous, glamorous, and any other fantastical words that ended in -ous, human being. The answer I came up with, today as it happens, is simple.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not. I won&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t. </em></p>
<p>My life is not a pre-written, pre-arranged script that can be drafted and edited and formatted to &#8220;fit&#8221; a certain genre or reach a particular group of people. Do I want to reach people? <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>. Do I want people to find a small corner of happiness when they visit this blog?<em><strong> Absolutely</strong></em>. Am I willing to lie, to puff myself or my life up to make those things happen? <strong><em>No, absolutely</em>. </strong> I have promised never to feed you crap food, I will never feed you crap about who I really am, and what my life is really like. No, It is not always beautiful and chocolate covered, but, my hope is that it is that rawness, that feeling of being able to relate, that brings you back for one more bite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I think I&#8217;m a feminist. Maybe. Kinda. Probably a lot. I&#8217;m not sure. Honestly, I&#8217;m not terribly schooled in women&#8217;s studies or the feminist movement, so I&#8217;m kinda wingin&#8217; it here. So, I think I should do what I always do when I&#8217;m unsure about something: ask Google.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" title="Screen shot 2012-07-17 at 2.27.00 PM" src="http://mlcrutchfield.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-17-at-2-27-00-pm.jpg" alt="Asking Google: Am I a feminist? " width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>Google, in its omniscience, directed me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, which says that</p>
<blockquote><p>A <strong>feminist</strong> is &#8220;an advocate or supporter of the rights and equality of women.&#8221;<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>and also that</p>
<blockquote><p>Feminists have worked to protect women and girls from <a title="Domestic violence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence" target="_blank">domestic violence</a>, <a title="Sexual harassment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a>, and <a title="Sexual assault" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault" target="_blank">sexual assault</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>They have also advocated for workplace rights, including <a title="Maternity leave" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_leave" target="_blank">maternity leave</a>, and against forms of <a title="Gender equality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality" target="_blank">discrimination against women</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>By those parameters, I&#8217;d absolutely say I&#8217;m a feminist. <strong>Why do I have this lingering feeling that &#8220;feminist&#8221; is a dirty word?</strong> Where did I get that from? Because, really, I can&#8217;t NOT want equality for women. I can&#8217;t NOT want to protect women and girls from domestic violence, sexual harassment, and sexual assault. And, by golly, I think that women should have rights in the workplace, and that boobs shouldn&#8217;t keep them from getting good jobs, and that they should have the same pay opportunities as their dude counterparts. These are all no-brainers…so why am I such a chicken about it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be Melanie the Magnificent Feminist, but…I&#8217;m not really magnificent. I&#8217;m more kind of terrified. And timid. I&#8217;m more Shirley the Sheepish Feminist (not that Shirleys are weak, I just like alliteration.) It sucks.</p>
<h2>Case in point: I&#8217;m so sad to say it, but I&#8217;m kinda pissed off at Jerry Seinfeld.</h2>
<p>And I like that guy a lot. I think he&#8217;s really funny and awesome. I loved <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328962/" target="_blank"><em>Comedian</em></a> (have you seen it? It&#8217;s good.). In it, Seinfeld is humble and hard-working, even after years of his staggering success. He connects with his craft in a really beautiful way. And he&#8217;s hilarious. There&#8217;s no arguing that. It&#8217;s a pretty kick-ass flick.</p>
<p>But then…he comes out with his new show, &#8220;<a href="http://www.comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/" target="_blank">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</a>&#8221; which premieres on <a href="http://crackle.com" target="_blank">Crackle.com</a> tomorrow. It&#8217;s a simple show that looks really funny—it&#8217;s Seinfeld driving around with different comedians, getting coffee and chatting. I&#8217;m sure there will be GREAT moments in the show.<strong> But as I watched the two trailers for it, I noticed something was missing: women.</strong> There&#8217;s more than half a dozen comedians in the trailers and not a <em>single one</em> is female.</p>
<p>Really? Shouldn&#8217;t it be called &#8220;Dude Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&#8221;? Or &#8220;Comedians with Penises in Cars Getting Coffee&#8221;? I mean, just to be clear about it? Because there are a ton of funny women out there. Funny women that Seinfeld has worked with over the years.</p>
<p><em>Where are the women?!</em></p>
<p>And this is about where I start to feel pretty sheepish about things. I hear that voice pipe up that says that I shouldn&#8217;t need to see women everywhere. Why is it important to have women in a silly comedy show? Why does it matter? Can&#8217;t Seinfeld just do what he wants? Aren&#8217;t you being too <em>sensitive?</em> (Also, you can&#8217;t be funny and witty and fun AND be a feminist. Everyone knows feminists are a bunch of downers.)</p>
<p>And, I dunno. Maybe I am being too sensitive. Like I said, I&#8217;m a terrible feminist—I&#8217;m just starting to really explore it. But I&#8217;ve got this feeling in my gut that if one of the best comedians of the last 30 years has a show that highlights other comedians that he deems valuable, and none of them are women, <strong>the message is that women aren&#8217;t capable of being in that class of talent; women don&#8217;t make the cut.</strong> And I hear that message all too much.</p>
<p>After the message that we don&#8217;t make the cut, comes the message that we&#8217;re lesser-than. And after that, it&#8217;s that we should be sexy to get what we want. Then it&#8217;s that if you&#8217;re sexy, you should expect to get ogled. And then…and then after that…? The path is long, and windy, and shitty, and it paves the way for girls and women everywhere to think less of themselves; to expect less <em>for</em> themselves; and to silently take abuse. It&#8217;s a tired song and I&#8217;m sick of hearing it. What&#8217;s more, I don&#8217;t want my daughter to <em>ever</em> hear it.</p>
<p>So, even with that voice inside telling me to pipe down and stop being such an entitled shrew, I just can&#8217;t do it. It bothers me. I want to see women succeeding and being valued so that <em>I</em> can feel like I can succeed too. I want my daughter (hell, all daughters) to grow up in a world that doesn&#8217;t limit women, define them, reduce them or abuse them because of their gender.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;m posting this complaint about the ab-fab Jerry Seinfeld and his inability to hunt down even one, good, female comedian. Come on, Jerry. You can do it. Please, oh, please prove me wrong on this one. Don&#8217;t be one of <em>those guys</em>.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Am I being &#8220;too sensitive&#8221; or is this something we&#8217;re way overdue in changing? Cough up those opinions, peeps.</em></p>

<p>The series revolves around nationally-known news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) and his team of broadcast journalists that bring relevant news to television viewers every night on the show, “News Night”. Emily Mortimer plays McAvoy&#8217;s executive producer, as well as former girlfriend, Mackenzie McHale. The two butt heads quite often but they clearly respect each other and together make a solid team. Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston) is essentially the boss of News Night and, along with being involved in many decisions made on the news floor, contributes many of the better one-liners doled out in each episode. The News Night staff includes Jim Harper (John Gallagher Jr.), Don Keefer (Thomas Sadoski), Maggie Jordan (Alison Pill), Neal Sampat (Dev Patel), and Sloan Sabbith (Olivia Munn), among many others.</p>

<p>One of the things that immediately grabbed my attention was the technique Sorkin uses of setting up timeline a good two years behind current time. Since <em>The Newsroom</em> covers several “ripped from the headlines” stories, I found it quite interesting and smart that the show began at a point just far enough away that allowed for accurate portrayal of the news stories, but also gave we viewers the sense of connectedness we still feel with these stories. Granted, this technique will probably prove difficult at times, seeing as the show is on its fourth episode and is already dated in January 2011. However, I&#8217;ve seen enough of Sorkin&#8217;s work to trust that he knows where he&#8217;s going with the general timeline.</p>
<p>So far, each episode has dealt with one specific story that dominated the news during that period. The BP oil spill, the Arizona immigration law, the Tea Party movement, and the Arizona shooting that resulted in a wounded Gabriel Giffords, have all been topics of conversations in the recent episodes. I am interested to see where Sorkin and the show&#8217;s writers will take this technique, as well as how it will be received due to the inevitable political stances that must be taken in discussing such topics. I am sure the writers will attempt to stay as neutral as possible, since national news generally is as such, but nevertheless it seems like at some point a stance must be taken. It will be interesting to see how that aspect pans out.</p>
<p>Apart from the general mechanics, I am constantly floored by the wonderful and detailed character development that we&#8217;ve</p>
<div id="attachment_1946" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://abigpicturewindow.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/newsroomcharlie.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1946" title="newsroomcharlie" src="http://abigpicturewindow.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/newsroomcharlie.jpeg?w=300&h=187" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;News Night&#8221; boss Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston)</p></div>
<p>come to expect from Sorkin&#8217;s writing. Within the pilot alone, the seven or eight main characters who were introduced all had some sort of significant shift in their development, and it did not stop there. The relationships between the characters are delightful to watch, and this is not really surprising with such a strong cast playing these roles.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about <em>The Newsroom</em> is the incredibly rapid pace at which everything moves. I&#8217;ve worked in a news cycle and I know from experience that being in a newsroom is a chaotic, messy, fast-paced situation. The dialogue and general camera movement clearly exemplifies this and shows us just how quick the journalists need to move in order to get the story out.</p>
<p>Not only that, but each episode seems a little bit more uplifting and inspiring than the last. The show teaches us about integrity and honesty in the news, as well as the importance of reporting fairly and accurately. Not to mention, the music choices add significantly to the emotional ride we take in each episode. (Example: The last ten minutes of the most recent episode involved a tear-inducing race to get out the story of Congresswoman Gifford&#8217;s shooting set to Coldplay&#8217;s “Fix You” in the background.)</p>
<p><em>The Newsroom</em> makes me want to care about what&#8217;s going on around me. It inspires me to educate myself on past information in order to understand the info of the present. And most importantly, it keeps old news stories relevant and draws on our memories of the events and how they affected us. While the news is constantly in flux, one thing is for sure: I know my Sundays are a little brighter with this show to look forward to.</p>
<p><em>Have you been watching </em>The Newsroom<em>? What do you think? Let us know!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1904.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1280" title="peppers, zucchini and squash" src="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1904.jpg?w=500&h=280" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Say what? Gazpacho with no tomatoes in it?  And it isn’t even weird white gazpacho with its grapes and almonds?  What mockery is this?</p>
<p>This, my friends, this is what happens when I buy <em>way</em> too many zucchini at the farmer’s market because they were “such a good deal!”  And then the good deal zucchini sat in a huge pile in my fridge looking at me for days on end, and I didn’t know what else to do with them.  That’s what this is.</p>
<p><a href="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1905.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1281" title="zucchini, peppers and squash" src="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1905.jpg?w=500&h=280" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Well, that and I have had a craving for gazpacho for weeks now.  Unfortunately, the Big Man hates tomatoes with a maniacal hatred.  (Yes, this hatred comes from the same man that tore into fresh tomato sauce last week.  The same man who flings his tomatoes onto my plate in the restaurant before dousing his burger and fries with ketchup.  I just roll with it).  I <em>love</em> gazpacho, but whenever I make it I have to eat all of it by myself.  I’m usually okay with this set up for the first gallon or so, but since I somehow always make waaay more than I intend, it’s better to have someone else in the house that I can off the rest of it onto.</p>
<p><a href="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1921.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1285" title="cibed bread" src="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1921.jpg?w=500&h=280" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>One of the best things about gazpacho (green, white, red, whatever) is that you can go crazy with toppings.  And I love me some toppings.  Being as I prefer not to boil to death in my own house, I do not make chili in the summertime as it requires so much time spent simmering on the stove.  With gazpacho, however, I can go toppings crazy- just like I do with <a title="Fat bowl of chili for a cold December night." href="http://omeletta.me/2011/12/12/fat-bowl-of-chili-for-a-cold-december-night-best-midnight-snack-ever-com/">chili in the wintertime</a>.  Love it.</p>
<p><a href="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1924.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1286" title="zucchini gazpacho" src="http://omeletta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1924.jpg?w=500&h=280" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>And, like most good recipes (and especially those that require little to no cooking) this stuff just gets better with age.  It’s like a fine wine.  That is, it ages well if it stays around long enough.  Make this gazpacho and keep on beating the heat, my friends.  Fall is just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Zucchini Gazpacho</strong></p>
<p>Serves 4-6</p>
<p><em>The most important items in this soup are zucchini (natch), green peppers, and the bread as thickener.  After that, go crazy adding whatever other veggies you have lying around begging to be pureed. </em></p>
<p>2 zuccchini, skins removed</p>
<p>1 yellow summer squash, skin removed</p>
<p>1 medium sized yellow onion</p>
<p>2 small to medium green peppers, seeds and ribs removed</p>
<p>2-3 garlic cloves, smashed</p>
<p>2 medium cucumber, skin and seeds removed</p>
<p>juice of one lime</p>
<p>3 cups cubed stale bread</p>
<p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>2 cup water, seperated</p>
<p>2 tablespoons coarse ground salt</p>
<p>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p>
<p><em>For garnish</em>: one hard boiled egg, diced</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Toss the bread cubes with olive oil  and a good pinch of salt.  Over this, pour one cup of water and gently toss to make sure all the cubes of bread are wet.  Let sit for at least half an hour while you ready the vegetables.</p>
<p>Roughly chop all the vegetables and combine in a food processor or, if you&#8217;re like me, in a bowl or container big enough to use an immersion blender without stuff flying all over the place.  With the blender running on medium to high, puree all the vegetables, lime juice, salt and vinegar, adding up to one cup of water as needed.  You may have to work in batches.  Once the vegetables are pureed, add the wet bread cubes.  Continue to blend together until the entire mixture is combined and silky.</p>
<p>Eat.</p>
<p>For garnish, I like to add a diced hard boiled egg, or maybe pan-fried croutons that are extra crispy.  Or sometimes diced avocado, or diced green (or red!) tomatoes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you finally called last night.</p>
<p>You are defensive right from the start</p>
<p>And sarcastic</p>
<p>You tried to explain your absence at your sister&#8217;s on Sunday</p>
<p>Sorry&#8230;I want to believe you, but I can&#8217;t</p>
<p>You say you tried to call on Sunday</p>
<p>Before we left for the party</p>
<p>I check Caller ID while you are on the phone</p>
<p>No calls from you or anyone that day</p>
<p>You then say</p>
<p>Youe phone has been giving you trouble</p>
<p>Your number is not appearing</p>
<p>When you call people</p>
<p>WOW</p>
<p>How amazing</p>
<p>Do you see how hard this is for me</p>
<p>I ask if you are planning to come to town to see your children</p>
<p>You say yes</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to leave early in the morning on Sunday</p>
<p>I ask if it&#8217;s so that you can get here for breakfast</p>
<p>No you say</p>
<p>A friend is driving with you</p>
<p>You are taking her to her family so she can visit</p>
<p>Of couse it&#8217;s a &#8220;her&#8221;</p>
<p>Pfft I say&#8230;</p>
<p>How convenient her family lives close by</p>
<p>Right around the corner you say</p>
<p>I tell you she is not welcome here</p>
<p>There better be not any excuses</p>
<p>If her family is not home</p>
<p>Or her visit cut short</p>
<p>She will not be welcome here</p>
<p>She will have to find a place to wait for you</p>
<p>This little parolee chaser</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t allow her to share your time with your children</p>
<p>Your children better get a great visit</p>
<p>Your full attention</p>
<p>Nothing less</p>
<p>I am at a loss</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who you are</p>
<p>Wait</p>
<p>Maybe I do</p>
<p>Maybe I just don&#8217;t want to admit</p>
<p>That you are not who I want you to be</p>
<p>Nor am I</p>
<p>Who I want to be</p>
<p>With you</p>
<p>I hate where we are</p>
<p>We have always been so close</p>
<p>I hate that I can&#8217;t trust what you say</p>
<p>I hate that I can&#8217;t trust you</p>
<p>I know how we got here</p>
<p>But you have to be the person</p>
<p>Who gets us back on track</p>
<p>My hands are tied</p>
<p>I have told you your entire life</p>
<p>Perception is everything</p>
<p>Trust is golden</p>
<p>You are the only person</p>
<p>Who can erase my perception</p>
<p>That you aren&#8217;t always</p>
<p>Telling the truth</p>
<p>I am begging you</p>
<p>Please find the person</p>
<p>You used to be</p>
<p>I miss him</p>
<p>Love You</p>
<p>Your Mom</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Journalist rang me an hour earlier than I was expecting. They were 15 minutes away and I was in my bathroom talking to him on my cell phone with one eye open because I had glued the other one shut with the glue from the fake eyelashes I was making a mess of.</p>
<p><em>15 minutes away</em></p>
<p>I was still in my pijamas. My hair was pulled back into a careless ponytail, and the only makeup on my face was the black mascara that had slipped down my cheeks the night before.</p>
<p><em>15 minutes away</em></p>
<p>The breakfast dishes were still on the bench. A half drunk coffee on the dining table&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t say for sure if the only jeans that actually still fit me were in the clean laundry pile, or the dirty laundry pile</p>
<p><em>15 minutes away</em></p>
<p>It was 15 minutes before the crew from Channel 7 would walk through my door and set up lights and cameras and microphones and sit me in a chair and put a camera in my face and film my every word and every facial expression and reaction for a national program and here I was with glue all through my hair, fake eyelashes stuck to my fingers and bloodshot eyes (from falling asleep in my living room at 1am the morning before, with my laptop in front of me writing to you dear people, or from the glue on my fingers transferring to my sight&#8230; who knows?)  But nevertheless, this was not the image of myself I had carried for several weeks prior to this interview, where I saw myself with manicured nails, leisurely perfecting my hair, strand by strand and meticulously painting my face with foundations and blushes and mascaras&#8230;</p>
<p><em>15 minutes away</em></p>
<p>I whipped my hair up into a high pony tail and secured it with hair pins and too much hair spray. I paint-balled makeup in the general direction of my face and it was going to have to be good enough because I heard the knock on the door.</p>
<p><em>They were here.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-345"></span></p>
<p>I remember when I typed out that first piece of writing. That piece of this puzzle I thought no one would ever want to see. That piece that was meant to be just for me. The online journal I <em>had</em> to keep because I cant write pen to paper, because my hands tremble, and my hand-writing is ineligible. It was supposed to be just for me and when I shared it that first time to the world I truly believed that if anyone accidentally read it, that it would be the first and last time.</p>
<p>Now here I sit with readers from nearly 30 countries and counting. Belgium, Italy, Poland, Canada, Germany, The United States, Sweden, Spain, Malaysia, Netherlands, The United Kingdom, New Zealand&#8230;There had been talks of a book deal, queries of a movie, requests for exclusives to my story and now, journalists with cameras knocking at my door.</p>
<p><em>How did this happen? Is this okay with me?</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to think about it, I just slowly walked through my living room and opened the front door&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Here we go&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>As I have done so with every other story I have written to you, I must be honest with how this played out, and so here is my honest and transparent replay of what happened in my life today, after that knock on the door came&#8230;</p>
<p>The first person I saw after I opened the door, was Nick. He was with two other men. One was Adam, the journalist. The other was Brett, the camera man.</p>
<p>Nick was what I now refer to as &#8216;sound check guy&#8217;. He was wearing a green <em>knitted </em>jumper, and was sporting a very nice beard.<br />
Oh dear, i&#8217;m in trouble and its only day 40. I feel like Channel 7 tried to sabotage these One Thousand Single Days by planting this fabulous man-creature in my living room who apparently, also knows how to play music&#8230;<em>I see how it is, I see what you&#8217;re doing&#8230;.</em>He was beautiful. I happen to love tall men in knitted sweaters and hairy cheeks who have a gift in music. Be cool Vanessa. Be cool.</p>
<p>So in came Adam, the fabulous journalist who I will forever be indebted to for making me feel so at ease during perhaps one of the most uneasy and nerve wracking times of my life. And Brett &#8211; Camera man &#8211; who was a very, very suave and cool and who I liked as soon as he walked into my living room.</p>
<p>Lighting was set up. Microphones were attached to clothing and unusual sound equipment was unfolded onto my living room flooring and I stood back watching it all evolve before me feeling like a deer in the headlights. <em>Is it too late to say i&#8217;m scared? </em></p>
<p><a href="http://onethousandsingledays.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/number-12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-360" title="NUMBER 1" src="http://onethousandsingledays.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/number-12.jpg?w=767&h=1024" alt="" width="767" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>We had a chat, just Adam and I. We talked about where I am, how I got here, and how it feels. I was honest about it, as I always am, whether it be to you dear reader, or to myself&#8230;.and yet my responses felt forced and reenacted. I began to feel tight in my chest. <em>I cannot re-do this if I get it wrong, so <span style="text-decoration:underline;">tell</span> them what you you feel now. Speak from your heart. </em></p>
<p>I called &#8216;CUT&#8217; more times than I can remember. I froze. I kept requesting a re-shoot. Questions were asked which I didn&#8217;t know how to answer&#8230;This journey has been indescribably personal and yet here I was being being filmed speaking of it for national television and&#8230;after weeks of excitement I was left with nothing but insecurities. How can you speak of a decision that comes from deep within you to a television program without cheapening it in some way?</p>
<p><em>This choice <span style="text-decoration:underline;">means</span> something to me. Don&#8217;t take that away from me, you journalists, with your cameras and your sound checks&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>They let me speak. They were patient with me every time I said I needed more time. They joked around while I fidgeted and tried to collect myself enough to answer the next question. It was positive and fun and nerve wracking and fabulous.</p>
<p>Those in charge decided it would be a good decision to take a few sequences of myself and Adam, the journalist, discussing the facts of life over a bite to eat, and hence, we stumbled across the best place I have eaten all year:<a href="http://www.blugrottocafe.com.au"> Alu Grotto</a> in Surfers Paradise, who served several dishes to myself and the crew. They make the most delicious steak sandwiches and my salt and pepper calamari was an incredibly sexy little dish which I all but licked the plate to finish. Go and eat there. Then thank me later.  We filmed more. And more. And more. The whole process took 3 1/2 hours and as I drove home I felt it was unreal. The first person I called was my mother. We laughed about it and shook our heads over the whole ordeal and I debriefed her about sound check guy. Mother was perfectly excited for me and praised my achievement with her mother-words and I felt completely happy. This blog, this website&#8230;. It was created initially for the sole purpose of being a journal for <em>myself. </em>To record how my life would unfold should I experiment with it a little. Take a little here, add a little there. Mad scientist stuff&#8230; But now that decision, and the consequences were being filmed in preparation to be aired to not only a national audience, but for those who had internet&#8230;. an international audience.</p>
<p>I feel suddenly shy. I battle with deep insecurities and self esteem. Creating <em>anything </em>is a risk because you are holding it up before others inviting them to approve&#8230;.or otherwise. Whether it be music, art, poetry or stories. Creation is always crafted with the element of risk. <em>What if they hate it?</em></p>
<p>Every time I write for you I do so with so much love and I enjoy it immensely, but come time to publish, I hover over that button for so long&#8230;sometimes days. I keep expecting to get it wrong. I keep waiting for someone to stand up and point at me saying &#8216;<em>Hey YOU, what are YOU doing here? You don&#8217;t belong here, you words have no place here&#8217; </em>I have published once or twice and actually closed my eyes as I did so, then walked away from the laptop and refused to look at it again for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>But then you patiently read my stories and for one reason or another, you enjoy them and you have no idea what it means. I feel like I am finding my identity through these stories and each of you have become a part of that. Motivation is remembering why you <em>Started. </em>I started this because I had a premonition of a life that I <em>had </em>to discover, it was a life that I believe God himself penned for <em>me</em>&#8230; from the beginning to the end, and this new chapter in His story of me begins with a period of singleness and self discovery and after that&#8230;. who knows.</p>
<p>Ah life is a funny little thing. It can change from one moment to the next. One moment you are at the table surrounded by text books trying to study for finals, the next you are discovering what the love of your life is.</p>
<p>Be patient for the story to air, because it is too early to know just yet, but I <em>will</em> let you know as soon as I get word from the station, speaking of which, I would like to say a very sincere thank you to Channel 7.</p>
<p>To the producers, especially Erina &#8211; Thank you for your interest in my story and your support leading up to the interview. To Adam, thank you for being such a professional and walking me through a very foreign process and reassuring me that I didn&#8217;t &#8216;sound like a twat&#8217;. Brett, thank you for patiently reshooting every time I tripped up on my words and froze, you are a fabulous.</p>
<p>And to Nick, you have a good thing going on with that tallness and beard and green sweater. I hope you have a fabulous life. Thank you for being sound check guy. Best one i&#8217;ve ever met.</p>
<p>And thats a wrap.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_599" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://angloadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_8002.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-599" title="detroit airport" src="http://angloadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_8002.jpg" alt="tsa airport regulations rant detroit aiport" width="490" height="327" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bonus travel points if you tell me what airport this is</p></div>
<p>&#8220;If you see something, say something,&#8221; say the loudspeakers at Sea-Tac airport.</p>
<p>I saw something, I said something. And here’s what happened:</p>
<p>First off, I am not a hall-monitor type. I hated those smug kids with their little hall passes, threatening to rat you out for a harmless paper airplane.</p>
<h2>Snitches get stitches.</h2>
<p>If someone cuts in line, I roll my eyes and call it a day. I won&#8217;t tell on you for carrying an extra vile of liquid or playing hooky from work or cheating on a test.</p>
<p>But this was different. Way different. <strong>I saw a guy sneak a lighter through airport security</strong>. This was before I realized regular lighters without fluid are <em>permitted</em> in carry-ons. When did that happen? But who wants to carry a lighter without fluid &#8211; isn&#8217;t that just dumb? Doesn&#8217;t a lighter need fluid to work? Do they even sell fluidless lighters? Excuse me for my ignorance, I am not a smoker.</p>
<p>The Guy hid a blue BIC lighter under the vamp of a canvas slip-on, which was lurching towards the scanner in one of those bins. When I noticed it, he put one of those change tubs on top of his shoe. Clever.</p>
<p>My suspected terrorist tucks a tacky Hawaiian shirt  into his jeans.  And travels alongside a smallish, dark-haired woman who had a retired-teacher thing going on. I would guess mid-sixties, celebrating a 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary.<span id="more-583"></span></p>
<p>I went over the moral dilemma – should I tell? I looked around. I telepathically called to the girl behind me: look up, notice this, and say something, so I don’t have to.</p>
<p>It took a couple seconds, but I finally decided to say something, the way the loudspeakers at the airport kept demanding I do. What if this guy was the Bad-shirt Bomber?</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s a lighter in his shoe</h2>
<p>I walked over to the nearest TSA agent, who was busy chatting with his buddies. I noticed they were all properly mustached.</p>
<p>“Excuse me: I have a question.”</p>
<p>I intended to call him over, but be discreet. Clandestine. Spry. Is there a hand signal?  Should I whisper?</p>
<p>When the Agent approached me, I said out of the side of my mouth: “There’s a lighter hidden in his shoes.” I nodded towards the bins.</p>
<p>He loudly repeated: “A lighter? In whose shoes?” Four or five people turned to stare at me.</p>
<p>I shushed him. Like the two of us were engaged in light cafeteria-table gossip.</p>
<p>“It’s two bins in front of my bin.” I said quietly, thinking at that point, we were partners in this thing. I waited for TSA agents from all corners of the terminal to descend on Hawaiian-shirt man like a pride of lions.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt bad. Instead of going to Hawaii, the Bad-Shirt Bomber was going to have to endure a cavity search when all he probably wanted to do was smoke a couple cigars on the beach.</p>
<p>But then&#8230;</p>
<h2><strong>What Actually Happened.</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_600" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://angloadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_8147.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-600" title="airport tsa lighters" src="http://angloadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_8147.jpg" alt="aiport tsa luggage lighters travel rants" width="490" height="327" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another clue to the mystery airport, which is NOT the airport I talk about in this post.</p></div>
<p>“If there is one, I am sure they’ll get it. Now – are all your liquids in a bag?”  TSA Mustacheo peaked at my bins and casted a judging eye towards my innocent flats.</p>
<p>I spent that morning getting rid of my grooming scissors, my tweezers, and pouring the allotted three ounces (a day’s worth) of shampoo and conditioner into eco-friendly reusable bottles. I made sure not to carry a razor, which I desperately need because there’s “relaxing by the pool” on my trip itinerary.</p>
<p>And he has the nerve to question my packing?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they scan Hawaiian-shirt man’s briefcase. (Who wears a Hawaiian <em>and</em> carries a briefcase?)</p>
<p>Nothing happened – no pulling him aside. No little rooms. No cavity searches – he breezed through security and shot me a smug look. He knew.</p>
<p>I could not believe it. And then they motion me towards the full-body scan. Really, TSA? You’re body scanning <em>me</em> and the Tikki Terrorist waltzes right through the metal detectors?</p>
<p>When <strong>nothing happened</strong>, I expected John Quinones from the show, “What Would You Do” to pop out of a suitcase. I started preparing answers to his inevitable inquiry, which takes one of two routes: Why are you such an asshole? Or: how did you become so morally awesome?</p>
<p>“It was the right thing to do” I would say. &#8220;The voice-over at the airport says, ‘If you see something, say something.’ I said something.”</p>
<p>Readers, even after a whole lot of nothing, I still think if you see something, say something, especially when your silence could result in the harm of another human being. Sneeze-cough: Sandusky trial.</p>
<p>Only when you actually SEE something. Be SURE. Or you could really damage someone’s reputation. Also be sure the person you&#8217;re telling on isn&#8217;t all Mobbed up or G&#8217;d out or otherwise affiliated with people who occasionally take people out.</p>
<p>Maybe I over-reacted. Maybe I am more paranoid than the average person. What would you have done?</p>
