			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wittylittlesecret.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2011-05-27-07-13-521.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1089" title="memorial day 2011" src="http://wittylittlesecret.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2011-05-27-07-13-521.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="memorial day sale flyers" width="300" height="225" /></a>This week a reporter emailed me to ask my thoughts as the spouse of a deployed servicemember on Memorial Day, and I couldn&#8217;t answer the question for a whole day. I felt ridiculous for being at a loss for words.</p>
<p>I sat down to write and I stared at my computer screen. I blinked. I had nothin. <em>Yeah, me &#8211; </em>the one who can wax eloquent about nearly anything. The one who can strike up a conversation with a perfect stranger about the intricacies of just about any weather condition, who can extemporaneously compare and contrast The Preschooler&#8217;s constant need for peanut butter with Sweet Pea&#8217;s inexplicable desire to carry around (but not look at) ten books everywhere she goes.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was hard because one of the first holidays that passed after Husband left for his one year mobilization to the Middle East was <a title="At The White Table" href="http://wittylittlesecret.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/white-table/">Veteran&#8217;s Day</a>, and I&#8217;ll admit it was a hard one to swallow. When my newspaper arrived that Friday it was emblazoned on page after page with bright red, white, and blue sales flyers.  What in the hell was a Veteran&#8217;s day sale? Why had I never noticed how irritating this was before, when it was so clearly offensive to me, now? All I could think about was the blue star banner hanging in my hallway, and how I prayed every night that the star would never turn to gold. All I could do was skulk around my house, and clean insanely, and let my kids watch TV while I silently but violently ripped up the newspaper ads in defiance.</p>
<p>But this Memorial Day I didn&#8217;t feel that way. We&#8217;ve come so much farther in our pride, patriotism, and faith since we first built our <a title="The Preschooler Remembers Veterans Day" href="http://wittylittlesecret.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/veterans-day/">own little white table</a> six months ago. This Memorial Day, we understand that our perspective is not theirs. We understand that observing is the best honor. We understand that celebration isn&#8217;t for them &#8211; it&#8217;s for us.</p>
<p>So, we are celebrating. First we are attending a local ceremony at 9am put on by our American Legion. We&#8217;ve been talking about sacrifice at the dinner table, and I think the kids understand that word better this year than they ever have. They don&#8217;t understand the sacrifice Husband is making, but they understand their own. And that&#8217;s just enough understanding, for now.</p>
<p>But after the ceremony, we aren&#8217;t going to sulk. We aren&#8217;t going to hang around home with quiet and somber regret over the general public&#8217;s lack of understanding on the very holiday set aside to honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. Instead, we are going to celebrate and have some fun as a family, and take advantage of the festivities of the weekend.</p>
<p>Because it feels right to honor these men and women by doing what they could not, by doing what they would have most wanted to do if they were here: to spend more time with the people they loved.</p>
<p>Happy Memorial Day, America. Thankyou for your sacrifices.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/p1040186.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2564" title="P1040186" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/p1040186.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kempten is the largest city in Allgäu, a region in the south-west of Bavaria, Germany only 26 miles away from Austria. It was also my recent business trip destination, a short 500 mile drive from Wrocław. Short, if you consider the 140-150 mile per hour speed on the autobahn we were traveling to get there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But first things first; beer. Bavarian beer is the tastiest beer I&#8217;ve ever had. All kinds too; from Hefeweizen to Pilsener to the darkest Schwarzbier, they&#8217;re all simply delicious! And after our business end of the trip was concluded we were invited to a traditional Bavarian beer garden. Every Thursday the beer garden pictured below serves up an insane amount of food and beer while entertaining you with a different folk group every week. The beer garden season is short, from May to September at the latest, and that is why each folk group only has one chance a season to perform, there simply isn&#8217;t enough time. Performers are paid with food and beer for their work, but it is the the way in which beer is delivered to the crew that is engineering at its best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/p1040195.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2567" title="P1040195" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/p1040195.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meet the beer lift. This suspended system is first lowered inside the beer house and filled with four, one liter, beer steins. The stein bucket if you will, is then sent on its way toward the band where it is promptly lowered, unloaded and refilled with empty steins. Awesome!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The beer kept flowing and the band kept playing until we were eventually chased away by a lightning storm. After  4 pints of beer it was time to go home anyway. We did find out that you&#8217;re allowed about a stein of beer and drive home in Bavaria. I haven&#8217;t fact checked this yet, but it was explained to us that Bavaria&#8217;s culture of beer wouldn&#8217;t allow for a zero tolerance law to go in effect. We were driven back to our hotel, and it was the fastest ride of my life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">240kmh translates into 150 miles per hour. I&#8217;m sure some will tell me they&#8217;ve gone faster on their way to Vegas once, or that 150mph is nothing compared to their buddies&#8217; drag speed record. That&#8217;s all kosher, but in most cases it&#8217;s also not legal. Going 150mph on Bavarian autobahn however is just fine. I&#8217;ve personally never gone this fast (ever!) much less for a reasonably long period of time simply traveling from A to B. The speedo on the Mercedes-Benz we were riding only went up to 260kmh, so we were dangerously close to the limit of where even German engineers said &#8220;ok, that&#8217;s enough&#8221;. Oddly enough the driver, our German tour guide for the trip, didn&#8217;t even seem to notice the fact that cars we were passing seemed to be at a stand still in comparison. Driving to and from Germany was also fast which made for a shorter travel time that we promptly evened out with slow moving vehicles every time we stopped for gas; because 140mph equals some 6,000 rpms and a fuel level drop you actually see on the gauge in real time on a 1.4 liter Volkswagen engine. Fun.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Oprah, watching you be yourself makes me want to be more of myself.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself.</p>
<p>My love for Oprah is <a href="http://saltandnectar.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/a-love-letter-to-oprah/" target="_blank">well-documented</a> and I felt all that love flowing back my way as Oprah took to the stage and said her final farewell. She shared the highlights of her journey and the lessons she hopes we all took away from 25 years of programming. I knew some of them so well I could have completed her sentences.</p>
<p>Was it perfect? Short of my own personal lunch with Oprah to process my emotions on the final season, I&#8217;m not sure anything would have been perfect. However, I got the closure I needed and felt her sincerity in reaching out to thank the viewers who have loved and supported her all these years. I&#8217;ve been in Oprah&#8217;s audience. Everything she said about needing us there and feeding off our energy is true.</p>
<p>I even got one final &#8220;Aha! Moment.&#8221; She shared a lesson learned from her recent reunion with Iyanla Vanzant. &#8220;There is a difference, you know, between thinking you deserve to be happy and knowing you are worthy of happiness.&#8221; Aha!</p>
<p>In the spirit of Oprah&#8217;s final lesson and all the wisdom I&#8217;ve learned through the years in &#8220;the world&#8217;s biggest classroom,&#8221; I thought I would share my most important lessons—the Oprah-isms I repeat and repeat and repeat, the aha moments that changed me, the truths who shaped the person I am.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t let yourself be taken to the second location! </strong>Retired police sergeant Sanford Strong shared <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Greatest-Lessons-on-The-Oprah-Show_1/3" target="_blank">this tip</a> in 1991. &#8220;Rule number one—and frankly, it&#8217;s probably, in my opinion, the most important: Never allow them to take you anywhere else. Never,&#8221; says Sanford. &#8220;Because crime scene number two is going to be isolated, you won&#8217;t choose it, you&#8217;ll be the focus of the crime.&#8221;<br />
I know I was probably too young to have seen the original episode but this has been scalded into my memory after tons of follow-ups where Oprah viewers credit this tip with saving their lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Imago Theory.</strong> A relationship theory developed by marriage therapist Harville Hendrix, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Top-20-Moments/2" target="_blank">Imago Theory</a> is basically the idea that you draw people into your life to either heal or re-enact old wounds. It&#8217;s why we marry men just like our fathers or act like our mothers (basically, the premise of every episode of <em>16 &amp; Pregnant</em>). Understanding this central idea has really affected how I view my marriage and so many other relationships in my life. It helped me understand that what I usually think is all about the other person is most likely all about me.</p>
<p><strong>When people show you who they are, believe them. </strong>Although coming via Maya Angelou, this was not an <a style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;color:#0060ff;line-height:1.7;" href="http://saltandnectar.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/stand-on-your-own-not-by-your-man-a-response/" target="_blank">easy lesson</a> for me to learn. Maybe I wanted to believe the best in people. Maybe I was too busy worrying that there was something wrong with me. Either way, I finally learned that I have no space in my life for toxic people. So, I say goodbye when they show their true colors&#8230;<a href="http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Maya-Angelou/7" target="_blank">the first time</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:14px;line-height:23px;">All pain is the same. </span></strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:14px;line-height:23px;">Oprah was interviewing women in prison for killing their own children—the worst crime imaginable. After the interview, one of the woman came to Oprah and said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t hate us.&#8221; Her response, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t hate you. I see that&#8217;s what you did with your pain and I do something else with mine.&#8221; It was a profound lesson in empathy, sympathy, and compassion that was reinforced throughout the show. A lesson that has stayed with me and colored the way I see everything.</span></p>
<p><strong>You teach people how to treat you. </strong>So simple. So important—especially for <a title="All About Mom(ME)" href="http://saltandnectar.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/all-about-momme/" target="_blank">us moms</a>. If you give and give with no concern for yourself, then don&#8217;t be surprised if those around you take and take with no concern for you either. Putting everyone else first and waiting for someone to do the same for you is a fruitless endeavor. If you want people to respect you, <a title="Stand On Your Own, Not By Your Man" href="http://saltandnectar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/stand-on-your-own-not-by-your-man/" target="_blank">then you must respect yourself</a>. Simple? Yes. Easy? No&#8230;well, unless you have Oprah to guide you.</p>
<p>I know Oprah will still be there to guide me. I still have O Magazine and the all-important OWN. I appreciate the heartfelt goodbye and gratitude she expressed yesterday.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t make it any less sad today when my 4 o&#8217;clock came and went with no Oprah.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_327" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://frugalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-327" title="021" src="http://frugalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/021.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Careful Planning is the Key</p></div>
<p>When I first began studying the art and science of frugality I looked at many lists that claimed to be the top five or ten money wasters. I found that most of the items on the list were mere opinions. But one category stood out as being accurate and useful—the dead waste. These are not spending decisions, but rather mistakes. The parking ticket, the bank fee, and yes-the food we let rot. Almost everyone in the United States does this to one extent or another. Nobody likes it, and everyone finds themselves annoyed and a little guilty and embarrassed when it happens. So why do we do it?</p>
<p>There are several reasons. The first is lack of self-knowledge. A successful food shopping expedition starts at the kitchen table with a pen and paper. If you cook at home, and I know you do because you are a frugalista, you already have some idea how long it takes for you and those who share your food to go through a particular item. If the item is perishable, you can’t buy more than you know you will use before it spoils. If you buy the two gallon milk special when you know that you only use a quart a week, the predictable result will be food waste. If you just can’t pass up the bargain, plan on freezing half immediately if the item freezes well. Also plan on building menus around the food in question, just as you would if you were handling the zucchini glut at summer’s end.</p>
<p>A second form of self-deception is the buying of things you know you hate because you believe them to be healthy. Maybe you “should” eat seaweed, or flax seed, but if you and your companions truly dislike these things they will go bad and end up in the compost. Keep experimenting, and you will find things that are just as healthy as the craze of the week that you DO love.</p>
<p>Another cause of food waste is cooking too much at one time. If you feed four people then two gallons of chili, even</p>
<div id="attachment_328" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 242px"><a href="http://frugalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/024.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-328" title="024" src="http://frugalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/024.jpg?w=232&#038;h=300" alt="" width="232" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Let&#039;s Keep it Empty</p></div>
<p>your special recipe, is probably too much. You can freeze it, but just make sure that you label it and rotate it back in the very next week. A bucket full of freezer burned mystery goo is sure to end up in the waste bin.</p>
<p>Finally, we waste food because we get lazy and don’t cook it in time, or our plans change and we end up going out when we meant to stay in. Sometimes we say we are lazy when really we are tired. It is good to have a little play in the system. When we are exhausted it is the perfect time to pop out the dish we cooked too much of last week, solving two problems at once. As for the spontaneous change of plans, that is just life. If you leave a couple of blank spots when you plan the menu for the week it will all even out. The food use equation may never be perfect. But if you follow these steps the waste bin will be a lot emptier.</p>
<p>Here are some links that will help you plan. Remember, the use by date reflects optimum quality, not safety. Use your nose and these guides to determine how long you can keep food safely:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I took my kids to see the Blue Man Group show – almost 13 years after seeing the innovative program during it’s original run in Chicago. Beyond noticing the updates in technology and content – there are several new segments that feature iPhones and digital messages – what struck me are the valuable lessons BMG has for professional communicators; think of it as a theatrical metaphor for highly original, memorable and impactful communication.</p>
<p>At its source BMG is about human communication – almost all of it non-verbal. The program features a dizzying range of multi-media sketches mixing mime, comedy, improv theatre, drumming, props and digital imagery. All the frenetic, often hilarious sketches relate to telling a story, and entertaining the audience. And it&#8217;s all done with very little &#8220;formal&#8221; communication.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful tips from the performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start conversations</strong> – Right from the beginning, when a scrolling text line gradually engages the audience in a fun back-and-forth dialogue, the performance goes well beyond the one-way “push” performance you&#8217;d expect with a show of this nature.</li>
<li><strong>Assume intelligence</strong> – Everything about the program (from the subtle mime movements to the smart comedic moments) suggests BMG take for granted their audience will get the joke. This is not a show that dumbs-down or shoot for the typical or obvious – despite the fact there are plenty of kids in the audience.  It’s a good reminder that worrying too much about “talking down” to an audience can be counterproductive if it strips any nuance, wit and creativity from the communication.</li>
<li><strong>Let the audience join/be the performance</strong> – Like in many shows, the BMG group team use several members of the audience in some of their sketches. It also uses mobile cameras to focus on the audience at regular interludes&#8230;breaking down the proverbial fourth wall. The show also makes good use of informal crowd-sourcing, using audience input or reactions to influence the performance.</li>
<li><strong>Use your body</strong> – It’s no surprise that the BMG team use physical tricks and props in their performance – including the famous drumming on paint cans sequence – but it’s a good reminder that more formal presentations could benefit from better use of movement and stage presence.</li>
<li><strong>Use music to help set mood and emphasis</strong> – It often surprises me how little corporate communication professionals use music in their presentations and deliverables.  Music is central to the BMG experience – ranging from basic drumming to background music – and is a major factor in the overall experience.</li>
<li><strong>Tackle the elephants</strong> – Too much corporate output is compromised because it tries to dance around contentious issues or latent questions among the audience. BMG boosts the relevance and impact of the show by going straight for the hidden elephants – such as celebrating the arrival of latecomers in a hilarious paparazzi-style announcement, or proactively addressing likely audience questions at the outset of the show.</li>
<li><strong>Go for a laugh</strong> – This show confirmed for me (again) that smart, timely humor can be a universal language that crosses age, background and culture. And most importantly, humor helps keep the attention of the audience and increases the chances participants will remember anything.  Too many communicators frown on humor and argue it can dilute and distort a serious message. That may be true – in some cases – but the reality is that material that is serious and dull can be much more effective if presented in a more engaging format.</li>
<li><strong>Improvise – </strong>One of the great things about BMG is that it leaves plenty of room for surprises and improvisation. I really noticed this during the audience participation segments, where it appeared there was little structure or script to guide the volunteers…to positive effect. <strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Make the event an experience</strong> – BMG is famous for the explosive ending where the audience is showered with toilet paper streams, confetti and giant balloons. Though this may sound like a silly exercise, this celebration is invariably a highlight of the program. At the Austin show I saw audience members spent almost 15 minutes “playing” after the formal end of the show.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, not all the tactics and tricks used by BMG are appropriate for more formal corporate communications. On the other hand, too many professionals adhere to outdated, unfounded rules about what constitutes effective communications – particularly in an era where YouTube parodies, virtual games and Twitter updates dominate the landscape. Blue Man Group shows communication can take many forms. It’s time we take a fresh look at the tool kit and focus on what works best, not what is accepted practice.</p>

<p>Day 140 / 365<br />
So I finally got some time to head out and give the Fuji x100 a real workout today, off I headed to nearby Harrogate. Lucky me headed straight into the rain, now I said the fuji needed a workout but i&#8217;m not quite ready to test it&#8217;s water repellency just yet. Spotted this shot and despite the voice in my head screaming at me not to shoot such a cliche fired off a quick frame before walking back to the car feeling a little dirty for my lack of creativity today. However in hindsight it fits perfectly with what has been on my mind for a week or so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a whole lot about the craft of photography lately, partly due to <a title="Jump to David DuChemins blog and a rant or three which perfectly capture my feelings at the moment" href="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/2011/05/no-such-thing-as-better/" target="_blank">Mr DuChemin elegantly putting into words many of my recent thoughts &amp; feelings on modern photography.</a> I hinted at this the other day when I mentioned briefly my feelings on flickr and it&#8217;s general tide of fluffy kittens &amp; rainbows. One statement I&#8217;ve recently come to take to heart is &#8220;If you frame up a shot and feel you&#8217;ve seen it before, then don&#8217;t press that shutter&#8221;. We need to push the craft of photography forward and stop shooting what we think people want to see (ie. what we&#8217;ve seen already that has been received with praise).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any problem with using others concepts and putting your vision onto them but straight out shooting to look like someone else isn&#8217;t going to get you (or anyone else) very far. Surely we are photographers because we want to share our personal vision of the world with others, much like writers and painters. We create something which expresses how WE see the world, not how we think others want us to see the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the perfect image from a flickr contact of mine in which he expresses in his comment pretty much my <a title="Link to &quot;Bite the hand that feeds me&quot; on flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimmyd2008/4127687772/" target="_blank">feelings on the current state of many photographers work</a> (and I&#8217;m not just saying this of photographers on flickr).</p>
<p>My best advice? Well if you do see someones shot and think &#8220;hey that&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;m going to shoot one of those.&#8221; then rather than just trying to replicate what they did, examine exactly what it is about the shot that you think is &#8220;cool&#8221;. Is it the light, the moment, the composition, examine your true feelings on the photograph rather than just trying to make a photograph that you hope someone else is going to say &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s cool&#8221;,&#8221;Great shot&#8221;, &#8220;Fav&#8221;. In fact better than that, unplug the computer and pick up a book of Cartier-Bresson, Avedon, O&#8217;Neill, Penn, Winograd, Adams, Evans photographs and spend an hour or so looking at them. Feel the power the physical photograph has that looking at a monitor seems to lack.</p>
<p>Sure I&#8217;m not saying every image we take has to be able to change the world with its power and emotion, I&#8217;m just saying it&#8217;s time we all took a moment to consider what it is we are really trying to say with our work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a quote (it&#8217;s been awhile since one of these) -</p>
<p>I have often thought that if photography were difficult in the true sense of the term -meaning that the creation of a simple photograph would entail as much time and effort as the production of a good watercolor or etching &#8211; there would be a vast improvement in total output. The sheer ease with which we can produce a superficial image often leads to creative disaster. &#8211; Ansel Adams</p>
<p>Oh, I do like todays photograph by the way, It&#8217;s just I expect more of myself.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our search for wildflowers, we came upon Mazourka Canyon just outside Independence, CA. The road winds up through the canyon and skirts alongside old mines. As we traveled along, we saw more and more wildflowers and lots of Cottontop Cactus. I had never seen them before &#8211; they have what looks like cottonballs on their tops and some of them had cottonballs shooting out of their sides! Different?!?</p>
<p>We stopped a few places for photos &#8211; one place had Foxtail Cactus everywhere&#8230;I would spot one and walk over to it, and then see three or four more. It kept happening!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of views from our campsite &#8211; of the creek and Mt. Whitney, followed by photos from Mazourka Canyon&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://virtuallynomadic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lone-pine-mazourka-canyon1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2171" title="Lone Pine, Mazourka Canyon" src="http://virtuallynomadic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lone-pine-mazourka-canyon1.jpg?w=621&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="621" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://virtuallynomadic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lone-pine-mazourka-canyon2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2172" title="Lone Pine, Mazourka Canyon2" src="http://virtuallynomadic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lone-pine-mazourka-canyon2.jpg?w=621&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="621" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>The flower in the bottom left photo is a Showy Gila - it&#8217;s very tiny! I was hoping we&#8217;d come across one, and actually found quite a few clumps of them growing alongside the wash. The cactus in the lower right photo is the Cottontop.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#333333;"><a href="http://wordsohmy.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sneeze-shake.jpg?w=300"><img class="aligncenter" title="sneeeze" src="http://wordsohmy.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sneeze-shake.jpg?w=394&#038;h=228" alt="" width="394" height="228" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Hello, friends! Are you stuffed up, run-down, miserable? Are your allergies something to sneeze at? Had enough of this nasal nonsense? Well buck up, buckers! I have personally collected ideas to push you through pollen season. The answers to all your problems is in this little blog post&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Practice your sneezes</strong><br />
This is the perfect opportunity to practice the sweet sound of your sneeze. Vary the pitch, tone, and force of your sneeze. Try a cute little sneeze or a great, booming gale-force. (Confession: I&#8217;m thinking of a great scene from The Golden Girls, check it out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvtnqgjJBBQ" target="_blank">here</a> for a quick chuckle.) And who said that &#8220;ACHOO&#8221; is the only sneeze sound out there? Startle/impress passerby with &#8221;ET TU!&#8221; (if it&#8217;s good enough for Caesar&#8230;) or express your thrilling sneeze with a big ol&#8217; &#8220;WAHOO!&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Or, you could always blow your nose around a baby and see if anything as cute as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oxmRT2YWw" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333333;">this</span></a> happens.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 327px"><a href="http://connect.collectorz.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/carl-and-russel.jpg"><img title="UpCarl" src="http://connect.collectorz.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/carl-and-russel.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="151" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You crazy kids and your dagnab rocknroll</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Embrace your inner curmudgen</strong><br />
As long as you&#8217;re </span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#333333;">feeling this warm and fuzzy hatred towards flowers and grass, you might as well go full-grouch and indulge in a grumpy free-for-all. Make loud gagging noises when you spot public displays of affection. (Claim that your mucus is the result of their grossness.) Mutter rude-but-true comments. (Does your blutetooth make you feel important? Because you&#8217;re not.) Tell those neighbor kids to stay off your lawn. Wear a ratty bathrobe all day, eat ice cream out of the carton, and sniff your nose at perky people who cheerfully proclaim that they&#8217;ve never experienced springtime allergies. (They should be killed.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>You sound funny, therefore you <em>are</em> funny</strong><br />
When you can&#8217;t breathe, all your sharp letters turn into round ones. Vs turn into Bs, Ts lose all their oomph (or would that be toomph?), and As pop up on the end of words where they have no business being. &#8220;I hab bad allergies. I dona feel good. I cana breathe. Will medicine help? I doud id.&#8221; Okay, you sound ridiculous. But one person&#8217;s weird way of talking is another&#8217;s comedic gold. Being nasal worked for Fran Drescher, didn&#8217;t it? Or hey&#8211;pretend your stuffed-up-ness is an accent from an exotic faraway locale. Everyone will think you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_zPmwvQFaM" target="_blank">one wild and crazy guy</a>! </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Become a kleenex expert/model</strong><br />
Take the time to test the softness of kleenex. You could be doing generations of tissue users a favor. Your epic contributions to kleenex research will be the stuff of legends. In fact, your story will replace that of the Princess and the Pea. (All that chick did was feel a pea underneath a bed. Her schnauz wasn&#8217;t even involved!) Next, you&#8217;ll want to work on kleenex as fashion. Take a cue from grandmas everywhere, and make kleenex-up-the sleeve fashionable. You&#8217;ll be all the rage with the blue-haired crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Wink, wink-Nudge nudge</strong><br />
When your eyes are itching like crazy, resist the urge to rub them like Lady Macbeth, and instead use this opportunity to wink at anyone who happens to be around. You&#8217;ll either make a new friend with your sexy wink or convince people that you have an uncontrollable, slightly creepy twitch. How do you like them odds?</span></p>

<p>Catching up on some reading yesterday, I came across an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/may/10/creative-writing-courses">interesting item</a> published in the Guardian a couple of weeks ago about whether you can teach creative writing. Unsurprisingly, it prompted mixed views. But I found it of interest because over the last few years I have found myself wondering about precisely that question in relation to art.</p>
<p>Of course, if you think of creative writing or art as simply the outcome of a process of applying a specific skill set, then there is a strong argument for saying yes, it can be taught. Skills can be taught to anyone who wants to learn. Everybody can learn to draw; books like <a class="zem_slink" title="Betty Edwards" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Edwards" rel="wikipedia">Betty Edwards</a>&#8216; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0007116454">Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain</a></em> provide inspiring real life examples of what is achievable in the space of just a few short weeks, and I&#8217;ve no doubt that creative writing courses can achieve equally impressive results.</p>
<p>But then as any artist/writer/musician will recognise there&#8217;s rules and then there&#8217;s the rest of it. The unquantifiable, the ineffable, the x factor. The work product which rises out of and in spite of and above the rule-guided product. The spark, the life, the essence. Can this be taught?</p>
<p>In the field of art education, I read an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Art-Cannot-Be-Taught/dp/0252069501">absorbing book</a> a couple of years ago by James Elkins, an art professor at the Art Institute of Chicago,<em> </em>which argued compellingly that art could not be taught. I was halfway through my own degree course at the time and after I&#8217;d recovered from the shock of discovering I was possibly paying to be taught the unteachable, it did shed some helpful light on the art educative process and what could be learned from it all. It helped me to understand the limitations and so get some value from group crits which up till then had been a source of frustrating double-speak and ambiguous euphemisms. For an ex-lawyer, it was a painful and challenging learning experience.</p>
<p>But once I realised what couldn&#8217;t be taught and why, I felt much better. I allowed myself to start thinking differently, to begin liking the uncertainty, the not-knowing; to recognise that the best learning came from the experience (for good or for bad) of making and doing.</p>
<p>The thing about &#8216;rules&#8217; &#8211; whether for creative writing or art &#8211; is that they weren&#8217;t handed down to humanity on tablets of stone from Mount Sinai. They were elicited and &#8216;revealed&#8217; through the study of works which, if you go back far enough, were inspired by a deeply intuitive creative instinct. I mentioned the other day how depressed I felt recently on hearing a student ask for classes on how to be an entrepreneur.  It&#8217;s all part of the same problem and reflects the fashionable delusion these days that everything can and needs to be taught. Yet whilst this clearly applies to skills of all sorts, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily follow that you can teach the mindsets which lead to great novels, wonderful art and memorable music.</p>
<p>What you can do is <a href="http://gilliansblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/creativity-on-the-curriculum/">provide an environment</a> in which it can be facilitated and encouraged and nurtured. That&#8217;s what the best art courses do, and I&#8217;d be happy to bet that&#8217;s what the best creative writing courses do.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m not the person to pontificate on all of this! According to WordPress, my posts every day are spattered with the passive voice, redundant expressions and cliché. I usually choose to ignore these helpful suggestions because, unsurprisingly, I hate rulebooks&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a bit busy lately, so here’s a little something to keep this blog ticking over. As I mentioned in a previous post I’m working on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lewisbush/collections/72157626710081326/">documenting various aspects of London</a>, covering about fifteen categories, each intended to work as individual sets of photographs or as part of one massive series. It’s not really a serious documentary project, even the idea of doing justice to a city like this laughable. It&#8217;s more a use for some of the photographs I take each day when I feel the urge to record something I’ve seen in the city, and something to keep me thinking. Anyway these are a select few from the ‘Walls’ series.</p>

Primarily they keep nosy people like me out of places we aren’t meant to be, but they also function as ad-hoc canvases for inner city art, free advertising space for enterprising shop owners, or simply and unintentionally add a bit of texture to urban life.</p>
