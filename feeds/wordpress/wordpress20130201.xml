				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nikprose.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/couple-embrace1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-45 alignright" alt="couple-embrace" src="http://nikprose.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/couple-embrace1.jpg?w=189&#038;h=234" width="189" height="234" /></a>I took the picture. Hell, I took several- he just wouldn&#8217;t let go. My stomach was churning. I took note of an aluminum streetcar and pointed my Nikon in its direction and snapped away. It reminded me of a futuristic homage to better days.</p>
<p>A rounded man in a striped shirt struggled up the stiff and shiny cobbled steps. He reached out with his left arm and latched on to his wife’s, who seemed to have a little more vigor in her step. They were most likely going home for an afternoon siesta. Siesta: that’s all it seemed people did around here.</p>
<p>We were walking down a narrow sloped hill with beautifully crumbling buildings on each side, separated only by those challenging staccato cobbled stone steps, and by tram lines going up the middle of the ‘street.’ I took a moment to soak it all in- I finally felt like I was in South America.</p>
<p>“Did you get it? Did you get the shot?” It was Michael. They had finally stopped hugging.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got it.”</p>
<p>“How did it turn out?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Just fine,” I replied. I looked at Anna who gave me a half-hearted  glance and looked away. She was wearing her red floral sundress. The one that always lifted ever so slightly with the breeze and made me wonder whether her little frame would one day blow away altogether.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Michael with a big grin. &#8220;It’s just down the steps and to the left. You guys are going to love it.”</p>
<p>I stopped holding my camera and let it hang around my neck and adjusted the straps of my little backpack. Michael was already three steps down while Anna still hadn&#8217;t moved.</p>
<p>“Come on, what are you guys waiting for?” I could see her looking at me from the corner of her eye. She continued down the steps and so did I behind her. When she reached Michael he took her hand.</p>
<p>“You tired, Tony?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“You look a little tired or something. Doesn&#8217;t he look tired, Anne?”  She looked up at me, still holding his hand.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so,” she said, producing the faintest of smiles.</p>
<p>“Are you jet lagged? You can’t still be jet lagged?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not jet lagged Mike. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright! Sorry, man. I’m just excited. I want everyone to have a good time. The tequila will help! Come on.” He pulled Anna down with him and like always I followed behind.</p>
<p>He was living here. Walking the cobbled steps and riding trams up city streets built on burning rolling hills. Michael moved here from Ohio for med school. He couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere stateside and heard about the school from one of his father’s colleagues. This was the first time we were seeing him in three months. Anna and I flew in together the night before.</p>
<p>Descending the steps and out of the shade into the testing sun, a fuller woman stood in black pants, white sleeveless collar, with her arms crossed, seemingly bored and completely unbothered by the scorching heat; presumably waiting for patrons to arrive.</p>
<p>“Ola,” said Michael, with his American accent. The woman rolled her eyes and responded with an, Ola senior.</p>
<p>We walked through a tight blue door and I gave the broad woman a nervous smile that resulted in more eye rolling.</p>
<p>The bar was a dimly lit hole in the wall. There was lively ethnic music on in the background and a soccer match played in the corner above a wooden bar and dusty bottles on an ancient TV.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you,” said Michael. “Didn’t I tell you it was authentic? We come here at least once a week to get away from studying. There’s a guy Ernesto here who’s the-” and before he could finish his sentence a white swinging door opened revealing, “Ernesto!” shouted Michael, and he and the man embraced. I smiled and looked over at Anna who smiled too.</p>
<p>“Ernesto, they’re here! They made it. This is my best friend Anthony,” said Michael, grabbing me by the shoulders. Ernesto and I shook hands. “And this Ernesto- this is my beautiful girlfriend, the love of my life, Anna.” My stomach churned. Ernesto took a moment and looked her up and down and then pulled her in for a hug and kissed her twice on both cheeks.</p>
<p>We sat at the wooden bar and pounded back tequila and rum and cokes. Ernesto laughed at the sun burn developing on my nose and forehead, and complemented Anna’s already beautifully sun kissed skin.</p>
<p>“To the three amigos,” cheersed Michael. We drank.</p>
<p>“To my best friend Tony boy coming all this way to see me,” cheersed Michael. We drank.</p>
<p>“To my beautiful and loyal girlfriend Anne, who I miss so much. Salud!” We drank.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” said Anna and stepped outside through the blue door, a burst of light sobering through.</p>
<p>“I should go check on her,” I said. As I stood, Michael pulled me back down.</p>
<p>“You been taking care of her like I asked?”</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“Good boy,” he said. “I have to piss.” And he left for the bathroom.</p>
<p>Outside and a little bit further down the slope I found Anna crossed armed, her one leg bent behind her, leaning against a stores façade. There were trails on her soft cheeks fading away. I nearly stumbled past her down those damn steps and she caught me with a hug.</p>
<p>“Are you ok?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how I’m going to do this,” she replied.</p>
<p>“It’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>“He’s good, he really is. But he’s absolutely clueless.”</p>
<p>“We bought the tickets before any of this even happened.” I hiccuped and she laughed.</p>
<p>“I’m drunk,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know. Me too, a little.”</p>
<p>“I like your dress.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She nestled her head against my chest and I kissed her sandy hair.</p>
<p>“We still have five more days to tell him.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: This post was adapted by <em>The Huffington Post</em>. You can find that article <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rek-lecounte/boy-scouts-gay-ban_b_2581766.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices">here</a>.</p>
<p>“We all live with the objective of being happy, our lives are all different and yet the same.” –Anne Frank</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 551px"><a href="http://www.timepass.info/post/Where-two-oceans-meet-but-do-not-mix.aspx"><img class="  " alt="Amazing natural phenomenon where the Baltic and North Seas meet but don't mix because of the differing density" src="http://i.imgur.com/lCPDX.jpg" width="541" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other&#8217;s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets.&#8221; –Benjamin Disraeli</p></div>
<p>As a child, I was taught that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Dad’s particular corollary—pick your battles, as it’s not always worth it to be “right”—has served him well in the Army, so I’ve long aspired to apply its wisdom to my life. For this reason, it always made a sort of intuitive sense to seek mutual understanding and deescalate conflict rather than appeal to the choir in a scorched-earth crusade for feel-good “authenticity”. There is little value in a crown of bitterness, however righteous.</p>
<p>This philosophy of living, it turns out, is wonderfully conducive to maintaining close, mutually edifying relationships with many people whose political and ideological priorities would, I strongly suspect, be the <a href="http://tokendissonance.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/the-pride-of-yale/">ruin of America</a> (and Western civilization) if ever realized. I have well-meaning friends who oppose <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/12/20/the-court-of-marriage/">gay marriage</a>, distrust the military, hate <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/01/17/empire-state-of-guns/">guns</a>, disdain football, loathe the South, think highly of France, want ever <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rek-lecounte/fear-and-consequence_b_2235135.html">higher taxes</a>, and blaspheme the <a href="http://tokendissonance.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/guns-taxes-and-the-devil/">Southeastern Conference</a>. I don’t need my loved ones to <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/05/why-im-voting-for-mitt-romney/">agree with me</a> on all that’s right and true, and I have defended those <a href="http://tokendissonance.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/i-disagree-with/">whose positions I reject</a>. I just need the people I care about to be willing to hear me and understand where I’m coming from. Where consideration is given, it is returned.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I’m not terribly surprised by the development of what might seem an unlikely friendship between LGBT activist Shane Windmeyer of <a href="http://www.campuspride.org/3890/campus-pride-suspends-chick-fil-a-5-simple-facts-about-chick-fil-a-national-college-campaign-2/">Campus Pride</a> and noted evangelical Dan Cathy of <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a>. If there is any virtue in “tolerance” and “diversity”, you can <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shane-l-windmeyer/dan-cathy-chick-fil-a_b_2564379.html">find it in this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dan, in his heart, is driven by his desire to minister to others and had to choose to continue our relationship throughout this controversy. <em>He had to both hold to his beliefs and welcome me into them</em>. He had to face the issue of respecting my viewpoints and life even while not being able to reconcile them with his belief system. He defined this to me as &#8220;the blessing of growth.&#8221; <strong>He expanded his world without abandoning it. I did, as well.</strong> [My emphasis]”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus a chasm <a href="http://www.campuspride.org/3890/campus-pride-suspends-chick-fil-a-5-simple-facts-about-chick-fil-a-national-college-campaign-2/">was bridged</a>.</p>
<p>Just last summer, as another bitter presidential campaign launched into orbit, the Boy Scouts closed a two-year study by reaffirming their ban on gay scouts and leaders. By then, there was something resembling growing public consensus in favor of including gays, and <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/08/13185136-obama-opposes-boy-scouts-policy-banning-gays?lite">both presidential candidates</a> were on record supporting that consensus. Still, the Boy Scouts were primarily backed by <a href="http://www.the-daily-record.com/ap%20lifestyle/2012/08/03/as-eagle-scouts-return-medals-gay-ban-still-firm">religious organizations</a> that preferred the status quo, and so it held. Now, however, it seems that policy <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/scouts-retreat-gays-policy-18337361">might change</a>, after all, much to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/boy-scouts-gay-policy-change-conservative-pundits-_n_2573828.html">chagrin of some</a>—though certainly not all—of the faithful.</p>
<p>If the Boy Scouts decide to shed their national requirement to exclude gays, there will not necessarily be a sudden, massive change-of-heart within the ranks any more than Dan Cathy is now a gay rights activist because of his friendship with Shane Windmeyer. While those troops that have long been gay-friendly will be able to come out of <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/28/16738860-cub-scout-pack-were-dropping-gay-friendly-policy-in-face-of-boy-scouts-pressure?lite">glass closets</a>, others will be allowed to maintain their locally decided ban on gays. In short, a new world won’t be built overnight. What will matter is that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/as-eagle-scouts-return-me_0_n_1747067.html">fewer members</a> will be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/06/21/pennsylvania.gay.scout/">rejected</a> for being <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/08/us/california-gay-eagle-scout/index.html">who they are</a>, and religious conservatives will not be compelled to contravene their values. In an ideal world, people from various perspectives will find new occasions and opportunities to understand one another, to everyone’s benefit. Even if not all minds ever fully change, there is hope in the possibility of harmony emerging from where once there thrived grievance and resentment.</p>
<p>Wherever you fall on this or any issue, there is often a world of difference between being wrong and being evil. We don’t have to all agree on the content or path to a better world of enduring fulfillment and mutual respect, but we can at least acknowledge that we each strive for one. If nothing else, may we always have at least that much in common.</p>
<p>We can agree to disagree.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in the final stages before releasing my memoir, and for a few weeks there, I dealt with a paralyzing fear.  All I could think about are the attacks people will make on my character (though I’ve been attacked by readers before, on numerous occasions).   Or the ways in which certain people in the book will feel misrepresented or insulted (though I did my best to tell my story as it actually happened).</p>
<p>I listened to my dad telling stories about my sister and I over family dinner, and realized how unique each of our stories and perceptions really are.  He had no recollection of what we were really going through at different stages of our lives.  A bitter drink turned sweet with distance.  In fact, <i>everyone</i> from my youth has little idea of the double life I lived, now captured in my book.</p>
<p>“The risk is fearsome: in making your real work you hand the audience the power to deny the understanding you seek; you hand them the power to say, “you’re not like us; you’re weird; you’re crazy (Bayles, Orland, 39).”</p>
<p>In all truth, I prefer people that I don’t know at all to read my work, rather than people who know me.  It’s okay for a stranger to not like it, or not get it, but when it’s your friend, it means that they don’t really get <i>you</i> at all.</p>
<p>In the midst of my publishing fear phase, a friend leant me the book “Art &amp; Fear – Observations On The Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking”.  As soon as I began reading it, my fear subsided.  I was able to fully focus again on the process of making art, rather than fearing the result of my art.  And I remembered how amazing it is to be where I am at, and see that the creation of this book all happened through mad stubborn persistence, diligence, pain, tears, upheaval, countless rewrites, and that fleeting feeling of triumph.</p>
<p>“Basically, those who continue to make art are those who have learned how to continue – or more precisely, have learned how to not quit (Bayles, Orland, 9).”</p>
<p>In the beginning, I imagined I would write a novel.  My boyfriend at the time so fascinated me that I had to capture him with words.  I thought it would just be a story of him, but it grew and grew into a whole community.  How I got there, what I was searching for, and how it all ended up.  In the end, it was not really about him or them at all.  It was about me.</p>
<p>I thought it would be finished in 1-2 years.  It would be published by a major with a huge book advance, become a best seller, and I would receive a movie deal within the year (how wonderful it is to be naïve and clueless).  As I slugged away at horrible jobs that paid practically nothing, this image of the victorious author got me through the worst.</p>
<p>Then there was the issue, that in my twenties I partied so hard and lived so much to the fullest (which makes for much of my subject matter), that it was hard to find time and a morning without a hangover to write.  But no matter.  I still lugged my computer to the coffee shop when I could, on my one day off from work a week.  Eventually, even in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>“To the artist, art is a verb (Bayles, Orland, 90).”</p>
<p>Bit by bit the pieces grew organically, and came to fit together.  The book started as a third person novel, then a novel in the 1<sup>st</sup> person, then with voices of two other characters thrown in.  Finally, three years ago, I was able to find the courage to admit that it is a memoir.  But I would not have had the guts to say what I did, if it hadn’t started out as fiction.  I also wouldn’t have come to know the other characters so well without that extra exploration.  Did I mention that I began writing this book in 2002?</p>
<p>“The artists life is frustrating not because the passage is slow, but because he imagines it to be fast (Bayle, Orland, 17).”</p>
<p>It still amazes me that I have not given up.  But on the other hand, it doesn’t amaze me at all, because I had no other choice.  I couldn’t release it from my brain until it was all written down.  And when it was finally done, it lifted like magic, and I was free of it.</p>
<p>I am at an age now, where the idealism begins to fade away.  I’ve watched plenty of friends give up their craft for stability.  Life is hard.  Most artists don’t survive as artists once they leave the supportive community of school.  After that, it’s just you and your art, and good luck getting people to care about what you do.  Your friends are not necessarily your fans.</p>
<p>Facing the fact that my book will be available to the public, I wonder how my life will change.  I will do everything I can to see that it’s successful, but there is the fear that it won’t sell.  I won’t know until I take that risk.  And whatever happens, it will still be a foundation that I can build from.</p>
<p>Years ago, a friend of mine read several chapters.  Paul was a young techie nerd, who was bored with life, and struggling to find social skills.  He kept talking to me about one of the main characters: a binging, partying, player who puts on a debonair act.  He became obsessed with this guy.  It didn’t take long before he was turning into him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Paul was out every single night, getting wasted, and hounding women wherever he went.  In a bizarre turn of events, he married an older woman within three months of meeting her.  But he continued to go out every night, and slurred to me that he wasn’t sure how he’d gotten sucked into the institution.</p>
<p>At one point, he had been my best friend.  But soon, it was too embarrassing to go anywhere with him.  He was rude to bartenders who were my friends.  He was loud and obnoxious, trying to see how many curse words he could fit into one sentence.  He went from being madly intelligent and witty, to talking in circles without making any sense.  It was like watching Truman Capote’s downfall.</p>
<p>Was it the book?  Or was it because he also had feelings for me?  Or maybe, I was not responsible at all, and he was just on that course looking for an avenue to go down.  I don’t know.  But it was a disturbing realization that the book might be a little dangerous for the slightly unstable.</p>
<p>“Artmaking grants access to worlds that may be dangerous, sacred, forbidden, seductive, or all of the above.  It grants access to worlds you may otherwise never fully engage (Bayle, Orland, 108).”</p>
<p>I hope that my memoir shows that the world is never exactly as we are told it is, and it is up to each of us to find out for ourselves.  Every person has the right to be an adventurer, an explorer of life.  To Think for themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, it is dangerous to really live.  To take chances, and be open to people who are different from ourselves.  But it’s the only way to find out who we really are.  If we live in fear, we’ll remain in a bubble where nothing really happens, and nothing can really grow.</p>
<p>“Insist that the world must always remain <i>x</i>, and <i>x</i> is indeed exactly what you’ll get (Bayles, Orland, 111-112).”</p>
<p>I am excited, that soon, with the book release, my life will open up to new possibilities.  It will be out there, speaking for me, doing the work that I put into it for a decade of my life.  I will keep you all updated when it is released.</p>
<p>Do any of you have book release experiences to share?  Was it uplifting?  Did it feel like a let down?  Did it open your life up to new things?  Please share.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people lose all sense of rationality as soon as a brain chemical is mentioned. For instance, in the middle of an <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-humanity-desperately-wants-monsters-to-be-real/">otherwise good</a> Cracked article:</p>
<blockquote><p>It makes perfect sense &#8212; the emotion we call &#8220;anger&#8221; or &#8220;hate&#8221; is a part of our evolutionary fighting instinct, so to prepare us for the battle, it pumps us full of anesthetic to block the pain and <a href="http://billygordon.com/2012/06/13/drama-anger-addicting/#.UFvrya7hfio" target="a">releases the pleasure chemical dopamine</a> to ease our fears about fighting the tiger/tribesman/drunken Red Sox fan who is threatening us. Incidentally, these are the same two chemicals that are released <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181074/" target="a">when you smoke crack</a>.<br />
Quite simply, hate gets you high.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;No, that really doesn&#8217;t follow.</p>
<p>Dopamine exists for a reason. It is not the Give People Highs system. It is thought to be related to pleasure and a sense of well-being and to be a sort of &#8220;reward system&#8221; for doing things that helped your ancestors survive and make more babies. It&#8217;s like giving yourself a Skittle every time you answer an email. In this model, taking cocaine is like eating <em>all the Skittles</em> without answering any emails at all; it circumvents what the dopamine system is supposed to do. Saying that everything that involves the dopamine system is addictive is literally saying that every time you feel happy about or want something you&#8217;re addicted to it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible hating people gets you high! But you have to answer all kinds of questions like &#8220;how much dopamine is released?&#8221; and &#8220;is &#8216;high&#8217; a useful model to deal with hatred?&#8221; and &#8220;do people seem to get high when they hate people?&#8221; You can&#8217;t just declare it so because dopamine is involved.</p>
<p>Or consider <a href="http://www.loveandfidelity.org/2012/12/03/unprotected-a-lesson-in-chivalry/">oxytocin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why would it matter to us <em>young men</em> that oxytocin, which is released in women’s bodies on occasions of physical intimacy, is known to cause emotional attachment and increased trust?&#8230; The release of oxytocin that our intimate behavior with a woman could stimulate may have effects well beyond what she imagined when consenting to such physical intimacy.  The imbalance in emotional connection between us men and women in these circumstances in which there is no committed relationship can easily cause emotional issues that are hard to foresee.</p></blockquote>
<p>Things that are true: oxytocin is released from women&#8217;s bodies (and men&#8217;s bodies) after sex. It&#8217;s also released during childbirth, breastfeeding, snuggles, and hot showers. (The general rule of oxytocin-related discussion is to replace everything they say with &#8220;hot showers&#8221; and see if it still makes sense.) Oxytocin is also possibly related to increased trust, reduced fear, increased empathy, and improved memory, particularly for social information.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: oxytocin has been released in women&#8217;s brains when they have sex since long before we knew oxytocin was a thing. Assuming that she&#8217;s not a virgin or very inexperienced, if a woman tends to get attached to men after sex, she would have already recognized that and incorporated it into her &#8220;should I have casual sex?&#8221; decision-making process. The fact that getting attached after sex happens because of a brain chemical rather than because of crazy random happenstance doesn&#8217;t actually change anything.</p>
<p>Further exciting example, this time <a href="http://www.livescience.com/1139-music-chills.html">related to music</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As chills grow in intensity, bloodflow increases between areas of the brain associated with euphoria-inducing vices like food, sex, and drugs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or to put it another way: &#8220;like drugs, food, and sex, music makes people happy.&#8221; Music causes physical changes in the brain, like <em>literally everything else on the planet</em><em>, </em>because <em>all of thought and emotions happen through physical changes in the brain</em>. This is not remotely exciting, important, or news.</p>
<p>&#8220;This emotion happens in this circumstance because of this brain chemical!&#8221; actually doesn&#8217;t give you any new information about the emotion itself. It tells you interesting things about how the brain works and what assorted chemicals in the brain do. But knowing the physical process<em> </em>behind something doesn&#8217;t mean that the thing is any more valid, important, or real than it was before we knew the physical process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that knowing the physical process isn&#8217;t important. It is, of course it is, and neuroscience is an incredibly exciting field with some groundbreaking discoveries. I am a fan of science reporting about &#8220;scientists find neurotransmitter that plays a key role in getting people to want things.&#8221; I am just not a fan of &#8220;brain chemicals secretly mind control women into falling in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I suggest an exercise. Every time you read something that mentions brain chemicals or brain scans, rewrite the sentence without the sciencey portions. &#8220;Hate makes people happy.&#8221; &#8220;Women feel closer to people after sex.&#8221; &#8220;Music makes people happy.&#8221; If the argument suddenly seems way less persuasive, or the news story way less ground-breaking&#8230; well. Someone&#8217;s doing something shady.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before I kick off this post, first, an apology: you&#8217;ll pardon my lack of blog posts recently, as I&#8217;m slowly recovering from the GODDAMNED FLU. Jesus H. Christ on a shit-stained cracker, I never get sick! Suddenly, Friday night, I&#8217;m overcome with a thumping migrane and body aches. By Saturday morning, I&#8217;m in agony, so it&#8217;s off to the Urgent Care I go. A week&#8217;s worth of Tamiflu and Hydrocodone (which is quite delicious, by the way, and habit-forming&#8230;hmm&#8230;) notwithstanding, Saturday night was brutal. I was in the kind of physical discomfort that made resting absolutely impossible. Oh, and I got to hug the toilet, which is also a rarity. I&#8217;ve pounded booze until I&#8217;ve drunk myself sober, and hardly ever puked, but the flu make me do the barf dance.</p>
<p>Great. Nothing like puking in front of your daughter, who thinks this is HILARIOUS. That little shit. I reminded her later of when she got sick and spent the entire day puking. That shut her up.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s now Thursday, I&#8217;ve exhausted my Tamiflu, but I still have some Hydrocodone left over. My head is stopped up, and I still feel sluggish. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to go for a 2-3 mile run lately, or to the gym, so I&#8217;m feeling doughy, but I don&#8217;t dare go to the gym feeling the way I feel. Worse yet, I don&#8217;t even feel like writing. Nothing. Not even a blog. Well, until right now, I suppose.</p>
<p>Ten days have passed, my throat is still scratchy, I finally made it to the gym this morning, only to wrestle furiously with an elliptical machine; I won, but barely.</p>
<p>In addition to the flu, I&#8217;ve reprised my role as <a href="http://outwherethebusesdontrun.com/2012/11/12/confessions-of-a-collegiate-ringer/">a collegiate ringer</a>. One of my wife&#8217;s classes involves her reading a rather horrible novel; essentially, it&#8217;s Socratic didactic disguised as a novel. Great. Nothing more I love than being lectured to. So I took it upon myself to read the novel over the weekend, only to work myself up into a teeth-gnashing frenzy over how fucking irresponsible and outright <em>wrong</em> the whole didactic was. But I finished her assignments for the week, with a few more coming in the following weeks.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, that novel, which I won&#8217;t reveal its title just yet, has now entered my list of my All-Time Top 5 Most Hated Novels Ever. A blog post on this to come very soon.</p>
<p>Oh, and J.J. Abrams will direct the new <em>Star Wars</em> film. I want to be all excited about this, but I&#8217;m withhold any expected frenzy until May 2015, when the seventh chapter comes to the screen.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was at a local writer&#8217;s critique group I attend every second Saturday of each month. A lively discussion took place regarding one of the participant&#8217;s submitted pieces. I felt his writing, though promising, needed a lot of work. Too many run-on sentences, and his story seemed to threaten to get away from him. Like a lot of young adult writers, his story is part of a multi-part story; his submitted short selection was the prologue and opening chapter to the first novel.</p>
<p>My suggestion to him, one which I voiced loudly, was to make the story more ambitious. I felt he was restraining himself a bit too much.</p>
<p>One participant argued otherwise. There&#8217;s an adage in the publishing world, she said, that both agents and publishers will repeat with writers: your first and second novels should play it safe. Save the really ambitious stuff for the third novel. Agents find it easier to sell novels that play it safe. A few participants in the group nodded their heads, although it was hard to say if they agreed, or were just nodding for the sheer hell of it all.</p>
<p>I let her commentary pass, without a comment of my own. After all, I&#8217;m not a published writer, so I have no frame of reference to retort with. There are rules every writer must abide by. The classic &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell,&#8221; is probably the one cardinal rule no writer dare violate. The greatest lesson any writer should know is what the rules to writing actually are. Know the rules, and you&#8217;ll play the game correctly.</p>
<p>With that being said, there&#8217;s something to be said about breaking the rules. The greatest art has often been created when the artist thumbs their nose at the rules, and creates a new set of rules. Actually, let&#8217;s take that one step down a bit. Good art, even if it&#8217;s not great, should make every attempt to break the rules. And this rule that your debut novel should be something you should play safe, as a writer, is one rule I think needs to be broken more frequently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be hard-pressed to tell you exactly how many debut novels I&#8217;ve read, but I find that while so many are well-written and possessing of a literary voice that&#8217;s clearly going places, often times that debut just seems unmemorable. Not to say it&#8217;s a bad book. Far from it. But I get a feeling sometimes that after I&#8217;ve read a debut novel, I&#8217;ll likely not think much about it ever again. Which leads me recently to wonder if someone, an agent, an editor, another writer, suggested to this writer that they play it safe with their debut novel. The better the chances to get their novel published, right? So be it, I suppose.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333576871l/9969571.jpg" width="250" height="380" /></p>
<p>Then I finished reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one"><em>Ready Player One</em></a> by Ernest Cline recently, and was reminded again of what a debut novel should read like: an opening, forceful statement of intent from a new novelist, one that brims with so much promise, and whose debut novel is filled with the idea that &#8220;playing it safe&#8221; is a fool&#8217;s errand. Clearly, Ernest Cline skipped class the day that lesson was taught, and thank the gods for that, because had Ernest Cline played it safe, <em>Ready Player One</em> would simply be another run-of-the-mill sci-fi tale. By not playing it safe, Ernest Cline has weaved a hilarious, heart-racing, smile-inducing pop-culture thrill ride, a love letter to nerd culture and 80s-era nostalgia, and a game inside a story that&#8217;s hard to put down. If you&#8217;ve read this novel, then you know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>In other words, this is one hell of a debut novel because it goes for something far greater than the sum of its parts. It dares to be far more ambitious than it should be, and it works.</p>
<p>I thought of some of my favorite debut novels: <em>Fight Club</em>, by Chuck Palahniuk, <em>White Teeth</em>, by Zadie Smith, <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>, by Mark Haddon, and <em>Catch-22</em>, by Joseph Heller. What if Chuck Palahniuk&#8217;s agent told him to play it safe, and lose the whole plot twist about Tyler Durden and the narrator being the same person? Certainly Palahniuk&#8217;s ruminations on commercialism, masculinity, and materialism wouldn&#8217;t have had the same heft and anarchic glee to them. What if Joseph Heller&#8217;s agent told him, &#8220;Forget it, you need to make Yossarian less crazy and more likeable?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible these conversations took place. Clearly, if they did, these authors dug their heels.</p>
<p>Mind you, I&#8217;m not dumping on agents for dispensing this advice. Sometimes an author not playing it safe is an author being self-indulgent, and a good agent needs to call bullshit sometimes. But sometimes this advice can be misguided. I&#8217;m not saying the rule of &#8220;playing it safe&#8221; is wrong, but it&#8217;s a rule worth breaking when writing your first novel.</p>

<p>Playing on the high voltage electrical transformer was one of the most fun things you could do as a kid. It was like a jungle gym with a warm comforting electric voltage. It was like playing with matches and running with scissors at the same time. It was like smoking. It was like drinking. It was like DRUGS. </p>
<p>The thing had a siren song I could not resist. Or maybe that was just the sound of the cancerous grounding hum. My parents had many rules, most of which I followed. Don&#8217;t talk to strangers? Fine. Don&#8217;t play with matches? Done. But don&#8217;t play on the high-voltage electrical transformer box that could electrocute you to death? Sorry, no can do. </p>
<p>Besides, if it was really so dangerous, there would have been an after-school special about it. Or a special filmstrip shown in class. A cartoon all-stars program. At the very least, a piddly PSA at the end of GI Joe. I trusted television for all of my most important information.</p>
<p>I openly defied the sticker on the side of the transformer than read WARNING DO NOT TOUCH. I mocked it. A picture of silhouetted man being shocked to death meant nothing to the ice cold water running in my veins. I was a daredevil. A rebel. A fearless dragon. The only thing that scared me was quicksand. Well&#8212;and that episode of <em>Punky Brewster</em> where Cherie got trapped in the refrigerator and almost suffocated. God, that was traumatizing.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, and jellyfish. They&#8217;re translucent blobs with tentacles. And Brussels Sprouts. They&#8217;re mini-cabbages. SCARY. </p>
<p>The transformer was fun for lots of reasons. Reason #1: it was called a transformer. I was always waiting for that thing to turn in Optimus Prime. Reason #2: It was a moon base for my action figures. Reason #3: I could do extreme stunts off of it. Like jumping and well&#8212;only jumping. But I could jump all the way to the sidewalk without touching the grass. And that arbitrary invisible line was like the Olympic finish line.</p>
<p>I was like Rocky always training for the big fight. I practiced my jumps on the staircase in the house, always trying to jump from the next step up. I usually chickened out around the fourth or fifth step, but with enough training, my goal in life was to jump down an entire flight of stairs. </p>
<p>I never did make it, and maybe that&#8217;s a shame. I could always start trying again, but I like my knees. I think they used to be made of Kevlar, but now they&#8217;re just made of ligaments and flesh. I was bionic, once. I&#8217;m human now. But I&#8217;m a fearless dragon forever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re living through an interesting and potentially groundbreaking peroid of history at the moment with &#8220;The Arab Spring&#8221;, the very first African-American  President of the United States taking and retaining office, the economic balance of power shifting eastwards, and seeing the biggest challenge to Capitalism since the Bolshevik Revolution and &#8220;The Great Depression&#8221; of the 1930&#8242;s.</p>
<p>However, if you live in the United Kingdom there is another potentially historic development arriving in 2014: Scottish Independence. If you&#8217;ve not been following the news or do not live in the UK I&#8217;ll give a rundown of what I&#8217;m about to address. All of the nations which currently make up &#8220;The United Kingdom&#8221; were not always part of it; Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland to be exact. Scotland has been part of the UK for just over three centuries, since the 1st of May 1707 to be precise when the Acts of Union merged the Scottish Parliament with the Westminster British Parliament. With it&#8217;s foundations secured Britain went forth and forged the greatest empire known to man, an empire which stretched the width of the globe and brought many nations under it&#8217;s influence&#8230; <em>&#8220;The sun never sets on the British Empire&#8221;</em> was a term which was not too far from reality when it was coined.<br />
Despite being immensely prosperous for the British Empire the imperial model was an unsustainable system, financially and socially, and sure enough nation after nation began either demanding autonomy or outright independence from the British Crown. Although the American War of Independence (1775 &#8211; 1783) had shaken the foundations of the British Empire the real killer blows came with the Boer Wars (1880 &#8211; 1881 &amp; 1899 &#8211; 1902), World War One (1914 &#8211; 1918), and World War Two (1939 &#8211; 1945). In addition to almost bankrupting Britain these wars had also proven that Britain could no longer guarantee the safety of it&#8217;s colonies, the Japanese bombing of Darwin being a good example, and in the aftermath of World War Two many of these colonies began seeking new partnerships such as the ANZUS <em>(Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty)</em> Treaty of 1951. Despite it&#8217;s worldwide empire fast falling to pieces Britain could be safe in the knowledge that it still had Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (Republic of Ireland was recognized in 1922) to maintain the title of &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now even that appears to be in question as the Scottish Parliament has recently taken the extraordinary step of deciding to hold a referendum on whether or not Scotland should remain part of the UK. If the vote in favor of &#8216;Devolution&#8217;* passes in November 2014 that would mean with immediate effect that Scotland will become it&#8217;s own state completely independent from British politics. That would only leave England with Northern Ireland, which is experiencing ongoing tensions with it&#8217;s republican neighbor, and Wales, who&#8217;s future in the UK also seems in question.<br />
* <em>Devolution essentially means the transfer of powers from the UK parliament in London to assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast, and the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://daliennation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/devolution.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-992" alt="Devolution" src="http://daliennation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/devolution.jpg?w=267&#038;h=322" width="267" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>What this essentially means is that &#8220;The United Kingdom&#8221; would lose it&#8217;s second biggest member leaving England, Wales, and Northern Ireland as the remainder of what was once a global empire. The world has seen the death of the British Empire <em>(if you&#8217;re one of those patriotic zealots who believes Britain still has an empire you&#8217;re delusional)</em> and I genuinely think we&#8217;re about to see the death of the United Kingdom. If Scotland leaves the UK what does that mean for Wales? Even more so what does that mean for Northern Ireland, will it join it&#8217;s republican neighbor?</p>
<p><a href="http://daliennation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/uk-scotland.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998" alt="UK Scotland" src="http://daliennation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/uk-scotland.png?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Sceptics have said that without support from England Scotland would fail to keep itself afloat, pointing to the recent Euro bailout of The Republic of Ireland as a fear-inducing example. However, consider this&#8230; Scotland is not part of the Euro currency and has shown little inclination of ever joining it. It has a considerable advantage that many sceptics overlook when addressing this issue, the size of it&#8217;s population. As of 2012 England has a staggering population of roughly 60,000,000 people whilst Scotland has a mere 5,000,000. Nay-sayers will eagerly point out the potential costs Scotland will face without support from Westminster but the fact remains that Scotland has a tiny population to care for compared to England and that any public services bill would be minute compared to the ever-rising English bill. Scotland has the means to care for itself outside of finance, something that England is now learning the hard way <em>(thanks for that Maggie Thatcher&#8230;). </em>It is already rearing it&#8217;s own livestock, cultivating it&#8217;s own land, and has access to North Sea oil which can help sustain it&#8217;s economy for the time being.</p>
<p>English critics of the 2014 referendum generally sound like parents who are desperately clinging onto their children and who don&#8217;t want them leaving the nest. I think that a more suitable analogy is that of overly-protective grandparents taking care of their grandchildren in a similar manner, except they are stuck in a time warp and cannot get over the fact that the British Empire is dead-and-buried.</p>
<p>Can Scotland stand by itself come 2014?<br />
Who knows.<br />
We won&#8217;t know until we let them try though, it&#8217;s time to let Scotland decide it&#8217;s own future.</p>
