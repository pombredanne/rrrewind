				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can you get for one $2 cup of coffee?  How about a new perspective?  This happened when I bought a soldier a cup of coffee through <a title="Green Beans  Cup of Joe program" href="https://www.greenbeanscoffee.com/coj/">Cup of Joe</a>.  In a <a title="The Strongest Coffee In The World" href="http://ginaleftthemall.com/2012/09/04/the-strongest-coffee-in-the-world/">post about the program</a>, I included my message that went with the coffee and his reply. It was this soldier that gave me a new outlook.</p>
<p><em>Dear Soldier,  A cup of coffee is pretty small to be a present.  So what I really want to give you for Christmas is the certainty that you are not forgotten.  And to know how grateful I am for your service. I&#8217;m from NYC and whether my day is crazy good or bad, I get to live it in peace. Your hard work and sacrifice gives me that gift.  Thank you for all you do. I wish you a merry, happy and safe holiday. Gina</em></p>
<p>Thank you so much Gina. It is Christmas Eve and guess what?  You are the first person to give me a present <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   And a cup of coffee is NOT too small to be a present.  It is just fine. My name is SFC _____ and I&#8217;ve been in Afghanistan for almost 7 months. I have seen some things I hope to forget but I have some things I hope I never forget.  As it is Christmas Eve I am just trying to be thankful to have a place like the U.S. to go back to with nice people like you who care enough to give me a cup of coffee. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Thanks again, ____</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll call this soldier &#8220;Gibbs&#8221; for reasons that will soon become clear.</p>
<p><strong>The question</strong></p>
<p>Gibbs and I became pen pals.  It&#8217;s not always easy to think of things to write to a stranger. So I&#8217;d ask questions.  Most people love animals so I&#8217;d ask about pets.  Or, &#8220;did you ever break a bone?&#8221;  Often, there is some funny childhood mishap involved.  One time I asked Gibbs what his most incredible experience in the Army was.  What was his favorite memory?</p>
<p>My stealth motive for asking that was to boost his morale.  I figured recalling some positive experiences would be&#8230;..positive.  I didn&#8217;t expect the stunning answer I received in return. It was emotionally powerful and the imagery he used&#8230; well, I felt like I was there.  After I told him how amazing it was, I suggested he print out what he wrote and save it for his kids.</p>
<p>GIBBS:  No. I don&#8217;t want to share it.  In fact, I&#8217;ve never shared that with anyone before.</p>
<p>ME:  Why?</p>
<p>GIBBS: No one ever asked me that question before.  Besides, I don&#8217;t want to glamorize war.  I went to war so my kids and your Sofia won&#8217;t have to.  No war for them.</p>
<p>ME:  Understood.  Big fan of peace.  But what about when your kids are grown so they can know you better?  You told me your dad was a Vietnam Vet.  Is this story the kind of thing you wish you knew about him?</p>
<p>GIBBS:  Yeah. I wish I would&#8217;ve known.</p>
<p>ME:  So you&#8217;ll save it for them.</p>
<p>GIBBS:  No.</p>
<p>ME:  Well, what about the Library of Congress? I think you can do it anonymously. They are collecting soldier stories.</p>
<p>GIBBS:  Gina, you have to understand, in my real world I don&#8217;t talk a lot.  With you&#8230;you&#8217;re not going run into anyone I know so, it&#8217;s okay. Nothing is going to bite me in the ass.  But in real life, I&#8217;m like Gibbs (from the TV show NCIS.)</p>
<p>ME:  Okay, so the one person you shared this incredibly moving story with is a total stranger you will never meet in real life?</p>
<p>GIBBS: Yes.</p>
<p>As a woman, a mom, and a writer (I&#8217;m in a communications field!) this made me crazy. But it&#8217;s not about me, is it?  This is about letting him chat or vent and just being supportive. So I dropped it.  Knowing how much his privacy meant, I deleted the email.  And I&#8217;ve never repeated what he told me.  But his story is an indelible memory that I have the honor of carrying.  In my heart, I hope he did share it with someone in his real world. Because I think he is worth knowing and I&#8217;m rooting for him in every way.</p>
<p><strong>Payback</strong></p>
<p>Along with the coffee and emails, I sent him a few care packages.  One was &#8220;dinner and a show.&#8221; That consisted of 1 can of soup, some candy for dessert and a DVD of his favorite TV show, NCIS.  I admit the DVD was more money than I normally spend on a care package.  But they had some bad days and I knew he&#8217;d really like it so, I sent it.   As his deployment drew to a close, he told me he wanted to pay me back for the DVD.  I told him if he sent me money I would hunt him down and &#8220;put the hurt on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>GIBBS:  Lol&#8230;Okay, if you won&#8217;t take money, what about this?  What about my Unit patch that I&#8217;ve worn this whole deployment?  It&#8217;s been through a lot and I&#8217;d like you to have it.</p>
<p>ME:  Don&#8217;t you want to save that for someone in your real world?</p>
<p>GIBBS:  I would like you to have it because you were the one who was here with me.</p>
<p>ME:  Tell you what, I will accept it and hold it for you.  If you ever change your mind you can have it back.</p>
<p>When it arrived I held it and thought, of all the places this patch has been, the most unlikely is probably the palm of my hand in my little corner of Manhattan.  I decided to carry it in my wallet and use it as a &#8220;perspective check&#8221;.  When I have one of those days where I get caught up by the small annoyances,  a bad commute, someone rude in the checkout line&#8230;what have you,  I can look at it and remember.  I remember there are worse things and places.   I remember to be grateful for the good in my life.  And when I face the big challenges, I can look at it then too.  I look at it and remember to have courage. Because I am holding proof right there in my hand that difficult times can be overcome.  And I got all that with one <a title="Green Beans Cup of Joe" href="https://www.greenbeanscoffee.com/coj/">$2 cup of coffee.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stonecoastfacultyblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tennis-net1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-257" title="tennis-net" alt="" src="http://stonecoastfacultyblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tennis-net1.png?w=300&#038;h=284" height="284" width="300" /></a>I’m an avid tennis player, so last summer when one of my partners canceled our game at the last minute, I thought I would get some extra practice by hitting shots against the wall of a nearby handball court.  Yet, after a few minutes of hitting, I became frustrated.  The reason?  I couldn’t tell whether my shots were any good because there was no net.</p>
<p>While in the middle of a heated tennis match, I don&#8217;t exactly feel warmth for the net, particularly when it snags a ball that would have been a brilliant winning shot against my opponent.  In fact, in such cases, I have been known to give that net a good hard smack with my racquet.</p>
<p>And yet once the net was gone, I keenly felt its absence.</p>
<p><span id="more-255"></span>Writing without rejection is like playing tennis without a net—it&#8217;s just not the same game. Actually, it&#8217;s not the game at all.  I’m not just saying that rejection is a helpful tool for writers.  In fact, the business of rejection and the business of writing are one and the same.</p>
<p>This is what writers do.  We invite rejection into our lives.  Constantly.  If you&#8217;re not getting rejected, you&#8217;re not a writer.  You&#8217;re a hobbyist.</p>
<p>Rejection can take any number of useful forms.  Consider the case of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9668330/Philip-Roth-announces-his-retirement.html" target="_blank">Philip Roth</a>, perennial candidate for the imaginary title of Greatest Living American Writer.  Before the beginning of the `90s, he was certainly a respected figure, but I would argue more for the work he’d done in the past, like <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em> and <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em>.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, Roth took a sudden roaring leap back to relevance with a string of books—including <em>Sabbath’s Theater</em>,<em> The Human Stain</em>, and <em>American Pastoral</em>, which finally won him that Pulitzer he’d kept getting rejected for—that put him squarely back in the limelight and earned him a fan base with a younger generation of readers.</p>
<p>Since then, there has not been a great deal of rejection in Roth’s life, and perhaps as a consequence, his books have become somewhat more pale and less vivid.  After all, what editor would dare to say to the great Philip Roth, “You know, I really appreciate the quality of the prose, but there’s something missing here that makes this piece just not right for us.”</p>
<p>I make it my goal to get rejected 100 times a year.  Otherwise, I know I&#8217;m either not sending out my work at all, or else I’m not aiming high enough, only applying for things I know I&#8217;ll get instead of challenging myself to reach higher, dare more.</p>
<p>Of course, hearing “no” over and over can get wearying and sometimes I backslide. Too nervous about the prospect of failure to risk success, I’ll hide my work from the world.  And yet I find that when I do go for my 100 rejections, I’ll also get 6 or 7 acceptances in venues I’d have otherwise never dreamed of approaching.  When I retrench into silence, I get an equal number of rejections and acceptances: zero.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the gift that rejection brings.  With rejection, I’m a real writer.  Without it, I’m all by myself, hitting balls meaninglessly against a concrete wall.</p>

From Brooklyn.” I got some curious/skeptical looks from the audience, but my dance card was full for the rest of the afternoon. Apparently, there’s some novelty to showing the new girl how to dance. Watch your toes.</p>
<p>The same is true of watching football at Tiger Stadium. Instead of putting a ribbon in my hair and driving myself to the dance, I bought student season tickets and a girl-cut LSU jersey. Both gestures felt something like getting ready for a coming-out party.</p>
<p>At first (the start of the 2011 season), I mostly sat in the student section, with other grad students. (These were almost all guys; I’ve only convinced two women to join me in two season). Then, via a powerful friend of a friend’s uncle, I found myself tailgating with about half the Louisiana State Cabinet for the Florida game. I met Governor Jindal in the breezeway to the field. He liked my jersey. Guess I’d picked right.</p>
<p>For that game, the aforementioned powerful friend delivered us to the sixth row of sorority seating, right around the 20 yard line. We wedged in amongst the sisters with apologetic smiles; by the third quarter we were new best friends.</p>
<p>“I’m interested in writing about sports culture.” It was a few months before the start of the 2012 season, and I said as much in the office of Bill Demastes, contemporary drama professor and LSU’s new Faculty Athletic Representative (FAR). He gave me the encouragement, the connections, and the independent study credit to get Gameday Debutante off the ground. He also gave me a ticket to the first game of the season. We sat in his new FAR seats. “Oh, too bad they&#8217;re not on the 50,” he quipped when we found them. They were on the 49.</p>
<p>As part of my research, I got a second-tier press pass &#8212; access to the press box, but no assigned seat. Fortunately, I found an empty seat next to Joe May, former assistant football and track coach. Joe should be turning 80 any day now, but he’s kept up the muscle in his right &#8212; javelin throwing &#8212; arm. “SEC champion,” he let me know, flexing his bicep. We mostly watched the game intently, but when things got interesting, I was the closest audience letting off steam &#8211;“We need a first down like a dead man needs a coffin” was one of his favorite lines. During halftime, he introduced me around to the other press-box octogenarians, including LSU’s oldest beat writer, Ted Castillo.</p>
<p>Bill and I spent another game together, this time from the corner of the chancellor’s booth. It was a good view, about 100 feet above his regular seats. I met the athletic director and his wife, the chancellor, and a handful of other people whose names you see in the newspaper. But mostly, Bill and I &#8212; the only folks in the whole place in blue jeans &#8212; kept our heads down and talked department politics, LSU offense, and what to write about next.</p>
<p>The last game of the season I watched from a new vantage, the east-side suites of Tiger Stadium, as a guest of Jim Engster and his publishing group. The afternoon sun was fierce for November and the competitor, Ole Miss, stayed closer than I would’ve liked. We talked during breaks in the action, but kept our squinted eyes on the game while the ball was in play. Other than the sun, the corporate suites are different than the west side in two important ways: booze and china. Walking down the hall, I saw nameplates for most all the major players in South Louisiana. I can’t be certain, but I’m pretty sure it was Shaw that had a double-wide spot at midfield.</p>
<p>I’ve used the “I’m not from here” excuse many times since Whiskey River &#8212; dancing at Phil Brady’s and Café Des Amis, Festivals Acadiens and International, Blackpot and Jazz Fest &#8212; and just about every time I sit down for a football game. I’m still a cruddy dancer, and confused by some penalty calls, but it doesn’t seem to matter. Everyone I’ve met is willing to dance a number and talk football.</p>
<p>The kindness of strangers might be a southern cliché, but  down here dancing and football are ways of life. Step onto the dance floor and they’ll gladly give you a lesson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never intended my professional career to end up with editing obituaries. “Who did you offend?” my colleagues wondered as I was scheduled to the shift week after week. Yes, it’s a job I could have done straight out of high school, forget the university honors or political science degree and urban studies certificate or my writing skills as a novelist and poet. It’s an almost paint-by-the-numbers task, converting the text families or funeral home directors fancy into a format my employer demanded (at least until recently) – and I was caught in the middle. Yet, make an error in an obituary, and the family remembers for decades, so precision is essential. On top of it, many nights are pressed for time – I needed eight minutes, minimum, for the actually editing, but had only six or even four, interrupted by phone calls. Mistakes will happen. Then it’s on to do the paginating, the puzzle of fitting the obits around the advertisements on the page and sending it on to the presses. Again, there’s no room for error – they’ve already been cut to specification.</p>
<p>Much of the work is repetitive. “WWII” becomes “World War II,” the year after a date takes a closing comma, as does the state after a city, and there’s a hyphen in “great-grandchildren” – these are things few people do in their submissions. Others turn up with alarming repetition: “formally of” a town, rather that “formerly,” or “internment” or rather than “interment” will take place. Things I must fix before getting down to the basic form itself.</p>
<p>Then there are the out-of-focus portraits, made worse by electronic submission. Nothing can make a bad photograph any better, but nobody will be convinced of that. They’re upset if you won’t run it, so you do and let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>I wasn’t alone in criticizing my newspaper’s obituary policy. For a long time, we charged a flat fee for a services section at the end, and considered the rest a news story, albeit limited to two hundred words. For many readers, however, the news interest is in knowing where to go for the calling hours or memorial service. The life story and family members are of more interest to the family scrapbook than to the general readership, and therein lies the friction.</p>
<p>What many really want to see in print is a eulogy – the funeral oration or at least an encyclopedic history of the deceased and family, where the tone is more addressing the deceased than the public. In contrast, journalism, as in a news story, demands “Smith” on the second reference – or in the case of an obituary, “Mr. Smith” – not “Joe” and not “Mary.” We’re not interested if he married “the love of his life,” since that cannot be corroborated, only the marriage date and location. We don’t use euphemisms such as “passed away,” but stick to “died.” Never mind the family’s desire to say she “went to spend eternity with her Lord and Master,” “quietly slipped into spiritual abyss,” “went home” or “to her heavenly home,” or that he “ventured forth to the Happy Hunting Ground” or “sensing a favorable tide, he set out on his final voyage” (what? The body was floated out to sea?). Paraphrasing the Bard, we’re not here to praise Caesar, but to tell the world he’s dead. Nor are we here to be cute or clever. When the submission includes phrases like “beloved wife” or “loving father,” I recall a Brethren minister declaring she’d never again do another funeral for someone she doesn’t know, with its implication of having been burned by the gap between some strange family’s projected image and its underlying reality. Then there’s the cliché, reminding me of those personals ads that say nothing insightful – “enjoyed most spending time with his family.” Doing anything in particular? Or does the family remember nothing? “She will always be remembered,” although people will forget – quickly. Better to admit, “She is remembered,” and leave it at that.</p>
<p>The out-of-state submissions are often puzzling. Sometimes, the only connection to our circulation area and its readership is that the deceased was born here or has a grandchild living here. Often, no mention is made. I think of the places I’ve lived and know I wouldn’t have my obituary submitted there – not even for the hometown where I lived for two decades. But that’s my own perspective.</p>
<p>Family-submitted obits are often the worst, and not just the ones delivered in nearly illegible handwritten script. There are additional delays and often long-distance phone calls while attempting to confirm the individual’s actually deceased. Without a funeral director’s assistance, the family often makes mistakes that will require later corrections. Should I mention the difficulty of trying to decode tangled syntax? Or one woman trying to call in her own obituary and offended that I wouldn’t accept it? “You’re not dead” seeming to her to be not an issue.</p>
<p>I’d rather we run them as classified advertisements, as the larger papers do. Pay for what you want. If you want to name all of the spouses of the children and grandchildren, you get to, unlike our longtime policy. My fear was that under our traditional practice, we were only offending people, especially those expecting something more for free. As it stood, nobody was really happy with this – not even me – and it’s too easy to lose a longtime subscriber’s loyalty here.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people go to great lengths not to include the age of the deceased, and it’s not always for women. He was a war veteran or they were married for fifty years, and that’s the best you can do. At times, especially for elderly people, the family is uncertain of the birth date, year, or place.</p>
<p>As I go, I also find myself reading between the lines. Signs of family tension are hinted when parents or wives are not mentioned, or there are children whose location is apparently unknown – or are listed as nothing more than “children.” Sometimes a spouse is reported living in a separate town or city, and I’ll leave that in. A sister writes from another state to request a copy of the obituary, and I see she’s not listed among the survivors. The ex-spouse and her children are named before the current wife, and his children with her are not named. As one small-town police officer told me, his department was never called out to a disturbance at the monthly New England contradance – unlike weddings and funerals, where drunken brawls break out. New Hampshire is, by most measures, a conservative state, and yet I’m struck by the number of families that want to name same-gender couples among the survivors or by fundamentalist churches having funerals for members survived by live-in companions. Between the lines, the changing social fabric becomes apparent. Listening to the police radio scanner, I’ve quipped that someone is a “live-in girlfriend” until they’ve had two kids together, and then she becomes a “fiancee.” But what does one make of “his fiancee of twenty years,” as if that’s an honor? The legal distinctions are blurring.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we come across a memorable description, a tellingly honest detail. “He hated weeding” is one of our favorites. Quickly, we know the deceased gardened seriously, and can sympathize. This is reality. As is the unintentional confession, “She enjoyed watching television and playing bingo,” as her major accomplishments.</p>
<p>I’ll admit finding the deaths of infants emotionally difficult to handle, especially in the confines of our format. Sometimes a family’s financial poverty is apparent, or one sees that it has lost other children, or even that the couple saw the child as a kind of fashion accessory deserving a celebration at a local nightclub. In contrast, I recall the experience Penny Armstrong tells in <em>A Midwife’s Story</em>, after losing the first child in more than a thousand Amish birthings, and the unexpected support she received from the funeral director. I feel grief and anxiety, too, handling obituaries for youths the ages of my own stepchildren – a parent’s awareness of the perils they face daily – and am grateful we’ve not had to conduct such a memorial service in my own congregation. On the other end, as we’re reminded, the death of an old person who has served well is no tragedy and can be an occasion for celebratory remembering.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether an obituary fills only half of one column or spills across three, there’s a basic tension between a family’s perspective and that of the editor or reader. For the family, it’s the only obituary of importance – and offense is easily perceived, especially in any comparison to the others, which is the reason for the tight formatting in the first place. One person has more siblings than another, for beginners, or more education or military service, for another. Never mind there are another thirty obituaries that day, and not all of them can be at the top of the page or have a usable photograph. (I’m repeatedly amazed by the out-of-focus shots families provide, without realizing the image cannot be improved.) The reader, in contrast, scans the page; few read every obituary; most turn only to people they’ve known.</p>
<p>Having genealogy as a hobby provides me with other insights into obituaries. I wonder what someone reading this fifty or a hundred years from now will be needing. The location of the hospital, for instance, or the telling detail. My wife and stepdaughters wonder what vanity prompts people to want to proclaim an individual’s accomplishments after the fact, arguing that those who are interested already know them. But I respect the concept of an eternal Book of Life and the human desire for one’s existence to add up to something meaningful and good. That is, the obituary turns into a quest for meaning in life, though I am among those who believe that search belongs elsewhere. Even so, over the decades, the structure and tone of obituaries have changed, and for those of us seeking clues into the personality of our ancestors, these particulars can be priceless. There was a time when families recorded a person’s parting words or when visitors coming from a distance were listed. Sometimes it’s simply high-blown language or a courtly turn of phrase. Even the boilerplate selected can be telling, as in one saying she was always a great beauty, even in her old age. The researcher becomes frustrated when the parents or place of birth are not listed. As an editor, I chuckle, seeing grammatical or obvious reporting errors I’m constantly fixing today while cursing a widespread decline in literacy.</p>
<p>There’s one exercise I’d like to commend – one I first heard about as an assignment for high school students, and something one might try with teenagers in religious education classes or retreats. It’s writing one’s own obituary. What would you like to see as your life accomplishments? How do you identify yourself and your surroundings? What is most important to you? This procedure can be a tonic to a society that celebrates youth and celebrity; instead, this attempt embraces the underlying mortality and lifts up the central values one wants to pursue in the conduct of one’s life. I think of reporters coming back from the assignment of updating obituaries prepared in advance for prominent citizens; inevitably, they tell everyone in the newsroom how delightful the conversation was.</p>
<p>In all of this, I try not to disclose that my own faith discipline discourages the use of calling hours and urges simple burial and memorial services, rather than elaborate funerals. If the coffin is in the room during the service, its lid is to be closed. I am one who finds the old funeral hymns to be far more beautiful and moving than any Christmas carol. When I look at an obituary, I would rather it proclaimed, like the hymn, “This is my story, this is my song,” while demonstrating the ways that life actively went “praising my Savior all the day long.” I might even close it with an altar call. But there are lines I don’t cross in a professional career. I wait for the other opportunities.</p>

<p>For a year and a half, sometime back in the mid-1990s, I lived and worked in <a title="Pusan" href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Pusan" target="_blank">Pusan</a>, South Korea. I had a fabulous time there and think very fondly of the country and the people I met there. Immersing oneself in a foreign culture can be a very eye-opening experience, and sometimes it&#8217;s the little things that stand out: how Koreans use two hands when shaking or handing something to a person in order to show respect, how English words and phrases were used in very random ways on products and shirts and store names, how the public telephones all had a &#8220;report a spy&#8221; button, how&#8211;long before cell phones became ubiquitous here&#8211;my junior high school students in Korea seemed to all have pagers. At the time I was there, I was a beer-lover, but with only a few years of legal drinking experience under my belt, I was definitely a neo-phyte. Still, I had to try Korean beers. I found them&#8230; uh, <em>lacking</em>I guess would be the best way to put it. Standard, mass-produced lagers. Not worth writing home about, even to someone who&#8211;at the time&#8211;thought of <a title="Leinie's Red" href="https://leinie.com/Beers.aspx#redlager" target="_blank">Leinie&#8217;s Red </a>as somewhat exotic. One thing that did strike me as noteworthy, though, was that Korean beers only ever came in bomber-sized bottles. They were probably some metric quantity as opposed to 22 oz., but the point is that they were more than one serving in a single bottle.</p>
<div id="attachment_454" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ob.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-454" title="OB" alt="" src="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ob.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" height="300" width="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Korea&#8217;s finest? Probably not.</p></div>
<p>Why did this fact stand out to me? Well, back in the mid-1990s, that bottle size was rare for American beers. Colt 45, perhaps the King of Shame in the American beer court, was the only widely available large format beer available. Keep in mind that the plethora of craft breweries we have now did not exist then. The microbreweries that were in operation then either didn&#8217;t sell in Wisconsin where I could get them or they primarily produced packs of 12 or 16 oz. bottles because that was what people expected. So why did Korea have mostly large format as the default bottle size? Because of culture.</p>
<p><a href="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cowboy_1024.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-461" title="Cowboy_1024" alt="" src="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cowboy_1024.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112" height="112" width="150" /></a>Mainstream American culture is individualistic. That is, the individual is the smallest functional operative in cultural identity. We have a &#8220;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&#8221; mentality. Our cultural heroes are often individuals who buck the trends and stand out, carving their own paths, making their own rules. The lonesome cowboy, the rugged individual. When that cowboy wants to drink, he pops open a single-serve bottle of beer. He&#8217;ll drink when he wants to, dammit, whether or not there&#8217;s another cowpoke with him. After all, it&#8217;s a big, wide-open country with lots of desolate, empty areas.</p>
<div id="attachment_460" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 111px"><a href="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/confucius21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-460 " title="confucius2" alt="" src="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/confucius21.jpg?w=101&#038;h=150" height="150" width="101" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Confucius</p></div>
<p>Mainstream Korean culture is collectivistic. The family is the smallest functional operative unit in cultural identity. Korea follows a Confucian model, where there are a series of loyalties and responsibilities, such as children must obey parents and teachers. Don&#8217;t tell me we have that here, too, because it&#8217;s not the same &#8212; Teachers in Korea have AUTHORITY. Parents can and do make decisions for the children even after their children reach adulthood. One&#8217;s identity springs from to whom and to what you belong: your family, your job, etc. Also important in the shaping of Korean culture is the fact that the country is approximately the same size as Wisconsin, yet it has around 50 million people compared to Wisconsin&#8217;s 5 million or so. And Korea is quite mountainous and, generally, people don&#8217;t build homes or apartments on the mountains. So&#8230;less elbow room. Being alone, especially in public, strikes some Koreans as a bit strange. Drinking alone in public? Even stranger. Of course you will be drinking with your friends or colleagues or family, so beer needs to come in a bottle for you to share! (Oh, and you shouldn&#8217;t pour your own glass; that&#8217;s just unseemly. Make sure to fill up any of your companion&#8217;s empty glasses.)</p>
<p>It struck me just last week when I was rifling through our beer cellar that at least half of the beer Mr. NN and I buy nowadays is large format. Craft brewers do still make beer in 4- and 6-packs of 12 oz. bottles (or sometimes a 4-pack of 16 oz. bottles), but they put their special beers in bottles to share. If you are a responsible beer-drinker, you don&#8217;t see a bomber or a 750ml and think, &#8220;Okay, that one is all mine.&#8221; (Okay, you might think that, but then you might want to attend an AA meeting later on.) How amazing is that? The size of the bottle affects your social life &#8212; if you want that tasty beverage, you need to find someone to share it with you. That one change is bringing beer to the table around which a community sits. The Koreans had that figured out long, long ago. (Sadly, I see now that OB Lager, one of the predominant Korean beer companies&#8211; no relation to the tampon company &#8212; now sells single-serving bottles. Their culture is shifting, too.)</p>
<div id="attachment_462" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cigar_1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-462" title="cigar_1" alt="" src="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cigar_1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112" height="112" width="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visual approximation of my homebrew</p></div>
<p>So Thanksgiving was last week, and many Americans found themselves sitting around a table with their community. For my part, I share a 750ml of Smokin&#8217; Jack, my smoked pumpkin beer. Sadly, there was no pumpkin pie to have with it. (Can it really be Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie? Jury&#8217;s still out on that one.) The next day, I did all my Black Friday shopping at <a title="Rogers Park Fine Wine &amp; Spirits" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/rogers-park-fine-wine-and-spirits-chicago" target="_blank">Rogers Park Fine Wine &amp; Spirits </a>in Chicago. They had several <a title="Dogfish Head" href="http://www.dogfish.com/" target="_blank">Dogfish Head </a>beers and I bought them all: <a title="Sah-Tea" href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occassional-rarities/sahtea-0.htm" target="_blank">Sah-Tea</a>, <a title="Namaste" href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occassional-rarities/namaste.htm" target="_blank">Namaste</a>, <a title="Theobroma" href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occassional-rarities/theobroma.htm" target="_blank">Theobroma</a>, <a title="Black &amp; Blue" href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occassional-rarities/black-blue.htm" target="_blank">Black &amp; Blue</a>, <a title="Ta Henket" href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occasional-rarities/ta-henket.htm" target="_blank">Ta&#8217;Henket</a>, and a 4-pack of Chicory Stout. We also picked up bombers of a <a title="Pipeworks" href="http://www.pipeworksbrewing.net/#!__master" target="_blank">Pipeworks</a> beer (Chicago-based) and <a title="Uinta" href="http://www.uintabrewing.com/" target="_blank">Uinta</a> (Utah-based), both unavailable here in Minnesota. Some of these, Mr. NN and I will just be sharing with each other. Others, we will invite friends over to enjoy &#8212; and by buying these beers, those plans are already cooking in our brains.</p>
<div id="attachment_455" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 202px"><a href="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wp_001722.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-455 " title="sah-tea" alt="" src="http://ninkasisniece.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wp_001722.jpg?w=192&#038;h=300" height="300" width="192" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Artsy label, artsy beer, artsy event: The Trifecta.</p></div>
<p>Alas, I almost had a moment of Scrooge McDuck-itude. A friend of ours invited us to an artistic performance gathering that was part holiday party and part cabaret. We were told that people usually bring something to eat (vegetarian only) or something to drink. Other than our one friend, we would know no one else. Mr. NN insisted that we bring a beer, but we didn&#8217;t think about it until it was time to leave our hotel. The only things chilled were a couple of Dogfish Head beers &#8212; ones that cost $15 per bottle. We would only be able to get another Dogfish Head the next time we came to Chicago, which is usually only a once or twice yearly event. Reluctantly, I agreed to part with the Sah-Tea, knowing that at least Mr. NN and I would get a taste of it. This beer is DH&#8217;s version of a traditional Finnish beer called &#8220;sahti&#8221; which is brewed with juniper berries. DH also uses rye and then &#8212; in a stroke of brilliance &#8212; adds black chai. Finland meets India in a bottle, basically. It was wonderful, a rich farmhouse-type of body with the zing of juniper which pairs well with the cardamom and ginger in the chai seasoning. Yes, I would be sad that I would have less than my usual portion of this incredible beer, having to give up the rest to strangers&#8230;.</p>
<p>But then I heard and saw the reaction of those strangers. These were not Bud Lite-swigging fools, they were people who appreciated craft. These strangers enjoyed our beer, and some of them were no longer strangers by the end of the evening. That is the magic of good beer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve bitten off more than I can chew.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on writing about my favorite place in the world: <a class="zem_slink" title="Kauai" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=22.0833333333,-159.5&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=22.0833333333,-159.5 (Kauai)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Kaua&#8217;i</a>. In a way, it is a simple essay to write; the scenery is gorgeous, adventures prolific and the cultural history is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Words fail me.</p>
<p>This place means so much to me that I find it indescribable. The blend of beauty, power and the socio-economic struggles of this place make it more complex than describing the dysfunctionality of your own family lineage, with a touch of racism and politics on the side. There is so much more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it; Kaua&#8217;i is beautiful. Over a million visitors pour into the airports of the Garden Isle each year, mostly congregating to areas such as <a href="http://www.poipubeach.org/accommodations.html">Po&#8217;ipu</a> and <a href="http://princeville-vacations.com/">Princeville</a>. They drive up to <a href="http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/kauai/index.cfm?park_id=7">Koke&#8217;e </a>to visit the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d219643-Reviews-Kalalau_Lookout-Kauai_Hawaii.html">Kalalau lookout</a>, perhaps hike to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakapiai_Beach">Hanakapi&#8217;ai beach</a>, maybe even breach their car rental agreement and drive to <a class="zem_slink" title="Polihale State Park" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=22.0925,-159.75&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=22.0925,-159.75 (Polihale%20State%20Park)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Polihale State Park</a>. They return home to tell their friends and families how beautiful it is and how much less crowded it is than <a class="zem_slink" title="Oahu" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=21.4666666667,-157.983333333&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=21.4666666667,-157.983333333 (Oahu)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Oahu</a> (because tourists hate being around other tourists.)</p>
<p>This is where it gets complicated. This is where issues of localism, environment, culture and tourism blur between lines of a profoundly complicated history. This is where my role on the island becomes complicated as well.</p>
<p>I am a traveler. I am a tourist.</p>
<p>But I am also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama'aina">kama&#8217;aina</a> of these islands. They continue to teach me to carry this feeling of respect and humility where ever I go.</p>
<div id="attachment_376" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://roadlessgraveled.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/26nov2012respect.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-376" title="Respect" alt="" src="http://roadlessgraveled.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/26nov2012respect.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" height="768" width="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A good reminder on the top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giant_(Kauai)">Sleeping Giant</a>, Kauai.</p></div>
<p>Kauai has taught me so much about culture, life, light and aloha. I&#8217;ve gained practical skills like learning to read the ocean, how to rock hop up mossy boulders to secret waterfalls, and I can pretty much understand <a class="zem_slink" title="Hawaiian Pidgin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Pidgin" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Hawaiian pidgin</a>.</p>
<p>It has also taught me how to be <em>a good tourist</em>.</p>
<p>The longer I spend time in the Hawaiian Islands, the more I realize how much I have to learn about these volcanic rocks in the middle of the ocean and the people who inhabit them. I&#8217;ve dedicated my time to learning about the cultural and ecological history of this evolutionarily unique place, only to realize that my knowledge equates to a small fraction of all there is to learn. This place that I opened my heart to learning about, has taught me how much I don&#8217;t know. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this is one of the most important lessons one can learn as a tourist.</p>
<p>Never assume you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the outdoors and teaching people about local culture. Although I love both these things, I never idealized being a tour guide. You could say tourism chose me. I&#8217;ve worked as a server, a zip-line tour guide, crewing boats and giving snorkel tours on Maui and Kauai. I&#8217;ve seen tourism at its best and worst.</p>
<p>The bests are easy: people who genuinely care about the islands. They want to learn as they travel. They find the <a class="zem_slink" title="Culture of Hawaii" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Hawaii" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Hawaiian culture</a> fascinating. They see the dichotomy of a stolen land which was once self-sufficient and now barely survives on tourism. They appreciate the natural surrounding not as an amusement park built for people but as beautiful land and ocean that allows us to drink water, breathe air. Yes, these are the best kind of tourists.</p>
<p>The worst kind of tourists are the ones that make your skin crawl. You know you&#8217;ve seen them. Maybe you&#8217;ve even been one. They can frequently be seen standing in the middle of oncoming traffic, taking a picture of a chicken. They pack their suitcases and leave their brains at home. Everything they see is there to perform for them. They have no concept of island time and are in a hurry although they are on vacation (wouldn&#8217;t want to miss dinner reservations.) They planned this trip solely so they can brag later to their friends. They want everything to be like home but different. They came here because things are different, but it makes them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And they want to know why.</p>
<div id="attachment_375" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 480px"><a href="http://roadlessgraveled.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tourists-cartoon.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-375" title="Tourists!" alt="" src="http://roadlessgraveled.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tourists-cartoon.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look chickens!!!</p></div>
<p>This is the part where I will give examples of all the idiotic questions tourists have asked my friends and I who work in tourism. Disclaimer: there&#8217;s no harm in asking questions. In reality, it all comes from not knowing. Curiosity is fine. The problem is that many people don&#8217;t think before they ask.</p>
<p>Let me enlighten you.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Q: Does the water go all the way around the island?</p>
<p>A: Yes, that is the definition of an island.</p>
<p><em>Did you attend elementary school?</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Q: What time do you turn the waterfalls on?</p>
<p>A: Um, nobody is really in charge of that.</p>
<p><em>I guess it depends how much it&#8217;s been raining&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Q: So what holds up the islands?</p>
<p>A: Sea turtles, dude. (inwardly laughing)</p>
<p><em>I could go into details of the geologic concept that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Hawaiian Islands" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=19.5666666667,-155.5&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=19.5666666667,-155.5%20(Hawaiian%20Islands)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Hawaiian archipelago</a> is a volcanic island chain, but your head might explode.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Q: So do you live here?</p>
<p>A: Yes, I work where I live.</p>
<p><em>Either that or I take my private jet to the mainland everyday.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to ask questions, but don&#8217;t do it with a sense of entitlement. Every time these questions are asked, it is because they feel like they deserve to know.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a hint: be a tactful tourist. Know that you don&#8217;t know. Believe me, you will see far more if you don&#8217;t have your head up your ass.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>“<em>Cheater!!</em>” Mr ET shouted, as I emerged into the living room.</p>
</div>
<p>“<em>What?</em>” I shot back. I was completely taken off guard by his reaction. I was standing before him in my chic outfit paired with green wedge suede shoes.</p>
<div>
<p>“<em>That’s new!!</em>” he bellowed.</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>” I shot back, defensively and confused.</p>
</div>
<p>“T<em>hat dress. I’ve never seen that dress,</em>” he explained.</p>
<div>
<p>I was being falsely accused.</p>
<p>“<em>It’s not new, I swear!</em>” I began to plead with him.</p>
</div>
<p>“<em>I don’t know, I’ve never seen it,</em>” he continued as he skeptically circled me.</p>
<div>
<p>“<em>I…I don’t know why you’ve never seen it</em>,” I said, turning slowly, following his gaze, “<em>I suppose I forgot I owned it. I’m not cheating.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Are you sure?</em>” he questioned.</p>
<p>“<em>Honestly, I think I’ve owned it longer than we’re been together,</em> “ I implored, pleading my case.</p>
<p>The truth is Mr. ET had a point. I have previously lied about shopping.</p>
</div>
<p>This adorable shift dress, with its subtle elephant stencils decorating the top and its bright yellow skirt was without a doubt memorable. He certainly had a point; this number was certainly unforgettable so why had <i>I </i>forgotten about it?</p>
<p><a href="http://breakingthecontact.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bottomless-pit.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-250" title="bottomless pit" alt="" src="http://breakingthecontact.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bottomless-pit.jpeg?w=142&#038;h=300" height="300" width="142" /></a>It had gotten lost at the back of my wardrobe, only to be discovered a few weeks ago during my big sweep of my closets and drawers. Less is more. The cliché clearly holds some truth as I now see the benefit of having less in my closet. Less allows for choice. I whittled down and donated half of my possessions, from shoes to dresses and I now have more options available to choose from. Finally able to see what I own, I’ve been walking out of the apartment in different ensembles. When the closet was full, I was left with no choice, always choosing among the first few items on the rack. Everything else was out of sight. According to research, the same <a title="Order Effect" href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=va7XOSAWZTMC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Dr.+Susan+Weinschenk,+order+effect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1m3XceJHYi&amp;sig=xt5bIG-kXLlUQi9psK0Q-PqFTbc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F-qyUIOZCcmx0AGgtYDgAg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr.%20Susan%20Weinschenk%2C%20order%20effect&amp;f=false" target="_blank">order effect</a> influences whom you vote for at the ballot box. <a title="Voting ballot order." href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~marcmere/workingpapers/BallotOrder.pdf" target="_blank">Studies</a> found that in one out of every 10 elections, the first name on the ballot will win just because it’s first. They also calculated that being in the middle of the list lowers your chance of winning. Ouch! Another reason my elephant dress wasn’t a first pick.</p>
<p>Our ability to consciously process a certain amount of information at a time is small and the time we give to that process is even smaller. Think of it this way, <a href="http://www.theteamw.com/blog/" target="_blank">we handle 40,000,000 pieces of information every second, but only 40 of those make it to our conscious brains</a>. I think back to when I would peek into my closet and pick amongst the first items within sight. The clutter and constant disorder deterred me from wearing the items at the back. I couldn’t consciously process them, so I opted for the easy picks and grabbing what was available in the front. I continued to shop, for various reasons, but I can now see that as my closet grew, the new purchases covered the older items and it just snow balled. No wonder I felt as if I had nothing nice to wear, my wardrobe was self-imploding.</p>
<p>Speaking of picking the easy options, we, actually most primates, are genetically hardwired to take shortcuts. The shorter alternative route is always sought as we do our best to conserve our energy; we conduct our activities of daily living (think food, sex, shelter) by exerting the minimum energy needed to do the tasks and no more. I begin to see how the energy I expended sorting through the mess in my wardrobe could be used elsewhere. I had to lighten the load.</p>
<p>Whittling down our choices in order to facilitate decision-making is certainly not a new concept. Psychologist <a title="Barry Schwartz" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html" target="_blank">Barry Schwartz</a> wrote, “Choice no longer liberates, but debilitates”. Owning nice things isn’t a problem, but it doesn’t mean that owning more beautiful things is necessarily better. The beautiful items in my closet were not being enjoyed simply because they were too many. I came across another writer expressing the same frustration I’ve been experiencing. <a href="http://www.greenconduct.com/blog/2012/08/01/the-problem-with-too-many-choices/" target="_blank">She wrote</a>, <i>I feel that within my own closet I often have too many choices, so I just keep wearing the same shirts every week.</i> I empathize with you, Megan.</p>
<p><i>Trop de choix, tue le choix</i> is a French saying that underlines the enigma of choice. It translates to <i>too many choices kills the choice</i>. We live in a world where there are simply too many options for a simple need. We only use a dime size of it a day, so why are there entire aisles dedicated to toothpaste or shampoo? With so many different scents, colours and varieties, our choice becomes difficult. Something simple becomes trivial and we find ourselves wasting time trying to make sense of the options. Who wouldn’t enjoy making fewer time-consuming and ultimately tedious choices?</p>

<p><strong>Tips to share:</strong></p>
<p>Think of the essentials because if it isn’t of the essence, then there’s no space for it. Stick to the choices that matter, the needs and the reasonable desires. Eliminate the rest.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been good this past month. Only one small slip with a beautiful Guatemalan blouse- funds went directly to the <a href="http://www.tramatextiles.org/catalogue.html" target="_blank">Women’s Association</a>, so I get part marks off, no?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t talk about my faith anymore.</p>
<p>I used to. I used to talk about it a lot.</p>
<p>I used to talk about it all the time, to anyone who would listen, whether they wanted to hear about it or not. Sadly, I learned the hard way that the way I talked about my faith was more divisive than it was holistic. I was more argumentative and pushy than welcoming and joyful, and for many years I gave the wrong impression about my love for God and the love I believe he has for all others.</p>
<p>When I realized this, I simply stopped talking about my faith. I abandoned the catch-phrases I&#8217;d so lovingly used to talk about praying and worship, and I gave up the go-to answers for questions about God and life and challenges. I let go of the ideas that everything had to have a black and white answer and, instead, focused on understanding my beliefs as they blended with all of life&#8217;s shades of grey. I decided to go about living my faith quietly, and speaking of it in small whispers rather than loud taunts.</p>
<p>But there are some days, like today, when the beautiful mysteries of faith and trust and believing just can&#8217;t be kept quiet. There are some days when I get to be home, and fold laundry, and attempt to read research papers, and watch my son sleeping, and kiss my husband goodbye &#8211; and I realize I&#8217;m blessed. I&#8217;m just so blessed. And I turn on a record of hymns and listen to their old familiar words and I let God take me by the hand and dance with me. He hugs me close and pulls me in tight and guides me on my toes around my living room. We dance and we sing and we delight in this simple life&#8217;s calling to follow and find joy. If I could get all the steps right, He wouldn&#8217;t be the one to guide me. If I knew all the words to the songs, He wouldn&#8217;t be the voice in my ear. If I didn&#8217;t need him to hold onto me the way he does, He wouldn&#8217;t be my God.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old familiar song with an old familiar tune that brings me back to an old familiar faith. It&#8217;s simple. It&#8217;s pure. It&#8217;s lovely.</p>
<p>I delight in the dance today.</p>
