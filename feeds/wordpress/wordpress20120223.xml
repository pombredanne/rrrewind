			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:18px;"><strong>We</strong></span> were woken up this morning by the tannoy announcement that we would soon be crossing the arctic circle again, so it was a quick shower followed by a quick rush on to the deck to see us leave the arctic behind. We look all around to try and see the arctic circle but of course we don&#8217;t really know what we&#8217;re looking for, is there maybe a  big red line, like at the airport when you&#8217;re waiting to go through immigration, of course there isn&#8217;t, well not that we saw anyway.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4873' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6896494131"><img title="IMG_4873" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/6896494131_7781bd5215.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4873" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>After floating by the last couple of snow capped islands within the circle we come to the island, and the globe monument on it, that marks the latitude 66° 33′ 44″ and the ship dutifully sounds it&#8217;s horn as we effortlessly move passed on our journey south.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4876' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6896497325"><img title="IMG_4876" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7057/6896497325_965a42e88f.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4876" width="500" height="223" /></a></p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4891' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6896526687"><img title="IMG_4891" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/6896526687_4a8bfeba0b.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4891" width="500" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that we then decided to make our way straight to breakfast rather than go to the &#8216;ceremony&#8217; again, as we later found out that the southbound ceremony is even worse that the one going north. How can it possibly be worse I hear you say, well on the southward leg of the journey they make you drink a spoonful of cod liver oil, that how. As a souvenir they do let you keep the spoon, which is fish shaped and would undoubtedly be forgotten at the bottom of one of those ever overflowing draws that never seem to get emptied until you move. As Steph pointed out, she&#8217;d probably loose it like the one she dropped into her handbag when we flew on Concord!</p>
<p>There was enough time after breakfast to have a wander round deck 6 and take a few more photos before we were due into our next port of call, were we thought we would get off and have a stroll around. Since leaving the arctic the weather seems to have gotten slightly brighter with higher than freezing temperatures so that the ships crew have started hosing deck 6.</p>

<p><a title="View 'IMG_4915' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6896710089"><img title="IMG_4915" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7057/6896710089_0b6b99db01.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4915" width="500" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>As we approach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandnessjøen">Sandnessjoen</a> there are a number of other large vessels already tied up in the harbour, one of which is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statoil">Statoil</a> ship, and judging by the large tower in the middle of the vessel she might even be a drilling ship.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4918' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6896699027"><img title="IMG_4918" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7206/6896699027_6178ef5875.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4918" width="500" height="227" /></a></p>
<p>As we make our way down from deck 6 to deck 4 to disembark we notice some people so desperate for a &#8216;fag&#8217; that they actually go out of their office windows to stand on the roof for their fix of nicotine, rather them than me, particularly as the temperature is well below zero!</p>
<p><img title="IMG_4928" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7045/6898506881_f8ae8c14b7.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4928" width="318" height="500" /></p>
<p>As we disembarked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandnessjøen">Sandnessjoen</a> at 12:30 for an hours sojourn in the town the weather seemed to be turning again and within a few minutes of arriving we were in a near blizzard white out as we walked from the ship up the main street.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4946' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898567899"><img title="IMG_4946" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7178/6898567899_9199317f5c.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4946" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Steph obviously was savouring every moment of the snow, I, on the other hand was trying very hard to protect my equipment, if you know what I mean!</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4949' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6895880777"><img title="IMG_4949" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7186/6895880777_a871bbdd39.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4949" width="500" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>Being a big fan of Dolly I just couldn&#8217;t resist taking the following photo while we were walking up the main street, well you have to don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4934' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898497209"><img title="IMG_4934" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7180/6898497209_66690a88e5.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4934" width="303" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>After getting back onboard the ship we went to the restaurant for a light lunch, OK maybe just lunch would be a better term as there wasn&#8217;t anything light about it. I&#8217;m glad that I decided to take the camera down with me as shortly after leaving the port we went passed the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_syv_søstre">De Syv Sostre</a>&#8216; (the seven sisters), an amazing mountain range.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_4994' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898574701"><img title="IMG_4994" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6898574701_5e5e09982f.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_4994" width="500" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>At first I thought that it was hardly worth going out on deck to photograph them as they were shrouded in mist and cloud, nevertheless I decided to go, and boy was I glad that I did.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5002' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898581123"><img title="IMG_5002" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7043/6898581123_e3006ff967.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5002" width="500" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>As we sailed along the side of them the weather changed again, the mist evaporated, the cloud lifted and the most spectacular views just appeared. If I didn&#8217;t know any better I&#8217;d think that I was in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomites">Dolomites</a>. These are truly magnificent mountains seeming to almost rise out of the sea.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5010' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898660645"><img title="IMG_5010" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7054/6898660645_56c8d0a994.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5010" width="500" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>As if a curtain had risen as we sailed past, as we reach the end of the range down it came again engulfing the last of the peaks in cloud.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5019' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898623237"><img title="IMG_5019" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7191/6898623237_4a75d6d500.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5019" width="500" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>I stayed out on deck for most of the rest of the afternoon taking photos of the ship and the amazing scenery that we continued to pass as we made our way ever southward towards our final destination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen">Bergen</a>.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5013' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898769107"><img title="IMG_5013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/6898769107_e04991ee5d.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5013" width="500" height="238" /></a></p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5030' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898802057"><img title="IMG_5030" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7043/6898802057_6d0bdab3a2.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5030" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Of course I wasn&#8217;t the only one onboard that was taking advantage of the good conditions.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5160' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898823529"><img title="IMG_5160" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7183/6898823529_175b1f7077.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5160" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The sun dipping behind the clouds during the late afternoon provided ample opportunity for some lovely sun-scape photographs.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5183' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898812953"><img title="IMG_5183" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/6898812953_f46e906254.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5183" width="500" height="285" /></a></p>
<p>We arrived at our next port of call, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brønnøysund">Bronnoysund</a>, around quarter past four and stayed for about forty-five minutes, just long enough to actually catch the sunset.</p>
<p><a title="View 'IMG_5227' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91522294@N00/6898850473"><img title="IMG_5227" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/6898850473_f1823d98b4.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_5227" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The light was truly a joy to behold.</p>

<p><span id="more-686"></span><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9793-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-696" title="_MG_9793-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9793-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="389" /></a>On a slightly side note we are also getting his brother &#8230; however as he had caught &#8216;Kitty Flu&#8217; in transit he was still too poorly to come home with his brother Hugo and we will have to wait a few more days for the vet to be sure he is ok before we can collect him &#8230; so his introduction will be the subject of a different post hopefully soon!</p>
<p>Ok so back to Hugo &#8230; he is the cutest little thing and has actually settled in quite quickly which is comforting &#8230; but anyways here are some basic facts about him &#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>He weighs less than a kilo at 930g</li>
<li>He is grey with lighter white stripes, a white patch under his chin and a stripy tail</li>
<li>His birthday is the 1st December 2011 making him 12 weeks old tomorrow</li>
<li>He is in love with his little mouse toy</li>
<li>He loves to pounce and bounce around with above mentioned toy</li>
<li>He hates the cat bed we bought him and has chosen to sleep in the gap between our pillows on the bed instead</li>
<li>He loves to hide behind our bed and to crawl out from between the mattress and the edge of the frame at the foot of the bed</li>
<li>If he is in a playful mood and you lower your head to his level he will give you a little &#8216;head bump&#8217;</li>
<li>He swipes/grabs at things with both paws &#8230; which looks so cute</li>
<li>He already has both Perry and I wrapped around his little paws!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9611-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-703" title="_MG_9611-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9611-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="865" /></a>Back to the story now, we first went to see Hugo and his brother last week on Monday after having initially decided that yes we were finally in a position to get kittens and had gotten permission from the landlord, we thought we would just ring around a few places to register our interest for Scottish Fold kittens so they could let us know the next time they were expecting some to come in &#8230; with no expectation of being able to get kittens any time soon!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9771-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-701" title="_MG_9771-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9771-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="876" /></a>I should explain here that Scottish Fold kittens are quite rare because of their folded ears &#8230; but that they are quite popular in the UAE (and other countries &#8230; notably in Japan and USA) so there are usually long waiting lists for kittens &#8230; Also Perry and I had our hearts set on getting Scottish Folds for a couple years now &#8230; but our circumstances in the UK had always meant it would not have been practical or fair (to the cat) to do so &#8230; So after moving out here and having decided that we could now get a kitten we decided to get two so they would atleast have each other for company whilst we are at work during the day &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9676-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-702" title="_MG_9676-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9676-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="859" /></a>So the hunt began &#8230; and as luck would have it whilst Perry was phoning round different places he came across this one Cattery who was expecting some Scottish Fold kittens at the start of last week &#8230; but without any concrete information as to how many kittens, if they had folded ears, what colour their fur was, or if they were male or female &#8230; we wrang incessantly to check on when they were going to arrive &#8230; to the point where when the receptionist at the Cattery picked up the phone &#8230; all we had to say was &#8216;Hi&#8217; and she knew who we were &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-692" title="Edited1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="825" /></a>Anyways so having finally arrived we went to see them after work on Monday last week &#8230; the cattery was only a 15mins walk from my office so I scurried off and Perry met me there not long after &#8230; from the moment I saw the two of them I knew they were exactly what we had been looking for &#8230; but the poor little ones were really quite tired and  frightened by all the change so we didnt handle them for too long &#8230; especially as Hugo&#8217;s brother was abit sickly.</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9794-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695" title="_MG_9794-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9794-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="389" /></a>So having made the decision that they were the ones for us we figured out the details with the management and put a deposit down to reserve the kittens &#8230; and following that we went by every day after work for the next week to visit them and for them to get used to us before we brought them home &#8230; We even swung by on the Friday morning with Tom and Claire before going to brunch!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-689" title="Edited2" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited2.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="825" /></a>We were told initially that Hugo would be fine to come home on Tuesday (yesterday) but that our other little guy would probably have to stay with them for up to another week so they can monitor his recovery and be sure that he is putting on enough weight etc &#8230; In the mean time Perry and I set to Kitten proofing our flat and stocking up on toys and other supplies they would need &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-691" title="Edited" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="1200" /></a>Anyways so yesterday after work we headed over to the Cattery to pick up Hugo &#8230; after going over some details regarding feeding habits, what the optimum temperature for a kitten is etc &#8230; we loaded him in his crate and brought him home &#8230; he was abit aprehensive at first about coming out of the travel crate &#8230; but within 5 mins he had scoped out our room and was quickly making himself at home &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-687" title="Edited4" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited4.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="413" /></a>We spent the rest of the evening playing with him and trying to tire him out &#8230; which took a while &#8230; but considering he had been cooped up in a cage for most of the last week it wasnt too surprising that he was enjoying the freedom of being able to run around &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" title="Edited3" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited3.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="825" /></a>Tom and Claire who are still in Dubai (but staying at a hotel for their last couple nights) came over after dinner to visit and have a play with Hugo &#8230; which he loved &#8230; and he absolutely loves his little mouse on a string toy &#8230; it provided hours of entertainment &#8230; he would go hide under the bed and crawl out of the small gap between the end of the mattress and the bed frame to pounce on things &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-688" title="Edited5" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/edited5.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="825" /></a>If any of us stopped playing with him or if he couldnt find his mouse toy he would start crying for it until one of us caved and started dangling it infront of him again &#8230; and to be honest &#8230; it worked every time!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9810-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" title="_MG_9810-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9810-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="389" /></a>So when we finally went to bed neither of us were sure where he would decide to go to sleep &#8230; especially as he was decidedly not impressed with the cat bed we had provided &#8230; but no worries &#8230; he had decided that Perry&#8217;s stomach would be the best place to fall asleep! &#8230; After a slight relocation he finally settled down for the night on the bed between me and Perry until 5am when he woke me up by pawing me in the face!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9820-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" title="_MG_9820-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9820-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="331" /></a>So we ended up waking up around then playing with him and taking it in turns to doze abit longer before our alarms went off &#8230; Perry got up and dressed as usual for work while I threw on some shorts and a T-shirt to pop down to Starbucks for a morning coffee &#8230; I came back to spend the day with Hugo and try to get some work done as well &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0818-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-697" title="IMG_0818-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0818-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="778" /></a>Hugo turned out to be quite active and playful in the morning and took an active interest in anything and everything I was doing &#8230; he kept sitting on my laptop making it difficult to get anything done &#8230; or even when he did settle down long enough to watch some Gossip Girl with me he managed to keep clicking the buttons and making the video pause &#8230; at one point he even managed to refresh the page!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0815-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-700" title="IMG_0815-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0815-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="778" /></a>After trying to get some work done &#8230; and again being thwarted by Hugo who was either trying to eat my paperwork or sleeping on it &#8230; I gave up and decided to take a break for some lunch &#8230; after I had eaten Hugo decided he&#8217;d had enough play time and took what I thought would just be a nap but he ended up sleeping for about 4-5hours on the bed in the gap between our pillows &#8230; occasionally getting up to go to the litter box or for a stretch!</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0821-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-698" title="IMG_0821-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0821-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a>So finally I was able to get on with some work and even had a wonderful Skype chat with one of my friends, Declan, in Ireland &#8230; towards the end of this though he had woken up and was doing everything to get my attention &#8230; so I played with him for a bit until Perry got home from work and he got to have some play time &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9789-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-699" title="_MG_9789-1" src="http://perryandmina.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mg_9789-1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="408" /></a>We spent the rest of the evening lavishing Hugo with much love and attention &#8230; he is so incredibly adorable &#8230; we had to leave him in our room to go get dinner ready (we are confining him to the bedroom for a few days till he has settled properly before introducing the rest of the flat) &#8230; and every now and again you could hear him crying &#8230; so one of us would run back to check and make sure he&#8217;s ok &#8230; when there is actually nothing wrong with him &#8230; he just wants some attention and someone to throw a toy for him &#8230;</p>
<p>So there he is &#8230; Hugo our little Scottish Fold &#8230; will keep you posted on how he does and any developments with his brother &#8230;</p>
<p>I should go now as he is starting to cry for attention again &#8230; up until now he was happily dozing next to me &#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow were off to the Cricket (England Vs Pakistan) so will hopefully have more updates over the weekend!</p>
<p>Till next time &#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_321" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 474px"><img class=" wp-image-321 " title="family" src="http://revegofthenerd.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/screen-shot-2012-02-12-at-6-58-45-pm.png?w=464&#038;h=311" alt="" width="464" height="311" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Four generations of us.</p></div>
<p>I have a fairly large extended family. For the most part, our current clan originated in Wichita, Kansas, but through the power invested in marriages, divorces, job transfers and time, we have been strewn out across the country over the years. You&#8217;ll now find pushpins in our family map everywhere from the Florida Keys to Honolulu, Austin to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>As a result of our geographic divergence, it makes it very difficult for all (or even many) of us to ever come together in the same place at the same time. Years go by and we don&#8217;t see each other. The younger cousins eternally frozen in my mind as munchkins at the &#8220;little kids table&#8221; are now high school seniors and sophomores in college. The home I cast as the scene for all family memories hasn&#8217;t been in our family for nearly a decade. This is just to say &#8211; things change, people get busy, time flies.</p>
<p>A year ago my grandmother passed away after a brief battle with cancer. Weddings and funerals. For better or worse, these are the things that  finally bring a modern family together. As each branch received the call, they made plans to descend upon the teeny, tiny town of Frederick, Oklahoma &#8211; my grandmother&#8217;s childhood stomping ground. She had elected to be buried in Frederick beside her parents.</p>
<p>Frederick. How do I explain Frederick? It is perhaps best described as a blip town. A blip I fell very much in love with. Frederick is the kind of little place you pass through on a rural highway heading somewhere else. The last census put the population at under 4,000. I&#8217;m not sure what industry supports the economy there, I can only guess farming, and I remember reading somewhere that the median income in Frederick was well under $30,000.</p>
<p>In many ways Frederick feels like a land untouched by time. It struck me as the kind of place that could be described (and accurately so) as the heartbeat of America. A place steeped in family, God and the American dream. Unpretentious and hardworking. A welcome smile with a little grit under the fingernails. A land where people know their neighbors &#8211; and the value of a hard day&#8217;s work. Frederick isn&#8217;t relic as much as it is artifact. It isn&#8217;t un-evolved, rather it&#8217;s a place &#8211; and a lifestyle &#8211; unperturbed. From what I have gathered from my mother&#8217;s accounts of visiting the sleepy tow in the 50s and 60s, not much has changed for Frederick the past half-century&#8230;and that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>My family descended on Frederick like a bit of a storm. If you&#8217;re going to stay in Frederick, your lodging options are limited to two motorlodge-type hotels on the outskirts of town. If you don&#8217;t like the first, no worries. The other option is right next door. But if memory serves, one of the signs boasted that they were now offering wireless internet, so you may want to take that into consideration.</p>
<p>Our first afternoon in town, we took a driving tour around the city &#8211; and down memory lane. 40-some years later, my mother&#8217;s memory was still able to trace its way back to the modest farmhouse my great-grandmother (Mimi) and great-grandfather (Homer) had owned together. It is the place where my grandmother grew up. My mother reminisced about the small patch of land my great-grandmother had tended, a vegetable and flower garden, and beyond it, the land my great-grandfather had tilled. She regaled us with stories of Mimi, the industrious wife of a farmer, snapping the necks of dinner chickens and plucking them clean. It was a stark contrast to the gentle, quiet, if not a bit frail, great-grandmother I remembered. In my mind, she was a soul better suited for gently cradling a cup of tea than slaughtering unsuspecting chickens. The image of her strong and fearless doing what had to be done gave me new perspective.</p>
<p>I come from a long line of strong, courageous females, it would seem.</p>
<p>The funeral went as funerals go. The chapel and cemetery set in a picturesque, rural area outside of town. It was a beautiful day, unseasonably warm, and cows were murmuring off in the distance. I suspect our unusual quietness was a bittersweet recognition of the irony that bidding a loved one farewell was the one thing that had a way of bringing the living back together.</p>
<p>After the casket had been laid, we mobilized the troops. We&#8217;d need lunch before everyone traveled back to their separate corners of the world. Having had our fill of Pizza Hut (and having no inclination to try Sonic), we ended up at a little local restaurant called The Bomber Inn.</p>
<p>My people are not a small people. At 5&#8217;10&#8243; I am one of the shorter cousins on my mother&#8217;s side of the family. As we descended on The Bomber Inn, the staff and regulars looked at us incredulously, but only for a moment before shuffling chairs and tables to make it work. We crammed into booths, shared menus, stormed the single restroom. Clearly strangers, nobody poked or pried. They just made us feel welcome.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall what I ate that day. A grilled cheese or a chicken-fried steak, who can say for sure? I remember strange things from that afternoon. One of the waitresses asking my cousin to come into the kitchen to reach something on a high shelf. An older gentleman approaching my uncle to tell him he had a &#8220;mighty handsome family.&#8221; More than that, I remember a feeling. A feeling of being acutely aware of the importance of eating together that day.</p>
<p>The truth is we cannot control the ticking of time. We don&#8217;t get a say in when or how or where things come together or fall apart. We get busy, stressed, preoccupied, but at least a few times a day, life forces us to stop and eat. And we can choose to do that together.</p>
<div id="contentmain">
<div>
<p>Author Norman Kolpas once said, “Food, like a loving touch or a glimpse of divine power, has that ability to comfort.” That afternoon, crammed in booths at The Bomber Inn, we weren&#8217;t just eating lunch, we were celebrating a life. We weren’t just nourishing our bodies, we were nourishing our hearts and our spirits, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely I will ever be in Frederick again. I doubt I&#8217;ll be back at The Bomber Inn. But I often think of the kindness they showed us that day, and I hope they know that more than a meal, they gave us a rare and precious moment of togetherness in the heartbeat of America. It won&#8217;t soon be forgotten.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="margin:5px;" title="Muppets Peanut Gallery" src="http://blogs.walkerart.org/filmvideo/files/2011/08/muppet-show.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="230" />How many times have you felt the impulse to leave a comment on an article or blog but then thought better of it and moved on?</p>
<p>Whether the piece is sheer brilliance or more internet garbage, there is almost always a section where readers can leave comments (often referred to as a combox). I have mixed feelings about the combox, but until I read Kristin Lamb&#8217;s recent post about <a href="http://warriorwriters.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/10-ways-to-improve-your-likability-quotient-2/" target="_blank">&#8220;improving your likability quotient&#8221;</a>, and Bob Mayer&#8217;s thoughts on your <a href="http://writeitforward.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/if-you-dont-exist-on-the-internet-do-you-exist-at-all/" target="_blank">internet presence</a>, I must admit, I wasn&#8217;t an avid commenter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: As much as I often think I have important things to say, when I see several hundred comments, I often feel like adding my voice to the fray won&#8217;t be a worthwhile contribution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-1.png"><img class=" wp-image-651 alignnone" style="margin:5px;" title="4,000 comments" src="http://theaberrantpen.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-1.png?w=478&#038;h=64" alt="" width="478" height="64" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" style="margin:5px;" title="big eyes" src="http://thedailypos.org/forum/Smileys/emoticons/whoabigeyes.gif" alt="" width="145" height="145" /></p>
<p>Oh how wrong I was.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about you guys, but I know I have a tendency to size up the world in an &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; mindset far too often. Here are a few of my usual inner monologues:</p>
<p>&#8220;If my blog post or comment isn&#8217;t going to rock the foundations of the literary world, well, then&#8230; I may as well not comment at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look at the flame war! I thought I smelled smoke over on WordPress&#8230; This fire has clearly burned itself out. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy <em>clearly</em> doesn&#8217;t have a clue, but he&#8217;s obviously too stupid to consider anything I have to say. I think I&#8217;ll go preach to the choir where I know people will listen to me.&#8221;</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl class="wp-caption zemanta-img aligncenter">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SMirC-facepalm.svg"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Smiley from the sMirC-series. facepalm" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/SMirC-facepalm.svg/300px-SMirC-facepalm.svg.png" alt="Smiley from the sMirC-series. facepalm" width="209" height="209" /></a></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align:left;"> No, no, no.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You see, it&#8217;s called <em><strong>social</strong> </em>media for a reason. Even when it appears that your thought may be lost in an ever-deepening sea of other comments, you never know who might read it. At the very least, the blog author will get another alert letting him know that you thought his post was worthwhile reading, and while busier bloggers can&#8217;t always read or reply to every individual comment, you have just given him a digital high-five of sorts and spread some internet cheer. We bloggers like being &#8220;liked.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Secondly, whenever you leave a comment on a blog, you are leaving a virtual trail of breadcrumbs back to your own blog. As Nicola Morgan points out, <a href="http://ht.ly/94WiD" target="_blank">Google loves it when you make its job easier</a>. Every time you comment somewhere else, you leave a veritable trail of metadata in your wake, making your blog more likely to show up in search engines and, in a sense, casting your nets wide into the sea of the internet.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And lastly, while the internet is a big place, you are an important part of it. Sometimes, it might seem as if your contribution to the free flow of information and ideas is nothing but a drop in an ocean, but the ocean would be that much drier and shallower without your thought. As they say, &#8220;Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day&#8221; (a truism of which I am in constant need of reminding). It was, rather, each individual stone in a Roman road which comprised the network that allowed the empire to stretch across Europe. And it was each individual citizen who came to debate in the forum which allowed for the republic to flourish into the classical civilisation to which we still look today.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ready to join the legions of intelligent, articulate blog commenters currently amassing to redeem the internet?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I thought so.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>To bloggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO</strong> enable commenting on your blogs. Most platforms have sufficient spam blockers to keep the bots at bay. If people cannot participate in your blog, then you are basically having a conversation with yourself, and we all know that writers do enough of that outside the blogosphere as it is, right? <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> reply to comments within your own blog. This shows your adoring fans that you do, in fact, care about them and take the time to read what they say. Nothing builds rapport between a blogger and his audience better than <span style="color:#888888;"><del>mingling amongst the commoners</del></span> conversing with his readers.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> write thought-provoking posts that encourage conversation. Hell, write something controversial if its gets people talking! You might try leaving an open question at the end of your posts or inviting a guest blogger to provide a counter-post.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> take the time to read and comment on other bloggers&#8217; posts. Far from fraternising with the competition, you just paid the favor forward and brightened someone else&#8217;s corner of the internet. If anything, he might feel indebted and comment back on your blog, but at the very least, you have shown that what you consider worthy enough of your time to read is also worthy of your time to contribute to, as well.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To readers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO</strong> read articles and posts carefully and analytically. Take the time to craft a thoughtful, genuine post that shows the author you have heard what he has to say and want to collaborate with him via a shared experience or constructive criticism.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> forward links from other relevant blogs in your comments if you think they will contribute to the conversation. Just be careful about appearing&#8230; spammy.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> click the &#8220;Like&#8221; button if you don&#8217;t have time to write a whole comment. This will at least let the author know that you read and enjoyed his work.</li>
<li>I repeat <strong>DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, was this a cleverly-designed trap to lure readers into commenting on my blog and boosting my ego?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="shifty eyes" src="http://www.themonkeymafia.info/forum/Smileys/DarkB/other_awesomenessShiftyEyes.gif" alt="" width="111" height="111" /></p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>But really, it&#8217;s not about me (although notifications <em>are</em> gratifying most of the time). It&#8217;s about making the internet a better place for everyone. If you have been shy about joining the fracas, there&#8217;s no time like the present! So, please, take up that seat in the peanut gallery and fire away!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on your commenting in the blogosphere and what ideas you have to improve the experience. It seems to me that one of the huge problems confronting us is the general lack of civility in the comboxes. Thoughts? Opinions? Reactions? Criticism? Viewpoints? Convictions?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all ears.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blast those nincompoops who told us, as children, that gardening is as simple as dropping a seed in a hole and splashing it with water. Maybe that&#8217;s the case in the Northwest, but here in Texas it&#8217;s just not that simple&#8230;especially when you&#8217;re talking about seed starting.</p>
<p>Heath&#8217;s been itching to start gardening from seeds (rather than transplanting) for quite some time now. For one, it&#8217;s a pretty stellar way to feel somewhat God-like. Taking a tiny pebble-like object and transforming it into leafy, nutrient providing green. It does wonders for the ego.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the seeds grow to maturity, it&#8217;s a much, much, much more economical way to garden. Think about it: a single 3-inch tall tomato plant usually costs around $3.50 and will probably yield around 15 pounds of fruit in a good (&#8220;good&#8221; being the operative word) season. Not too bad considering what you pay in a grocery store for organic &#8216;maters. But a package of seeds, which usually has a count around 100 or so, is less than $2. I&#8217;m no mathematician, but based on those numbers, if you can do it right, seed starting is the way to go.</p>
<p>No problem except that when you start getting into it, seed starting is tricky business. Conditions must be perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>The seeds need to have between 12 and 18 hours of light each day. In the winter, when daylight isn&#8217;t so ample, dropping them in a hole and letting nature do it&#8217;s thing isn&#8217;t so much of an option. You&#8217;ve got to rig up a complicated lighting system, preferably attached to a timer, to make sure they get the appropriate amount of artificial sunshine.</li>
<li>Not just any soil will do. In fact, when seed starting, the experts recommend &#8220;soilless&#8221; soil. Which seems a little paradoxical. Using top soil from an existing garden can actually kill the seeds and you don&#8217;t always know the exact compounds you&#8217;re dealing with, and it has a tendency to compact easily without air ventilation, the presence of earthworms and manual tilling.  Instead, it&#8217;s recommended that gardeners use a mixture of sphagnum peat moss, plus vermiculite and a little perlite. The soilless mixture is much lighter than top soil and ultimately helps the seeds grow stronger, faster.</li>
<li>Seeds like the temperature to be juuuuuust right. Like me, seeds do best in temps between 65 and 70 degrees. While the temp has been known to occasionally hover around that level for day or two during Austin winters, it&#8217;s not a done deal. So the seeds usually have to live inside, and not just inside, but in a place that is well ventilated with moisture control. I&#8217;m telling you, they get a better set up than me, Heath and the doodles combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>The caring and handy individual he is, Heath spared no expense creating the perfect environment to start our seeds. Well, I guess he spared some expense, considering seed starting paraphernalia can retail in the hundred dollar range. We spent a grand total of about $30, but the top shelf of our laundry room is now Seed City. The spectacular shelf-top community features scenic views (of our washer and dryer), superfluous sunshine (16 hours of florescent lighting) and a cool and breezy climate (a circulating fan rigged to dangle from the ceiling in lieu of an actual ceiling fan). It might be a little makeshift, but dammit if it didn&#8217;t get the job done.</p>
<p><a href="http://thedoodlehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/seed-starter.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1890 aligncenter" title="seed starter" src="http://thedoodlehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/seed-starter.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="662" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thedoodlehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/seed-starter-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1892 aligncenter" title="seed starter 2" src="http://thedoodlehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/seed-starter-2.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>By summer, we should have a truck load of tomatoes, kale, chard, lettuce, peppers and broccoli to keep us satiated. What&#8217;s more, seedlings are not the only thing growing beneath the light of the laundry room. We have new chicks as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guys. I hate this question.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to answer something so broad, so ambiguous? There are so many wonderful movies out there that make my heart soar/sing/pitter-patter/explode/something. But I know this question will inevitably come up <strong>every time</strong> I say, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m a big &#8216;film&#8217; person.&#8221; Even, &#8220;Oh yeah, I like movies.&#8221; (Who doesn&#8217;t?) Someone will ask you this question. And if they don&#8217;t, they&#8217;re probably about to ask the other version: &#8220;So, like, what do you think is the BEST movie of ALL TIME?&#8221;</p>
<p>And who am I kidding &#8211; you&#8217;re wondering the same thing right now! You want to know my movie choices so you can belittle and judge them too! Well I aim to please, so I&#8217;m providing 10 of my favorite flicks in no particular order. But, to make it Annoying Film Person-y, I&#8217;m telling you why, and then I&#8217;m telling you why <strong>really.</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Breathless (1960)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.frontroomcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/breathless07bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Breathless" src="http://www.frontroomcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/breathless07bw.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="387" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of my favorites overall, but it&#8217;s definitely my favorite foreign film. It&#8217;s THE French New Wave film. Godard&#8217;s whole body of work is genius, but this one&#8217;s special to me. The characters are kind of terrible people, but it works and it&#8217;s great. Belmondo and Seberg are hot. Black-and-white is where it&#8217;s at. Jump cuts are cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;French films are cool, ya&#8217;ll.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Roman Holiday (1953)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.listal.com/image/367305/600full-roman-holiday-screenshot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Roman Holiday" src="http://i2.listal.com/image/367305/600full-roman-holiday-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="293" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actress, and I say that unironically. Oh, you don&#8217;t believe me? Audrey was so vulnerable in her portrayals; she was grace and elegance personified; I love the way Audrey&#8217;s voice gets super bass low when she&#8217;s trying to be serious (<a title="it's MOST unusual" href="http://youtu.be/_7Ky03UL0h0" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/_7Ky03UL0h0</a>, 2:33); this movie is a beautiful love story <strong>without</strong> the sugary, perfect ending &#8211; I mean, how rare is THAT-&#8221; and on and on and on.</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I really like &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8221; more, but this seems less shallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <strong>The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://blog.mutewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-royal-tenenbaums.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Royal Tenenbaums" src="http://blog.mutewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-royal-tenenbaums.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="268" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Where do I start? The Alec Baldwin narration? The splendiferous cast and kooky characters? My dreams of recreating a Margot Tenenbaum costume if I can<strong> just </strong>find the correct shade of brown fur coat? The shave-your-beard-attempted-suicide-by-Elliott-Smith-music scene? How about the music overall? Gene Hackman, that old curmudgeon?!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Guys. You have to include a Wes Anderson film. It&#8217;s required.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. <strong>The Breakfast Club (1985)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/15/1316104152087/The-Breakfast-Club---1985-001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Breakfast Club" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/15/1316104152087/The-Breakfast-Club---1985-001.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="336" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A: Love me some John Hughes. B: I can&#8217;t imagine growing up without this movie. I&#8217;ve seen it 333 times. Sure, it&#8217;s got its cliches and cornball moments. But the essence is timeless, and it&#8217;s genuinely funny and &#8211; dare I say - touching.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This movie would be nothing without Judd Nelson&#8217;s nostrils. And flannel.&#8221;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Dazed and Confused (1993)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4yrvDAh91qh8wq4o1_500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Dazed &amp; Confused" src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4yrvDAh91qh8wq4o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Guys. I truly, truly wish I had been around for the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s. I love the fashion and the styles in this movie &#8211; guys with shaggy hair, girls using pliers to zip up their flared jeans. The music is flippin&#8217; awesome too &#8211; Aerosmith, Foghat, Frampton. It captures a specific time, yes, but it captures adolescence and high school pretty perfectly too (much like BC). This movie has some of the most quotable quotes of my life. Watch it for Matthew McConaughey&#8217;s lines alone. AND it&#8217;s set in Texas. Win.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;All right all right all right.&#8221; -drawl</p>
<p>6. <strong>The Princess Bride (1987)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://latimesherocomplex.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/princessbride.jpg?w=600"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Princess Bride" src="http://latimesherocomplex.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/princessbride.jpg?w=480&#038;h=289" alt="" width="480" height="289" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Only the most grand, fantastic love story ever! I&#8217;m a sucker for fairy tales, but this one has such wit, really. It&#8217;s a simple story in the end, but it&#8217;s full of such adventure and unforgettable characters &#8211; Westley + Buttercup, Inigo, Fezzik, Miracle Max, the clergyman (&#8216;Mawwiage is what bwings us togeffer today!&#8217;). The dialogue sparkles; this is another movie that I love to quote. It&#8217;s ageless.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a girl, ya&#8217;ll.&#8221;</p>
<p>7. <strong>The New World (2005)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://annoyingfilmperson.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/newworld.jpg?w=300"><img class="aligncenter" title="The New World" src="http://annoyingfilmperson.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/newworld.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327" alt="" width="490" height="327" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, I chose probably the least-beloved of Terrence Malick&#8217;s films. SO WHAT. It&#8217;s my fave. The cinematography is, as always, <strong>breathtaking</strong>, and the score is lovely &#8211; at times soaring or serene. The dialogue is sparse, with the customary whispering narration. It&#8217;s a love story, albeit an awkward one for modern-day viewing and full of historical inaccuracies I&#8217;m sure. I am completely willing to overlook it all. I shed some for serious tears when Pocahontas (Q&#8217;orianka Kilcher) asks John Smith (Colin Farrell) if he ever &#8216;found his Indies&#8217; and he replies, &#8216;I may have sailed past them.&#8217; Cryfest.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a girl, ya&#8217;ll.&#8221;</p>
<p>8. <strong>The Graduate (1967)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://i2.listal.com/image/2358934/600full-the-graduate-screenshot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="The Graduate" src="http://i2.listal.com/image/2358934/600full-the-graduate-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have to explain the brilliance of this to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. <strong>Into the Wild (2007)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/071105/oscars/holbrook_l.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Into the Wild" src="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/071105/oscars/holbrook_l.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What I Say to People:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Guys. So sad. <strong>But</strong>, totally made me want to drop everything and trek into the Great Outdoors. Or at least a solid road trip. Emile Hirsch is an actor I really admire, and, underused in my opinion! The way this film is shot makes me drool, top notch soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, Sean Penn directs the mess out of it, but I think the strongest piece is the supporting cast of characters and the actors/actresses portraying them &#8211; Hal Holbrook especially, makin&#8217; me tear up and all.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sucker for some nature shots and a true story that&#8217;s <strong>super </strong><strong>depressing</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>10. <strong>Cry-Baby (1990) / Labyrinth (1986)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Crybabyposter.jpg/215px-Crybabyposter.jpg"><img title="Cry-Baby" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Crybabyposter.jpg/215px-Crybabyposter.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="332" /></a><a href="http://www.moviegoods.com/Assets/product_images/1010/460334.1010.A.jpg"><img title="Labyrinth" src="http://www.moviegoods.com/Assets/product_images/1010/460334.1010.A.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="304" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What I Say Aloud:</strong></p>
<p>I had to include these solely because they were my favorite movies when I was 6 years old. I made my mom rent them for me, VHS-style, like every other weekend. They are terrible. And by terrible, I mean <strong>awesome</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>So, Basically:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;OMG JOHNNY DEPP! OMG DAVID BOWIE!&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love when things just fall into your lap.  A couple of weeks ago a friend of mine decided she wanted to take self-defense classes and the general Facebook consensus was that you just couldn&#8217;t beat <a class="zem_slink" title="Krav Maga" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga" rel="wikipedia">Krav Maga</a>.  It&#8217;s an Israeli self-defense system that&#8217;s boasted as being one of the most &#8220;battle-tested&#8221; and highly used in law enforcement.  It looks a little something like this:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lXw1CcWiSlY?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>That, by the way, is Fit and Fearless, one of my new favorite places.  After hearing Day talk about how awesome the workout was and how much she was learning, I took her up on her offer to join her for a free intro class.  You can&#8217;t dispute free, really.</p>
<p>When I showed up, the teacher for the class that day pulled me aside for a few minutes just to catch me up on basic stance and technique since I would be taking a Level 1 class, one step above the Beginners class that takes you through the basics.  What immediately struck me though, was that each stance and movement wasn&#8217;t just about how to do it correctly, but why it&#8217;s done that way.  I&#8217;m immediately more attracted to things when there&#8217;s underlying logic and reason to each aspect.</p>
<p>For example: In your ready stance you hands are always up, 6-8 in. from the face, <strong>with palms open</strong>.</p>
<p>My instinct after 2 years of childhood karate was to make fists, which I&#8217;m still doing a week in just out of habit.  But, this is not <em>defense.</em> The teacher explained that fists automatically incite aggression. Krav Maga is to neutralize threats, not create or advance them. Open hands are more passive, but still guard your face in case things escalate.</p>
<p>Even in my first class I was hitting things.  No shadow boxing here (unless it&#8217;s to warm up). I learned to punch, how to move around the room, and to finish out I learned how to get out of a headlock and drop a grown man to the ground.  Theoretically at least.  I was actually throwing my 97 pound best friend to the ground, but I&#8217;m hoping the technique will translate.</p>
<p>Of course, after class as I&#8217;m sweating and riding an endorphin high, I couldn&#8217;t resist when they asked if I wanted to sign up. It&#8217;s expensive, yes, but good lord it&#8217;s a good use of the money.  It&#8217;s self-defense first of all, which can easily be invaluable if you ever need to use it, but it&#8217;s also the hands-down best workout I&#8217;ve ever had in my life.</p>
<p>The goal was to take a class, but this is quickly looking like it could turn into more of a lifestyle.  I&#8217;ve already been to my second class and a quick private lesson with one of the instructors. I&#8217;m now kicking, learning ground movement and&#8230;.working on some serious abs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we left off in the southwest of Switzerland. I arrived in Champery by a small train that went along the cliff side. It is amazing how scenic everything is in Switzerland. It is such a beautiful country.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://transientmtb.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/1391.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="139" src="http://transientmtb.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/1391.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Champery is home to a World Cup track. I walked on some of it, and I have to admit that there is no way in hell I would have ridden it. It is so steep that you&#8217;d have to be suicidal. I have tons of respect for the pro racers that fly down it. After that, I went on a hike. Here is a picture of Champery from the cliffs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://transientmtb.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/143.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="143" src="http://transientmtb.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/143.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After Champery, I spent a month in Morzine, which is part of Portes du Soleil. Portes du Soleil is the name for a bunch of resorts in the Swiss and French Alps. They are all connected by lifts. It is really cool. I took the lifts from France and rode in Switzerland, then took the lift from Switzerland, and rode in France and back to where I was staying. I got there a few days before the season started. It was completely dead. Once the season started, it was packed. I was lucky enough to be there for the giant race called Passporte du Soleil. It is a long race that connects all of the resorts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, I was luck enough that 2 friends were coming down to Morzine. They would also be how I make it to my next destination, Freiburg, Germany. I met up with them, and we set off to ride. We take the lift up to the top of one of the mountains, and they lead me to a black trail. For those of you that don&#8217;t know, that is equivalent to the black diamonds when skiing (basically the hardest trails). I turn to them and say &#8220;god you guys are assholes&#8221;. And off we go, flying down the mountain. We are slipping and sliding around, and I won&#8217;t lie, I used my brakes a bit too much. But I had a blast, and was really proud of myself to make it down in one piece. I did have a crash, but only walked away with a scrape on my knuckle. I also discovered that, which I kinda already knew, that I needed wider and better tires. Anyway, I get to the bottom like 2 minutes after they do. So off we go across the town to the lift up the other mountain. The lift up to the top of Les Gets was long, but it was cool seeing everyone flying down underneath you.</p>
<p>At the top of Les Gets I say &#8220;no black trail this time!&#8221; One of them turned to me and said &#8220;you made it to the bottom didn&#8217;t you&#8230;&#8221; True&#8230; So we decided to ride the red trails (one level below the black trail) mixed in with the black and some of the blue. It was so much fun carving the berms, especially since I need to practice my body position on them. They taught me a bit, and kept saying to let off the brakes some more. I honestly am a bit afraid, but at the same time I have been progressively getting faster and faster. I&#8217;m learning, and they understood. So we are riding, jumping, carving around turns, and sliding around turns because it has been raining a lot the past couple of days. This one section in the woods got really muddy, and I decided to have more fun than I should have. I basically slid sideways left and right through the whole section. I didn&#8217;t notice that there was a line of 5 guys behind me, but they started doing the same thing, and we had a laugh about it at the end of the section. So we get to the bottom of the jump park/technical section, and I feel like I really have to piss, but we are already in line for the lift to get to the way top because there is a bar up there.</p>
<p>So we arrive at the bar, and it is closed. Along with the bathroom&#8230; My friends say that we should just ride to another bar halfway down the mountain. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;fine, I&#8217;ll take a piss there. I can probably hold it.&#8221; So we are riding down these narrow, rocky, rooty, fast trails and all of a sudden I am thinking, &#8220;holy crap I really have to piss but there is no way in hell I can safely stop.&#8221; So the whole time I am thinking about pissing, which turned out to be great because I thought less about riding, therefore I was able to ride faster and not intervene at the wrong times. Basically, I wasn&#8217;t over thinking. We get to the next bar and it is closed too&#8230; At this point I am about to run behind a tree and piss, but my friends decide that we could just go really fast down the mountain, and the bars are definitely open down there. Well, off we went&#8230;</p>
<p>We are riding at a good pace down these really muddy parts, with some serious puddles. All of a sudden we drop down onto this rocky and wet trail. It is pretty damn steep, so we are all on the brakes hard. Then the trail turned into a river/stream. I have to admit, it was pretty awesome. I really wish I had a helmet camera with me then because the images would be amazing. As we are riding slowly through this river/trail, I really really have to piss but cannot get off the bike. I made a deal with myself that if I fell on the trail and got soaked, I am just going to piss my pants. No one would notice, right?? Thankfully I did not fall! We finally get to the bottom, and I swear I almost gave a right hook to a guy standing between me and the bathroom door.</p>
<p>Lesson I learned &#8211; having something else on your mind while biking can be a very good thing. Having that something else be a knee knocking piss emergency is probably not the best idea&#8230;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the mountain, at the bar, we see this helicopter come and land somewhere on the mountain. Someone apparently fell and needed to be airlifted. It made me remember just how dangerous this sport can be. It is good that my reality check comes from someone else&#8217;s injury this time!</p>
