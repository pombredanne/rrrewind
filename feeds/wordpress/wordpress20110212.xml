<p><strong>This Valentine&#8217;s Day, forget the wining and dining. Do something that matters.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Like many people, I&#8217;ve had good Valentine&#8217;s Days and well, not so good.</p>
<p>The not-so-good dates back to middle school, when I, like many of my classmates, anxiously awaited one of those pink-dyed carnations from what I hoped would be a secret admirer. Much to my dismay, the carnation never came, and for years, it left me feeling downright <em>uneasy</em> about the 14th of February.</p>
<p>I later came to realize that Valentine&#8217;s Day is about much more than getting flowers or conversation hearts that say &#8220;Hot Stuff&#8221; or &#8220;Be Mine.&#8221; I love it that there&#8217;s a day in our busy lives when we officially celebrate <em>love</em>. I&#8217;m not just talking romantic love, like Hallmark would have us believe, but the real-deal, universal stuff-of-life that makes up who we really are. Behind all our roles and personalities and professionalism, each of us, at essence, is a living, loving being. Sure, on the other 364 days of the year we might try to fake it, but on this one day, the world agrees: Love is where it&#8217;s at. Call it spirit, call it sweetness &#8212; whatever you want to call it, we&#8217;ve all got it. It&#8217;s just a matter of what we do with it.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to <em>do</em> good and <em>feel</em> good this Valentine&#8217;s Day. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Will You Be My&#8230;Volunteer</strong>? There&#8217;s no shortage of ways you can help. Volunteer at a local soup kitchen, animal shelter, or favorite nonprofit, or offer to tutor a child in reading or math. You can find loads of opportunities on <a title="Volunteer Match" href="http://www.volunteermatch.org" target="_blank">VolunteerMatch</a>, or check out <a title="Do Something" href="http://www.dosomething.org" target="_blank">DoSomething</a>, which helps younger folks rock the causes they care about.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Put the &#8220;Fun&#8221; in Fundraising</strong>. If you&#8217;re taking that special someone out for a pricey dinner, why not have your bill go to a good cause? Check your newspaper or online city pages for Valentine-themed fundraisers that support local nonprofits. Or better yet, throw your own happy hour or party, and donate the proceeds to charity.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Give a Little Bit</strong>. Sometimes a little helps a lot. Looking to put your money where your mouth is? Donate a dollar a day to a cause that calls to you through <a title="Philanthroper" href="http://www.philanthroper.com" target="_blank">Philanthroper</a>. Or support students and classrooms in need in your hometown through <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" title="Donors Choose" href="http://www.donorschoose.org" target="_blank">DonorsChoose</a>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Send Love Letters</strong>. Not just to your sweetheart, but to people and organizations that are doing good things for the world. Tell them why you respect and appreciate their work, and that they really do make a difference. If you&#8217;re feeling extra romantic, include a donation.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Reach Out to Those in Need</strong>. Deliver homemade Valentine&#8217;s cards or heart-shaped cookies to the sick, the elderly, the homeless &#8212; and their caregivers. Call a local children&#8217;s hospital, nursing home, domestic violence or homeless shelter and ask how you can donate an hour or two of your time.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Give Gifts That Give</strong>. There are dozens of charitable shopping sites and online nonprofit stores selling gifts for a good cause. Look for red Motorola phones, Gap T-shirts and iPods from Apple to support the <a title="Red" href="http://www.joinred.com/red/" target="_blank">(Red) Campaign</a>, or find cause-specific gifts to alleviate hunger, breast cancer, deforestation and more at <a title="Greater Good" href="http://www.greatergood.org" target="_blank">Greater Good</a>. Can’t find the perfect gift for your special someone? Give a <a title="Good Card" href="http://www1.networkforgood.org/good-card" target="_blank">Good Card</a> through Network for Good.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Remember Those Who Serve You</strong>. Think of all those people who make your life easier and more convenient &#8212; every single day. Give a thank-you card to the bus driver or the barista who serves you your latte. Personally thank the janitor who keeps your office or campus clean, or the people who pick up your trash. Leave your waiter an extra tip, and smile&#8211;big&#8211;at the gas station attendant.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Clean Your Closets</strong>. Get a head start on spring-cleaning and donate clothes, toys, furniture, household items, and old computers to nonprofits accepting them. Check your local Big Brothers Big Sisters, Salvation Army, or Goodwill Industries.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Love Your Mother (Earth). </strong>Take the trash challenge: For one day, see if you can generate zero trash. Zip, nada, nothing. No cardboard boxes, no disposable containers, no bottled water. Think of what you can reduce and re-use, and call your county or city waste management to find out about local compost programs.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Get Your Heart Pumping</strong>. Charity walks and runs raise money for a good cause and get you moving in the great outdoors. Bring the family or your co-workers along to make it a team event. To find an event, check your local American Heart Association or a local runners&#8217; club, such as <a title="Road Runners" href="http://www.rrca.org/" target="_blank">Road Runners Club</a>.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Adopt a Pet for a Day</strong>. Offer to take care of a pet for an ill or homebound neighbor. Volunteer at your local animal shelter to take the dogs for a walk. Or adopt an endangered species through the <a title="World Wildlife Fund" href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/ogc/index.cfm?sc=AWY1100WC912&amp;CFID=48944027&amp;CFTOKEN=ba15ef62430eef39-081E99DD-FA57-3653-9600FC50C99D530B" target="_blank">World Wildlife Fund</a>, and you&#8217;ll get a lovable stuffed pet and adoption certificate.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Be a Fair-Trade Valentine</strong>. Buy certified fair-trade chocolate from companies that ensure that small-scale farmers receive higher and more stable prices for their cocoa. Try <a title="Theo" href="http://www.theochocolate.com/" target="_blank">Theo</a>, <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" title="Equal Exchange" href="http://www.equalexchange.coop" target="_blank">Equal Exchange</a>, or my new favorite: <a title="Alter-Ego" href="http://www.altereco-usa.com/main.php" target="_blank">Alter-Ego Fair Trade</a> (love their Dark Quinoa Chocolate &#8211; talk about a superfood!).</p>
<p>12. <strong>Say it With Organic Flowers</strong>. Buy fresh organic blooms from your local farmer&#8217;s market, or send a bunch from Organic Bouquet, which donates 10 percent to charities like CARE, the Global Fund for Women, and the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>13. <strong>Be Kind While You Dine</strong>. Taking your sweetie for a steak dinner this V-Day? Choose a restaurant that sources its meat from sustainable, humanely treated and harvested animals &amp; farms. Visit <a title="Sustainable Table" href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/shop/guides/" target="_blank">Sustainable Table’s Eat Well Guide</a> to find vendors that offer farms and stores that sell sustainably raised meat. For seafood lovers, download the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seawood Watch app for your smart phone.</p>
<p>14.<strong>Continue to Support Disaster Relief</strong>. We don’t hear much about Haiti or the Gulf Coast on the news these days, but these disasters are in need of much support. Here are a few ideas: Adopt a Brown Pelican through the <a title="International Bird Rescue" href="http://www.ibrrc.org/donate.html" target="_blank">International Bird Rescue Research Center</a>, which picks up oiled birds, cleans and rehabilitates them. Or provide direct support to those facing financial devastation due to the Gulf Coast spill by donating at <a title="Protect Your Coastline" href="http://www.protectyourcoastline.org" target="_blank">Protect Your Coastline</a>. For Haiti and other world disasters, consider supporting an organization like <a title="Doctors without Borders" href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a>, which sends medical and non-medical aid workers to countries whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe.</p>
<p>15. <strong>Say &#8220;I Do&#8221; to Charitable Weddings</strong>. Tying the knot this year? Consider creating a charitable gift registry through the I Do Foundation and its many retail and nonprofit partners.</p>
<p>16. <strong>Celebrate with Small Acts of Kindness</strong>. Valentine&#8217;s Day isn&#8217;t the only holiday this week: February 14-20th is Random Acts of Kindness Week. What can you do?

</div>
<p>Moms, I’m going to be honest with you. There are some days when my dear, sweet, lovely children have driven me to the point of my head imploding.  When they have whined the 1,237th &#8220;Mommy!&#8221; and have managed to have about 35 mini-tragedies in nine minutes (&#8220;He took my Polly Pocket and tried to flush her down the toilet!&#8221; &#8220;She ripped all the wheels off my favorite hot wheels and is now trying to eat them!&#8221;). We all have <em>those days</em>.</p>
<p>But, fear not.</p>
<p>There is one place a mom can go to get away from it all:</p>
<p>The bathroom.</p>
<p>My sanctuary.  My domain. My sweet escape.</p>
<p>The kids and hubby may think I’m in there taking a shower or plucking my brows. But what I’m really doing is trying to hang onto that last shred of sanity I have left.</p>
<p>After many years of attempting this escape, there are a few things I’ve learned.</p>
<p>First and foremost rule: <strong><em>Lock the door.</em></strong> This is extremely important. Do this the split second you rush in there. But here’s the key: try to do this quietly. Because if little ears have any inkling you are in there, the jig is up.</p>
<p>If they do notice you are in the bathroom (correction: <strong><em>when</em></strong> they notice) you must take evasive action as quickly as possible. <strong><em>Turn on the fan.</em></strong> This will help drown out the inevitable knocking and pleading outside the door (mostly from my husband who has spent a grand total of 5 minutes dealing with the kids on his own).</p>
<p>Okay, now the door is locked. You’ve made it. You’re safe. You are officially in a room that is separate from your loved ones. It’s an exhilarating feeling, I know.  You are alone and no one can come in (barring using a screwdriver to take the hinges off the door, which my son once informed me he was going to attempt). </p>
<p>You are now leaning against the door, breathing huge sighs, trying to regain your composure. For a brief second you may even remember the “old you”, the one who had two seconds to form a complete thought…remember her? No, me neither. Sadly, this feeling is fleeting.  So what do you do now with this glorious alone time?</p>
<p>Any mom knows that you need a bathroom survival kit. You need supplies that will enable you to spend as much time in there as humanly possible. Spending it actually doing bathroom type things is not an option. You have to clear your head. Keep it together. Your very soul is on the line here, woman!</p>
<p>Find a place to rest.  Naturally the toilet is a good spot. Close the lid <em>ever </em>so quietly and plunk your tired butt down for a second. Go ahead, Mom. It’s okay. You deserve it. Sit there and breathe. Close your eyes and utter “Serenity Now” over and over until you actually believe it. It worked for Kramer.</p>
<p>Next, grab something to read. I like to have plenty of guilty pleasure trashy magazines on hand. I keep a stack of Good Housekeeping, People, Ladies’ Home Journal, maybe even the occasional Cosmo. For those rare times that I manage to slip into my sanctuary unnoticed, I try to have my favorite book on hand. Or maybe even stash your iPad under the towels. Think of all the things you can accomplish surfing the net sitting on your cozy fuzzy pink toilet seat. </p>
<p>If kids/hubby are inexplicably fascinated with your bathroom excursion and are suddenly outside the door acting like Armageddon is just around the corner, you might need to actually turn the shower on for a minute and run a little water. This might buy you another few minutes.</p>
<p>If they persist and the whining grows louder, I occasionally have to resort to yelling out: “I’m BUSY!!!!” I am usually surprised at how irritated I sound when I yell out these words. It comes out as a growl most times, but I try not to let on that my loved ones are slowly stripping away layers of my sanity.</p>
<p>After my growl, there is always a moment of stunned silence behind the door. So I’ll add a meek and sweet comment like “just a second, okay? I’ll be right out!” to lighten the mood. We don’t want our family thinking Mom is thisclose to cracking now do we? Keep the illusion alive.</p>
<p>And then I sit there in silence at least another five minutes, flipping through my People, reading about Angelina Jolie and her kids. That woman has it so easy.</p>
<p>I bet she has at least five or six bathrooms to hide in.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How a late-night Luddite accidentally fought his way back into bedrooms (and computers, smartphones, and tablets) across America.</strong></p>
<p><em>By Douglas Alden Warshaw, contributor</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/conan_obrien2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-51400" title="conan_obrien2" src="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/conan_obrien2.jpg?w=240&#038;h=320" alt="" width="240" height="320" /></a>Conan O’Brien is in his bedroom. It’s a little bit past 11 p.m., and he’s shyly, hesitantly, nervously attempting to do his first webcast. But he keeps getting interrupted. And it’s driving him crazy. “Get out of my room! Get out of my room! This is private!” O’Brien’s embarrassed, and he’s yelling at the top of his lungs. “Everybody get out!!!”</p>
<p>Okay, that’s part of a skit from O’Brien’s new late-night show, <em>Conan</em>, on TBS. But, almost exactly a year ago, more than a few people in the media business thought that O’Brien, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/news/companies/1012/gallery.business_dumbest_moments_2010.fortune/12.html">freshly tossed off <em>The Tonight Show</em></a> by NBC after only seven months on the job, just might have to sit in his bedroom for a long time, and that performing a show on the web might actually be his only option. That was until more than a million people, most of them ages 18 to 49, started shouting, “We want Coco!” and the reinvention of Conan O’Brien from traditional television performer to multimedia brand began.</p>
<p>O’Brien’s audience came to his rescue in a way that was inconceivable until it happened. In fact, it was inconceivable even while it was happening.<span id="more-51240"></span></p>
<p>O’Brien’s brief tenure on <em>The Tonight Show </em>began in May 2009 with ratings so high that Jeff Zucker, then president and CEO of NBC Universal, proclaimed him the “new king of late night.” But the new king wore his crown uneasily, in part because the old king, Jay Leno, had been installed almost directly in front of him with <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2009/fortune/0912/gallery.dumbest_moments_2009.fortune/19.html">a new show at 10 o’clock</a> that was supposed to revolutionize primetime and, instead, ended up revolting the NBC affiliates. NBC’s solution to the crisis <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/10/news/companies/nbc_leno_late_night/index.htm">was to offer Leno his old time slot back</a> for another new, half-hour show, and push <em>The Tonight Show </em>back from 11:35 p.m. to 12:05 a.m. Informed of the plan, O’Brien considered his options and, five days later, on Jan. 12, 2010, hit the send button on an e-mail he’d stayed up most of the night composing at home. The e-mail began “People of the Earth” and made it clear to everyone that he was unwilling to host a <em>Tonight Show</em> that actually started tomorrow. And that’s half the story of the beginning of the social-media revolution that forever changed the landscape of late-night TV.</p>
<p>The other half?</p>
<p>By pure coincidence, at the same time Conan O’Brien was working on his e-mail in his Brentwood home, just about a 30-minute car ride away a 25-year-old graphic artist and diehard fan named Mike Mitchell was also pulling an all-nighter at home, creating a graphic image of his hero standing in front of an American flag, emblazoned with the words I&#8217;M WITH COCO. The image was reminiscent of the Obama poster created by Shepard Fairey, and the name “Coco” was a nickname coined by Tom Hanks when he was the second guest on O’Brien’s <em>Tonight</em> show. (It is a nickname Conan dislikes &#8212; the first time he heard it, he told Hanks, “That catches on, I’ll sue you” &#8212; but catch on it did.) Mitchell posted his “I’m with Coco” image on his own site, then created a new “I’m with Coco” Facebook page and Twitter account, and then at 4 a.m. he went to bed. When he woke up at noon, he was shocked to discover that more than 30,000 people were following his new Twitter feed, close to 10,000 had clicked LIKE on his new Facebook page, and an untold number were making his “I’m with Coco” graphic their own profile picture on Facebook. Two days later, “I’m with Coco” had 185,000 Twitter followers, and just a week after Mitchell’s all-nighter the number was 700,000.</p>
<p>That was barely a year ago, but it was before most television executives understood what Twitter was. In fact, it was before Conan O’Brien, age 47, understood what Twitter was. “I’m a Luddite when it comes to computers,” says the man who keeps a bust of Teddy Roosevelt prominently in his office. “I didn’t do Twitter. Didn’t understand why anyone would do Twitter. I’m not on Facebook.” But now, suddenly, NBC executives were telling O’Brien to “stop it,” and O’Brien was saying, “Stop what? It’s not me.” And it wasn’t. It was Gen X and Gen Y.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Conan discovers the digital divide </strong></p>
<p>“This is something about myself as a performer that I’ve never understood,” says O’Brien, who tries to understand everything about himself. “When I started doing television, I always thought I was doing it for my peers, and I quickly found out that the real hard-core fans were much younger than me.” O’Brien’s younger audience then and now is on the digital side of the digital divide. It’s an audience that doesn’t want to be just an audience &#8212; they want to be participants. They love being connected to one another and to the celebrity objects of their affection; they love posting and creating and remixing. Culturally they’re very different from the baby boomers who watch most network television &#8212; and the boomers who program network television &#8212; and they’re a bit pissed off at them too. And that meant that, as much as they loved Conan, they were equally pissed off at Jay Leno:</p>
<p><em>I think Conan O’brien is 10 times funnier and better than Leno.. I say he stays and Leno goes. time for Leno to retire. Who is with me on this </em></p>
<p>“The boomers have overstayed their welcome,” declares the man credited by many with creating the phrase “viral video,” Douglas Rushkoff, the author most recently of <em>Program or Be Programmed</em>, a book about digital media. “Generation X is finally at the stage where they can have the jobs the boomers had, and the economy crashes. There’s nothing left for them: There’s no Social Security; there’s nowhere to invest. Conan was a great stand-in for the frustration with this never-ending boomer legacy.”</p>
<p>“There was this huge explosion online of protests and anger, but also creativity,” O’Brien says. “People were making really funny art and posters.” A statistical breakdown of comments tweeted found almost 40% to be anti-NBC and anti-Leno. “It overwhelmed them,” O’Brien’s agent, Rick Rosen, says. “And to this day it’s affected the perception of NBC and Jay Leno.” Indeed, though O’Brien’s new show is on basic cable, on occasion it has beaten Leno’s <em>Tonight Show</em> in the ratings demographic that advertisers love, those 18 to 49. Its viewers have a median age of 31, more than 24 years younger than Leno’s or David Letterman’s. For advertisers that’s a remarkable statistic.</p>
<p>Thanks to Twitter and Facebook, and the fact that America loves to watch a car wreck, during the last two weeks of O’Brien’s <em>Tonight Show</em>, fan rallies spontaneously sprouted up all across the country (mostly outside NBC affiliates), and O’Brien’s ratings shot up. But O’Brien’s letter to the people of the earth &#8212; which in the digital age turned out to be a letter read by tens of millions &#8212; and his refusal to move the <em>Tonight Show</em> to 12:05, meant it was over. And on Jan. 23, after taping his last broadcast, Conan O’Brien, a guy who had been a staple of late-night television for 17 years, no longer had a show. Nor did he have a Facebook or Twitter account yet. But he did have <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/22/news/companies/NBC_Conan_financial_fallout/index.htm">a $45 million payout from NBC</a> &#8212; $32.5 million for himself and $12.5 million for his staff, over 50 of whom had moved with him from New York, where <em>Late Night With Conan O’Brien </em>was produced, to Los Angeles to work on <em>The Tonight Show </em>less than a year earlier. Still, O’Brien’s heart and mind remained planted in old media.</p>
<p><strong>Conan discovers Twitter </strong></p>
<p>“You know that scene in the first<em> Indiana Jones</em> movie where he gets thrown through the truck windshield by a Nazi? I was thrown through the windshield of broadcasting,” O’Brien says, a bit wistfully. “I made a decision and that decision very quickly led to me walking away from the crown jewel of old broadcasting and, in addition to that, being legally prohibited from going on television.” NBC’s final separation agreement prohibited O’Brien from performing a show on another network for eight months, until September of last year, and from making disparaging comments about NBC Studios, Jay Leno, Jeff Zucker, and a small group of other NBC executives. “What was interesting about it,” points out O’Brien, “is that all the legal prohibitions were coming from people in the old media. They were saying you can’t do all these things, and pretty quickly we realized, ‘Wait a minute!’ Someone said, ‘Does that include Twitter? No. It doesn’t include Twitter.’ And so I started tweeting.”</p>
<p>Around seven o’clock in the morning on Feb. 24, 2010 &#8212; a day that lives in social-media history &#8212; O’Brien, sitting in his living room with his core team, including his longtime executive producer, Jeff Ross, and his former show blogger, Aaron Bleyaert, opened up a Twitter account, typed fewer than 140 characters, and hit the SEND TWEET button:</p>
<p><em>Today I interviewed a squirrel in my backyard and then threw to commercial. Somebody help me. </em></p>
<p>Bleyaert, who has his own massive following on Twitter, quickly re-tweeted it. The next thing he knew “it was like a skyrocket!” Every minute or so Bleyaert would refresh his browser, and O’Brien’s account would have hundreds of new followers. Every minute. For hours. “I’m just sitting there laughing and laughing. I’m like, ‘You guys, this is insane.’ And they’re like, ‘Okay.’ And I was like, ‘No! You have no idea how crazy this is!’ ”</p>
<p>O’Brien shakes his head at the memory. “Aaron’s saying, ‘You’re up to 250,000’ or something, and I would say, ‘I don’t know what that means.’ ” It meant that O’Brien was setting the single-day record for gathering followers on Twitter.</p>
<p>Just as quickly, O’Brien’s team began to hear that NBC was far from happy. “The network isn’t crazy about you tweeting. They’re not sure that’s cool,” O’Brien recalls being told. His response was simple: “Tell them I would be thrilled if they shut down my Twitter account. I’d love it if that got out. You think PR’s been bad up till now? Wait till you take away my Twitter account.” Today O’Brien laughs at the old-media disconnect of that moment: He is approaching 2.5 million followers.</p>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/fortune/1102/gallery.conans_cheep_publicity.fortune">Read Conan&#8217;s tweets to his fans</a></p>
<p>O’Brien’s next step was to give himself a job, hosting a traveling show he called the “Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour.” He did it to support his staff, especially his show’s eight-piece band, which had not received a severance package from NBC; to try to keep himself relevant; and to accommodate his wife, who wanted him out of the house.</p>
<p>Ross and the rest of the team booked a 30-city tour. They had a website built for ticket orders, acquired a sponsor (American Express (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AXP">AXP</a>)), and began to talk about the advertising budget for the tour. That’s when Ross, six years older than Conan and up to then just as mired in old media, matter-of-factly said, “Let’s hold off on taking any ads and just tweet it out.” Now it’s Ross’s turn to shake his head. “People looked at me like I was crazy. But I was like, ‘What’s the risk? If it doesn’t work in two days, we can advertise.’ And it turned out to be a good idea.”</p>
<p>Actually, it turned out to be an amazing idea.</p>
<p><em>Hey Internet: I’m headed to your town on a half-assed comedy &amp; music tour. Go to http://TeamCoco. com for tix. I repeat: it’s half-assed. </em></p>
<p>In a matter of hours, both New York shows at Radio City Music Hall had sold out. Then, across the country, one show after another sold out. And then the site crashed. “The first day we sold, like, 120,000 tickets,” Ross recalls. “We spent no money on advertising.” The tour sold out in a couple of days. Once again, Conan had typed fewer than 140 characters, only this time he had changed the concert promotion business forever. O’Brien was definitely keeping himself relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Conan discovers that performing now means engaging </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_51384" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 350px"><strong><strong><a href="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/conan_fans.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-51384" title="conan_fans" src="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/conan_fans.jpg?w=340&#038;h=255" alt="" width="340" height="255" /></a></strong></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">O&#039;Brien mobbed by fans in Seattle on his &quot;Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour&quot;</p></div>
<p>The tour lasted 60 days, and before it was over O’Brien and Ross’s outlook on new media and social networking and what it all could mean for their next television show had completely changed. Suddenly O’Brien wasn’t just performing for fans; he was also engaging in a conversation with them.</p>
<p>Just before each show Bleyaert would tweet a new hashtag (which allowed Twitter users to form a single conversation stream that everyone in the audience could follow), and then members of O’Brien’s team would monitor the tweets from audience members to one another. Between his bits, O’Brien would come backstage and ask, “How’s the tweets? How’s the audience?” By reading the hashtag stream, Bleyaert recalls, O’Brien and his team could see, for example, that “some guy in the fifth row was using Twitter to try and pick up a ‘girl in the white hat, three rows in front of the stage,’ ” and O’Brien would instantly incorporate that into his next bit. He was tapping into his improvisational roots &#8212; he had been a member of the Groundlings, the legendary Los Angeles improv group whose alumni include Will Ferrell, Phil Hartman, Laraine Newman, and Jimmy Fallon &#8212; but now he was “improv-ing” based on digital information gathered in real time.</p>
<p>For O’Brien and his team, the tour was a digital baptism. Bleyaert remembers thinking, “It was like he was thrown off one stage into the great digital mosh pit, and all his digital fans are passing him around, and then they threw him back up on stage. And he was changed.”</p>
<p>By the start of the tour, O’Brien had a new deal for an 11 p.m. show on TBS (which is owned by Time Warner (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TWX">TWX</a>), which is also the parent company of <em>Fortune</em>). The budget is smaller than that at NBC &#8212; TBS puts up $45 million a year, vs. <em>The Tonight Show </em>budget of $75 million (every member of O’Brien’s 100-person staff took pay cuts, some as much as 20%) &#8212; but O’Brien is in control of all the on-air creative and, just as important, all the digital use of his content. He and his production company Conaco own the show. Among the other late-night talent &#8212; Leno, David Letterman, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Craig Ferguson, and Jimmy Fallon &#8212; Letterman is the only host who owns his show. It’s the opposite of O’Brien’s setup at NBC, says Ross, a partner in the company. “Conaco owns the show, and TBS is a participant. At <em>Tonight</em>, NBC owned the show, and we were participants.” And ownership makes all the difference for O’Brien and his team.</p>
<p>Team Coco, not TBS, chooses which clips to use, edits them, and posts them. Preview clips from each night’s taping go up an hour before the show’s East Coast broadcast; within an hour after the show’s West Coast broadcast more than a half-dozen clips from that night’s show are posted on its site and Facebook, and linked to via Twitter; and the full show is viewable online the next day at 11 a.m. Eastern time. Last year at <em>The Tonight Show </em>Bleyaert had tried to get pre-show clips posted, but even that seemingly simple idea was difficult to execute because NBC.com ran the show’s site, and putting up such clips wasn’t part of its normal workflow process. “After the experience that we had at NBC, we wanted to be in control,” says O’Brien’s agent, Rosen. “We wanted the freedom to exploit our content.”</p>
<p>To fully utilize his content digitally, O’Brien started a second company, Team Coco. There’s no TBS show site. Instead, TBS funds the new company’s first $2 million of expenses and participates in any profits. Team Coco is now a studio of eight Gen X and Gen Y employees, all except Bleyaert hired by new GM–executive producer John Wooden, a self-described “mega-nerd who specializes in producing allegedly entertaining digital media” and has started or run a dozen or so sites, including Jokes.com, Maxim.com, and WhiteHouse.org. Wooden, 39, views Conan above all as a brand, and his social networks as a content system through which to carry the brand as far and wide as possible. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare, Flickr, and Tumblr (a blogging/ sharing site) are what Wooden calls core “content satellites.”</p>
<p>All told, Team Coco touches more than 5 million people each month, many of them primarily consumers of O’Brien’s brand of humor online. “A lot of television executives still have the idea that a show is something everybody watches,” O’Brien says using an old-fashioned voice: “ ‘Let’s gather around the TV set and watch it, and then let’s talk about it with all our friends at work tomorrow.’ Well, your friends didn’t watch the same show that you did, and they also didn’t watch it at the same time.” And it no longer bothers O’Brien if that’s the case with his show. As long as they’re consuming it, any time, any place will do.</p>
<p>O’Brien and his team have taken this message to the Hollywood PR machine, which looks at them as digital pioneers instead of guys who got to the party late. Weeks before <em>Conan </em>made its debut on TBS, O’Brien gave a presentation to top publicists in his new studio on the Warner Bros. lot. He and his digital staff explained that a guest’s appearance on <em>Conan </em>was no longer just about being on air for 10 minutes; it was a connection to O’Brien’s full social network of millions of fans &#8212; a connection that could last for days or even months. “The same goes for their charities and pet projects,” says Wooden. “We’re ramping up our efforts to be producing digitally exclusive content with either guests on the show or people who can’t appear because of scheduling conflicts.”</p>
<p>O’Brien’s digital team has also reached out to media outlets like the Huffington Post, the Daily Beast, and Entertainment Weekly, and even to bloggers like Perez Hilton to make sure they’re always in the know about new clips from the show, which they can publish on their own sites (using Team Coco’s player, with Team Coco’s ads, recording Team Coco clicks, of course). This gives those sites content that they crave and also acts as a promotional tool, but more important, it distributes <em>Conan </em>content as quickly as possible, which is crucial to discouraging piracy. “There’s no need for some kid to become a bedroom programmer if the clips are already out there,” says Wooden. “Our job is to give them the tools to share, so they don’t have to rip.”</p>
<p>Finally, Team Coco has taken over the administration of Mike Mitchell’s “I’m with Coco” Facebook page (for an undisclosed amount of money). The page now has more than 1.1 million “friends,” but “it’s still totally fan-generated,” Wooden points out. “We want it to remain true to its origins.” The show’s official Facebook page, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/teamcoco?v=app_7146470109">Facebook .com/TeamCoco</a>, was started in August and now has over 500,000 fans. The company also maintains two Twitter feeds: <a href="http://twitter.com/TeamCoco">Twitter.com/TeamCoco</a> is where all the announcements, clips, contests, and staff posts are sent from, while <a href="http://twitter.com/ConanObrien">Twitter.com/ConanObrien</a> is O’Brien’s personal account, on which he sends out one or two tweets a day.</p>
<p><strong>Conan’s team discovers a digital dilemma</strong></p>
<p>It’s 6:15 p.m. on the Warner Bros. lot, and Jeff Ross and John Wooden are trying to figure out what to do about Finland. Recently, more than a dozen Facebook pages have cropped up with names like: “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Conan-OBrien-Come-Back-to-Finland/291760509661">Conan-OBrien-Come-Back-to-Finland</a>,” all of them originating from the country that created Nokia (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NOK">NOK</a>) and Angry Birds.</p>
<p>O’Brien has been a hit in Finland since 2006, when his old<em> Late Night</em> show did a recurring bit about how much he looked like the (female) President of the country, Tarja Halonen. Eventually, O’Brien endorsed her for reelection (she won), and the show even shot a special in Finland. But TBS, unlike NBC, doesn’t have a Finnish distribution deal in place yet for <em>Conan</em>.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should just stream it to them,” Ross begins thinking out loud. “Is that counterproductive as far as getting us sold in Finland? Maybe it doesn’t matter. It’s not geo-blocked in Finland right now, right?” Not the clips, but “full episodes are,” replies Wooden.</p>
<p>For another minute they try to think through the pluses and minuses of unblocking the full show. “We need to sit down with the Warner Bros. distribution guys,” says Ross. He pauses for a moment, a sheepish smile crossing his face. “This is a conversation that never would have happened at NBC.” Of course, that wasn’t entirely NBC’s fault. “I didn’t know two months ago that you could geo-block,” Ross freely admits. “I thought you put it on your website and anybody around the world could get it. Apparently, that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>As of now, if you’re in Finland, you’re still limited to clips. But odds are that Halonen and her constituents will be able to see the full show soon, one way or another.</p>
<p><a href="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/multimedia_audience_numbers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51386" title="multimedia_audience_numbers" src="http://fortunebrainstormtech.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/multimedia_audience_numbers.jpg?w=612&#038;h=338" alt="" width="612" height="338" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Conan considers the future (and the past)</strong></p>
<p>“When I was a little boy, I remember watching <em>The Tonight Show</em> with Johnny Carson and thinking, ‘Some day I’m going to host that show &#8212; for seven months.’ ” &#8211;Tonight Show <em>monologue, O’Brien’s last week on the air</em></p>
<p>Like millions of other Americans, Conan O’Brien’s life has been disrupted by the digital world, and he’s been forced to reinvent himself. YouTube, TiVo (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TIVO">TIVO</a>), Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms have greatly diminished the cultural relevance of <em>The Tonight Show</em>, whose overall audience has shrunk 44%, from 5.6 million a night to 3.9 million, over the past five years, and whose key 18- to-49 demographic has shrunk from 2.4 million to 1.4 million during that time. O’Brien had worked his whole professional life with one goal in mind, to get to host <em>The Tonight Show</em>, and he got there, but he was born 10 years too late for it to really matter. Accidentally, however, he’s learned how to innovate and make the <em>Conan </em>brand mean even more than <em>The Tonight Show</em> brand to a young, passionate, and growing audience.</p>
<p>O’Brien sits back in his office, guitar in hand, trying to make sense of his personal and digital evolution. First he thinks it through as a performer: “The Beatles were trying to be the Everly Brothers, and they couldn’t quite pull it off. Elvis really wanted to sound like Dean Martin. But, you know, by failing …” He stops and starts again. “You have an image in your head of this iconic person. For me, it might have been Johnny Carson, where you grow up with him, and you think, ‘Well, that’s who I need to be’ &#8212; to realize that feeling I had when I was 8, sitting in my parents’ house and watching him. And then things happen, and you think, ‘Oh, my God, I didn’t &#8212; that fell apart.’ But it’s the failure to be that person or to completely follow through on what he did that leads you to something that’s much better.”</p>
<p>Then O’Brien thinks it through like a digital-media guy. “Ten years ago, if my situation with NBC had unfolded, none of this would have happened. Yeah, maybe I was 10 years too late to do <em>The Tonight Show</em> that I wanted to do,” he says. “But I was just in the nick of time. Do you know what I mean?”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://cwstapp.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cws0334w_100.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1864" title="_CWS0334w_100" src="http://cwstapp.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cws0334w_100.jpg?w=384&#038;h=258" alt="" width="384" height="258" /></a>&#8220;Climbing is a series of calculated risks.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is usually my response when people ask me about the dangers of mountain climbing. Although it is partly tongue-in-cheek, there is a lot of truth to it as well.  I would  be lying to say that there aren&#8217;t risks associated with climbing.  But there are risks associated when you step out your front door too.  That is what risk management is all about. I usually add to that original statement that, in climbing, you know the risks when you head out, you prepare for them and you have a plan if things don&#8217;t turn out the way you expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussions about the dangers of mountain climbing are usually followed with questions of what mountain climbing is like.  Do you scale sheer ice walls with those little ice pick thingies and dangle hundreds of feet in the air?  No, you don&#8217;t.  That is ice climbing.   Although there are various techniques used depending on the peak, mountain climbing in its most simple form is&#8230;walking on snow.  Yes there is more to it than just that, but generally to get to a summit, you walk up there.   Typically you are roped together in a 3-4 person team and you have other safety tools like an ice-ax and crampons.  However, it also helps to know why you have those items and what to do with them and that is where snow school comes in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On any guided trip there are the basic lessons that you will learn before you set out to climb a mountain.  Walking, maintaining your balance, using crampons, roping up with a team, falling and self arrest are all topics covered in a snow school course. The initial lesson might not even be what you think would be the first skill to learn. No it isn&#8217;t self arrest (stopping your self in the event of a fall), its walking on snow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://cwstapp.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cws0076w_100.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1865" title="_CWS0076w_100" src="http://cwstapp.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cws0076w_100.jpg?w=282&#038;h=420" alt="" width="282" height="420" /></a>It makes sense if you think about it; preventing a fall in the first place is easier that stopping yourself if you did fall. Once you get comfortable walking around on a mild, snowy, slope you move into how your balance plays into it.  You learn about being &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out of&#8221; balance on steep slopes, while walking and stopping for breaks.   You learn how to be efficient while climbing and use the rest-step and breathing techniques to help you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you add crampons and ice-ax to the mix. It is more embarrassing than dangerous but most everyone has at one time or another &#8220;cramponed&#8221; themself in the pant leg with one of those 10-points on your crampons.  So you learn how and when to use your ice-ax and crampons so that you can avoid that occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the skill building for balance and walking, you learn how to fall.  Or more importantly how to stop yourself. Self-Arrest is the term used but really what it is, is more practice and making it second nature in the event something should happen.  Your self-arrest techniques doesn&#8217;t have to look, it just needs to work. So you fall feet first, head first, and sideways.  You fall by yourself and then roped together with your team so you know how your climbing partners can help you and vice versa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is some psychology to snow school and what you might not realize during all of these lessons is; you are building your confidence, learning new skills and working together as a team. You practice, because practice makes perfect. Then you climb. While you are out there, you realize you&#8217;re not afraid of heights, your just savoring a view that most don&#8217;t get to see. And more importantly, you&#8217;re no longer afraid of falling, because your prepared.</p>

<p>Tough economic times, and a growing desire to be more &#8220;green&#8221; has led to a renaissance from creative architects looking to find cheaper, more creative ways to design spaces.  Ports around the world are overflowing with used, empty shipping containers, but now they are being repurposed to create funky residential and commercial structures.  Shipping containers aren&#8217;t for everybody, and their limited width and height do create some limitations, but with a bit of imagination you can do some pretty amazing things with these versatile boxes.</p>

<div id="attachment_1019" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://jodyforehand.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/shipping-container-office.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1019" title="Shipping Container Office and Home" src="http://jodyforehand.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/shipping-container-office.jpg?w=300&#038;h=448" alt="Shipping Container Office and Home" width="300" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shipping Container Office and Home</p></div>
<p>First, to use these as occupied buildings, you have to insulate them, heat and cool them, add electricity and add plumbing.  All of those elements will encroach on the already cramped dimensions if you have to fit these elements within the exterior skin, but it can be done.  The walls between units can also come out, and the ceilings and floors can be removed to create multiple volume spaces, but any more extensive demolition of the framing begins to break down the cost effectiveness of the system as well as the &#8220;green&#8221; benefits of reusing these containers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Puma City is a traveling store that is touring the world, and will eventually be &#8220;parked&#8221; somewhere to become a showcase store for Puma.  It is made up of 24 containers stacked and offset from each other with strategically removed walls and floors to create amazing interior spaces and cool exterior decks.</p>
<p>Obvious other uses for these containers are for classrooms and small living quarters, like hotels or apartments (see the picture of the infill office/house that is made of 4 stacked shipping containers squeezed between existing buildings on either side).  Shipping containers do well in a stacked arrangement because the steel frames were originally designed to be stacked like Legos on board ships.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations mentioned previously regarding insulation, electrical, and mechanical systems, another cost-effective and creative use for these boxes is as an inexpensive &#8220;skin&#8221; to create a large interior volume like these pictures of the Nomadic Museum.  The &#8220;walls&#8221; are stacked shipping containers that create a large interior gallery, and the whole museum is taken on tour to ports of call around the world. The containers themselves can store all the parts and exhibits during transit.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.VisioneeringStudios.com" target="_blank">Visioneering Studios</a> we&#8217;re currently working on a church project incorporating shipping containers as interior spaces inside a pre-engineered metal building to create a funky, cost-conscious, and &#8220;green&#8221; youth facility.  I hope to share pictures of that with you in the near future, once the design develops further.</p>
<p>Would you like to live, work, or worship in a shipping container?  Keep your eyes open because they may be coming to a city near you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been wanting to do this for a while now&#8230; but I needed a little inspiration. Thanks so much Julie @ <a title="Whole Chicken" href="http://www.thelittlekitchen.net/2011/02/03/whole-chicken-in-a-slow-cooker/" target="_blank">The Little Kitchen</a> !</p>
<p>With the temptation of a delicious  rotisserie chicken at a steal of a price for just $6.99 and ready to eat, it&#8217;s so hard to turn down. And the stores are smart, they always have these sitting on a warmer, right near the checkout. Normally, I&#8217;d just grab one and go, but not this time; this time I sacked up and bought a little raw 4.5 lb fryer chicken, some veggies and herbs, and set out on a culinary adventure. Not only does it give me the satisfaction of knowing I cooked a tasty chicken from scratch, but also it gives me the liberty to incorporate different flavors with much less sodium! Score!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how the fun process works:</strong></p>
<p>First, grate some lemon peel<strong>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05922.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1129" title="DSC05922" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05922.jpg?w=482&#038;h=361" alt="" width="482" height="361" /></a></p>
<p>Combine lemon peel with chopped fresh rosemary and thyme, and some salt and pepper and a pad of  butter.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05924.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1130" title="DSC05924" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05924.jpg?w=476&#038;h=358" alt="" width="476" height="358" /></a></p>
<p>Rub the herb butter on chicken breast, underneath the skin. This will  make it super moist and extra tasty!</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05925.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1131 alignnone" title="DSC05925" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05925.jpg?w=352&#038;h=264" alt="" width="352" height="264" /></a><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05927.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1133" title="DSC05927" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05927.jpg?w=353&#038;h=264" alt="" width="353" height="264" /></a></p>
<p>Coarsely chop carrots, celery, and onion.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05929.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135" title="DSC05929" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05929.jpg?w=462&#038;h=385" alt="" width="462" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>Make the Spice Rub and apply to the skin of the chicken&#8230;.really rub it on there good,  you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05933.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1136" title="DSC05933" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05933.jpg?w=377&#038;h=281" alt="" width="377" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Then stuff the cavity of the chicken with a few handfuls of veggies, along with a quartered lemon and a sprig of rosemary.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05937.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1137" title="DSC05937" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05937.jpg?w=344&#038;h=258" alt="" width="344" height="258" /></a><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05938.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1138" title="DSC05938" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05938.jpg?w=346&#038;h=258" alt="" width="346" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>I bet right now you are getting so excited that you are almost ready to get your little guy cooking. I know that I was so giddy&#8230; but first, you should infuse some olive oil with a few smashed cloves of garlic and rosemary.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05939.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1139" title="DSC05939" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05939.jpg?w=492&#038;h=369" alt="" width="492" height="369" /></a></p>
<p>Put the chicken in, breast-side down to brown for 5 minutes. Add the remainder of the veggies around the chicken.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05941.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1140" title="DSC05941" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05941.jpg?w=561&#038;h=421" alt="" width="561" height="421" /></a></p>
<p>Flip the chicken over, breast-side up, and let other side brown for another 5 minutes. I threw some more thyme on top too, just for fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05947.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1144" title="DSC05947" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05947.jpg?w=579&#038;h=435" alt="" width="579" height="435" /></a>Put the lid on the <em>b-e-a-utiful</em> dutch oven, and put in the oven.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05943.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1142" title="DSC05943" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05943.jpg?w=521&#038;h=392" alt="" width="521" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, pull it out and pour in the wine along with placing  the quartered potatoes on top. Put the top back on and pop back in the oven for another half n hour or so.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05946.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1143" title="DSC05946" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05946.jpg?w=275&#038;h=366" alt="" width="275" height="366" /></a><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05952.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1147" title="DSC05952" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05952.jpg?w=272&#038;h=364" alt="" width="272" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>Check done-ness with instant thermometer (our new kitchen tool, compliments of Lauren&#8217;s dad, Thanks Mike!)</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05953.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1148" title="DSC05953" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05953.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>Take chicken out of the pot, and set on cutting board (with grooves, so juice doesn&#8217;t flow all over the place), cover with foil for 20 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05958.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1150" title="DSC05958" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05958.jpg?w=365&#038;h=273" alt="" width="365" height="273" /></a><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05960.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1151" title="DSC05960" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05960.jpg?w=363&#038;h=273" alt="" width="363" height="273" /></a></p>
<p>Transfer the potatoes to a bowl.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05964.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1152" title="DSC05964" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05964.jpg?w=534&#038;h=400" alt="" width="534" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Add in parmesan cheese, chopped rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper, a pad of butter, and some milk. Get smashing, until preferred texture.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05965.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1153" title="DSC05965" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05965.jpg?w=347&#038;h=259" alt="" width="347" height="259" /></a><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05967.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1154" title="DSC05967" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05967.jpg?w=351&#038;h=262" alt="" width="351" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>Strain out the juices from the solids, applying a little pressure on the solids to help the process, and discard them. Then let the juices settle and spoon out the fat, which is that whole top layer. Cook the remaining juice with lemon juice and serve this &#8220;sauce&#8221; with the chicken &amp; smashed potatoes!</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1155 alignnone" title="DSC05969" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05969.jpg?w=273&#038;h=365" alt="" width="273" height="365" /><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05971.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1156" title="DSC05971" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05971.jpg?w=334&#038;h=251" alt="" width="334" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, chop up some onions, green bell pepper, and trim some asparagus. Drizzle with olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar, and sprinkle with garlic salt. Let bake in the oven for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05956.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1149" title="DSC05956" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05956.jpg?w=437&#038;h=328" alt="" width="437" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>Plate the chicken, smashed potatoes, and crispy balsamic veggies&#8230; and you have an amazing 100% home-cooked 3 dish dinner!!</p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05976.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1157" title="DSC05976" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05976.jpg?w=556&#038;h=417" alt="" width="556" height="417" /></a></p>

<p>4 red potatoes, cleaned and quartered</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Spice rub:</span> (1 tsp cayenne pepper, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper) This combination was inspired from <a title="The Little Kitchen: Whole Chicken in a Slow Cooker" href="http://www.thelittlekitchen.net/2011/02/03/whole-chicken-in-a-slow-cooker/" target="_blank">The Little Kitchen blog</a></p>
<p><a href="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05977.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1158" title="DSC05977" src="http://fromthelittleyellowkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05977.jpg?w=485&#038;h=364" alt="" width="485" height="364" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Chicken Directions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and arrange racks to make room for dutch oven.</p>
<p>2. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season outside with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">spice rub </span>(see directions above).</p>
<p>3. Mix butter, rosemary, thyme, and lemon peel and distribute evenly underneath the skin, atop the chicken breast. Stuff the chicken cavity with the carrots, celery, onions, 4 cloves smashed garlic, sprig of rosemary, 2-3 wedges of lemon.</p>
<p>4. In a large Dutch oven over high,  heat the oil and add small sprig of rosemary (only the leaves) along with 3 smashed cloves of garlic to infuse the oil. Add the chicken, breast-side down.  Scatter the remaining onion, celery, and carrots around  chicken.</p>
<p>5. Cook until the breast is lightly  browned, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken breast-side up and cook another  6 to 8 minutes. Add in the wine.</p>
<p>6. Cover with lid and transfer the pot to the oven and  cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when  inserted in thickest part of breast and 175 degrees in thickest part of  thigh, about 60 to 80 minutes. Halfway through, throw the quartered red potatoes on top, close the lid and return to oven.</p>
<p>7. Once it&#8217;s finished cooking, first take out the quartered potatoes and put aside, in a medium bowl. Then, transfer the chicken to carving board, tent with foil and let rest for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>8. Now the fat has to be separated from the juice. While the chicken is resting, strain chicken juices  from the pot through fine-mesh strainer into a glass measuring bowl, pressing  on solids to extract liquid. Discard the solids (carrots/celery/onion). You don&#8217;t want to eat the veggies since they are doused in fat, although I suppose they are tasty.</p>
<p>9. Allow the liquid to settle, about 3 minutes, then pour back into dutch oven and set over low heat.</p>
<p>10. Carve the chicken, adding any  accumulated juices to the saucepan (if at all possible). Stir lemon juice into the saucepan  to create some really delicious &#8220;au jus&#8221; type sauce, and serve with chicken.</p>

<p><strong>Herb-Parmesan Smashed Potatoes preparation:</strong></p>
<p>1. Smash potatoes with fork, or a masher if you have it.</p>
<p>2. Add a pad of butter, 2 Tbsp of grated parmesan cheese, 1/4-1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp chopped fresh thyme, and 1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, salt and pepper to taste. Mix until desired consistency (it&#8217;s best to start with less liquid, and then adding more as needed). Also it would be a great idea to add in a few tablespoons of the chicken &#8220;au jus&#8221;.</p>
<p>3. Enjoy!</p>

<div id="attachment_1413" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/alyie-and-mike1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1413" title="Alyie and Mike" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/alyie-and-mike1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michael and me on my 21st birthday, May 2006.</p></div>
<p>By Alexandra Fuller</p>
<p>While talking to a neighbor about my husband’s current deployment she asked me many of the normal questions that a civilian wants to know.  “Will he be home soon?”  “Is he in a dangerous area?”  “Do you miss him?” But, one of her questions really stood out.  “When will your husband get out of the military so you can be a normal family?”</p>
<p>She meant no ill will by asking this question.  To her, our life is not normal.</p>
<p>I have been asked many questions about our life and his career.  Yet, this particular question really made me stop and think: What is the definition of a normal family?  I met my husband after he had already enlisted as <a class="zem_slink" title="Active duty" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty">active duty</a> Air Force. So, I do not know any other life.  To us, our life was normal.</p>
<p>I married, Michael, the love of my life in  September<sup> </sup>2007.  At the time, he had been active duty for more than five years and had completed many deployments.  Shortly thereafter, our newly-wed stage ended and reality appeared when he received orders to deploy.</p>
<div id="attachment_1416" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/happy-family-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1416" title="happy family 2" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/happy-family-2.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fuller Family pictures April 2010.</p></div>
<p>I had never been properly introduced to the lifestyle of a military wife.  So, I decided to be proactive and learn the ropes on my own.  I made friends with many spouses in my husband’s unit.  I attended spouse functions and volunteered as much as my school and work schedule would allow.  The participation in the activities made the transition into the military lifestyle so much easier and eased the pain of not having my husband close by.</p>
<p>I have to thank each of the spouses from the 823rd Security Forces unit and all of the other spouses that befriended me at <a href="http://www.moody.af.mil/">Moody Air Force Base</a> for helping me through that trying time.  Without them my life would have been miserable.  They taught me what true strength is.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost two years:  another deployment and homecoming had come and gone. Michael and I found out that we were expecting a little one.  We were over the moon. But, due to the rapid deployment nature of his unit at the time, we prepared ourselves as if he not be home for the majority of the pregnancy and birth.</p>
<p>Most of wives in his unit had given birth by themselves while their husbands were deployed.  Several of the spouses I knew had been alone for the birth of all of their children. It was not an easy pill to swallow. Yet, we continued to enjoy the time he was at home.</p>
<p>He had to leave several times during my pregnancy for different training exercises.  Yet, he made the majority of my appointments and was there when we found out that we were having a boy.  Closer to the end of my pregnancy we began to realize that we were going to be among the lucky few who were able to remain together through most of my pregnancy.  We were truly blessed and did not take a moment of it for granted.</p>
<div id="attachment_1414" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_0108.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414" title="IMG_0108" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_0108.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Daddy and son, Cason, on the day he was born in 2009.</p></div>
<p>When our son, Cason, was born in November 2009, Michael was there to hold my hand through the entire scary, but wonderful, experience.  He was the first person to hold Cason.  Yet again, we knew how blessed we were.  So many military families are separated during this time in their lives.  Yet, they don’t complain.  They make do with the communication that they have and push forward.</p>
<p>Michael deployed again in late fall 2010.  He missed our Cason’s first birthday by three days.  He missed his first steps by a week.  It was a very hard time in our lives.  Before we had Cason, deployments seemed hard.  Little did we know, the intensity would just increase after he was born.  We both knew it would be hard. I personally hoped that having a child would keep me on my toes and allow me to focus on something other than my husband not being home for several months.</p>
<p>I did not factor in the pain of hearing Cason cry for his Daddy or Michael missing so much of his son&#8217;s life.   Michael, as all parents, hates not being here for everything.  We take hundreds of photos and chat online as much as possible.  But, with the rather bad internet connection on Michael’s side, it is hard to video chat.</p>
<div id="attachment_1415" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc00122.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1415" title="DSC00122" src="http://offthebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc00122.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Christmas 2010 with Daddy who was 8 hours ahead of our time, yet he stayed awake to web cam with us.</p></div>
<p>We were truly lucky that the internet held up on Christmas so he could see Cason opening his gifts.  Michael was glowing with pride as he watched Cason tear into the gifts that he had picked for him from half way around the world.</p>
<p>The military lifestyle has a lot of situations and terminology unknown in the civilian world.  Sometimes, as a military spouse, I forget that not everyone understands. To many, deployments seem like extended business trips.  Though, to those who endure deployments, they are life altering experiences.  Some are worse than others. They all mean months or years away from your loved one.</p>
<p>My husband’s profession, like all members of the Armed Forces, is not one that he leaves at the office.  It can be stressful, frustrating and heart breaking. It also can generate the greatest sense of pride from knowing that he is sacrificing so much for his country and for people he does not know and will never meet.</p>
<p>We are truly blessed. To those who live this life, it is normal. To us this life is normal.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_260" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1125.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-260" title="Home Practice" src="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1125.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tools in my yoga corner</p></div>
<p>Developing a home practice can be challenging.  Usually, I have to feel the stars aligning in order to find the space (mental and physical) to practice at home.  But I know it&#8217;s important so lately I have been doubling down my efforts to acknowledge my resistance and work through it.</p>
<p>One of my issues was the space, so I designated a yoga corner in the living room. This way, I don&#8217;t have to move furniture in order to practice.  The corner is free and clear of clutter with a mat or two rolled up in the corner, an eye pillow, strap, and usually a few yoga books for reference.</p>
<div id="attachment_261" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1132.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-261" title="ipillow?" src="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1132.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ipillow?</p></div>
<p>Then I decided there was an overhead hanging lamp in the way of my sun salutations so my fiance removed it.</p>
<div id="attachment_262" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1138.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-262" title="Obstruction no more" src="http://downdogdaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1138.jpg?w=500&#038;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Obstruction no more</p></div>
<p>With the yoga corner decluttered and happy it was time to practice.  But where to start?  Sun Salutations seemed like the obvious answer.  And then I realized I could do anything I wanted in this new liberated space.  My personal class can be any length of time and take any sequence I choose.  How fun.</p>
<p>I have decided to make it my yoga work zone.  I am working on poses or transitions that I don&#8217;t really take the time to focus on in class because I am &#8220;flowing&#8221;.  Right now, my focus is lifting from a standing forward bend into handstand (handstand pike press).  I don&#8217;t have it yet, but will be sure to let you know when I do!</p>
<p>With the freedom to do anything we want, what do we do?  I am trying to break free of the &#8220;what <em>should</em> I do&#8221; thinking and just do what I want. Who knew unleashing ourselves could be so challenging?</p>
<p>With a home practice, I think the key is just to get started.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be right, or rigorous, or anything really.  It could be a seated meditation.  Decluttering helps to make the space &#8216;sacred&#8217; and allow for mental and physical freedom.</p>
<p>Namaste!</p>
