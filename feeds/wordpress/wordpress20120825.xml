<p>I started building my boat because, to be honest, I was unhappy. And one cause of my unhappiness was our home. Ten years ago we bought a 200-year-old stone house in a semi-rural corner of eastern Pennsylvania, charmed by the exposed beams, pine floors and deep window wells. Smitten by the house, we were tone deaf to the culture of the surrounding community. While I lived by the rules of suburban conventionality (be quiet, be tidy, be polite), my neighbors surprised me by, for example, firing guns from their back porches after a night of heavy drinking and idling Harley motorcycles in their front yards.</p>
<p>Most were friendly, but none could figure us out. I worked at home and, as one neighbor summarized, “did something with computers.” We could chat about the weather, but wisely avoided religion, politics and professional sports (about which I know absolutely nothing). I was starved for intellectual companionship, but found none. To buck up my spirits, I made frequent trips to distant cities, just to sit in cafes, browse bookstores, and see people who shared a similar set of life experiences.</p>
<p>Because I disliked our community, I grew resentful of our house. In previous homes, I was always mister fix-it, eager to paint, patch, build and garden. But our ancient, crumbling home defeated me. I didn’t have the energy or enthusiasm needed to keep up with the weeds, the peeling paint, the rotting windowsills, or the leaky roof and I resented every dollar spent on antique septic systems, faulty electrical wiring, and crumbing stucco.  Yet leaving didn’t feel like an option. Because the real estate market was dead in our blue collar community, we felt trapped.</p>
<p>Sailing was, in this way, more than a psychological escape. It was, to some extent, the dream of physical escape. As I worked in my garage, I felt like an inmate at Alcatraz, secretly building my raft to freedom. These dreams of serenely gliding to Bora Bora grew more vivid every time the local Harley bike club roared by&#8211; twenty, thirty, forty bikes at a time—violating every municipal noise ordinance devised in the Western world.  And I redoubled my efforts when reminded that the “grand dragon” of the local KKK lived just down the road.</p>
<p>And then, one day, I finished building my boat. I loaded it on a trailer, drove it to a lake, sailed around, and then…came home. A few hours had passed—I was tan and happy—but nothing fundamental had changed. A small boat on an inland lake was, quite obviously, not going to take me away from my house. And a few trips on the Chesapeake wouldn’t magically heal a leaky roof, or produce a neighbor eager to chat about art, history, or philosophy.</p>
<p>The boat was a kind of therapy when I needed hope and a distraction. But it was not a real solution to my problems. Obviously, the only real way to get away was to leave in a more conventional manner: Put up a for sale sign, pack boxes, rent a U-Haul truck and drive off. And two months after I finished the boat, that’s what we did. The market was still bad, but we no longer cared. Life is short and we were miserable.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder what role, if any, my boat building project really had on the timing of our move. Did the effort and emotional energy devoted to building the boat delay the day of reckoning and keep us tied to Pennsylvania longer than necessary? Possibly. But I think the opposite is true. I believe that building a boat helped me imagine a richer life and articulate my values and my dreams. It could not be the means of my physical escape, but it nurtured the emotional fortitude needed to make a change that was complex and financially unwise.</p>
<p>On the rebound, we decided to find a town that was, to the greatest extent possible, the exact opposite of everything we experienced in rural Pennsylvania. After many exploratory trips—Asheville, North Carolina; Bisbee, Arizona; Shepherdstown, West Virginia; Portland, Oregon—we settled on Ithaca, New York, which is home to Cornell University and a well-known outpost of progressive thought. How much cooler is Ithaca? Well, it has four bookstores within four square blocks and actually supports a <em>multiplex</em> art movie house.  I can go to a different café every day of the week&#8211; and agonize over which one makes the better cappuccino.</p>
<p>And, oh, yes, it happens to sit on the shore of Lake Cayuga, the largest of New York’s famed Finger Lakes. Only a few miles wide, but 38 miles long, it is filled with dozens of sailboats, both large and small, on breezy summer days. Officially, the lake was not a factor in our decision-making, but, unofficially, I was consulting charts even before we found a house to rent.</p>
<p>And that’s when I discovered that the lake is also connected to the famed Erie Canal, which meant—get this!&#8211;that I could embark from my home and sail, unimpeded, all the way to the Great Lakes or the Atlantic and destinations beyond. My mind reeled at the possibilities:  Montreal, New Orleans, and Bimini were all there for the taking, requiring only a right turn or left turn once I reached the top of my lake. My dream of sailing away was rekindled and burned bright.</p>
<p>The move was hard and stressful. Our Pennsylvania house didn’t sell and when it finally did, nine months after we left, it went for a firesale price. But we never regretted the decision to leave, or our choice of destinations. For the first six months, I walked around town with a goofy “pinch-me” smile and drank up the artsy-bookish culture like a man who had nearly died of thirst. I marveled that people related to my work as writer and we found ourselves in the disorienting position of not being the most liberal people in the county. My kids liked their new school and my wife started making connections that would lead to rewarding employment.</p>
<p>All was right with the world—except for one thing: I had not yet sailed my boat. And accomplishing this goal turned out to be an unexpectedly difficult and, initially, humiliating task.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Howard Zinn was a great friend of Rethinking Schools. He generously allowed us to reprint articles of his in the magazine and our books. He agreed to be interviewed by Rethinking Schools editors.  He gave us kind blurbs for our books. He mentioned our work in his talks and referred teachers to us. Most important, Howard Zinn taught us about the world and inspired us to think more deeply about social change. To commemorate his 90th birthday, Rethinking Schools editor Bill Bigelow wrote this article as part of the Zinn Education Project&#8217;s article series, &#8220;<a title="If we knew our history series web page" href="http://zinnedproject.org/why/if-we-knew-our-history-series">If We Knew Our History</a>.&#8221;</em></p>
<hr />
<p>This Friday&#8211;August 24&#8211;would have been the 90th birthday of the great historian and activist <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/about/howard-zinn" target="_hplink">Howard Zinn</a>, who died in 2010. Zinn did not merely record history, he made it: as a professor at Spelman College in the 1950s and early 1960s, where he was ultimately fired for his outspoken support of students in the Civil Rights Movement, and specifically the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); as a critic of the U.S. war in Vietnam, and author of the first book calling for an immediate U.S. withdrawal; and as author of arguably the most influential U.S. history textbook in print, <em><a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/67" target="_hplink">A People&#8217;s History of the United States</a></em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;That book will knock you on your ass,&#8221; as Matt Damon&#8217;s character says in the film <em>Good Will Hunting</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_897" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 347px"><a href="http://www.americanswhotellthetruth.org/portraits/howard-zinn"><img class="size-full wp-image-897" title="howard_zinn" src="http://rethinkingschoolsblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/howard_zinn.jpeg" alt="" width="337" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Painting of Howard Zinn by Robert Shetterly</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s always worth dipping into the vast archive of Zinn scholarship, but at the beginning of a school year, and as the presidential campaign heats up, now is an especially good time to remember some of Howard Zinn&#8217;s wisdom.</p>
<p>Shortly after Barack Obama&#8217;s election, the Zinn Education Project sponsored a <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/8567" target="_hplink">talk by Zinn</a> to several hundred teachers at the National Council for the Social Studies annual conference in Houston. Zinn reminded teachers that the point of learning about social studies was not simply to memorize facts, it was to imbue students with a desire to change the world. &#8220;A modest little aim,&#8221; Zinn acknowledged, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p><a href="http://zinnedproject.org/why/howard-zinn-at-ncss"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-20-NCSSvideo.jpg" alt="2012-08-20-NCSSvideo.jpg" width="314" height="274" /> </a></p>
<p>In this talk, available as an <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/why/howard-zinn-at-ncss" target="_hplink">online video</a> as well as a <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/8567" target="_hplink">transcription</a>, Zinn insisted that teachers must help students challenge &#8220;fundamental premises which keep us inside a certain box.&#8221; Because without this critical rethinking of premises about history and the role of the United States in the world, &#8220;things will never change.&#8221; And this will remain &#8220;a world of war and hunger and disease and inequality and racism and sexism.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key premise that needs to be questioned, according to Zinn, is the notion of &#8220;national interests,&#8221; a term so common in the political and academic discourse as to be almost invisible. Zinn points out that the &#8220;one big family&#8221; myth begins with the Constitution&#8217;s preamble: &#8220;We the people of the United States&#8230;&#8221; Zinn noted that it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;we the people&#8221; who established the Constitution in Philadelphia &#8212; it was 55 rich white men. Missing from or glossed over in the traditional textbook treatment are <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/1160" target="_hplink">race and class divisions</a>, including the rebellions of farmers in Western Massachusetts, immediately preceding the Constitutional Convention in 1787. No doubt, the Constitution had elements of democracy, but Zinn argues that it &#8220;established the rule of slaveholders, and merchants, and bondholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teaching history through the lens of class, race, and gender conflict is not simply more accurate, according to Zinn; it makes it more likely that students &#8212; and all the rest of us &#8212; will not &#8220;simply swallow these enveloping phrases like &#8216;the national interest,&#8217; &#8216;national security,&#8217; &#8216;national defense,&#8217; as if we&#8217;re all in the same boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Zinn told teachers in Houston: &#8220;No, the soldier who is sent to Iraq does not have the same interests as the president who sends him to Iraq. The person who works on the assembly line at General Motors does not have the same interest as the CEO of General Motors. No&#8211;we&#8217;re a country of divided interests, and it&#8217;s important for people to know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another premise Zinn identified, one that has become an article of faith among the Tea Party crowd, is &#8220;American exceptionalism&#8221; &#8212; the idea that the United States is fundamentally freer, more virtuous, more democratic, and more humane than other countries. For Zinn, the United States is &#8220;an empire like other empires. There was a British empire, and there was a Dutch empire, and there was a Spanish empire, and yes, we are an American empire.&#8221; The United States expanded through deceit and theft and conquest, just like other empires, although textbooks cleanse this imperial bullying with legal-sounding terms like the Louisiana <em>Purchase</em> and the Mexican <em>Cession</em>.</p>
<p>Patriotism is another premise that we need to question. As Zinn told teachers in Houston, &#8220;it&#8217;s very bad for everybody when young people grow up thinking that patriotism means obedience to your government.&#8221; Zinn often recalled Mark Twain&#8217;s distinction between country and government. &#8220;Does patriotism mean support your government? No. That&#8217;s the definition of patriotism in a totalitarian state,&#8221; Zinn warned a Denver audience in a 2008 speech, included in a new volume, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/18699" target="_hplink"><em>Howard Zinn Speaks</em></a>, edited by Anthony Arnove (Haymarket Books, 2012.)</p>
<p>And going to war on behalf of &#8220;our country&#8221; is offered as the highest expression of patriotism&#8211;in everything from the military recruitment propaganda that saturates our high schools to the social studies curriculum that features photos of U.S. troops heroically battling &#8220;enemy soldiers&#8221; in a section called &#8220;Operation Iraqi Freedom&#8221; in the popular high school textbook <em>Modern World History</em>.</p>
<p>Howard Zinn cuts through this curricular fog: &#8220;War is terrorism &#8230; Terrorism is the willingness to kill large numbers of people for some presumably good cause. That&#8217;s what terrorists are about.&#8221; Zinn demands that we reexamine the premise that war is necessary, a proposition not taken seriously in any high school history textbook I&#8217;ve ever seen. Instead, wars get sold to Americans&#8211;especially to the young people who fight those wars &#8212; as efforts to spread liberty and democracy. As Howard Zinn said many times, if you don&#8217;t know your history, it&#8217;s as if you were born yesterday. Leaders can tell you anything and you have no way of knowing what&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Howard Zinn wanted educators to be deeply critical, but never cynical. When speaking to the teachers in Houston, Zinn insisted that another premise we needed to examine is the idea that progress is the product of great individuals. Zinn pointed out that Abraham Lincoln had never been an abolitionist, and when he ran for president in 1860 he did not advocate ending slavery in the states where it existed. Rather, it was largely the &#8220;huge antislavery movement that pushed Lincoln into the Emancipation Proclamation&#8211;that pushed Congress into the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zinn urged educators to <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/about/a-people%E2%80%99s-history-a-people%E2%80%99s-pedagogy" target="_hplink">teach a <em>people&#8217;s</em> history</a>: &#8220;We&#8217;ve never had our injustices rectified from the top, from the president or Congress, or the Supreme Court, no matter what we learned in junior high school about how we have three branches of government, and we have checks and balances, and what a lovely system. No. The changes, important changes that we&#8217;ve had in history, have not come from those three branches of government. They have reacted to social movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus when we single out people in our curriculum as icons, as &#8220;people to admire and respect,&#8221; Zinn advocated shedding the traditional pantheon of government and military leaders: &#8220;But there are other heroes that young people can look up to. And they can look up to people who are against war. They can have Mark Twain as a hero who spoke out against the Philippines war. They can have <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/18417" target="_hplink">Helen Keller</a> as a hero who spoke out against World War I, and Emma Goldman as a hero. They can have Fannie Lou Hamer as a hero, and Bob Moses as a hero, the people in the Civil Rights Movement &#8211; <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/posts/1503" target="_hplink">they are heroes</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And to this, there is one final &#8220;people&#8217;s history&#8221; premise we need to remember &#8212; whether in education or the world outside of schools. As Howard Zinn reminded the audience of social studies teachers in Houston: &#8220;People change.&#8221; Zinn did not look to President Obama to initiate social transformation; but in 2008, he saw the election as confirmation that the long history of anti-racist struggle in the United States produced an outcome that would have been inconceivable 30 years prior. And this shift in attitude should give us hope.</p>
<p>As we remember Howard Zinn on what would have been his 90th birthday, let&#8217;s count him among the many social justice heroes who offer proof that people&#8217;s efforts make a difference &#8212; that ordinary people can change the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top-level road cycling cannot seem to escape the specter of doping.</p>
<p>Just last month, Luxemburg’s Frank Schleck was withdrawn by his team from the Tour de France after testing positive for Xipamide, a banned diuretic that can be used to help flush other banned substances from an athlete’s system.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s the seemingly endless drama of Lance Armstrong’s legal battle with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, which, depending on your perspective is either a persecution or a necessary catharsis for the sport.</p>
<p>Armstrong is retired. Schleck, along with his brother Andy, was due to race in this month’s USA Pro Cycling Challenge across the mountains of Colorado. Frank will not be making the trip; Andy will. (Andy inherited the Tour de France crown in 2010 when nominal winner Alberto Contador was stripped of the title for doping.)</p>
<p>There will be drug testing at the Pro Challenge. And there will be riders participating whose names are currently under drug-related clouds.</p>
<p>Race Director Jim Birrell said his organization “works closely with UCI (the International Cycling Union, the sport’s governing body) and, yes, every day we will be testing the General Classification (overall) leader, that day’s stage winner, and two other riders picked at random.”</p>
<p>Within an hour of the race finish each of these four will meet with the Doping Control Officer and be asked to give a urine or a blood sample. “You don’t know ahead of time which it will be,” Birrell said.</p>
<p>Neither do you know what substances doping control will be looking for. “They don’t tell you,” Birrell repeated. They don’t tell you, because, as Tom Murray, chair of the ethics panel for the World Anti-Doping Agency, told me, “The contest is more even now” between those who would cheat (and their doctors and chemists) and those who would catch them cheating. “USADA and WADA have changed the landscape,” Murray said. “They are making a difference. They have funding now to conduct research, but there’s still an edge for the outlaws.”</p>
<p>Why dope? Because given the intensely competitive nature of sport at the highest levels, and the very small differences in physical and mental ability among top athletes, a drug or a procedure that can improve your time by even 1 or 2 percent is an immense temptation.</p>
<p>Murray, who has been studying ethical issues around performance-enhancement for 30 years at the Hastings Center in New York, said, “Once you believe there is an effective drug, you have three choices.” One, you can compete at a disadvantage, trusting that your innate ability and work ethic will level the playing field. This works only rarely, with freakishly gifted individuals. Murray mentioned the hurdler Edwin Moses, whose legs were so long he only needed three strides between hurdles where everyone else took four. Two, you can decide not to dope and effectively give up any hope of winning the Tour de France. And three, you can join your fellows in chemical enhancement so that you at least have a chance to compete.</p>
<p>The UCI website lists a cabinet full of doping techniques. Near the top is “blood doping,” which “increases one’s red blood cell mass resulting in the transport of more oxygen to the muscles.” The preferred method of blood doping these days, the one that Lance Armstrong is charged with employing, is EPO, erythropoietin, known to the athletes as “Edgar Allen Poe.”  It’s a hormone that is produced naturally in the kidneys and acts in the bone marrow to stimulate red blood cell production. A racer who injects EPO risks thickening of the blood, heart disease, stroke, and cerebral or pulmonary embolism. But it can also increase his efficiency on the bike by 10-15 percent. A urine test for EPO was first used at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p>The UCI goes on to list the synthetic oxygen carrier HBOC, two types of blood transfusions, homologus (using someone else’s blood) and autologous (using one’s own stored blood). “A resurgence [in transfusions] is likely due to the introduction of efficient EPO detection methods,” the website says. There is currently no test for autologous blood transfusions, but WADA is working on one.</p>
<p>There is Human Growth Hormone, and testosterone, the latter known by the nickname “oil.” A big spike in testosterone level is likely to get you disqualified; it’s not subtle. Floyd Landis found that out at the Tour de France in 2006. Landis had had a very bad day in the mountains, all but dashing his hopes of replacing Armstrong as Tour champion. But somehow the very next day he mounted a superhuman effort, crushing his rivals by minutes and setting up his eventual triumph in Paris. As stage winner he knew he would be tested. For years, the disgraced American claimed the test result must have been caused by the whiskey he drank the night before, drowning his sorrows.</p>
<p>Landis eventually fessed up, though his armor-plated denial took years to erode. And he has come out publically saying Armstrong doped, too. The USADA case, which has yet to come to a hearing, claims to have testimony from 10 former teammates and associates of Armstrong’s from the U.S. Postal Service days. Four of those rumored to have testified will be at the Pro Challenge: Levi Leipheimer, George Hincapie, Christian Vande Velde, and David Zabriski. Leipheimer won the overall at last year’s inaugural Pro Cycling Challenge. Vande Velde came second. “Big George” Hincapie, who was a faithful domestique for Armstrong on all seven of the Texan’s Tour de France victories, has said that at age 39 he will retire at the end of the year. “60 Minutes” quoted Hincapie as saying he and Armstrong supplied one another with performance enhancing drugs. Hincapie says he never spoke with “60 Minutes” and these days slides around questions from the press with amiable but vague statements about “loyalty.”</p>
<p>The Lance Armstrong question – whether or not USADA should pursue a cancer-survivor hero whose alleged crimes are well in the past – has divided the cycling community. Some say, leave Lance be; draw a line through the past and try to chart a fairer future. Others say, only ripping the bandage from the wound will allow ultimate healing.</p>
<p>Anti-Lance factions are angered by his stonewalling. “Lance redefines innocence as simply not having been caught,” writes Edward Pickering, a cycling blogger. He supports the USADA investigation. “Cycling has its first chance in a generation to come to terms with its past,” he writes.</p>
<p>Tom Murray, the ethicist, thinks the tide is shifting. Is doping control doomed to failure? “No,” he told me. “Somebody will try to cheat. It will never be 100 percent. But the tide will shift [toward cleaner competition]. That’s a realistic hope.”</p>
<p>He said the Armstrong case “makes me think of South Africa with its truth and reconciliation commissions. Bad things were done, horrible things that needed to come to light. This [drugs in cycling] is not horrible by comparison. But it would be wonderful to rip the Band-Aid off the wound; everybody tell the truth. If Lance were to tell everything he knows, and come to a kind of plea bargain, maybe get to keep some of his titles . . . I would certainly welcome that. It’s important to get the truth out.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_175" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 480px"><a href="http://thementalenvironmentdotorg1.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/magician.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-175" title="magician" src="http://thementalenvironmentdotorg1.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/magician.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just think positively.</p></div>
<p>Odds are, if you&#8217;ve been skimming a website, you&#8217;ve come across those tacky ads in the corner: &#8220;Doctors hate him for discovering fountain of youth,&#8221; &#8220;Woman uncovers secret to looking 30 years younger,&#8221; or &#8220;This one tip will shrink your belly.&#8221; And of course, most of us scroll past them unnoticed, quickly out of sight and mind.</p>
<p>While these cigarette butts gathered in the curbs of the mental environment may rarely be mentioned, they most certainly reflect the narrative of modern marketing strategy; irrationality has overtaken the once-occupied area of practicality. Instead of products that make once-cumbersome tasks easy, we see a good portion now giving us <em>easy answers</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one small caveat: life isn&#8217;t easy. But if we&#8217;re patient enough, it will give us answers. The <em>easy</em> answers, however, are more than willing to reveal themselves quickly, and our quiet desperation leads us to the spottily shady area of self-help books and film &#8211; essentially, a grab-bag of pseudoscience and pseudo-spirituality with random nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout. Categorically, there is a very, very wide array of material out there under the banners of &#8220;self-help&#8221; and &#8220;personal guidance.&#8221; The problem is, when some consumers are at a point in life where they&#8217;re standing on the tattered divide of well-being and misery, they&#8217;re hardly in a position to distinguish sound psychological practice with mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>The sleazy guys with trench coats full of watches stand on the corners of the self-help community. <em>The Secret</em> is one of those guys.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t difficult to pick this book/film combo out of the fray &#8211; it appears that many are &#8220;in&#8221; on the &#8220;Secret.&#8221; The book has sold 21 million copies, and was a success through viral marketing and Oprah. The title itself is a testament to its marketing strategy; something that&#8217;s scarce and shrouded creates the need to be &#8220;in the know.&#8221; Shh. Don&#8217;t even mention it.</p>
<p><em>Time</em> magazine ran an <a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1573136,00.html" target="_blank">article</a> on it in 2006, and quoted some of the film&#8217;s backers, who are partners with <em>The Secret</em> creator Rhonda Byrne. While looking to <em>Time </em>for solid journalism is often like looking at the Moon through a kaleidoscope, one can&#8217;t ignore just how up front the financial engine behind the film is. <em>Time</em>&#8216;s Jeffrey Ressner writes, <em>&#8220;The film&#8217;s backers say they deliberately aimed to make &#8216;wealth enhancement&#8217; a major element of the project. &#8216;We desired to hit the masses, and money is the number one thing on the masses&#8217; minds,&#8217; says Bob Rainone, a former IBM salesman and telcom exec who now serves as Byrne&#8217;s U.S. business partner. Wealth enhancement is also part of the The Secret&#8217;s business plan.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So, why not aim for the cash cow? Indeed, <em>The Secret </em>pushes all the right buttons in the consumer that marketing execs do, playing to people&#8217;s desires and leading the lambs to the film&#8217;s grand statements<em> </em>and its spinoffs. This book/film posits that the Law of Attraction can work for us, if only we think positively to attract a positive outcome. It illustrates this by using examples such as a kid wanting a bike or an adult wanting a sporty car, and attempts to weave the Law of Attraction into the &#8220;inevitable&#8221; outcome of the desire being met. In reality, of course, the Law of Attraction can be observed in the placebo effect.</p>
<p>There are multiple layers in the big sell of <em>The Secret </em>that must be examined, considering that at their best, are merely unobservable. At their worst, they are far more than complete dreck &#8211; they&#8217;re dangerous to our well-being.</p>
<p>The film implies nothing more than a conspiracy theory to establish the &#8220;secret&#8221; nature of the &#8220;knowledge&#8221; about positive thinking by purporting that the those in power want to keep the film&#8217;s main point buried from everyone. This frames the rest of &#8211; frankly &#8211; the <em>slog</em> that any skeptical, mindful or otherwise critical viewer will sit through.</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s use of the Law of Attraction is essentially no different than a slew of other coachy, positive thinking claptraps. Think <em>American Beauty</em>: &#8220;I WILL sell this house!&#8221; It&#8217;s no coincidence that in the story, Carolyn Burnham has no dignity left as her life seemingly crumbles into a smoldering heap. It&#8217;s also no coincidence that conversely, her husband gained awareness through letting go of expectations. <em>The Secret</em>, however, is more than happy to provide advice to the contrary. Through various sleazy &#8220;gurus&#8221; and &#8220;mental coaches,&#8221; it encourages more quiet desperation by reinforcing the discontentment in us, and how to quell it by throwing material things and desired outcomes at it. A couple of blurbs about &#8220;gratitude&#8221; later in the film don&#8217;t mask the overarching objective of getting what we want.</p>
<p>This is particularly unsettling, considering that real happiness and peace arise from within, not in expectations met outside ourselves. In the West, we routinely equate happiness and comfort. In reality, chasing comfort zones is futile, because they are generally places where we try to avoid exposure to the unplanned realities of life, which are uncomfortable. But, this discomfort is exactly where we learn to &#8220;just be&#8221; and grow. We actually learn more about ourselves, and how to be truly happy.</p>
<p>With pseudoscience and highly questionable academic credibility, the whole paradigm of discussion in <em>The Secret </em>actually manages to promote both nonsense and non-awareness. It takes a special kind of &#8220;self-help salad&#8221; to do this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a good chunk of self-help literature, film and personal-to-person contact use the positive thinking placebo. Major offenders, including <em>The Secret</em>, go past the mere placebo to sell the idea that we can actually have what we want, material possessions included, if we just want it bad enough to subscribe to their ideas. While people in the world are living in poverty and horrifying conditions, many of them still live with happiness. These works of first world desire are an insult to that testament.</p>

<p>if someone asks you the meaning of life:</p>
<p>duality.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s all you need</p>
<p>just that one word.</p>
<p>you see it every day</p>
<p>sense it in every way.</p>
<p>bitter and sweet.</p>
<p>pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>good and evil.</p>
<p>light and dark.</p>
<p>up and down,</p>
<p>east and west,</p>
<p>north and south,</p>
<p>left and right.</p>
<p>yes and no.</p>
<p>on and off.</p>
<p>action and reaction.</p>
<p>1s and 0s.</p>
<p>you see it in film.</p>
<p>black and white.</p>
<p>in politics.</p>
<p>conservative and liberal.</p>
<p>in mythology.</p>
<p>God and Satan.</p>
<p>you see it in biology.</p>
<p>the water that gives you life</p>
<p>may also drown you.</p>
<p>you see it in a microscope.</p>
<p>protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s inescapable.</p>
<p>yin and yang.</p>
<p>beautiful and ugly.</p>
<p>male and female.</p>
<p>truth and lies.</p>
<p>fire and water.</p>
<p>large and small.</p>
<p>positive and negative.</p>
<p>so when someone asks you</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?</p>
<p>tell them simply,</p>
<p>duality.</p>
<p>and you can walk away confident</p>
<p>in the fact that you know the answer.</p>
<p>and it is very simple.</p>
<p>or you could just be a smartass</p>
<p>and say 42.</p>
<p>*end*</p>

<p>If you wish to drive a vehicle at Burning Man, you have to obtain a permit from DMV. I am not talking about the Department of Motor Vehicles here; I am talking about the Department of MUTANT Vehicles.</p>
<p>Cars, golf carts, trucks, and busses have to change into something completely different and unrecognizable to cruise through Black Rock City and out on the Playa. Only bikes are allowed to roam free. And even they are known to morph into dragons, horses, camels and a multitude of other creatures. (Check out my next blog.)</p>
<p>The same creative energy that goes into art, costumes and performances at Burning Man goes into the production of mutant vehicles. A tractor pulls a false-front house and bar across the playa while an outhouse trails behind. An old bus changes into a riverboat, the Lady Sassafras, courtesy of <a href="http://fractal-nation.com/fractal-nation-2012/">Fractal-Nation</a>. A convertible morphs into a cat. Dragons, polar bears, bugs and pirates roam the playa with impunity. There is even a vehicle for the couch potato.</p>

<p>My all time favorite mutant vehicle is the <a href="http://neverwashaul.com/">Neverwas Haul</a>, a three-story Victorian house with the characteristics of a railroad steam engine including a cattle catcher. Horse-Bone Camp member Sailor Boy, AKA Tom Lovering, likes the Haul so much that he donated an antique ship-telegraph last year. The telegraph was designed to allow the pilot to communicate with the engine room.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an aura of romance, of doomed brilliance, that surrounds <strong>Neutral Milk Hotel&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PHVHFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002PHVHFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iamsyn-20">In The Aeroplane Over The Sea</a><img class="ymtpjwpaarqpketfqcvj" style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=iamsyn-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002PHVHFI" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. Looking back and listening to it once more, it&#8217;s hard to separate the music from the knowledge that <strong>Jeff Mangum</strong> was apparently teetering on the edge of what some would call a nervous breakdown and what all would call sudden, life-changing fame. It sounds like a cry for help from inside a haunted closet, even while it hits you like a joyous exaltation – a yawping, yearning ode to beauty and death and fate and not-so-simple existence. It&#8217;s a strange experience to say the least, an exercise in <strong>Brechtian</strong> estrangement that enlists a singing saw, multiple flugelhorns, and whatever the hell a zanzithiphone is in the effort to cut you loose from your moorings, to send you swirling away on the lilting melodies and through the clashing distortion to a cathartic, ecstatic release.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all complicated by the fact that the album is a suite of songs written about <strong>Anne Frank</strong> and there&#8217;s more than a whiff of the <em>auteur</em> about it. It&#8217;s intensely and obviously personal, from the surreal lyrics to the dense orchestration to Mangum&#8217;s emotive, nasal whine, and the devotion it inspires is nothing short of religious. For the Church of Mangum is built on passion, on doomed endeavors, on writing love songs to a girl who died in 1945, on blending commercial hooks with a lo-fi rejection of overt commercialism, on the realization that this man is pouring his everything (maybe even his sanity) into this one message to the universe. It&#8217;s so intense that at the end of “Oh Comely” – an eight-minute force of nature that stops to reflect on the mass grave in which Frank is buried before the warning, “Know all your enemies. We know who our enemies are,” knocks on your consciousness and occasionally reduces me to tears – someone in the faint distance of the studio cries out “Holy Shit!” in awe of the performance, the testimonial they have just witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Playing it as I was driving down Route 7, through the Green Mountains of Vermont and along side the glitter of Lake Champlain, I found myself thinking of how perfectly suited the songs on this album are to being on a Wes Anderson soundtrack. Speaking of estrangement and anger, sweetness and love, these songs swing from atonal distortion to melodic rapture with all the intensity and oddity of one of Anderson&#8217;s off-beat protagonists, and the album would certainly fit in to a space somewhere between <strong>The Kinks</strong>, <strong>Bowie</strong>, and <strong>Benjamin Britten</strong> in Anderson&#8217;s sonic catalogue. If you&#8217;re as willing to mix media in your mind as I am, it&#8217;s not much of a leap to imagine Max Fischer of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HK13SG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005HK13SG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iamsyn-20">Rushmore</a><img class="ymtpjwpaarqpketfqcvj" style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=iamsyn-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B005HK13SG" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> Academy writing just such an album to his own inaccessible muse Ms. Cross in between penning heavily plagiarized high-school-theater masterpieces. He&#8217;s precisely the kind of guy who would get behind a fundamentally doomed endeavor (like an unlicensed school aquarium or The Calligraphy Club or falling in love with Anne Frank), and I think it&#8217;s this misguided idealism that speaks to me in both of these works.</p>

<p>Add to that the sense that Anderson is as in control of every element of his movies (even when, if not especially when, they seem on the verge of falling apart) as Mangum is in control of this album, and you&#8217;ve got a match made in synesthetic heaven.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
