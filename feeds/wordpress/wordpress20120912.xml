				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zadie Smith&#8217;s new novel <em>NW</em> was &#8211; mathematically &#8211; one of the longest awaited of the year, and its mixed reception surprised me. For every <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9508844/NW-by-Zadie-Smith-review.html">850 words of closely-argued praise</a>, there was a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/31/nw-zadie-smith-review">crowd of cavils by a normally perceptive critic</a>. I had expected critical near-unanimity on this one, with the only disagreement being which section was best. Anyway the attention paid to the book affirmed that any new work by Zadie Smith is a publishing event, and this time, in my view, a literary event too. I was grateful for the opportunity to ask the author some questions about <em>NW</em> and her writing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>(You can buy any of the books mentioned by Zadie Smith from the excellent independent bookshop <a href="http://booksellercrow.typepad.com/the_bedside_crow/">Bookseller Crow</a> by clicking on the images below.)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zadie-smith-nw-2012-use-c-dominique-nabokov-2012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5559" title="Zadie Smith by Dominique Nabokov, 2012" src="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zadie-smith-nw-2012-use-c-dominique-nabokov-2012.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="658" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>NW</em> is a novel in varied parts, about the lives of very different people in one area of London. Did you always know that their stories would be part of something larger? How did the novel find its form?</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t begin with any stories, really. Just this single idea of a girl coming to the door. The novel found its form slowly, over a long period. I wrote the first lines almost nine years ago. And that’s really how it was built: sentence by sentence, hoping the shape would emerge by itself. But once I had the idea of the girl coming to the door, I started to read around the idea of guests and hosts… and there’s sort of a long philosophical history to those ideas, and inevitably they ended up being a part of the book, and shaping it. And from “Who gets invited?” I went to “Once you’re invited, what kind of hospitality is ideal?” – and that gets you into thinking about utopia and dystopia… And those ideas ended up being another room in the house of the book. It’s hard for me to explain, but I guess as a general rule I find the characters subconsciously, but then the conscious part of a novel are these larger ideas. The whole trick for me is not to let the ideas overwhelm that subconscious work, which is where I feel the real life of the thing is. But perhaps for 90 percent of readers all the larger framework goes unnoticed and all they see is a lot of uncouth Kilburn people, talking… I can never tell. It doesn’t really matter. I think that’s just the risk you take when you shape a novel round the present. People distrust the present – it looks formless, unserious. They want the security of the past, and of familiar forms.</p>
<p><a href="http://booksellercrow.moonfruit.com/#/johnselfzadiesmith/4568650657"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-5602" title="Zadie Smith: NW (click to buy from Bookseller Crow)" src="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zadiesmith_big1.jpg?w=99&h=150" alt="" width="99" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Much of the strength of the book lies in the way it reports communication between characters, particularly those of different social and cultural backgrounds. Is <em>NW</em> a state-of-England (or part of it) novel?</strong></p>
<p>I find that idea really boring: ‘state of the nation’. It’s one of those phrases that people who secretly dislike fiction use to pretend a novel is just a spring board to enter into some other, less embarrassing discussion: a political analysis or a sociological portrait. I really don’t presume to know the state of England. I’m a fiction writer. I’m interested in trying to find ways to depict experience through a medium that can never succeed in depicting experience fully: language. It’s a fool’s task, but I know that the pleasure I have as a reader is watching different writers attempt it. And this is just my attempt, to add to all the attempts by others that have come before it. Of course some of that experience involves ‘having been born and bred in England,’ but a sense of place is just one part of a larger concern, as it is with all novelists, no matter where they were born. How does language feel to hear and use? How does time feel? How can we know other people are real and not just projections of our own desires or fears? What does the thought of death do to us? These are the sort of vulgar, childlike question that novelists ask – at least, the kind of novelists I’m interested in. Because it’s just so odd to be alive! And fiction is about that. I think all good novels are about “the state of being alive.” Trying to make them act as national sociological descriptors isn’t the worst crime in the world, but focusing on that aspect ignores the very particular linguistic thingyness of the form. To me writing is deeply irrational, idiosyncratic, because its medium – language – has so much ambiguity built into it. That argument that Alice and Humpty Dumpty have about the instability of meaning that’s the epigraph of a million graduate dissertations… Language is the absurd bit of writing that can’t be entirely suppressed or controlled by journalistic ideas like ‘state of the nation’ novels. Maybe the phrase, if it’s used at all, is best used satirically, as Amis used it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels that in England and America especially there is this desire that the novel behave itself and exist as only a sort of mildly creative interpretation of the news. Faction. Solid, recognizable, like a TV sitcom written down. But a novel <em>should</em> have a little witchcraft in it, don’t you think? It should be a little weird. It should try to do something that can <em>only </em>be done in <em>this </em>form, in language.</p>
<p><strong>When reading <em>NW</em>, I thought of other books. <em>London Fields </em>(obviously), which is similarly controlled in its prose yet enacts the messiness of life even as it portrays it. Or Evan S Connell&#8217;s <em>Mrs Bridge</em>, which like the &#8216;Host&#8217; section in <em>NW</em>, makes up a whole life in short discrete scenes. Does the book have any direct literary inspirations or influences?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm… When I think of <em>London Fields</em> I think of <em>White Teeth</em>. And there the influence is direct. But nothing could have been further from my mind writing <em>NW</em> than <em>London Fields&#8230;</em> I see books in terms of their sentences and to me the sentences of <em>White Teeth</em> and <em>NW</em> are really from different planets! But this may be my own delusion. In the end, you have to defer to readers: you can’t instruct them to see a sentence your way – they have to see it themselves.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>Mrs Bridge</em> was certainly in there, though perhaps not as much as Roland Barthes&#8217; autobiography, Raymond Queneau’s variations, and various books of epigraphs I was reading. I became envious of that numbered structure – and then it seemed to suit Natalie so perfectly, with her determination to march boldly into the future. Originally her section was in a sort of fractured first person. Everyone who read it hated it – me included. Then another writer said to me: “You’re the only writer I know who can create no sympathy in the first person.” I thought: that’s right! When I write the pronoun “I”, I think of myself and end up being incredibly cruel. I’m not sympathetic to myself, as it turns out. I need the she and he.</p>
<p><a href="http://booksellercrow.moonfruit.com/#/johnselfzadiesmith/4568650657"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-5603" title="Evan S. Connell: Mrs Bridge (click to buy from Bookseller Crow)" src="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/images.jpeg?w=97&h=150" alt="" width="97" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>NW</em> is on the one hand psychologically acute and strongly character-driven, but also experiments with form and content &#8211; it&#8217;s littered with up-to-date cultural references, has typographical trickery and surprising appearances of the way we live now (such as a chapter made of Google Maps directions). Do these elements come easily? Or is &#8220;<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/fiction/2009/12/novel-culture-smith-wood">the culture doing strange things to novels</a>&#8220;?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, not so strange. You could find far, far stranger in 1918 or 1761. Nothing new under the sun. The novel has always been a weird form, full of oddities. If there’s trickery in this one, I’m sorry for it: I genuinely wanted to try and get closer to reality, not to obscure it. I mean, look: a version of the most realistic novel possible right now would be the one that took into account the fact that for much of each day in the west, the consciousness of many of us is projected outwards into a 14-inch lit screen, and any thought we have constantly penetrated by news, trivia, gossip, adverts, glimpses of content, and email, always email. I can’t figure out a way to do that, but some younger writer will. Not in the dull manner of ‘putting emails in a novel’ but some organic and genuine way of representing that reality. And stuff like that will always be called ‘trickery’ and accused of shallowness and then fifty years later it will be understood as pure realism. I remember David Foster Wallace saying somewhere that his ‘real’ life did not involve walking by a stream, pausing under an apple tree and having a deep internal monologue about the nature of the world – yet that’s what his fiction teacher expected of him and it’s true to this day that much contemporary fiction hangs upon what are actually quite unrealistic premises. But people still call it realism and think of it as completely ‘natural,’ not strange at all. To me it’s a little strange.</p>
<p>The same goes – at the most banal level – for content. When I first started writing, people often asked why I insisted on this ‘multicultural’ cast. To them it was a publishing ‘angle’ or some kind of post-modern trick. Slowly you realize: <em>these people live in an entirely white social world. </em>So to them it probably <em>is </em>exotic, it <em>is </em>an angle. I had interviewers – especially abroad – congratulating me on the “trendiness” of my family, as if I had picked out a black mother and a white father for fashion purposes. But to me what’s exotic is a world in which everyone is white. I’ve never lived in that world. Being mixed race is not some kind of gimmick: a third of the kids in my school had families like that, and nothing could have been more dull to all of us, more everyday. I remember, too, the shock of reading reviews that took it for granted that Willesden is a sort of piteous place to live, unutterably ‘grim.’ And if a character of mine isn’t living in a four storey house in Hampstead their lives are also described as ‘grim,’ or brutally modern, or whatever. It makes you wonder: where do these reviewers <em>come </em>from? This is just bog standard London life I’m describing, the lives of millions. But perhaps the only ‘moral’ of my fiction is that one person’s strange is another person’s normal.</p>
<p><a href="http://booksellercrow.moonfruit.com/#/johnselfzadiesmith/4568650657"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-5604" title="Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (click to buy from Bookseller Crow)" src="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/images-1.jpeg?w=100&h=150" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Your essay &#8216;Two Directions for the Novel&#8217; attracted much attention, contrasting lyrical realism (in Joseph O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s <em>Netherland</em>) with the &#8216;alternative road&#8217; of Tom McCarthy&#8217;s <em>Remainder</em>. Where do you place your own work in this context?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t really. The critic in me and the writer in me are two different people. The critic writes of what she would ideally like to read; the writer only writes what she can. Criticism is easy; fiction hard. I know what I’m doing when I write an essay. I have no idea what I’m doing when I write a novel. Fiction is a much riskier enterprise.</p>
<p>And then that essay is a polemic, and describes what I felt, at the time, to be an extreme situation in publishing. I think China Miéville – my Kilburn neighbour! – said recently that English fiction tends to privilege recognition over strangeness and alienation, and I think that has often been true. Personally I adore the recognition Jane Austen provides but I also love the strangeness of B.S. Johnson or Octavia Butler. In “healthy” times there’s no need for the polemic: it’s a wide church and both types of writers can exist perfectly happily in there. But it didn’t seem to me to be a very healthy time. I think it’s got a little better, at least from the books that I’m being sent. And the ideal – as I think I said in the essay – are those books that defy all categorization, that are great on their own idiosyncratic terms. I was describing two particular paths in the tradition of the novel, but what marks the most interesting novels is their absolute particularity. You can’t pin them down so easily. What kind of a novel is <em>Invisible Cities</em>? What kind of novel is [Naipaul's] <em>Half a Life? </em>I’m afraid real writing laughs in the face of polemical essays. They were rare four hundred years ago, two hundred years ago, fifty years ago, yesterday – great books will always be rare. <em>Lolita</em> doesn’t come around every day. <em>Heart of Darkness</em> doesn’t come around every day. Most novels are just “good enough”, and given that this is so, shouldn’t they be welcomed in their full variety? Great writing comes in a trickle, not a flood. And we’re not so drowning in riches that we can afford to dam up certain tributaries.</p>
<p>As for my own writing, I’m surprised to find I’m quite excited about the future, which I’ve never really been before. <em>NW</em> feels like my first novel in some ways, maybe because it’s the first I’ve written as what my mother would call “a grown ass woman.” So I’m just going to keep on shuffling down my own path, wherever it leads me. The next novel I have in mind is actually a sort of speculative fiction, set in the future, so I don’t know where that lies along those two paths. I don’t think I care!</p>
<p><a href="http://booksellercrow.moonfruit.com/#/johnselfzadiesmith/4568650657"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-5605" title="Italo Calvino: Invisible Cities (click to buy from Bookseller Crow)" src="http://theasylum.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/unknown.jpeg?w=114&h=150" alt="" width="114" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>As a reader, I&#8217;ve discovered that since becoming a parent, limited reading time means I&#8217;m much less forgiving of – or willing to continue with – mediocre books. Does parenthood have any comparable effect on writing? Are the short sections of <em>NW</em> an effect of this?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But that makes it sound purely practical. To me, the intense awareness of time that parenthood creates makes a different person of you, and necessarily a different writer. I hate waste of all kinds now. I hate padding. I want only essential things. A good analogy is party-going. I love to drink and I love to dance. I didn’t used to need an excuse to do those things. But now it better be the best party that man has ever invented, otherwise I ain’t going. Otherwise I’m not paying the babysitter, enduring the tears, texting to check the child hasn’t died, and so on and so forth. The same logic works on the page. If I’m going to write it, it better be a necessary word. It better be essential. Because otherwise I could be hanging out with my family, which most days is about infinity times more enjoyable than struggling over a paragraph in the library.</p>
<p><strong>Parenthood is also a central subject in <em>NW</em>. Is this something that came from the essence of the characters Leah and Natalie, or from a desire to write about something prominent in your own life?</strong></p>
<p>I began the book five years before I had a child. That seems to be a pattern with me. <em>On Beauty</em> is about a marriage of thirty years standing, but at the time I had been married only two. I don’t know the reasons. You’d have to ask a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend an overlooked book or author for readers of this blog?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s overlooked, but someone just recommended it to me and I’m enjoying it. It’s got a great title, too: <em>How to make love to a negro without getting tired </em>by Dany Laferrière.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I had the opportunity to read Jonah Lehrer’s <a title="Imagine page on Lehrer's website" href="http://www.jonahlehrer.com/books/imagine/" target="_blank"><em>Imagine</em></a> -  the book that’s part of the controversy about <a title="Edward Champion's analysis of Lehrer's writings" href="http://www.edrants.com/how-jonah-lehrer-recycled-his-own-material-for-imagine" target="_blank">plagiarism</a> and <a title="Michael Moynihan's article on Lehrer's fabricated Bob Dylan quotes" href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/107779/jonah-lehrers-deceptions" target="_blank">fabrication</a> in Lehrer’s writing. <em>Imagine</em> has been <a title="Houghton Mifflin offers refunds to Imagine purchasers" href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/08/02/lehrers-publisher-runs-ads-telling-bookstores-to-send-back-imagine-for-a-refund/" target="_blank">pulled by its publisher</a> as a result of that controversy, so pointing out additional problems with it may now be somewhat redundant. (The copy I read came from my public library.) Nevertheless, after reading it, I want to outline the problems I found with the referencing in the book &#8211; an area which other commentators <a title="Michael Moynihan suggests that Imagine has referencing problems" href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ilk1jt" target="_blank">have also raised concerns about</a>.<span id="more-543"></span></p>
<p>I have a professional interest in <a title="my Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences article about reports on the Hawthorne studies" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1936-4490.2005.tb00368.x/abstract" target="_blank">how scientific research findings get communicated to general audiences</a>, but as a reader I&#8217;m in some disbelief that a book with this many obvious problems ever got published as it is.  The fact that it did goes beyond the <a title="Update: “Self-Plagiarising” Writer Admits to Fabricating Quotes" href="http://allaboutwork.org/2012/07/30/update-self-plagiarising-writer-admits-fabricating-quotes/">ethical debates around Lehrer’s own conduct</a>, and should make publishers question their editorial processes and where they choose to invest resources in a project.</p>
<p>Referencing in non-fiction writing is important. It’s important because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it gives factual support to the writer’s claims;</li>
<li>it demonstrates that the writer is familiar enough with existing knowledge about the subject to be able to make an informed contribution of new knowledge;</li>
<li>it tells readers who want to learn more about the subject where they can find other sources of information; and,
<p><div id="attachment_546" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 287px"><a href="http://allaboutworkdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1945.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-546 " title="IMG_1945" src="http://allaboutworkdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1945.jpg?w=277&h=300" alt="" width="277" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An example of a reference list</p></div></li>
<li>it gives credit where credit is due for work by other writers or researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accurate referencing is particularly important for a book like <em>Imagine</em>, which positions itself as an investigation of the “science of creativity”. Since no single author or researcher could possibly cover this huge subject on their own, they’re going to have to draw on other sources for at least some of their material &#8211; and those sources need to be acknowledged. <em> </em></p>
<p><em>Imagine </em>is written for a popular (non-scientist) audience, so obviously it shouldn’t be held to the same rigorous standard of referencing as, say, a scientific research article in a peer-reviewed academic journal. However, the book does include a reference list (p. 255-263), so to some extent it sets its own standard that referencing is expected. If a book is structured to include a reference list, it’s reasonable for the reader to expect that everything in the book that should be referenced <em>is</em> going to be referenced, and is going to be referenced accurately.</p>
<p>Before I outline what I found, I’ll present a few disclaimers/boundaries. I am not trained as a neuroscientist, so I can’t tell whether the neuroscience research described in <em>Imagine</em> is accurately reported or referenced, and I can&#8217;t address the <a title="article on selective presentations of research in Imagine and other popular science works" href="http://www.alternet.org/jonah-lehrer-and-problems-pithy-science-writing?paging=off" target="_blank">allegations of selective &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; from that body of research.</a>  Instead, I checked the reference list while I was reading the book, and I marked points in the text where I thought there should have been a reference &#8211; and there wasn’t &#8211; or where I felt that a referenced topic was close enough to my own expertise that I could reasonably assess whether the referenced material was accurately reported.</p>
<p>The first problematic reference in <em>Imagine </em>is within its first few pages, on page xvi of the Introduction:  “A recent survey of psychology papers published between 1950 and 2000 revealed that less than 1 percent of them investigated aspects of the creative process”. Clearly, this statement should have a reference, since it reports factual material from a secondary source. But there is no reference included in the book’s reference list.  So I ran a search using five <a title="EbscoHost homepage" href="http://www.ebscohost.com/" target="_blank">EbscoHost</a> reference databases (PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, and ERIC) that include psychology journals, as well as searching <a title="Google Scholar &quot;about&quot; page" href="http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/about.html" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> - and I could not find a published article that fit all of the identifiers of the study as described in the sentence. The sentence contributes to setting up the premise of the book:  i.e., “how creativity works” hasn&#8217;t been extensively researched, so the book&#8217;s contribution is to examine this important yet overlooked topic.  Given this premise, the lack of a reference for this study is, in my opinion, a serious omission.</p>
<p>Other problems that I found relating to referencing published academic research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 140 includes a discussion of research on trends in scientific production. The referenced article is <a title="abstract of Jones (2007) &quot;Burden of Knowledge&quot;" href="http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/283.abstract" target="_blank">this one</a>. However, from the description of the article’s contents and findings, it appears that the article actually being discussed is <a title="Wuchty, Jones &amp; Uzzi (2007) &quot;The Increasing Dominance of Teams&quot;" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5827/1036.abstract" target="_blank">this one</a>.</li>
<li>Page 141 contains a discussion of an “epic study of nearly every musical produced on Broadway between 1877 and 1990, analyzing the teams behind 2,258 different productions”. The study in the <a title="Uzzi &amp; Spiro (2007) &quot;Collaboration and Creativity&quot;" href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/432782?uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101171862251" target="_blank">referenced article</a> looked at musicals produced from 1945 to 1989, and examined 474 musicals with 2,092 participants.</li>
<li>A discussion starting on page 162 describes a research study on the effects of dissent on group decision making, and explains how subjects were placed in groups and asked to answer questions, with a “plant” in some groups shouting a wrong answer. The <a title="Nemeth &amp; Ormiston (2007) &quot;Creative Idea Generation&quot;" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.373/abstract" target="_blank">referenced study</a> investigates the impact of stable or changing group membership on a group’s creativity. It does not report on an experiment structured like the one described.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three other academic studies that were mentioned did not have references.</p>
<p>There are also problems with incomplete or inaccurate references to other types of sources. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li> Keith Johnstone, a theatrical improvisation teacher, is quoted directly on page 103. The source of the quote is not referenced. A Google search indicates that Malcolm Gladwell uses the same quote in his book <a title="publisher's website for Malcolm Gladwell's Blink" href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316004992.htm" target="_blank">Blink</a>. I do not have a copy of that book, so I could not determine if a source was identified there.</li>
<li>Page 108 contains a discussion of how Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards came up with the guitar riff for the song Satisfaction. There is no reference for the direct quotes, although there’s contextual information that makes <a title="NPR's Terry Gross interviews Keith Richards, 2010" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=130722581" target="_blank">the source</a> relatively easy to find. However, there is a discrepancy between the content of the direct quotes in the source transcript and the content of the direct quotes in <em>Imagine</em>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>Imagine</em>: “There, in some sort of ghostly version, is the opening of a song.”<br />
<em>NPR transcript</em>: “There, in some sort of ghostly version, is (singing) da, da, da, da, da &#8211; I can&#8217;t get no satisfaction.”</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Footnote 3 on page 101 describes the “cinematic improv” of actor Mike Myers in a scene in an Austin Powers film (the Austin Powers film containing the scene is not identified, but it’s fairly easy to discover through Google that it’s <a title="IMDB listing for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/" target="_blank">the first one</a>). However, there’s no reference for the assertion that “Myers made it up on the spot”. According to <a title="director Jay Roach discusses the &quot;shhh&quot; scene in the first Austin Powers film" href="http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0902-Summer-2009/Interview-Jay-Roach.aspx" target="_blank">this interview with the film’s director,</a> the basis of the scene was spontaneous, but what appeared in the film was not constructed quite in the way that <em>Imagine</em> suggests it was.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_547" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 276px"><a href="http://allaboutworkdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1946.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-547 " title="IMG_1946" src="http://allaboutworkdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1946.jpg?w=266&h=300" alt="" width="266" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An example of a reference list</p></div>
<p>And finally, I found four factual statements (e.g. on page 180: “the United States, for example, is 81 percent urbanized”) that were not referenced, along with two instances of discrepancy between the information in the text and the information in the reference. There are also extended discussions of three topics &#8211; the development of Silicon Valley, the creative process at Pixar, and Shakespeare’s creative inspirations -  which only have general references to secondary sources and/or to author interviews, making it difficult to determine which material is from the secondary sources and which material is the author’s own work.</p>
<p>All of these problems &#8211; in addition to <a title="article on problems with Imagine" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444226904577559322045607092.html" target="_blank">the other problems in <em>Imagine</em> that have already been identified</a> &#8211; seriously make me question how this book ever got published as it is.</p>
<p>In <em>Imagine</em>’s acknowledgements (p. 265-267), Lehrer thanks an editor, a number of readers who reviewed drafts of various parts of the book, and a copy editor. It’s entirely possible that some of those readers looked at conceptual or structural issues, and thus missed any referencing problems.  I don’t know the specific details of the editorial or production process that <em>Imagine</em> went through – but I find it disturbing that apparently there was no point in the process when the references in the reference list were cross-verified with the text, or when unreferenced material was identified and flagged for correction.</p>
<p>I am not sure what lesson the publishing industry will take away from the saga of <em>Imagine</em>, other than being very careful with any subsequent work by its author. But <a title="commentary on book publishing and the current state of fact checking" href="http://www.emilywillinghamphd.com/2012/07/bob-dylan-jonah-lehrer-nonfiction.html" target="_blank">as this commentator indicates</a>, the publishing industry has put itself at risk for these kinds of catastrophes by cutting back or eliminating fact-checking resources. I suppose I fall into the particular sub-category of reader that Willingham describes as having “an eye for detail” &#8211; but, in fairness, for many of the referencing problems I identified in <em>Imagine</em>, I was able to find the correct information in less than a few seconds through Google. And using a research database to search journal content is not that much different from running a Google search. Neither kind of search is particularly time-consuming, highly skilled, or prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Hopefully, another lesson of the <em>Imagine</em> story for publishers will be that investing in fact-checking is worth the cost – not only to avoid the financial and reputational consequences of uncorrected errors, but also to be sure that authors are fulfilling their part of the responsibility for the accuracy of their work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Every day, 19 WordPressers are featured on the Freshly Pressed section of WordPress.com. And every day, many more wonder, “What do I have to do to get Freshly Pressed?”</em></p>
<p><em>Well, it’s time to reveal what the folks who push the launch button are thinking. Each week, a member of our editorial team will do a close-up on one post and why we thought it was Press-worthy. We hope we can provide insight into the process and give you tips and tools to make your blog the best it can be.<br />
</em>_________________________________________________________</p>
<p>We love when a blogger jumps head first into a debate and uses their blog as a forum, and that&#8217;s exactly what Clare, the writer behind <a href="http://cer90cer.wordpress.com">A Little Blog of Books and Other Stuff</a>, does with the recently Freshly Pressed post, <a href="http://cer90cer.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/the-rise-of-ebooks-evil-or-essential/#">&#8220;The Rise of eBooks: Evil or Essential?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>First of all, Clare&#8217;s writing is solid, the humor is sharp, and her voice is authoritative. Good, confident writing goes a long way. But what else stands out?</p>
<p><span id="more-10114"></span></p>
<h2><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-10-17-07-pm.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10127" title="Screen shot 2012-09-06 at 10.17.07 PM" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-10-17-07-pm.png?w=300&h=180" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>The post title poses a question.</h2>
<p>Sensationalist headlines can be intriguing:</p>
<p><em>Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? </em></p>
<p><em>Can Your Jeans Kill You?</em></p>
<p>The title &#8220;<em>The Rise of eBooks: Evil or Essential?&#8221;</em> is just as attention-grabbing. If you&#8217;re presenting two sides of a debate, whether it&#8217;s a controversial political issue or a lighthearted discussion on chocolate versus vanilla, pique your reader&#8217;s interest immediately in the title. Be bold and brief: use this headline to reveal what your discussion will be about.</p>
<p>In this case, since many people already have an opinion on the topic of eBooks (and the value of printed books), asking a simple yet provocative question is a surefire way to lure a reader.</p>
<p>This type of title isn&#8217;t appropriate for all posts, but it can be effective when you&#8217;re weighing the pros and cons of something, or asking your reader to consider different perspectives.</p>
<h2><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-10-16-43-pm.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10128" title="Screen shot 2012-09-06 at 10.16.43 PM" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-10-16-43-pm.png?w=300&h=179" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a>The format is effective.</h2>
<p>A clean, easy-to-follow format is the simplest way to keep a reader happy and engaged with your text until the end. Clare presents the disadvantages and advantages of eBooks in a series of short, snappy paragraphs, each with lead-in sentences in bold. As a result, each point she makes is clear.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re writing a post like this in which you&#8217;re presenting numerous points, avoid long paragraphs that don&#8217;t allow your readers to breathe. Consider using a bullet or numbered list to keep your post focused and succinct. Or, experiment with the use of bold, italicized, and underlined fonts to draw attention to specific parts of your discussion.</p>
<h2>The author allows you to decide for yourself.</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, this post had nearly 350 comments—a fair amount of which are personal, passionate comments about reading and publishing. Why did this post generate such a healthy, lively discussion? One, the Clare&#8217;s take is opinionated but extremely balanced: she presents both sides—as well as a &#8220;neutral point&#8221; at the end—allowing readers to come to their own conclusions. Two, she ends the post with questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think? Are you a total convert to e-readers or do you remain devoted to the humble paperback?</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, you can engage your readers when you give them the space to express their opinions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been listening to Bach&#8217;s Ciaconna in D Minor, the infamous Chaconne, on loop recently. This piece comes like a punch to the face at the end of Bach&#8217;s Partita No. 2, the last and longest movement of five. I first learnt about it in this article, a famous one called &#8216;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html" target="_blank">Pearls Before Breakfast</a>&#8216; by Gene Weingarten (he won a Pulitzer for this article, and although many &#8211; fair &#8211; criticisms have been leveled at the experiment it carries out, I think it&#8217;s worthy of one nonetheless; very few articles in the world have the power to engage someone so entirely <em>and</em> make them think very hard about certain things, and this definitely does!). In the article, Joshua Bell is quoted as calling the Chaconne &#8216;one of the greatest pieces of music ever written&#8217;. I was curious to see what sort of piece could earn itself such an epithet, and I didn&#8217;t (still don&#8217;t) know much about classical music anyways, though I liked listening to it when studying (no lyrics to distract!), so I figured it would be as good a place to start as any. And <em>boy</em>, was it.</p>
<p>(In the experiment the article carries out, Joshua Bell starts off by playing this Chaconne &#8211; he&#8217;s pretending to be yet another busker in some metro station in DC, only he&#8217;s a world-renowned violinist who&#8217;ll be playing a Stradivarius or something. The experiment is to see how many people will notice &#8216;genius&#8217; and &#8216;greatness&#8217;, if you will, and stop to pay attention even in the middle of rush hour. Very few people paid attention to the Chaconne, which <em>amazes</em> me &#8211; never mind getting to work on time; <em>this is the Chaconne</em>. I would run out of my college MCR every time a violinist on Turl Street started playing the Chaconne, which he often did in the evenings; he wasn&#8217;t even a Joshua Bell. Oxford is a lovely place to hear this played, especially when someone plays it on the streets in the evening. It melts into the dusk and into the buildings.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I could ever get bored of it: every hearing reveals new layers to the piece that I hadn&#8217;t noticed previously; it fits almost any mood (except the exercise-adrenalin mood, unfortunately &#8211; but Bach was not to know of treadmills way back then, so can&#8217;t blame him!). I sometimes think perhaps the whole of life and its emotions are encapsulated in this song; the exuberant moments, the calm ones, the sad ones; mornings with a pink and orange sunrise, and the slight rain that falls briefly before the big shower comes; the way crowds slowly increase in certain parts of town (any town) as the morning progresses, the tempo of life rising alongside increments in time; there are traffic jams and cars speeding on highways. I can hear necessary cups of coffee in it; heartbreak and reconciliation; determination, decision. It&#8217;s all in there. I could list a thousand more odds and ends that come to my mind as I listen to this song, but that would probably consume this post and a thousand more.</p>
<p>Brahms rightly identifies the most extraordinary quality about this piece, in a letter to Clara Schumann - <em>how does anybody, any human being, feel enough to compose such a piece?</em> Sometimes it is hard enough just listening to it. (Miles told me that while poor Schumann was being treated for syphillis with mercury, which is highly poisonous, his wife was having an affair with Brahms; I would have been wary if I were Brahms, but then again, perhaps Schumann was the philanderer&#8230;) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partita_for_Violin_No._2_(Bach)#cite_note-1" target="_blank">Brahms writes to Clara</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>This might be presumptuous, and I might have no right to &#8211; but I agree with him entirely. It&#8217;s an echo of a sentiment that Shakespeare himself expressed (albeit as Othello), of the soul &#8211; &#8220;if it were to die now, &#8217;twere now to be most happy; for, I fear, my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this suceeds in unknown fate&#8221;. It&#8217;s almost as if there can be no better expression of feeling (unknown, undefined) and emotion (ditto) than this. These quantities have to be left vague and undefined, because I think they elude definition &#8211; to claim it is a dirge for his first wife is a bit too simplistic, and worse, it simplifies something extremely complex and profound.</p>
<p>There can be no easy attempt to ascribe meaning to the music, because I think that&#8217;s impossible &#8211; a Bach scholar called Helga Thoene suggests that the Chaconne is actually written <em>in memoriam</em> of Bach&#8217;s first wife, of whose death he had learnt shortly before composing the piece. But I&#8217;m not sure. It&#8217;s definitely sad at parts, but also peaceful if not exuberant in others. Miles and I have many violent (and nerdy) arguments about meaning in (instrumental) music; I hold staunchly (and perhaps without enough subtlety/philosophical delving into the issue) that music cannot formally present meaning, that it&#8217;s without a formal means of reference. Miles says I&#8217;m silly and that of course music is referential (but he is unsure about what referentiality is, as he hasn&#8217;t been forced to consume copious amounts of poststructuralist theory). A book I foraged from my father&#8217;s book cupboard yesterday, called <em>Musicophilia</em> by someone called Oliver Sacks, agrees with me (HA!); he writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>But why this incessant search for meaning or interpretation? It is not clear that any art cries out for this and, of all the arts, music surely the least &#8211; for while it is the most closely tied to the emotions, music is wholly abstract; it has no formal power of representation whatsoever. We may go to a play to learn about jealousy, betrayal, vengeance, love &#8211; but music, instrumental music, can tell us nothing about these. Music can have wonderful, formal, quasi-mathematical perfection, and it can have heartbreaking tenderness, poignancy, and beauty (Bach, of course, was a master at combining these). But it does have to have any &#8216;meaning&#8217; whatsoever. One may recall music, give it the life of imagination (or hallucination) simply because one likes it  - this is reason enough. Or perhaps there is no reason at all, as Rodolfo Llinás points out.&#8221; <strong>p. 37</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside the somewhat short shrift he gives to other art forms, I guess I agree almost completely with this characterization of (instrumental) music: it becomes almost a <em>tabula rasa</em>, to be inscribed upon at will. I cannot see that it even controls what themes or emotions one might choose to associate with it &#8211; what I hear as sadness might very well be someone else&#8217;s happiness. There is no necessary common denominator in these issues. Bach&#8217;s Chaconne is a rich <em>tabula rasa</em> indeed, because of its many variations and leaps and twirls &#8211; one can read almost anything (and everything) into it, which brings me back to what I said about the whole of life being encapsulated in this one piece. And it is an extraordinary quality. And technically &#8211; I know nothing about music, and maybe that&#8217;s why I find it so difficult to believe, even though I <em>know</em> now, that all these sounds (sometimes simultaneous) are coming from one instrument and one person. But they are!</p>
<p>The version of the Chaconne I have is by Yehudi Menuhin, though I had actually wanted a version by Itzhak Perlman (one of the few violinists I know). It sounded amazing though, so I couldn&#8217;t complain. Miles later corrected my ignorance about Menuhin, and that explains why it is so very good, too.</p>
<p>A clip for you all, of Menuhin playing the Chaconne (this is only Part 1, so 7 mins long):</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://poojabharat.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/on-bach-music-part-1/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/lm1q3gadv50/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be fitting to conclude this post with one of my favourite paeans to Bach, by my favourite author in my favourite book (a lot of likes in this sentence, eh!) &#8211; from Coetzee in <em>Diary of a Bad Year</em>. (Some people say that this whole book is a paean to Bach, with its descent into a three-part structure.) I&#8217;ve never heard anything expressed so honestly as himself (and for once, I think I am right to see <em>Coetzee</em>, and not his character, saying this!); I didn&#8217;t think it would be possible to hear such unqualified, unquestioning praise from a man who questions <em>everything</em>. But here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best proof we have that life is good, and therefore that there may perhaps be a God after all, who has our welfare at heart, is that to each of us, on the day we are born, comes the music of  Johann Sebastian Bach. It comes as a gift, unearned, unmerited, for free. How I would like to speak just once to that man, dead now these many years! &#8220;See how we in the twenty-first century still play your music, how we revere and love it, how we are absorbed andmoved and fortified and made joyful by it,&#8221; I would say. &#8220;In the name of all mankind, please accept these words of tribute, inadequate though they are, and let all you endured in those bitter last years of yours, including the cruel surgical operations on your eyes, be forgotten.&#8221; <em>Diary of a Bad Year, J. M. Coetzee (&#8216;On J. S. Bach&#8217;)</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://simplyamericandotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/machinist.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3512" title="machinist" src="http://simplyamericandotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/machinist.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Unemployment is the most pressing problem facing our nation.</p>
<p>The official unemployment rate is <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">8.3%</a>, but many think the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/48468748/Real_Unemployment_Rate_Shows_Far_More_Jobless">&#8220;real&#8221;</a> unemployment rate is actually much higher.</p>
<p>So I was shocked to learn that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/08/smallbusiness/Indiana-manufacturing-jobs/index.htm">manufacturers in Indiana</a>, <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20120901/BUSINESS/309010077/rochester-jobs">in New York</a>, in <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/08/business/la-fi-skill-shortage-20120608">California</a> and in many other states can&#8217;t find the people they need to hire to ramp up production of their goods.  While we have added nearly <a href="http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/benefits-manufacturing-jobs">500,000 </a>manufacturing jobs over the last two years, a <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/AD/us_PIP_2011SkillsGapReport_01142011.pdf">study</a> published last year by Deloitte estimated that approximately 600,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs are going wanting in our country simply because of a lack of workers with the requisite skills to fill the positions.  But I am happy to report, help is on the way.</p>
<p>Given the high average wages of jobs in the manufacturing sector ($29.75 an hour in 2010), lots of Americans are getting the training necessary to fill the 600,000 manufacturing openings in this country.  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/31/news/economy/manufacturing-trade-schools/index.htm?iid=EL">A recent article in CNN </a>chronicled the huge number of Americans flooding into trade schools and community colleges that offer certificate programs designed to train our next generation of manufacturing workers.  <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-06-19/news/hc-naugatuck-college-manufacturing-center-0620-20120619_1_engineering-program-manufacturing-positions-manufacturing-workforce">Programs</a> like those offered by Naugatuck Valley Community College&#8217;s new Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center.  Naugatuck Valley offers a manufacturing certificate program.</p>
<p>CNN also did <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2012/smallbusiness/1203/gallery.manufacturing-future/index.html?iid=EL">a nice piece </a>on members of our extended American family who have joined the storied manufacturing sector.  Students training for positions in the manufacturing sector run the gamut from our heroes returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, older workers transitioning from other industries and young pups just graduating from college.</p>
<p>I talked to three young guys on the bus yesterday about manufacturing jobs.  It was clear that they had never considered preparing for a job in the manufacturing sector.  But they got interested as we discussed the benefits of attending a community college for a couple of years and being fairly sure of getting a job as <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/14/smallbusiness/trade-schools/index.htm?iid=Lead">soon as they graduate</a>.  They got really interested when I told them that new manufacturing workers can expect <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/27/smallbusiness/youth_manufacturing_jobs/index.htm?iid=EL">a starting salary of around $40,000 a year</a>, with the potential to jump to $55,000 to $65,000 in less than two years.  But they were really floored when I told them that if they did well in their new endeavor, they could make <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/27/smallbusiness/youth_manufacturing_jobs/index.htm?iid=EL">more than $100,000 annually </a>after ten years on the job.</p>
<p>Given the demand for workers and the decent money you can make, it is difficult to understand why more young people are not getting into manufacturing.  But I have a couple of theories.</p>
<p>Theory 1: The endless drumbeat that every young person in America should go get a four-year degree from a university.</p>
<p>This idea is a relatively new concept, but it is now firmly established in the national psyche.  However, it is a pipe dream, and an expensive pipe dream at that.  There have always been, and will always be, a large number of jobs in this economy that don&#8217;t require a BA from a university.  Rather than try to squeeze all young people into a &#8221;one-size fits all&#8221; university track, we should be helping young people train for careers that fit their goals and circumstances.</p>
<p>Theory 2:  Americans who don&#8217;t get a BA never make any money.  As set forth above, this is a canard.  Americans who graduate from high school and then get some post secondary education in the form of a certificate relating to manufacturing jobs can do very well thank you in terms of making a living.</p>
<p>Theory 3:  A BA is necessary in order to receive a well-rounded education.  One of my favorite lines about higher education is from the bar scene in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Good Will Hunting" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_will_hunting" rel="rottentomatoes" target="_blank">Goodwill Hunting</a></span>.  Matt Damon tells a stroppy Harvard grad student that someday he will come to understand that he &#8220;dropped a $150,000 on an education you could have got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t agree more.  I took lit classes, psych classes and political science classes in college, and in most of the classes it was just me, the professor, and 150 other people.  Not a lot of one-on-one guidance on the significance of the Iliad was offered.  Later I read it on my own, with the aid of a guide to reading it I got at the library, and I got a lot more out of it than I ever did in Lit class.  You simply don&#8217;t have to get a BA to understand and appreciate the finer things (Literature, music, philosophy, Monty Python, English Football) in life.</p>
<p>I hate to brag, but my home town of Seattle <a href="http://www.komonews.com/radio/home/featured/144051106.html">actually leads the nation </a>in the creation of manufacturing jobs.  From the big boy in town, Boeing, to a slew of great smaller manufacturers (<a href="http://www.tombihn.com/SFNT.html">Tom Bihn </a>and <a href="http://www.mckinnonfurniture.com/">McKinnon Furniture </a>to name a few), Seattle is a town that makes things.  And our community colleges are helping lots of people train for a career in the manufacturing sector.  You can&#8217;t know how happy that makes me.  Okay, maybe you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://benjaminroesch.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/andy-murray2.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-705" title="andy-murray" src="http://benjaminroesch.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/andy-murray2.jpg?w=210&h=139" alt="" width="210" height="139" /></a>As my wife can testify, I&#8217;ve consumed massive quantities of tennis these past two weeks during the 2012 U.S. Open.  So much, in fact, that I&#8217;ve had loose volleys in my hair, top spin forehands stuck between my teeth, massive overheads clinging to my thighs, second serves out wide on the bottom of my shoe, rain delays in my back pocket, backhands down the line puffing out in my exhalations.  You get the point.  Last night&#8217;s men&#8217;s final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic was a war of attrition, both physical and mental, to match any grand slam final I&#8217;ve seen.  In terms of sheer energy and will expelled by the players, it&#8217;s up there with the 2008 Wimbledon Final and this years&#8217;s 2012 Australian Open Final.  The two players punished each other, a flinching contest on live television.  Though, as is often true in tennis, it was a mental battle above all.  The conditions were absurd.  Cool and with gusting winds that found both players serving cautiously and measuring their ground strokes like level tea spoons into cake batter. Even still, shots were frequently Mary Poppinsed over the baseline, or coasted out wide, seeming to lift off like they&#8217;d sprouted wings.  The match went to the player that was able to battle and then harness his own frustration, doubt, and will the most successfully, Scotland&#8217;s Andy Murray, making it not only Murray&#8217;s first grand slam victory (although he did win the gold medal at this summer&#8217;s London games), but making him the first Brit to win a major tennis tournament since the age of Napoleon.  Okay, not quite, but close.  It was the match of the tournament.  A fitting capstone to a triumphant two weeks of tennis in New York City.</p>
<p>As thrilling as the match was, it was Murray&#8217;s reaction to FINALLY winning a grand slam that sticks in my mind a day later.  It was, in a word, muted.  I&#8217;ve watched me some tennis over the years and I&#8217;ve never seen a tennis player celebrate a major victory will less overt fanfare.  I&#8217;m sure that Murray was thrilled&#8211;you&#8217;d have to be a robot not to be, and we know Murray&#8217;s not a robot because a robot would never have hair that bad&#8211;but it was kind of hard to perceive.  He more so seemed caught in a web of dazed relief, as if viewing his victory through a funhouse mirror. Or like he was afraid he&#8217;d slipped into a dream state and at any moment would wake with a runner-up trophy in his hand. Now, he&#8217;d just played five hours of brutal tennis against the best returner of his generation and was cramping visibly, so perhaps his body simply denied him the usual catharsis that we&#8217;re used to seeing, that we associate with those triumphant moments.  But even later at his post match <a href="http://www.usopen.org/en_US/video/2012-09-10/0139b33ba0680000072b.html?promo=home">press conference</a>, if not for the giant silver trophy to his left, Murray almost looked like he&#8217;d just lost the match.  During the interview, he admitted that the dominant emotion he was experiencing was relief, citing the difficult conditions and the length of the long and grueling match.  He spoke about how the reality of it hadn&#8217;t yet sunk in, and how perhaps he was taking a cue from the perpetually staid demeanor of his new coach, Ivan Landl.  My favorite moment was when a reporter asked if he&#8217;d felt any exaltation since the victory, to which Murray replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;  It was kind of a funny moment&#8211;a simple break down in vocabulary&#8211;but I like to pretend that he knew exactly what it meant and that he meant he just didn&#8217;t have access to that particular emotion.  As if exaltation was a place he wasn&#8217;t sure how one would get to, like say, Jupiter.</p>
<p>Regardless, my heart went out to the Scot.  Once the constant bridesmaid, he is runner up no more and though I enjoy the artistry of Serbian wonder boy Novak Djokovic, who is about as fun to watch as a tennis player gets, I was thrilled to see Murray pull it off.  Way to go Andy.  Now go celebrate.  Kiss your lovely girlfriend.  Fill that massive trophy with Dom and drink heavily.  And smile, goddammit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In East Java, the &#8220;most wonderful time of the year&#8221; has just passed. Ramadan and the following holiday, Idul Fitri or Hari Lebaran (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid-ul-Fitr">Eid-ul-Fitr</a> or some variation of that in most parts of the world) is the equivalent to Christmastime in the U.S. The two celebrations/holiday seasons are far different but do share a few common threads&#8230;they&#8217;re the most significant religious holidays (respectively speaking), they disrupt the daily rhythm of life (though in different ways) and both tend to send people into a shopping frenzy on the brink of their concluding. So we&#8217;ve just gone through our version of that here, and things are pitter-pattering back to normal.</p>
<p>Ramadan in general was much more enjoyable than <a href="http://thepersonette.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/hari-kemerdekaan-ramadan-and-fasting/">last year</a>. It spurred deeper connections and observations into the Islamic faith and my community. It also made me rather sentimental during the last breaking of the fast, knowing it&#8217;d likely be my last time participating.  In addition to fasting, I also choose to go on the <em>mudik, </em>a jumble of nearly everyone on one of the world&#8217;s most densely populated islands hitting the road and heading to their hometowns to visit family and friends. It was slightly chaotic.</p>
<p>Included in all this is Halal Bihalal. During Halal Bihalal you ask forgiveness from any former wrongdoings on your part towards that person with the phrase &#8220;Mohon maaf lahir dan batin&#8221; which roughly translates to &#8220;I&#8217;m apologizing from my heart and soul.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen this said with the kind of sincerity it implies, but in many cases it came off less so.</p>
<p>Therefore the last few months have been pretty busy with the false start of school blending into the holidays, time off, holidays, celebrating, traveling around. I hadn&#8217;t captured quite as much of Ramadan as I had hoped to but I&#8217;ll leave you with a few photos from the Halal Bihalal celebrations at my school with my school being my strongest tie to my community other than my host family.</p>

<p>Halal Bihalal is celebrated, as many things are in Indonesia in gathering together with family and friends, ceremony, prayer and food. Above are pictures from Halal Bihalal celebrated amongst teachers and staff the day before school resumed from the two-week break. The photos below are from Halal Bihalal celebrated the next morning with students before lessons began.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a younger woman, I used to relish the time in a relationship when I collected my paramour’s scar stories. I would lightly trace the scars on hands, feet, arms, legs and coyly inquire where they had come from, how they were acquired.<a href="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/band-aid-retro.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-248" title="band aid retro" src="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/band-aid-retro.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>Those physical scars always seemed to lead to a discussion ripe with the knowledge I was really after – what their emotional scars were and where they hid. As a naïve, infatuated young adult, these were scars I mistakenly thought I could help heal.</p>
<p>Of course, I know all of Mr. Bailey’s scars now. Being a bit clumsy, he’s got a number of them. When we were first married, they all represented adventures or amusing stories he had before me. Now, a good number of the scars represent shared memories – a gash on his wrist a week before our second Christmas together, slightly raised bumps across his broad knuckles from accidentally punching a hole in our ceiling, celebrating our team winning a trip to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>After so much in-utero anxiety about their health, the first time they laid my pink and perfect babies in my arms, I cried over their unblemished skin, tears I hoped would bless and protect them from any harm.</p>
<p>I remember the moment Prima received the cut that is now a straight, slim two-inch scar on the front of her left hand. I think of that moment every time I catch sight of the scar.</p>
<p>But what really keeps me up at night is the mental gymnastics I do pondering where and how Prima’s and Secondo’s emotional scars will bloom. As any good parent does, I contemplate my role in creating them, which, let’s be honest, always pertains.</p>
<p>Prima and Secondo have already experienced the death of two grandparents, before the</p>
<div id="attachment_249" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bloom-finding-beauty-skinned-knees.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-249" title="Bloom finding beauty skinned knees" src="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bloom-finding-beauty-skinned-knees.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Kelly Hampton, from the blog, Enjoying the Small Things, www.kellyhampton.com</p></div>
<p>age of 10. A grandfather before Secondo was born, so the scars carried there belong to Mr. Bailey and I; a grandmother just a year ago. For a year, they only rarely spoke of her keen love for her granddaughters, her sparkling smile, the way she made them feel better when they were sick and handwrote thank you notes praising them for small kindnesses they had offered her. But since that year has slipped by in a confusing fog, they’ve begun to ask me to tell them stories, and to explain again why they lost her.</p>
<p>They’ve also lost a teacher, two great-grandparents, and two great uncles, in some cases, quite suddenly.</p>
<p>So I am aware of those scars and try my mother-bear best to prevent smaller losses – friends or routines or cherished playthings – from causing further damage.</p>
<p>Recently, Prima came home from school in an absolute fervor. The band teacher had <a href="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/playing-trumpet.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-250" title="Playing trumpet" src="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/playing-trumpet.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="430" /></a>visited the classroom and she was now on fire to join the band and play the trumpet. Having paid for guitar lessons over the summer that seemed to go well but resulted in a distain for practicing and an interest in a thousand other activities, we were less than enthusiastic. Then we took a look at the costs, and the other activities she was already committed to, we decided to postpone the band for another day.</p>
<p>Prima was completely devastated. There were tears, gnashing of teeth, casting of stones, spasmodic jumping up and down and sad faces for days. Her big brown eyes became orbs of betrayal when she expertly cast them upon us, welling.</p>
<p>I calculated how deep this cut would be. I worried it would result in a lifelong scar. I hoped the band scar might be treated with the happy moments we were also providing: birthday parties! Soccer games! Specialized tutoring! A study hall with her teacher while the other kids were at band! Not so much.</p>
<p>But then, the tide of tears seemed to stem and Prima once again found her happy place. She’s a pleasant child by nature, and I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Several days later, I was tucking her and Secondo into their bunk beds. We said our nightly prayer and then I asked each child to tell me who they wanted to pray for. Prima mentioned family and friends, then paused.</p>
<p>“I also want to pray for all of the children who want to do band but their parents won’t let them,” she intoned, reverently.</p>
<p>The dim night light shielded my shocked face as I managed to choke out, “OK. Secondo! Who do you want to pray for?”</p>
<p>So, chalk up another scar. It’s clearly not the first, and certainly not the last.</p>
<p>But maybe, (I can dream) it might be the worst for a little awhile.</p>
<div id="attachment_251" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/trumpet-playing-boy-norman-rockwell.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-251" title="trumpet playing boy  norman rockwell" src="http://moderngeorgeandmary.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/trumpet-playing-boy-norman-rockwell.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="377" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You won&#8217;t find this scene in the Bailey household these days, much to Prima&#8217;s chagrin.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a word I&#8217;m looking for: Alive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a word somebody said to me once, maybe two. Two syllables, just two meaningless exhalations of breath. Two notes of this language that can be played minor and major, but never intentionally—it seems to break little differently upon the ears of each person.</p>
<p>“Alive”—say it to yourself now, whisper it, feel it on your lips, your tongue, taste what you hear it to be. Alive. Mouth it if prying ears are seated too close, this is for you.</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>Alive means breathing. Alive means thinking. Alive means excitement. Alive means wasteless, Alive means untapped discovery. Alive means pain, that pit that gathers in your gut when you have to choose. Alive means a world, you know, the one you sense, at least sometimes. Alive means something beyond you, something you can see, feel, touch, love.</p>
<p>This is<em> everyone&#8217;s </em>“Alive”</p>
<p>But what do all those words mean? Not Alive? Alive?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a word now. Alive. A-live. Alive doesn&#8217;t mean Alive any more. Alive is too broad. If Alive means everything, it&#8217;s useless. What do you hear when I say it?</p>
<p>Here—“Alive”. What did you hear? Alive? How about Alive? I didn&#8217;t hear Alive, I just heard Alive. When I hear Alive as Alive, and you hear Alive as Alive, what does Alive mean anymore? Everything, conceivably, or nothing, if you prefer. Meaningless, I say. Just a word, two syllables, five letters, a word. Just Alive, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Alive means happy. Alive means cake. Alive means drying paint. Alive means Zip-Lock. Alive means pre-cooked. Alive means strawberry. Alive means kiss. Alive means kidney cancer. Alive means stale marker tips, left out to dry. Alive means Alive. Say it again—Alive.</p>
<p>What does it mean when I say that word now?</p>
<p>“Alive”. What do you taste?</p>
<p>A – the start, the beginning, a letter.</p>
<p>L – another.</p>
<p>I – self, yet nothing. A piece, and the only perceivable whole. Both, more. Nothing.</p>
<p>V – a symbol, a letter rarely spoken alone. V. A name. V. Twenty-two.</p>
<p>E – the silent helper, a noise, shriek, just another, just more often, you know, statistically.</p>
<p>Alive. What does it mean now? Letters? Noises, sound? Say it again. Alive. Do you taste it anymore, or does it fade like the after-fear of struck lightening. There was something, there was power, but now? Just the shakes and memories half-forgotten in seconds.</p>
<p>Alive. Hear the shock, the crash? Hear anything?</p>
<p>Alive. Does that even mean “word” anymore, or is it just, you know—</p>
<p>Alive?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nothing now, Alive. Just. Alive. And that&#8217;s it, isn&#8217;t it. Let me say it again:</p>
<p>“Alive”.</p>
<p>Here comes the fear. If Alive is just Alive, what does anything mean? If one word can fail, where lies the stability of words? Just empty promises, right? Just Alive.</p>
<p>Alive is lying there, lost in a sort of singularity. Lost in Alive. Alive means losing meaning. What did I tell you about things outside of time, outside of Alive, our Alive? They pause, sort of, suspended of rules, laws, definitions. Alive just means Alive here, and that&#8217;s all it needs to mean. Rejoice, we have brought Alive back to a stable nothingness, just—</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>But now, when I say the word Alive, it still means something, doesn&#8217;t it, at least to you. Alive can mean everything and nothing to everyone else, its outrageous, meaningless nature clear. But it still means something in your reality, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>What if I were to tell you that to invoke the meaningless sounds and letters that make up Alive is to burst the singularity, just for a moment, and in that moment, your Alive is Alive, whatever you decide Alive means. Just, Alive. You say it, and despite what I taste, it only means what Alive means to you in that timeless snapshot moment. As the color fades into the next moment, Alive becomes a singularity once more, a well of nothingness until I say it.</p>
<p>“Alive”. I taste that soft contentment just behind the glow of eyes, maybe yours, lost in a singularity of its own—a moment without time and rules, taking place during that stall between the clock&#8217;s next tick. Just warmth, just mystery, just understanding, just love, just a heartbeat, two, all at the same moment. A glow of pure yellow flowing into being through endless words, endless letters, syllables. Endless Alives.</p>
<p>This is the moment of Prestige. You see the Alive I have put out before you. With all your mind, you have recreated my Alive in yours. But it&#8217;s still not your Alive, not quite. But it&#8217;s the only real Alive in this moment.</p>
<p>When each of us says Alive, we create new meanings for Alive, meanings wiped clean immediately after, save what we see them as. “Alive” may fail in giving me the sure taste of your Alive, and you the taste of mine, but that becomes no longer the point, see?</p>
<p>“Alive” is for the one who said it, them only. The magic comes from the beauty that “Alive” really creates an Alive somewhere. Words, letters, sounds, all just ways of building every Alive. I can spell Alive as Comfort, or Smile, or Persistence, or Dlksj. It&#8217;s still means exactly what I what I wanted it to taste like, regardless of what it means to you.</p>
<p>You can show me Alive, film an Alive, draw an Alive, sing an Alive, play an Alive, but until I see Alive come to life in your eyes, Alive has been robbed of its full potential for you.</p>
<p>Say it one more time, loud enough for me to hear.</p>
<p>Alive. Say it with me.</p>
<p>“Alive”. Do you taste it? Did your Alive come Alive, so to say?</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>Alive!</p>
