<p>Sometimes, I do stupid things. Things I know are stupid but for some reason just keeping doing anyway. Why? Why do I do these stupid stupid things? For years I have wondered about it. Last night, I realized why. I broke my logic bone. Of course! All these years the answer to my problems alluded me because it was so logical and my logic bone was broken so I couldn&#8217;t physically be logical. Duh.</p>
<p>I try really hard to eat well. I have to watch my figure, you know. Sometimes, if I know I&#8217;ve eaten really well all day, I will treat myself to an ice cream after dinner. All day long, I will think about how delicious that ice cream will taste later. Usually, everything goes according to plan and I delight myself in ice cream heaven. But, on several occasions, I have felt really sick by the end of the day. Does that stop me? No. I could literally be throwing up but I will take a break from vomiting to eat that ice cream I promised myself. Even though I know it will only make me feel worse. Doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m going to eat that ice cream come hell or high water! I always regret it. The culprit behind this ridiculousness? My broken logic bone.</p>
<p>I love fruit. I especially love melon. I eat a LOT of watermelon, and honeydew melon, and cantaloupe. So much, in fact, that I have on many, many occasions made myself sick from eating too much of it. For reals. MANY occasions. You would think after the first time, I know not to eat so much melon. Nope. You would definitely think after the third or fourth time, that I would never eat that much melon again. You would be wrong. I will eat that much melon again and I will make myself sick again. Why? Broken logic bone.</p>
<p>I wear a lot of skirts. For work, for fun, I just like to wear skirts. Sometimes, they get caught in my car door when I get in. Instead of opening the door back up and moving my skirt, what do I do? I just yank it. And it rips. And this has happened to me more than once. Why didn&#8217;t I learn the first time? Broken logic bone.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&#8217;t mix my colors and whites in the wash. I KNOW that. But I do it. A lot. And every time I end up with formerly white now vagueishly blue or pink shirts. Huh. Why in the world would I do that more than once? Broken logic bone.</p>
<p>Bangs aren&#8217;t a great look for me. I&#8217;ve tried several times and it just never looks quite right. I know that. I know I&#8217;m not someone who can pull-off bangs. Doesn&#8217;t matter. Every few years, I decide I want bangs. Who&#8217;s to blame? My broken logic bone.</p>
<p>You would think that it would be easy to fix my broken logic bone. Not so. It&#8217;s been broken so long, it&#8217;s healed all wrong. My logic now walks with a very severe limp. It would probably take a lot of corrective surgeries to fix it. And who has that kind of time and money??! Not me. A broken logic bone isn&#8217;t going to kill me. Although&#8230;.actually&#8230;..it might. Uh oh.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5232977718/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5232977718/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-542" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Sobu Main Line crossing above Chuo Dori, heading into Akihabara Station" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106a-cimg2306.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368" alt="Sobu Main Line crossing above Chuo Dori, heading into Akihabara Station" width="490" height="368" /></a></h5>
<p>For some reason, I became enamored with train travel at a very early age. One of my earliest memories is of riding the Strasburg Railroad, an antique steam engine train in southeastern Pennsylvania, with my grandparents. I returned to daycare after my first trip to Washington, DC, recounting only the experience of riding the metro, including pitch-perfect recitation of, “Doors closing &lt;ding dong&gt;.” As I grew older, rail transit became a fundamental element of how I interacted with the world. Trains have meant never needing to brave the commuter traffic of Washington or New York metro areas, arriving safely at my destination after enjoying a few chapters of a book. While living in Japan, trains literally carried me anywhere I wanted to go, and the micro-worlds found above, below and around major hubs packed enough activity to merit their own anthropological study.</p>
<p>It was these thoughts that came to mind when I first heard mentions of the stimulus funding that had been marked for investment in US rail infrastructure. It was disappointing to watch how quickly the public discussion devolved into debate over whether we ought to be spending any money for this at all. Some politicians equated investment in public transportation with socialism and found that adopting an anti-train platform could help one garner a respectable amount of votes. What makes this all a bit absurd is that, with population growth projections of over 100 million in the next several decades, the choice between investing and not is a false one. Even more ridiculous, the much maligned stimulus funds merely propose to bring many existing and decrepit transit systems up to something resembling working order, and the so-called high speed rail plans are mere shadows compared to what already exists or is being built in Europe, Japan and China. The ship is sinking and we are arguing about whether to plug the hole.</p>
<p>It is a complex problem that needs to be addressed if we are to move forward, but I do not plan to jump into this technical, financial and political brouhaha. Rather than add to the shouting, I am much more interested in shining a light on the unique and fun aspects of train centric development that seem to often be overlooked by a largely car dependent society. So far, attempts at teasing out the precise dimensions of this idea have yielded an amorphous collection of images and experiences. As I tried explaining to my friend Christa a few weeks ago, I have not yet been able to define “train culture” but know it when I see it. The following examples are a starting point in painting a picture of these intangibles:</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5306862148/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5306862148/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551" style="margin:0;" title="Lexington Avenue Subway" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106b-img_4171.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327" alt="Lexington Avenue Subway" width="490" height="327" /></a></h5>
<p>I grew up watching my father leave for work around 5:30 in the morning, a 90 minute car commute (each way). My father loves life as much as anyone else, so I often wonder what he might have done with an extra three hours a day. I have worked in Philadelphia, Washington, DC and New   York, but for my entire career have never commuted by auto. Choosing to live and work in urban environments with mass transit, taking me out of the driver’s seat, was a conscious choice to ensure that I can always make productive use of my time. I have polished off many a good book on my way to and from work.</p>
<p><a href="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106c-img_3640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-558" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="New York Pennsylvania Station" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106c-img_3640.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327" alt="New York Pennsylvania Station" width="490" height="327" /></a></p>
<p>For a time, I was living in New Jersey but working in Washington four days a week. I took Amtrak down the Northeast Corridor early Monday morning and back Thursday evening. I usually departed on the trip down around 6:00am, making use of the quiet car to rest before jumping head first into the day when I arrived at Union Station. On the return trip, I could finish work, pull out a book, and in some cases even make a new friend. Though we grumbled about Amtrak’s less than stellar on-time statistics, in truth no one was sorry to have avoided a grueling trek up or down Interstate 95.</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5272450941/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5272450941/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Tram in Hong Kong Central district" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106d-img_0959.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327" alt="Tram in Hong Kong Central district" width="490" height="327" /></a></h5>
<p>Hong Kong has a convenient and well-maintained metro system. It can take you all the way from Hong Kong Island to the border with Guangdong  Province. Though not quite as fast, the brightly colored tram pictured above is another way to get around the central business district. For 2 HKD (about $0.25) you can take in the changing scenery, hang your arm out in the harbor breeze, and get up close and personal with the local inhabitants while en route to your destination.</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5143311655/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5143311655/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-564" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Rice fields in Zhejiang Province, flying past at 200 km/h" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106e-cimg8794.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368" alt="Rice fields in Zhejiang Province, flying past at 200 km/h" width="490" height="368" /></a></h5>
<p>China is investing in rail infrastructure as if its future depended on it (which it very well may, as anyone who has sat through a Beijing traffic jam can attest). It is building a high speed rail network comparable to Europe and Japan’s, as well as extensive regional rail (much of which still runs faster than Amtrak’s Acela), local services and metro systems. For my wife Min and I, this means that the 350km trip from Shanghai to Jinhua to visit our parents, four and a half hours at highway speeds, can be made in about two while comfortably zipping across the countryside and enjoying tea brewed by aid of the onboard hot water dispenser.</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5162084447/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5162084447/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-566" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Shinkansen train stopping at Kyoto Station" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106f-img_1416.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368" alt="Shinkansen train stopping at Kyoto Station" width="490" height="368" /></a></h5>
<p>Japan’s Shinkansen trains whisk passengers between major cities at speeds of up to 300 km/h, stopping in central city transportation hubs with seamless connection to regional rail and metros. Their cost competitiveness and convenience (no security lines or baggage check) has led to the elimination of some short and medium haul flights. One could finish work in Osaka, hop on the Tokaido Shinkansen and be back in Tokyo (550 km away) in time for dinner. Despite the distances involved, Japanese from different regions can jump from city to city almost as effortlessly as data moving between nodes on a computer network.</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5225131162/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5225131162/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-568" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Shinjuku Station South Entrance" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106g-cimg2034.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368" alt="Shinjuku Station South Entrance" width="490" height="368" /></a></h5>
<p>In Tokyo, as in other large cities, extensive rail and metro networks have a profound impact on the rhythm of Japanese life. Stations often serve as focal points for neighborhoods. They are one of the most common locations for meeting others. Large department stores and grocery halls built into hub stations are always buzzing with activity as commuters stop to pick up items on the way home (I did my weekly grocery run at Odakyu’s food hall under Shibuya Station). Shinjuku Station, the Guinness world record holder for most passenger volume, has enough restaurants, vendors and services that one could survive a lifetime without leaving the complex.</p>
<h5><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5160139394/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-570" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Shimokitazawa" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106h-img_0961.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368" alt="Shimokitazawa" width="490" height="368" /></a></h5>
<p>The Shimokitazawa neighborhood in Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward is defined by the fact that it surrounds its train station of the same name. The tiny apartments and shops on narrow streets and allies crammed into the spaces between the intersecting Odakyu and Keio Inokashira lines create its characteristic charm. For many in the US, it might be challenging to understand how this could be desirable, but the residents of Shimokita wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<h5><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5306263297/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">Flickr</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelvito/5306263297/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-573" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Christmas morning memorial for Mama Doe, at Grand Central Terminal" src="http://likeafishinwater.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110106i-img_4101.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327" alt="Christmas morning memorial for Mama Doe, at Grand Central Terminal" width="490" height="327" /></a></h5>
<p>In some ways I think travel by train helps us to remember that we are part of something bigger. New York’s Grand Central Terminal has more platforms than any other train station in the world, dispatching riders to destinations throughout New  York State and Connecticut. The Main Concourse is typically awash with travelers headed to meetings with colleagues, friends and family. It vibrates with unmistakable energy confirming that life happens here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p>Yes, we are not Europe, Japan or China. There are difficult barriers we face. We have so much existing non-compact development, which makes rail impractical for some areas. Highway travel and petrol are not priced to reflect their true costs, which distort financial viability projections for public transit projects. Both of these contribute to a way of thinking that equates car ownership with personal freedom, but more cars and more highways are not scalable. We should not build trains (or other infrastructure) to nowhere, but where and when we must build there is a great opportunity to rethink how we as a society wish to cultivate our way of life. I hope that by calling more attention to these additional benefits we can reframe the discussion away from incremental changes to the status quo. Doors are opening &lt;ding dong&gt;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_21" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 255px"><a href="http://interpretationnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ipad.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-21" title="child using ipad" src="http://interpretationnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ipad.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300" alt="Child using iPad." width="245" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ryan has fun at preschool using the iPad; photo courtesy Above and Beyond Education.</p></div>
<p>OK I admit it – my nearly-three-year-old daughter is more familiar with iPads than I am. It’s not hard – I think I have only just fully realised I am raising a “screen-ager”. Once they started appearing at her preschool, I should have realised that if I didn’t catch up soon, I was going to be left behind; and possibly speaking an entirely different language according to the latest scrabble dictionary!</p>
<p>The infamous Douglas Adams came up with a set of rules that describes our reactions to technology;</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</em></li>
<li><em>Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</em></li>
<li><em>Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</em><em> </em></li>
</ol>
<p>So perhaps I should not be surprised that my daughter asked for a ‘pink ‘puter’ for her third birthday. Although I was still a little taken aback when I spotted one in a local café being used by a similarly-sized girl. She was colouring while mum drank coffee. Not a lidless felt-tip in sight.</p>
<div id="attachment_14" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://interpretationnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/laptop.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14" title="laptop" src="http://interpretationnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/laptop.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="Children using laptop; S Mankelow" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Josie and William Webb of Christchurch both learned their ABCs thanks to programmes like &#039;Letterland&#039;.</p></div>
<p>I must admit, iPads are particularly well-suited to the preschool market. They are small and compact – much like many pre-schoolers. They have no power cords to trip on, chew on or get caught on. You can carry them and plonk them down anywhere you (or the child) likes. They are instantly on – which cuts down on whinge-time. They are intuitive to use – kids touch everything and these things are made to be touched! No keys to bash and get stuck up with nutella.</p>
<p>And according to i-TUNES, over 20,000 educational Apps (May 2011). But of course, like with all media, not all Apps are created equal. It’s easy to get excited about the possibilities, without first checking if the experiences you are buying into are quality ones.</p>
<p>Luckily there are plenty of websites and blogs to help; this is just a few:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teacherswithapps.com/" target="_blank">www.teacherswithapps.com</a>- Founded by two teachers this site reviews educational apps, under the premise that they are the tools of the future, if used responsibly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adesontheweb.com/" target="_blank">www.adesontheweb.com</a> – This site posts reviews of apps being used by Apple Distinguished Educators; searchable by name or grade level.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.momswithapps.com/" target="_blank">www.momswithapps.com</a> – Moms with Apps is a collaborative group of family-friendly developers seeking to promote quality apps for kids and families.</p>
<p><a href="http://ictece.blogspot.com/2011/05/ipad-for-manaia-kindergarten.html">ictece.blogspot.com</a> &#8211; This NZ blog focuses on issues relating to children and teachers using Information and Communication Technology in education.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.core-ed.org/">blog.core-ed.org/</a>  &#8211; CORE Education is a NZ non-profit organisation devoted to education.</p>
<p>And of course, if iPads are useful in formal education, what is their potential role in informal learning situations such as museums and visitor centres? Our July newsletter highlights Tauranga Art Gallery’s first go at incorporating iPads into the Lynley Dodd exhibition.  On pedestals child-high; yeah they had a clear idea of their target audience.</p>
<p>New Plymouth Museum Puke Ariki launched an iPad-based visitor experience in August last year, claiming to be the first in New Zealand to deploy iPads for public use in a museum. Their story can be found at <a href="http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/">www.nzmuseums.co.nz/</a></p>
<p>And a partnership between DOC and University of Otago’s Centre of Design will see a trial of iPads use in the Arthur’s Pass Visitor Centre launched during Conservation Week this September. See the story in our newsletter or find out more on the DOC website www.doc.govt.nz.</p>
<p>Imagine visitors wandering around your art gallery, centre, museum or park with an interactive App that encourages them to look at details and discover connections to their own lives. It’s getting closer every day.</p>

<p>According to a study by <a href="http://www.latd.com/">Latitudeº Research</a>, “<a href="http://latd.tv/kids/kidsTech.pdf">Children’s Future Requests for Computers &amp; the Internet</a>,” kids ages 12 and under are predicting that the future of media and technology lies in better integrating digital experiences with real-world places and activities.</p>
<p>Sounds like a mandate for interpretation to me! It’s a brave new world out there &#8211; and according to my daughter, it should come in hot pink.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">I sold my 1992 BMW 316 today. While I&#8217;m happy it found a good new owner and glad that I now have a better car to call my own, I can&#8217;t help but reminisce a little about the good times with the Bimmer. It was built like a rock and always made it back no matter how long the drive home was. This also got me thinking back to all my cars till now so here&#8217;s a short story of my automotive adventures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1971 Plymouth Valiant</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mamavalient.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2892" title="mamavalient" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mamavalient.jpg?w=500&#038;h=339" alt="" width="500" height="339" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some time back in &#8217;95 or &#8217;96 my dad brought home this boat of a car. I didn&#8217;t really appreciate it till many years later, but I sure miss that thing a lot. Slant six, 225, four barrel carbs, with 3 speed automatic on the column, no power steering (we took it out as it was useless anyway), with room for six inside and a body trunk for at least three more. My dad restored that car from the ground up and while it was never worth as much money as the restoration cost, it was a great looking ride and my first every day car. I was 17 when I started driving it to high school, was 18 when I took it to prom instead of a limo, and drove it well past college. I loved playing classic rock in it and often received compliments on the street; once while bringing home 8 cement bags in the trunk (heavy!) I got a nod from some cholo&#8217;s passing me in a low rider. Had they only known that my car was riding low for a completely different reason&#8230; We sold it as it wasn&#8217;t the most economical car to have, with a 4.0 liter engine and all, plus by then I had another car already.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And yes, that is my mom with our family Valiant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1972 Datsun 240z</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/100_0751test.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2884" title="100_0751test" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/100_0751test.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We bought the Z with restoration in mind. It was a very sweet two seater with an inline 6, manual 4-speed transmission that tore the asphalt it rode on. I learned how to drive a stick shift on it and received my first speeding ticket in it as well. The restoration never really went as planned and my dad did most of the work on this father-son project. Somewhere along the line I lost interest in it and simply wanted a car to drive as opposed to driving a car that always needed more work. We had it painted, reupholstered, my dad converted all the gauges to white faces with a nice green glow at night, original rims were repainted, but the engine was mostly untouched till the end. All new rubbers made it very stable but the exhaust fumes that somehow pushed their way inside the car made it a smelly pain to drive. I later found out that it&#8217;s a common problem with the 240z, that the only way to drive was really to seal it completely and drive with everything closed. I sold it a month before moving back to Poland to a kid who would continue the restoration who also had a 240z in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2002 Toyota 4Runner</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0938.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2890" title="IMG_0938" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0938.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a Thanksgiving eve back in 2005 when my dad said he would help me sponsor a car, any car, as long as it was a Toyota 4Runner. That&#8217;s because of my mom&#8217;s 1998 4Runner that has proven to be one of the best cars we ever had. We bought mine that Thanksgiving weekend. 2002 is the last model of the 3rd generation body style, with six cylinders and a 3.4liter engine. This was my first modern car with electric everything, air conditioning, and the one thing I loved the most, a retracting back window! I put that car through its 2wd paces on the road and in the Sierra Nevada mountains on various camping trips. It served me well as a tent and I almost fit with the back seats folded. I planned to sell it before my move to Poland but gave it back to my dad instead and it now awaits him in Wrocław.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1992 BMW 316</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_5309.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2886" title="DSC_5309" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_5309.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another deal with my dad I traded the 4Runner for a more economical BMW in Poland. Oddly enough the bimmer doesn&#8217;t really burn a whole lot less petrol (gas) than the 4Runner. In fact, for a 1.6 liter it has an enormous appetite for fuel. While a 10 year step backward in my car adventures, it served me well for what it was supposed to do; get me from point A to B. In between those points it also got us through Chech Republic, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and all of Poland of course. It also did quite a bit of work for my dad during his house construction a couple of years ago  and it never got stuck in the dirt road that served as a street during a 4 year construction project in our Polish neighborhood. I did get a little tired though of investing money into repairs I felt were worth more than the car itself. It works fine now and will serve its next owner well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2004 Mazda 6</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1040556.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2898" title="P1040556" src="http://polvadis.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1040556.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I am happy to report on my newest car yet, my new (old) Mazda 6. Four cylinders, 1.8liter gas engine, 5-speed manual, auto and electric everything including my very first climate control system with ice cold air conditioning! For the money it was the best looking wagon I could find and I&#8217;m liking the way it looks more and more with every drive. I&#8217;m hoping it will last me for years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what does your list look like? Feel free to share in the comments section!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Dog-What-Dogs-Smell/dp/1416583408"><img title="Inside of a Dog" src="http://insideofadog.com/images/Inside-of-a-Dog-cover.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="528" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside of a Dog, by Alexandra Horowitz</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m an avid reader of book reviews, and I first heard of this wonderful book in the New York Times Book Review. Critic Cathleen Schine gives a fair and warm review of the book, writing that author Alexandra Horowitz is keen on dropping &#8220;some lovely observation, some unlikely study, some odd detail that causes one&#8217;s dog-loving heart to flutter with astonishment and gratitude.&#8221; You could hardly find a more fitting description of what this book did to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://insideofadog.com/author.php" target="_blank"> Alexandra Horowitz</a> is a psychology professor at Barnard College, Columbia University, and an increasingly renowned animal cognitive scientist, now specializing in the minds and lives of dogs.</p>
<p><em>Inside of a Dog</em> is almost like a book-length version of Temple Grandin&#8217;s chapter on dogs in <a title="Review: Animals Make Us Human" href="http://thedoggerel.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/review-animals-make-us-human/" target="_blank"><em>Animals Make Us Human</em></a>. It&#8217;s a thoughtfully presented review of the behavior and body of a dog, without muddling the information with overly cutesy asides or peremptory training tips. It&#8217;s just straight science, simplified for your average dog owner.</p>
<p>Appropriately, I learned a lot about dogs from this book. By this stage in my dog reading, I feel like I&#8217;ve already learned most of what I could learn about canine psychology and behavior. It&#8217;s not a very old science and most of the reputable research has been widely disseminated throughout the seminal training texts. But Horowitz drops a lot of knowledge on you in this hefty book. And I enjoyed every second of it. For instance, you know why dogs are so good at catching Frisbees? Horowitz explains, in more scientific terms than I am capable of, that it&#8217;s because dogs see things about a millisecond faster than we do. Because of this ability and motion sensitivity, dogs are much better at predicting the path of a flying disc than mere humans.</p>
<p>Little facts like this are a large part of the appeal of this book, but I liked it more for Horowitz&#8217;s detail-oriented and almost narrative style. She gives you the scientific evidence that you crave, but she also gives you the gentle lightheartedness of a fellow dog lover. Her anecdotes about her beloved mixed breed Pumpernickel are heartwarming without being overly saccharine.</p>
<p>Horowitz is clearly a great researcher, but she&#8217;s also a great writer. She has written previously for the New Yorker and it shows. Girl knows what she&#8217;s doing. I appreciated this book that much more because of her skill with a pen. Dog people are not necessarily also word people (and often for good reason), and so it&#8217;s a special bonus when you find someone who is both, like Horowitz (and like <a title="Review: The Other End of the Leash" href="http://thedoggerel.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/review-the-other-end-of-the-leash/" target="_blank">Patricia McConnell</a>, I&#8217;d wager).</p>
<p>All that to say, I highly recommend this book. I&#8217;m inclined to give a copy to the other dog owners in my life, because there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that they&#8217;d enjoy this book as much as I did.</p>

<p><em>*See <a href="../2011/06/28/travel-portland-with-friends-day-1/" target="_blank">Day 1</a>, <a href="../2011/06/29/travel-portland-with-friends-%E2%80%93-day-2/" target="_blank">Day 2</a> and <a href="http://bforbonnie.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/travel-portland-with-friends-%E2%80%93-day-3/" target="_blank">Day 3</a></em></p>
<p>For breakfast, <a href="http://www.sallyjshim.com/blog" target="_blank">Sally</a> took us to <a href="http://pinestatebiscuits.com/" target="_blank">Pine State Biscuits</a>.  I think she ordered me a Reggie Deluxe &#8211; Fried chicken, bacon &amp; cheese topped with gravy and an egg.  The biscuit was buttery and fried chicken was crisped to perfection.  I paired that with a bloody mary and that was sensational.  After a big breakfast, we walked to a kids store <a href="http://www.grasshopperstore.com/" target="_blank">Grasshopper</a> and found some unique gifts + chatted with the owner for a bit.  I&#8217;ve been wanting to check out <a href="http://baristapdx.com/" target="_blank">Barista</a>, which happens to be nearby, so we hopped in for milk + coffee.  Their coffee was great, but more on the tangy side.  While we were relaxing, I spotted ice cream cart <a href="http://saltandstraw.com/" target="_blank">Salt &amp; Straw</a> and of course we had to give it a try!  I had the Pear and Blue Cheese flavor.  At first I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but now I&#8217;m hooked &#8211; it was refreshingly light (from the pear) with nice texture + little saltiness (from the cheese).  Wish I can have more!</p>
<p>For lunch, we met up with <a href="http://www.designformankind.com" target="_blank">Erin</a>, who happened to be in town, at <a href="http://www.grunerpdx.com/" target="_blank">Grüner</a>.  It was nice to finally meet her in person, she&#8217;s such a sweet girl!  After lunch, we spent time at <a href="http://www.alderandcoshop.com/" target="_blank">Alder &amp; Co.</a>, a shop I wish I can live in.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we stayed home to rest.  Sally and I were ready for a nap (especially after all those food we had!).  Oh, how I wish I can borrow some energy from Miss V and the boys&#8230;  While we relaxed, Sally&#8217;s husband was busy preparing dinner &#8211; roasted beef and freshly made salsa.  Sigh, that was wonderful.  :)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124002.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124002.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124002.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>Today we slept in much longer than anticipated because there were no sprinklers in sight. Once we rose from our tents we packed up and had some breakfast and took off towards the Natural Bridges national monument.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124039.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124039.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124039.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>It was supposed to be an easy ride into the park with plenty of time to spare for sightseeing once we arrived at the Natural Bridges. We knocked out the first 25 miles pretty quickly and stopped for a bite in Blanding, UT. I, Cam, had my first ever breakfast quesadilla and it was impressive. At the end of our breakfast this extremely old Ute Indian walked up to us and pointed at Karey and said &#8220;you should be called arrowhead&#8221; and she chuckled and walked away, so if any of you run into him that should be his nickname for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>After we finished breakfast we started to head out of town and realized there was an amazing dinosaur museum.  So of course we had to stop! After touring around in the museum we realized that we really needed to get on the road.  We still had a good amount of riding left and we all wanted to do some sight seeing.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124128.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124128.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124128.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a> </p>
<p>According to our maps it was supposed to be a few hills with roughly ten miles downhill but that wasn&#8217;t the case. The ride into the park was much harder than anticipated and we are both worried about riding 93 miles tomorrow in this terrain.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124155.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124155.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124155.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>One thing that we did stop to check out was an Anasazi Indian ruin site. It is crazy how they built their dwellings in the the side of a cliff!</p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124228.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124228.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124228.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>Once we finally got into the park and got everything set up we headed out to see the natural bridges. They were amazing, it was really cool to think about how a river carved these huge arches over millions of years.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124342.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124342.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124342.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124433.jpg"><img src="http://teamwooha.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/20110713-124433.jpg?w=450" alt="20110713-124433.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>The plan for tomorrow is to be on the road as early as we can and knock out 93 miles to Hanksville, UT. We will see how it goes!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_11" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://katstravel.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/florence.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11" title="Florence" src="http://katstravel.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/florence.jpg?w=300&#038;h=202" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me at the Ponte Vecchio, Florence in 2001</p></div>
<p>For my 16<sup>th</sup> birthday my parents surprised me with a trip to Europe.  It was a tale of 2 cities – Paris and London.  I had no idea what they were plotting.  I had told them about the trip and I really wanted to go but they told me that it was too much money and I thought that was that.  Then on Friday 12<sup>th</sup> April 1996 they told me that I needed to pack my bags because the following day (my actual 16<sup>th</sup> birthday) I was going on a plane to London!  Oh the excitement of trying to navigate the underground tube network and I actually cried when I got to Paris.  I never thought I would see with my own eyes the same images that were in my high school French text book!</p>
<p>The following year, I wanted to go back.  A new school trip – this time to Madrid, Paris, and Rome.  My parents didn’t know at this stage that I had caught the Euro-fever so when I realized that they weren’t forking out for this new trip I saved up all my money and borrowed a staggering sum (about $500 I think) from a close friend to pay for it.  I did pay my friend back eventually and it was totally worth it.  I was hooked on Europe.</p>
<p>Later I went to Barnard College, Columbia University in New York City.  The urban environment was the change I was looking for coming from Maine but it still wasn’t Europe.  Luckily American universities provide the opportunity to study abroad so I spent a year of my college education divided between Bologna, Italy and Grenoble, France.  I was in heaven!  I couldn’t bear to leave and return to New York to finish the final year of my degree.</p>
<p>But return I did, because my parents would have disowned me and because I had no viable reason to stay.  I couldn’t work in Europe without a permit and I didn’t want to study anymore, plus what would have been the point?  A week into my senior year at Columbia 911 happened.  It was a crazy time to be in New York.  I received an outpouring of support from all of my French and Italian friends I had made while I was studying in Europe.  I missed them so badly.</p>
<p>Once I finally graduated in 2002 I was still in the same situation as I was when I left Europe.  I still had no work permit and no viable reason to reside in Europe.  As luck would have it, and it was definitely luck, or divine intervention, I got a job working for a large multinational company who transferred me to the London office within a year of starting my job.</p>
<p>So here I am in London after all these years and I absolutely love it.  More on that later.  With its close proximity to Southern Europe (read Spain, France, Italy) I can now travel to all my favorite destinations on a regular basis.  In this blog I will be describing my travel experiences mostly in Europe and I want you to feel like you are coming along with me.  This will not be one of those go here, see this, book this deal types of blogs.  I just want to share with you my personal experiences, reflections, observations, thoughts, feelings, etc.  And if what you read inspires you to book a trip, well then great!  And if it doesn’t then I hope that you enjoy what you read.</p>
<p>Special thanks to my mom who recently told me “you go on a lot of vacations” as if it was some kind of accusation.  Well, it’s true, I do!  I live to travel, I work to travel, and I love to travel.  And that’s why I’ve started this blog.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2201" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mc6pack.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/imag0207.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2201" title="IMAG0207" src="http://mc6pack.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/imag0207.jpg?w=300&#038;h=179" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Please have a fuse. Please, please have a fuse.&quot;</p></div>
<p>“<em>Dad, I found one!”</em></p>
<p>I looked down. Sure enough, Slim <em>had</em> found one, and he was understandably excited.</p>
<p>“Set it off to the side,” I told him, a knowing smile turning up at the corners of my mouth. “We’ll save it for tonight. And keep looking, guys. There are probably more.”</p>
<p>He and his siblings continued to scour the grass, hoping to discover more treasures.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*****</p>
<p>One of the greatest moments in childhood is finding unexpected treasures, and for a kid, there are <em>a lot</em> of things that qualify as treasures. A couple that come to mind:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>1. Any form of monetary unit</strong> (parking lots are prime territories).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>2. Any form of insect</strong> (at least for Perpetual Motion).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>3. Any lost/misplaced toy</strong> (I’ve seen Slim practically moved to tears after finding one of his clone trooper’s tiny, plastic blasters he’d been missing, even though there were 30 other tiny, plastic blasters in a Ziploc cache of weapons that looked, to me, pretty much identical to it).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>4. Any stray M &amp; Ms</strong> (found in the nook, or perhaps even cranny, of a car seat).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>5. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Any unexploded firework</span></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_2202" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mc6pack.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_1420.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2202" title="IMG_1420" src="http://mc6pack.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_1420.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cardboard tanks are a treasure.</p></div>
<p>And <em>that</em> was Slim&#8217;s treasure: an unfired missle extracted from a cardboard tank.</p>
<p>Holy sweet mother of non-ignited incendiary devices! To stumble across anything that still had a fuse – be it a firecracker, a bottle rocket, a smoke bomb – the day after setting off fireworks was a thrill I remember fondly from my youth.</p>
<p>In fact, discovering an unlit firework probably trumped all other childhood treasures.</p>
<p> Maybe even finding my stormtrooper’s tiny, plastic blaster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*****</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>What were treasures in your youth? What kinds of things are treasures as an adult? And, most importantly, do you have a lighter?</em></strong></h2>

<p>It helps that I have never been tempted to climb the vertical career ladder (I have more of a horizontal, snake and ladders approach) and that my husband has enough ambition for four people.<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070083.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3560" title="Coffee beans in milk" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070083.jpg?w=630&#038;h=563" alt="" width="630" height="563" /></a>I&#8217;m secure in the knowledge that I haven&#8217;t and won&#8217;t miss the formative moments, minutes, hours and days of a warm, unfocused bundle becoming a person.  And that delicate as she is, she won&#8217;t be crushed by the possible coarseness of strangers.  Instead, she is allowed to form along her natural inclinations.<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070084.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3561" title="Sifted flour ready to go into milk and butter" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070084.jpg?w=630&#038;h=472" alt="" width="630" height="472" /></a>Sometimes my girlfriends ask how it doesn&#8217;t drive me crazy, spending all that time together without a break.  But I just think of this as the Layla and me era, which will pass in the same way the previous eras of my life have, when she begins school.  Things are oppresive only if you think they are going to last forever.  And nothing does right? <a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070085.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562" title="Dough coming away from the side of the pan" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070085.jpg?w=630&#038;h=472" alt="" width="630" height="472" /></a>Still it&#8217;s hard not to get lost in the fabric that is the minutiae of everyday, like one of those fat black flies that buzz aimlessly against a pane of glass.  Or spending half an hour trying to find the right day underwear.  (What? You <em>don&#8217;t</em> have day of the week underpants?)<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070088.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3563" title="Shiny choux dough after the eggs have been added" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070088.jpg?w=630&#038;h=480" alt="" width="630" height="480" /></a>That is why this blog has been so useful.  It  introduced a bit of structure, direction and soothing repetition (as opposed to the irritating repetition of putting playmobil toys and their accompanying tiny accessories away daily).  I&#8217;ve kept diaries since I learned how to write, often with scraps of things that I found interesting but without the risk of someone reading, they were little more than vessels into which I could discard thoughts that nagged me.<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070089.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3564" title="Choux pastry ready to go into the oven" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070089.jpg?w=630&#038;h=478" alt="" width="630" height="478" /></a>I never expected people to read this blog but I <em>hoped</em> they would.<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070095.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3565" title="Choux ready to be filled and glazed" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070095.jpg?w=630&#038;h=840" alt="" width="630" height="840" /></a>So I am over the moon to be mentioned in this week&#8217;s New York Magazine!  &#8221;<a href="http://nymag.com/travel/features/berlin-restaurants-2011-7/">The Urbanist&#8217;s Guide to Berlin: Where to Eat</a>&#8220;.<span id="more-3555"></span></p>
<p>Take a look and if you have more places to add, include it in the comment section.<a href="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070093.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3566" title=" A little helping hand: adding butter to the custard filling" src="http://foodieinberlin.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/l1070093.jpg?w=630&#038;h=472" alt="" width="630" height="472" /></a>Like this blog, éclaires take time to put together but the rewards of both make it time well spent</p>
<p>The choux pastry itself is straightforward, as long as you follow a few rules, the most important of which is: keep your ratios correct.  In other words, don&#8217;t let your butter and milk (or water depending on your recipe) evaporate way down and then add your flour.</p>

65ml milk<br />
65ml water<br />
50g butter, cut into small cubes, at room temperature<br />
1/2 teaspoon of sugar<br />
75g flour<br />
pinch of salt<br />
2 eggs, beaten, plus egg wash</p>
<p>Coffee Custard Filling<br />
250ml whole milk<br />
2 tablespoons whole coffee beans<br />
60g sugar<br />
1 egg<br />
2 tablespoons cornflour<br />
25g butter, diced into small cubes</p>
<p>Coffee Glaze<br />
100g icing sugar<br />
2 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee</p>
<p>Method:<br />
1. Preheat oven to 180ºC. Line a flat tray with baking paper.<br />
2. Take a large piece of baking paper or aluminum foil and make a sharp crease down the middle. Sift the flour 3 times, ending with the flour on the creased paper / tinfoil. (You will be using it as a funnel to shoot the flour into the milk and butter).<br />
3. Place the milk, butter, sugar, water and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to the boil quickly then off the heat, shoot the flour in and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan.<br />
4. Allow to cool to room temperature and then beat in the eggs a little at a time, making sure it&#8217;s fully incorporated before adding more. (If you have a stand beater, plunk it in there and let it do the work). The texture you are trying to attain is one that, were you to scoop up a spoonful with a wooden spoon and flick your wrist, would come off the spoon with a splat. If it clings on, it needs more egg. Your choux should be shiny.<br />
5. Put into a pastry bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle and pipe out 12 éclairs spaced 5cm apart. Brush with egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown and puffed up.<br />
6. When cool enough to handle, pierce one end with a metal skewer. Then twirl the skewer around to gather up any webs of dough inside (this will impede your custard from getting to the end of the éclair. If they seem wet inside, put them back in the oven for a few minutes to dry up. While still warm, use a nozzle to make a hole in the skewered end for when you come to filling with custard.</p>
<p>7. For the custard filling, place the milk, coffee beans, sugar and a pinch of salt in a saucepan and heat to just under the boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and leave to steep for 15 minutes. Meanwhile whisk the egg and the cornflour in a small bowl and set aside.<br />
8. Strain the ilk mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl. Return the mixture to the pan and heat again to just under the boil, then whisk 2 tablespoonful into the egg mixture. Pour this back into the pan and whisk constantly over a low heat until you have a thick custard.<br />
9. Strain the custard and then stir to release the steam. Sir in the butter cubes one by one. Place a sheet of cling film on the custard&#8217;s surface so a skin doesn&#8217;t form, and leave to cool.</p>
<p>10. Put the custard into a piping bag fitted with a 5mm nozzle and fill the choux pastry via the hole on the side. It helps to hold the pastry upright so that gravity helps you a bit. (You can also just slice them in half and spoon the custard in but if you&#8217;ve already gone to all this trouble&#8230;you might as well.)</p>
<p>11. Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl, then gradually whisk in the espresso. When smooth and glossy, spoon the glaze over the éclairs. Allow the icing to set before you serve.</p>
