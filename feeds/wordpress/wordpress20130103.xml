				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Facebook,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. I need to figure things out. Like how you are sucking all my time and how you&#8217;re making me into someone I am not. Like how you make me hate myself as I skim through posts and pictures of my so-called &#8220;friends&#8221;. God, their lives are so perfect! Why is my life not as perfect as theirs? Am I the only one who have to deal with occasional bouts of jealousy and self-doubt every time I read about a &#8220;friend&#8221; who bought his own private jet, and another &#8220;close friend&#8221; who spent his holidays on the moon? I feel so pathetic.</p>
<p>Oh please, don&#8217;t stare at me with those wide pitiful eyes. That won&#8217;t work anymore. I know, things were going so great between us, and it&#8217;s such a shocker that I&#8217;m telling you this. But this has been on the back of my mind for months, and I&#8217;m sorry it has taken me quite a long time to finally gather enough courage to confess that you and I just aren&#8217;t good for each other. Remember that time I was at the top of the Eiffel tower in Paris? For a fleeting moment, while taking in the breathtaking panorama of the City of Lights, I really felt like I was the King of the World, that everything was truly possible, and yes, that with a panoramic view of Paris at night, who needs drugs to get high? But that feeling of being invincible quickly evaporated and was immediately replaced by a seemingly innocuous thought along the lines of: &#8220;I need to share this on Facebook! Paris, you&#8217;ll now be Instagrammed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh by the way, I don&#8217;t have an Instagram account, so I might have slightly altered the line above. But then, altering wall posts and minor adjustments in statuses have become a staple part of our complicated relationship dynamics, right? You&#8217;ve always made me feel like I needed to make my posts and stories more interesting than they really are, so there you go, I made some minor adjustments in them. It&#8217;s not that the minor adjustments are lies you know, they are after all, just minor. I just want my &#8220;friends&#8221; to like my posts, isn&#8217;t it a noble motivation to alter, and in doing so fake a post? Everyone&#8217;s doing it, so nothing&#8217;s possibly wrong with it, right?</p>
<p>Listen, you&#8217;re really great. You are. And you&#8217;re way too generous, to the point that I&#8217;m really having a hard time receiving all the stuff you so generously shower upon me. How come you know that I need to get informed on what my &#8220;friends&#8221; had for dinner, or about how a &#8220;friend&#8217;s&#8221; baby just had the first poop of the baby&#8217;s life, complete with DSLR-quality pictures of the poop? And isn&#8217;t it too much information when a &#8220;friend&#8221; posted about her weird bodily functions, about another&#8217;s drunken ramblings, and beat this &#8211; about someone&#8217;s sex life?</p>
<p>Our relationship was founded on complete trust. We even made a pact to be totally honest to each other. You promised me that you will reveal to me all your secrets, that all the things you know I will know. You have given me the power to really <del>stalk</del> know someone &#8211; what someone is up to, what type of movies she likes, where she spent her weekend, what sort of jokes she finds funny, how she looks like in a swimsuit, and even when she has a period &#8211; all in the comfort of my room and with a mindless click of a button! You even told me about a friend of a friend&#8217;s family background and life history, even though that friend of a friend is someone I&#8217;ve only known through you, and wouldn&#8217;t even talk to in real life. I sometimes feel queasy about this kind of set-up. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a little unhealthy knowing too much about a person without even spending time talking with that person?</p>
<p>This is not easy for me, believe me. We had so much promise, we shared so many memories. But as time passes by, I feel like our relationship has become a little more than a superficial facade, a carefully altered representation of myself. It has been totally unexpected that with the ease you provide in communicating with &#8220;friends&#8221;, my relationships with my &#8220;friends&#8221; are increasingly becoming shallower. What went wrong? Is it because with your existence, I have been more concerned about what others think of me through my online persona? That instead of meeting and talking with friends and family, I have resigned myself to simply liking and commenting on their posts?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. You deserve someone better. I deserve a better life too &#8211; a life of genuine relationships, a life that couldn&#8217;t care less about what people think as long as I know it&#8217;s what I want, a life lived every moment without thinking of posting it online&#8230; which is why, I&#8217;m setting both of us free.</p>
<p>Farewell,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Authors" href="http://thecortex.com.au/authors/">BENJAMIN ZAUGG</a>: Right at the beginning of <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i>, there is a wonderful scene depicting Thrór, the Dwarf King of Erebor, surrounded by mountains of gold, going completely mad with greed and power. As I watched the rest of the film I would frequently find myself recalling that scene and substituting that Dwarf King with Peter Jackson.</p>
<p>At a little over 300 pages long, the original paperback of <i>The Hobbit</i> is a rather and short straightforward tale. Originally, Peter Jackson was going to tackle it in two films, adding some backstory/sidestory elements to fill out two separate features. This was a bit of a surprise, but given Jackson&#8217;s relatively strong track record I was cautiously optimistic. When I heard that he was splitting the 300-page tale into <i>three</i> films I began to worry.</p>
<div id="attachment_492" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-492" alt="Peter Jackson's The Hobbit is far too long at 170-minutes. " src="http://cortexnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bilbo_1280x1024.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" width="300" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Peter Jackson&#8217;s The Hobbit is far too long at 170-minutes.</p></div>
<p>Going in with these grave concerns I came out at the end neither disappointed nor overly pleased with what I saw. There is no doubt that the movie was a combination of two dark forces: Warner Brother Studios milking three films out of what could easily have been one or two, and Peter Jackson given unlimited power to explore every nook and cranny of his cherished middle-earth. What makes Jackson different to say, George Lucas, is that he is actually an extremely good filmmaker. So while this first installment is overloaded with tacked-on story elements it holds together far better than it has any right to.</p>
<p>If you go into this expecting a faithful film adaptation of the first third of <i>The Hobbit</i> you will probably be disappointed. However, if you want to experience a richly detailed backstory to <i>Lord of The Rings</i> where part of <i>The Hobbit</i> is the main plot line, then this may be your cup of tea. Perhaps because I went in knowing it would be more of the latter I enjoyed myself most of the time.</p>
<p>The problem with expanding the story beyond the original book seems to be that much of its spirit seems to have been lost in the process. Part of what made the book so charming was its very linear Bilbo-centric storyline and Tolkien&#8217;s excellent pacing &#8211; which was so different from LOTR. With all the backstory and &#8216;side-quests&#8217; stuffed into this installment there is an added weight that slows down the narrative and it also feels like the story is more about the fellowship than about Bilbo Baggins. This is a particular shame because I felt that Martin Freeman&#8217;s Bilbo was the best thing about the film and I would have enjoyed a film more focused on that character’s journey.</p>
<p>It is only the <i>extra</i> story elements that slow things down, not the key ones. The arrival of the dwarves and the unveiling of their plan at the hobbit hole, while a scene or two too long, was very well done. The meeting of Gollum and Bilbo is above and beyond what I ever expected, and the appearance of the Goblin King (Barry Humphries) was excellent.</p>
<p>Whole swathes of story could be cut from around the main plot points and the film would only have benefited. Instead, Jackson seemed to be pulling out every bell and whistle to keep the add-ons interesting. I lost count of how many scenes occurred on or just near an overhanging cliff (there&#8217;s a new drinking game), and by the end of the film I&#8217;d almost forgotten what normal daylight looked like, because every scene seemed to take place at either sunrise or sunset. The editing seemed to be working overtime to keep things dynamic. Just when I thought they exhausted every camera angle a new one would appear.</p>
<p>Despite being a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster of plot and despite being something other than the original tale of <i>The Hobbit</i>, the stunning visuals and extraordinary cast made this film an enjoyable watch. I have no doubt that once all three films are finally released on Blu-ray, someone somewhere will rip and edit them all into a single three-hour epic with no extraneous plot. <i>That</i> film will be incredible. In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to treat each of these installments like the extended extended edition releases that they seem to be.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I saw <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey </i>at 48 frames-per-second in 3D. I&#8217;m going to leave the discussion about this format &#8211; worthy of its own article &#8211; to a later date.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Santa, I don&#8217;t ask for much geeky stuff, but one very good gift in that area would be a Dvorak keyboard for my iPad. And please don&#8217;t give me a side real hardware keyboard, I am talking of a touchscreen keyboard (the combo external keyboard + iPad looses the battle with my Mac Air&#8230;).</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31512354@N00/730311163" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" alt="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1074/730311163_2912a98110_m.jpg" width="240" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (Photo credit: Gustavo da Cunha Pimenta)</p></div>
<p>I switched to the Dvorak keyboard map not so long ago, last July. Reason for that was not to be faster (like many others) even if this would be a nice side effect, but exploring solutions to solve the pain of a recurring carpal tunnel syndrome. My friend Paolo advised this, explaining it would make my finger, hand and wrist move way less, as a result, it should reduce the inflammation and then the pain. If you are interested in the Dvorak keyboard, jut read it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Wikipedia</a>, or from <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/">Ma.tt</a> already almost 10 years ago!</p>
<p>For learning resources, you will find plenty around the web so I won&#8217;t say much here beside a short feedback if you are interested:</p>
<p>I am not yet 100% up to speed but really happy with that switch &#8211; I am still fighting a bit for all special characters and also for french accents&#8230; but I made progress in speed compared to my Qwerty typing. I am finally touch-typing and have my pain slightly diminished, which was the main goal. While not perfect yet, still very positive change!</p>
<p>I must say though that I can&#8217;t type for a too long time or pain still comes back but it is definitely an improvement compared to Qwerty. I also still have a hard time using it when not really in a &#8216;typing mode&#8217;, for instance when taking notes in meetings. And finally, I am just a bit annoyed by the blind or Dvorak stickers that I use on my keyboards as it is not the most comfortable solution. One day I will take the time to remove and switch keys.</p>
<p>Actually, now, the very main issue is coming from iOS. The Dvorak keyboard would be a perfect story for me if only I could use it not only on my computers but also on my iPhone and iPad but I can&#8217;t! It simply seems impossible to find a way to have a Dvorak map configured on the iOS system. Come on Apple, what the heck!? Can you believe that?</p>
<p>This is supposed to be so easy to support, certainly not more than a bunch of configuration files to change. Instead of that, we are in the paradoxical situation where we were able to find a solution for hardware keyboard and not for purely software ones&#8230;</p>
<p>And let me add that this is a typical example (among plenty of others) where I would love iOS to be more open if not open source. We are so far from it now with Apple. Openness would enable a bunch of happy few to make this thing happen quickly, without hurting Apple or asking their contribution, and pleasing many other users&#8230; but no! This has a taste of &#8220;innovation is over&#8221;&#8230; I will certainly keep a very interested eye on Android phones and tablets, and feel the change coming stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>And to conclude, I took 20 minutes to write this post because, even if just a drop in the ocean, I wanted to contribute to the Dvorak keyboard cause! It is super interesting and deserves more attention from device and system makers. It also needs to be known by more users. I believe that it is an interesting option with lots of potential for people like me. When I think about people writing, typing, translating, transcribing all day; I strongly feel Dvorak could be a much bigger change worth to consider.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Turbo debriefs on IBM's 2012 "5 in 5," five projected innovations based on market and societal trends and emerging technologies that could dramatically change our world.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=6878&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IBM released its annual &#8220;5 in 5&#8243; list yesterday, the seventh year in a row whereby IBM scientists identify a list of innovations that have the potential to change the way people work, live and interact during the next five years.</p>
<p>The IBM 5 in 5 is based on market and societal trends, as well as emerging technologies from IBM&#8217;s R&amp;D labs around the world. This year, the 5 explores innovations that will be underpinnings of the next era of computing, what IBM has described as &#8220;the era of cognitive systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>This next generation of machines will learn, adapt, sense, and begin to experience the world as it really is, and this year&#8217;s predictions focus on one element of the this new era: The ability of computers to mimic the human senses &#8212; in their own manner, to see, smell, touch, taste and hear.</p>
<p>But before you try and spoon-feed your iPad some vanilla yogurt, let&#8217;s get more practical.</p>
<p>These new sensing capabilities will help us become more aware, productive, and help us think &#8212; but not do our thinking for us.</p>
<p>Rather, cognitive systems will help us see through and navigate complexity, keep up with the speed of information, make more informed decisions, improve our health and standard of living, and break down all kinds of barriers &#8212; geographical, language, cost, even accessibility.</p>
<p>Now, on to our five senses.</p>
<p><strong>1) Touch: You will be able to touch through your phone.</strong>  Imagine using your smartphone to shop for your wedding dress and being able to feel the satin or silk of the gown, or the lace on the veil, from the surface on the screen. Or to feel the beading and weave of a blanket made by a local artisan half way around the world. In five years, industries like retail will be transformed by the ability to &#8220;touch&#8221; a product through your mobile device.</p>
<p>IBM scientists are developing applications for the retail,<strong> </strong>healthcare and other sectors using haptic, infrared and pressure sensitive technologies to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric &#8212; as a shopper brushes her finger over the image of the item on a device screen. Utilizing the vibration capabilities of the phone, every object will have a unique set of vibration patterns that represents the touch experience: short fast patterns, or longer and stronger strings of vibrations. The vibration pattern will differentiate silk from linen or cotton, helping simulate the physical sensation of actually touching the material.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sight: A pixel will be worth a thousand words.</strong> We take some 500 billion photos a year, and 72 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. But computers today only understand pictures by the text we use to tag or title them; the majority of the information &#8212; the actual content of the image &#8212; is a mystery.</p>
<p>In the next five years, systems will not only be able to look at and recognize the contents of images and visual data, they will turn the pixels into meaning, making sense out of it similar to the way a human views and interprets a photographs. In the future, &#8220;brain-like&#8221; capabilities will let computers analyze features such as color, texture patterns or edge information and extract insights from visual media, having a potentially huge impact on industries ranging from healthcare to retail to agriculture.</p>
<p>But please, no Escher drawings, at least for now&#8230;that&#8217;s just plain mean.</p>
<p><strong>3) Hearing: Computers will hear what matters. </strong> Ever wish you could make sense of all the sounds around you and be able to understand what&#8217;s not being said? Within five years, distributed systems of clever sensors will detect elements of sound such as sound pressure, vibrations and sound waves at different frequencies.</p>
<p>It will interpret these inputs to predict when trees will fall in a forest or when a landslide is imminent. Such a system will &#8220;listen&#8221; to our surroundings and measure movements, or the stress in a material, to warn us if danger lies ahead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ever hopeful such systems will be able to &#8220;listen&#8221; to my golf swing and help me course correct so I can play more target golf!</p>
<p><strong>4) Taste: Digital taste buds will help you to eat smarter.</strong> What if we could make healthy foods taste delicious using a different kind of computing system built for creativity? IBM researchers are developing a computing system that actually experiences flavor, to be used with chefs to create the most tasty and novel recipes. It will break down ingredients to their molecular level and blend the chemistry of food compounds with the psychology behind what flavors and smells humans prefer.</p>
<p>By comparing this with millions of recipes, the system will be able to create new flavor combinations that pair, for example, roasted chestnuts with other foods such as cooked beetroot, fresh caviar, and dry-cured ham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top Tasting Computer Chefs,&#8221; anyone?</p>
<p><strong>5) Smell: Computers will have a sense of smell.</strong> During the next five years, tiny sensors embedded in your computer or cell phone will detect if you&#8217;re coming down with a cold or other illness. By analyzing odors, biomarkers and thousands of molecules in someone&#8217;s breath, doctors will have help diagnosing and monitoring the onset of ailments such as liver and kidney disorders, asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy by detecting which odors are normal and which are not.</p>
<p>Already, IBM scientists are sensing environment conditions to preserve works of art, and this innovation is starting to be applied to tackle clinical hygiene, one of the biggest healthcare challenges today. In the next five years, IBM technology will &#8220;smell&#8221; surfaces for disinfectants to determine whether rooms have been sanitized. Using novel wireless mesh networks, data on various chemicals will be gathered and measured by sensors, and continuously learn and adapt to new smells over time.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to listen to IBM scientists describe some of these new innovations and their potential impact on our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The only unfulfilled love I&#8217;m willing to talk about openly is writing. And the realization that the love affair will never be reciprocated hurts just as much as that first time someone came out and said, &#8220;I like you. I just don&#8217;t like-like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing will never like-like me. I&#8217;m too old, and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m too old as much as born at the wrong time – the non-generation. I&#8217;m not a baby boomer. I&#8217;m not a Me. I&#8217;m too old to be a Gen-Xer. Or Y and Z for that matter. I missed the computer age – I didn&#8217;t even have a computer until I got married and I was forty-one before I actually owned my own – a laptop, which took me a year to finally use with any kind of regularity. My kids know the VCR as the machine next to the TV that has never worked.</p>
<p>I read Julie Andrews autobiography recently. She grew up in the fifties, and I was sad to discover that her voice is my voice. That&#8217;s how I write. Very formally, describing how the leaves rest on the rooftop, narrative on top of narrative with very little emotion unless it&#8217;s purple prose. I write like someone who grew up in the fifties, only I have no story to tell. My parents weren&#8217;t alcoholics, I did not overcome drug abuse, I wasn&#8217;t abused or molested. My parents sent me to college. I lived at home until I got married.</p>
<p>This non-generation of girls was expected to grow up, be prim and proper, but still know everything, go to school, college and be anything you wanted, anything boys could be even President of the United States. At least until you got married and had kids and in that order. And when the kids were in high school you could go back to work because women were independent now.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a writer. A writer is impractical. And they drink. They don&#8217;t have two nickels to rub together either.</p>
<p>Get a degree and then you can write.</p>
<p>Get married. You can write later.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re still young. You can&#8217;t wait to have kids. Writing will always be there.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Writing didn&#8217;t wait for me. Writing found someone else. Writing computerized. Modernized. Writing grew up, and changed with the times where it needed to. More do it yourself. More travel. More health care and fitness. New writers came along. Younger and prettier and having seen people like me get left behind knew just what to do to keep up.</p>
<p>Writing won&#8217;t ever come back for me, and I just can&#8217;t catch up. My writing is tired and old; timid. Like me.</p>
<p>My best friend, like any good friend, pushes me towards the love that got away, prods, challenges, shames, but he can only push so far. I keep my hand on the ledge. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s down there. I lean over, but I can&#8217;t see very far, and what I can see is dizzying.</p>
<p>What if I fall?</p>
<p>What if I catch up to writing and I&#8217;m just not good enough? Staying back and wondering is better than being rejected again, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m reading a bad book right now.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m in revision mode, or maybe it&#8217;s because I enjoyed this book as a kid and don&#8217;t find it living up to my expectations. The book is <a title="Vendetta (Memory Alpha)" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vendetta" target="_blank">Vendetta</a> by Peter David (yes ST:TNG for those of you clicking along at home). Normally I find David&#8217;s writing to be spot on and funny, but this one&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it started:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the one who was ankle-deep in blood,&#8221; said Crusher.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I sure was!&#8221; said Geordi hotly.</em></p>
<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>Yes, the writing&#8217;s bad but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s bothering me. What&#8217;s bothering me is that this isn&#8217;t how these characters would act.  Guinan wouldn&#8217;t say sir to Picard, Picard wouldn&#8217;t reveal his frustrations openly, and Geordi (hot-head that he is) would have a better comeback than &#8220;I sure was!&#8221; Sounds almost cheerful doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>This got me to thinking about my characters, are they full enough that something could seem OUT of character, or even IN character.  How do I give my characters a distinct personality, one that can have variation certainly, growth most definitely, but never have a moment like this one that jars you out of your suspension of reality and makes you think about checking your e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>1) Understand your character&#8217;s relationships to other characters: </strong>Your character has friends, enemies, family members, co-workers, and everything in between. Each relationship has a slightly different dynamic, but all stemming from the base of your character&#8217;s personality. It may be that your character doesn&#8217;t like to make enemies and so tries to be his gregarious self around someone who doesn&#8217;t like him, but awkwardly. Some relationships with co-workers are strictly professional, whereas others are more casual. One might think of this as a spectrum of intimacy, or the amount a character can be their &#8220;real&#8221; self around another character. What&#8217;s important is that this remain consistent. A superior is always, sir, until a situation arises to naturally make the relationship more casual.</p>
<p><strong>2) Characters will change with experience:</strong> But these should be experiences we see. If your main character is a gregarious and funny person and becomes somber and reflective, you had better show us why. Change is good, it enriches our understanding of the person we&#8217;re trying to bring to life, but that change needs to happen on the page. If a cop changes after he loses his partner, a partner who was alive and drinking in the previous book, then he&#8217;d better kick the bucket somewhere on the page. Otherwise we&#8217;re being left out of the important experiences of our character&#8217;s life, and that changes the reader&#8217;s level of intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>3) Know more about your character than your readers do:</strong> Your character&#8217;s favorite color may not come up on the first page. The kind of whiskey they like, their hobbies, a good story reveals these details gradually. If the leg work&#8217;s been done up front to establish this character, then when a new detail is revealed it is shown to be a part of the whole, even when it seems inconsistent. One of my favorite examples of this is Ron Swanson from Parks &amp; Rec. He&#8217;s a gruff libertarian man, who likes to play as Duke Silver, a saxophone playing jazz lethario. He remains consistent in that he keeps this part of himself separate from most of the people in his life, and it provides color to his outward gruffness to see such a suave and fun loving side.</p>
<p><strong>4) A measured response is often better than a freak out:</strong> Geordi freaks out all over the place in this book, with little provocation. It&#8217;s overly dramatic, even if the reasons for it are sometimes understandable. It&#8217;s like in singing, the louder moments are made all the better by the quiet ones around them. Frustration is best kept on a low boil that is then allowed to burst rather than constantly bubbling over. I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t people who react to crisis this way, and it may be that you want to portray a certain level of immaturity in your character, but make sure that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going for. This could also probably be distilled down to eliminating all or most of the &#8220;[character] said [blank]-ly&#8221; tags from sentences.</p>
<p><strong>5) It takes time to build a relationship:</strong> No character is fully formed in the first sentence they utter. There definitely is room to change the direction of a character, or flesh them out in later chapters, or even in later books. A certain about of leeway can be afforded so you don&#8217;t have to feel locked in. Just make sure that new details aren&#8217;t too drastically different from established norms, unless they&#8217;re a contrast like our good friend Ron.</p>
<p><strong>6) Your moral compass:</strong> Briefly it&#8217;s also a good idea to know what your character&#8217;s values are, would they never kill, do they oppose mastication, that sort of thing. Again, morality can change over time, but rarely all at once.</p>
<p>What makes your characters distinct? What would be out of character?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I&#8217;m late to the recent craft beer <a style="font-size:15.199999809265px;font-style:normal;line-height:19.200000762939px;" href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22189184/craft-vs-crafty-big-and-small-breweries-square" target="_blank">hullaballoo</a> that followed the Brewer&#8217;s Association&#8217;s <a style="font-size:15.199999809265px;font-style:normal;line-height:19.200000762939px;" href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/media/press-releases/show?title=craft-vs-crafty-a-statement-from-the-brewers-association" target="_blank">bitchy, little missive</a> about the Big Beer Boogeyman trying to swoop on craft beer&#8217;s game with brews like Blue Moon and Shock Top. There has been enough whining, though. So, this might not be popular, but the Curmudgeon must speak.</p>
<p>I drink beer. Period. And I&#8217;ve said it before: So as long as your beer is tasty, I’ll drink it&#8230;well, as long as it wasn’t made from orphan tears, or something messed-up like that. But I&#8217;m willing to make an exception if the orphans were already crying anyway.</p>
<div id="attachment_3597" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 261px"><a href="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/orphan.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-3597" alt="orphan" src="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/orphan.jpeg?w=251&#038;h=201" width="251" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Except for her. Keep this orphan&#8217;s tears the F away from my beer.</p></div>
<p>For me, it started on December 12th, when SABMiller executive chairman Graham Mackay asserted that the basis for craft beer success is the desire for more variation and interest and &#8220;it&#8217;s also local, anti-marketing, anti-global, anti-big, and more focused on experience and knowing that about where beer is from.&#8221; This elicited immediate mockery from the Big Beer haters about how Big Beer just doesn&#8217;t get it, and how it&#8217;s about quality and taste.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, the Brewer&#8217;s Association fired-off a press release reiterating their standard for what constitutes craft beer, lamenting Big Beer&#8217;s sinister foray into the craft beer market, and claiming that Big Beer should be required to clearly label their masquerading beers as being made by the Big Beer Boogeyman (and, thus, not true &#8220;craft beers&#8221;). Hmmm. So, apparently it&#8217;s not all about taste. Otherwise, why does this matter?</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://thisiswhyimdrunk.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/9-beers-americans-no-longer-drink-and-why-big-beer-doesnt-get-it-part-1-5/" target="_blank">thisiswhyimdrunk</a> makes a compelling case for the distinction between the Brewer&#8217;s Association lamentations and Graham Mackay&#8217;s claims of anti-big sentiment. However, it&#8217;s hard to deny the general contempt for Big Beer that courses through the veins of the majority of beer nerds. The accusations run the gamut: Their beers all taste like crap (not true); they are unrelenting and sometime nefarious in their efforts to gain market share (probably true); they like to eat kittens (totally true).</p>
<div id="attachment_3598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/whiplash.png"><img class=" wp-image-3598" alt="whiplash" src="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/whiplash.png?w=240&#038;h=328" width="240" height="328" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Graham Mackay thinking about kitten recipes.</p></div>
<p>But we operate in a capitalist system. Making money and gaining market share is what you&#8217;re supposed to do. It&#8217;s what makes the system function well, subject to smart regulation and enforcement, of course.</p>
<p>In fact, the capitalist system is like a zoo with lions, tigers, polar bears, and cute little animals like koalas and penguins. When a polar bear escapes and fulfills his lifelong fantasy of eating a penguin, or when the lions and tigers get out and eat the koalas and some zoo patrons, do you blame the lions and tigers and bears? No. Sure you might think the carnivores are dicks for eating cute animals and people, but that&#8217;s what they do (and partly what makes a zoo cool). You should be blaming the f-ing zookeepers.</p>
<p>And what do you think the purpose of the Brewer&#8217;s Association cockamamie definition of craft is (which actually seems simultaneously over-inclusive (Sam Adams Light) and under-inclusive (August Schell Brewing))? It&#8217;s about inventing a term to solidify a market niche and to gain and protect market share to the exclusion of others. Gasp!</p>
<p>And the label idea is silly. It&#8217;s not even worthy of the zoo&#8217;s suggestion box. These offending Big Beer brews are a completely different product line from their other beers and are geared to an entirely different market. Of course they&#8217;re going to label and market them differently. Are you mad that a Lexus doesn&#8217;t come with &#8220;TOYOTA&#8221; emblazoned across the back? The few people who actually care about this will know or easily find out.</p>
<p>It all boils down to this: I&#8217;ve had some good brews made by Big Beer and many terrible beers from so-called craft breweries. To me, it&#8217;s all about gettin&#8217; the yummy in my tummy and what&#8217;s best and available at the time, not about what constitutes craft beer or who gets to call it that. So, maybe the Big Beer Boogeyman realized that he needs to get in on selling tasty beer. Wah. Deal with it. Just drink beer.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Go read John Cochran&#8217;s thoughts (From Terrapin Beer) <a href="http://johnatterrapin.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/craft-vs-crafty/" target="_blank">here</a>. He masterfully drives home the point: This is all so silly. He also lists some of the goofier results from the Brewer&#8217;s Association line-in-the-sand.</p>
