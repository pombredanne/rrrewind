<p>Tonight is the second Presidential Debate of the 2012 election. We&#8217;ve had <a title="Some post-Presidential Debate thoughts… {#1}" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/10/04/some-post-presidential-debate-thoughts/">one Presidential</a> and <a title="Some post-Vice-Presidential Debate thoughts… {#2}" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/10/12/some-post-vice-presidential-debate-thoughts-2/">one Vice-Presidential</a> Debate so far, both of which were traditional debate formats. This debate, though, is a &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/strict-rules-behind-debates-looser-town-hall-format.html">Town Hall</a>&#8220;-style debate in which the candidates walk freely and speak to a small studio audience that encircles them as they take their questions directly from audience members. They do not know the questions beforehand, but as the years have gone on, <a href="http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/">they have limited</a> both the ability to have back-and-forth exchanges with the audience members as well as the follow-up role of the moderator, giving them far more space to dance around the question with no accountability (these changes were put in place after Clinton devastated Bush <a href="http://youtu.be/7ffbFvKlWqE">in this exchange</a> in 1992).</p>
<p>This got me thinking: what if I was there, and I got <em>one shot</em> to ask them <em>one</em> question. I&#8217;ve had my <a title="I’m a one issue voter: specific abuses of Executive power {pt.3}" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/02/29/im-a-one-issue-voter-specific-abuses-of-executive-power-pt-3/">fair share of complaints</a> about <a title="I almost voted for Romney, but then I remembered…" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/09/13/i-almost-voted-for-romney-but-then-i-remembered/">both</a> <a title="I almost voted for Obama, but then I remembered…" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/09/17/i-almost-voted-for-obama-but-then-i-remembered/">candidates</a> (<a title="Catholics Aren’t Crazy: Paul Ryan &amp; the 2013 House Budget" href="http://blog.prodigalpaul.com/2012/03/21/catholics-arent-crazy-paul-ryan-the-2013-house-budget/">and their running mates</a>), so boiling all of this down to one question that would both be difficult for them politicize <em>and</em> address the most issues I&#8217;m concerned about was difficult, but this is what I came up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. President and Governor: as a social worker, I&#8217;m taught that the goals I make with my clients should be S.M.A.R.T. goals: <strong>S</strong>imple, <strong>M</strong>easurable, <strong>A</strong>ttainable, <strong>R</strong>ealistic, and <strong>T</strong>imely. Using this criteria, could each of you, in terms that are not cliched, rhetorical, or abstract, tell me what the goals of the War on Terror are, and what would represent the end and accomplishment of that War? Thank you.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you think would be their answers to this question? What would be your question?</strong> (And how do you think they&#8217;d answer?) Sound off in the comments below, and tune in at 9pm tonight for the debate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am surprised at how much I have learned from blogging. Obviously writing more and writing regularly has honed my technical skills. I am far more conscientious about word choice and sentence formation, hopefully grammar but I ain&#8217;t fer sure on that.</p>
<p>I have learned about  food and customs and people from around the world, religions, governments, joys, sorrows and illnesses. I have made friends. I have laughed and cried and ground my teeth in anger over injustices visited upon my friends.  Just as people do when making friends in &#8220;real life&#8221;, in the blogosphere you get used to people&#8217;s idiosyncrasies and styles of communication. When are they joking? When are they serious? Who is sensitive? Who has a tough hide?  My friend Brigitte wrote a Freshly Pressed piece on <a href="http://brigittebanter.com/2012/04/06/a-gracious-guide-to-benevolent-blogging-five-tips/">Blogging Etiquette</a>, which is a good read for new bloggers as well as those that have been around a while.</p>
<p>I am a fairly blunt communicator. On WordPress I have learned to hold my tongue, don&#8217;t respond in anger (or at least don&#8217;t hit send in anger), don&#8217;t tease someone if you don&#8217;t know how they will take it, be sincere, be positive, be kind. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m particularly diplomatic and I call &#8216;em like I see &#8216;em. I think I&#8217;m fairly in tune to the blogs I follow regularly and I can tell when there is action going on between the lines.</p>
<p>I guess where I&#8217;m slowly going with this is that while we form friendships here on WordPress, we are still typing. We aren&#8217;t Skyping so we can see facial expressions. We aren&#8217;t on the phone so we can hear voice inflections. We are typing words on a screen. And as with email or texting, sometimes what you  type isn&#8217;t what you meant or you didn&#8217;t mean it like that! So what if you do hurt someone&#8217;s feelings by accident? What if someone calls you out for something you wrote to them in the Comments section that they didn&#8217;t care for?</p>
<p>Instead of getting defensive, dramatic, self-righteous, etc&#8230; pause for a minute and reread what you wrote. Ask yourself, &#8220;is there a chance that my comment didn&#8217;t come across the way I meant it to?&#8221; Just take a breath and think, &#8220;how would I react if someone wrote this to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress is such a gift. It is generally such a positive place and if people need to rant, they need to rant, it&#8217;s not about you, it&#8217;s about the writer and what they need to express. That doesn&#8217;t mean that our words don&#8217;t have consequences and sometimes people don&#8217;t want to read our rants and that is fair. My main point is, in the Comments section, if necessary think hard before you hit Reply.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Brad Pitt is now hawking Chanel No. 5.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Just let that sink in for a moment.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://blog.keelygalgano.com/2012/10/15/absurd-ad-of-the-day-chanel-no-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/mGs4CjeJiJQ/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>If you missed the monologue because you were too occupied staring at a pretty man in dire need of a haircut, here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not a journey.<br />
Every journey ends, but we go on.<br />
The world turns and we turn with it.<br />
Plans disappear, dreams take over,<br />
But wherever I go, there you are.<br />
My luck, my fate, my fortune<br />
Chanel No. 5<br />
Inevitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that&#8217;s nonsense, essentially. And I find it a little strange coming from a man.</p>
<p>That being said, the ladies love them some Brad; so the chances this commercial flops aren&#8217;t great. For me, however, the ad (teased by industry publications for some time) fell flat. And if I were to do the casting, I would go in another direction.</p>
<p>Chanel No. 5 is the ultimate in women&#8217;s fragrance and synonymous with the highest of class. Perhaps this is my personal preference, but if I were to cast one of Hollywood&#8217;s leading men to be the face of such a classic, I would instinctively approach George Clooney. There&#8217;s just something about that ageless wonder and his salt-and-pepper locks that screams class and would shine in black and white.</p>
<p>Casting aside, I&#8217;m not sure a male face of Chanel No. 5 is necessary in the first place. Though it remains brand relevant, conjuring images of timelessness and luxury, it feels a bit forced.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am sure this accomplishes what Chanel set out to do. With an ad that will certainly circulate the web and incite chatter both good and bad, Chanel No. 5 will be top-of-mind for consumers as we approach the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>I leave you with this gratuitous photo of George Clooney (swoon) cuddling a puppy:</p>

<p>By Corby Anderson</p>
<p>I am being methodically, malevolently denuded of an already depleted mental capacity by a wireless Internet system that taunts me mercilessly and evades capture on a regular basis.</p>
<p>If I could afford the monthly expense (which is to say if I avoided eating, fueling my vehicle, drinking, etc.), I would gladly pay for my own dedicated Internet line to avoid this maddening, odd circumstance that I find myself in – trying to marathon-watch the fourth season of <em>Breaking Bad</em> on Netflix on my shit-hot new iMac via a poached wireless connection that seems to vanish every time Brother Hank the Narc appears on screen.</p>
<p>“IT” – the  appropriately creepy name that the kindly stewards of the ranch that I live on have given their weak-ass wireless signal – wafts in like a mirthful, rotten ghost. IT appears in my available networks list in full-bar force, only to vanish when I wearily discover IT’s renewed presence and attempt to engage it for a renewed viewing of a show that I can never seem to catch up on.</p>
<p><em>Hello, big fella! I’m here! USE ME!</em> IT howls, only to dissipate into a cloud of nothingness, leaving me with a red, spinning wheel of Netflixian frustration to ponder. I curse. I reload. I back the stream up a few seconds. I close programs. I holler. I whimper. I consume more than the recommended daily intake of alcohol (but that may indeed be unrelated.) I plead for technical mercy. I do everything in my limited internetworking experience to cajole IT into action. But like Charlie Brown lining up for a field goal attempt, my efforts end up with me foiled yet again, lying on my back and staring at space.</p>
<p>If the wire-free Internet weren’t invisible, matter-less, and everywhere at once (or, mostly not) I’d stab IT in the groin with a rusty butter knife.</p>
<p>This weekend, as I was setting up the new computer – my long-awaited, first –ever personally purchased machine that I saved every nickel for over the past few months, I went out and bought a wireless range extender – some cockamamie device that is supposed to boost the area’s available wireless signals. Then I spent an hour on tech support with some Linksys agent who prefaced each instruction with “kindly please.”</p>
<p>Predictably, this brain-numbing programming effort worked for a total of about 30 minutes, during which IT appeared on my list of available wireless signals. Approaching cautiously, expecting the virtual football to be yanked once more, I clicked around the link in every direction. IT hung around, all four bars gleaming invitingly into the distrustful rods and cones of my jilted eyes. Finally, feeling like something Technically Important had occurred, I clicked IT.</p>
<p>Then, as if life had always been this simple, the Internet fired right up. Netflix launched into the episode I had previously watched in five-second spurts with dazzling speed.  The extension had WORKED! IT was compliant. I had broken IT’s rebellious spirit.</p>
<p>“Thank the Lord! Or Steve Jobs, or whoever is running the weird spectacle that we all bumble through, because we’ve got high speed connectivity!” I yelled silently. (Better to not to wake the wife. She avoids computers with Luddite passion, reads books and falls asleep at a normal hour.)</p>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of the term “it goes without saying,” mostly because it is generally always followed with a direct contradiction, but in this case it really does go without saying just how important the Net is in our lives these days. Hardly a single job, task, event, duty, hobby, or responsibility can be accomplished without some necessary component of Internet.</p>
<p>And now, thanks to my impressive technical support dialing skills, I had accomplished total, harmonious internetical SYNC with the neighbors’ Internet signal. IT has personally approved of my equipment choices and invited me into IT’s world. Good ol’ Hank was back on his feet again, shaking off an assassin’s bullet to his spine.</p>
<p>In the immortal words of Gilby, the freckled kid from Guam who tormented me in the street games of my youth: “NOTTTTT!”</p>
<p>Just as easily as IT had come, IT went, taking my spirit with IT. Then IT appeared again. Oh Hi! Ca-lick. Then, gonzo…</p>
<p>Brutal, pervasive frustration reigns. Remember dial up? No? Here, let me remind you.</p>
<p><em>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRBBBBBBBBLLLLLLEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPfuckfuckfuckshitgoddamnallIwanttoseearemovingtittiesandit’stakingtenfuckingminutestoloadEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG.</em></p>
<p>IT makes that crazy-making dialup “speed” of yore seem like a live HD shot from Mars.</p>
<p>I would tether the fucker to my phone, but I learned THAT harsh lesson a few months back, when in a fit of ignorance, perhaps exacerbated by an extended homebound flu, I decided to see what the Personal Hotspot function of my new cell phone was all about by watching the entire show run of <em>The Wire</em>, back to back to back to ohmygodwhatisthis$500billfromAT&amp;fuckingT?</p>
<p>Did I mention that this connectivitease happens only when Hank the Narc is on screen? Isn’t that ODD? What sort of superfreaky juju does THAT character have over me? And why has IT channeled Hank the Narc into my own personal Lucy? Am I supposed to skip those scenes? Is there something GOING ON here? Is the entire internet possessed by some sort of paranoid Meth-crazed jokester?</p>
<p>Or is it just me? Can someone Kindly Please email me an answer? Better yet, mail IT.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sidelinesignals.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-14-at-5-47-36-pm.png"><img id="i-212" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://sidelinesignals.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-14-at-5-47-36-pm.png?w=434" /></a></p>
<p>Mach 1.24. 24 miles above Earth. 834 miles an hour (unofficial). A 4 minute 20 second free fall.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Felix Baumgartner did this Sunday. 65 years to the day that Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier.</p>
<p>It took him almost 2.5 hours to get to the 127,000 plus height in order to attempt the jump or, if you prefer, fall. It took some 5 years of planning and test jumps. It took him less than 10 minutes to land on solid ground in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The question does get raised, why?</p>
<p>While some ponder this question others sit back in awe. This event was amazing enough to have some 8 million people watch the fall on YouTube which by some accounts was 16 times larger than their previous record. So it&#8217;s pretty obvious why YouTube would stream it live (Red Bull is a main partner on the site just like the UFC and WWE) but that doesn&#8217;t answer the question as to why?</p>
<p>Is this fall sport? Yes. Is it a scientific experiment? Yes. Is it a homerun for Red Bull as far as marketing and media? Absolutely. The best tweet seen all day was, &#8216;boy what does 5-hour energy have to do to beat this?&#8217;</p>
<p>For each person it probably satisfies some sort of primal function. This was sport because it is almost impossible to measure how technically and physically demanding this fall was on Baumgartner. It was scientific. Imagine the questions that had to be asked and answered in order for this man to do this and survive. And yes it was done in the most progressive way imaginable as far as marketing and media is concerned.</p>
<p>In the end, it&#8217;s an idea. One imagined, sold, and rallyed to and then celebrated by the world. It&#8217;s a talking point for the next year. It provides hope that all is not lost in this age of negativity. It shows us that   &#8216;if man can think it he can do it.&#8217; In the end, it&#8217;s something to proud of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melbourne blogger, copy-writer and waffle-lover <a href="https://twitter.com/loupardi" target="_blank">@LouPardi</a> sent me a link to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2012/07/20/the-death-of-seo-the-rise-of-social-pr-and-real-content/" target="_blank"><em>The Death of SEO: The Rise of Social, PR, And Real Content</em></a> a while ago now (it numbers in the months rather than the days). Thanks Lou.</p>
<p>At the time I got myself nice and fired up about why I was going to agree with the post, albeit with a gripe that a made-up term like &#8220;social media&#8221; was trumping the decades old practice of public relations in the headline hierarchy. But I got over that.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://us11.memecdn.com/Get-Over-It_c_93934.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://us11.memecdn.com/Get-Over-It_c_93934.jpg" height="569" width="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey, he&#8217;s Gandalf AND Magneto. I&#8217;m doing what he says.</p></div>
<p>To summarise the part of the original article I believe was most likely to incite the flamewar of all time, here&#8217;s a quote from Ken Krogue, the author (it&#8217;s nicked from the actual post):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2012/07/20/the-death-of-seo-the-rise-of-social-pr-and-real-content/" target="_blank">&#8220;The bottom line is that all external SEO efforts are counterfeit other than one: Writing, designing, recording, or videoing real and relevant content that benefits those who search.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>While originally I was keen to post on this, it&#8217;s taken me until now to actually form a point of view on the topic. In the style of supporting <a href="http://sayitdifferent.net/2012/10/12/the-rise-and-rise-of-self-selection-or-why-the-mass-approach-to-media-is-doomed/" target="_blank">my own pre-existing biases</a> I&#8217;d like to whole-heartedly agree, and the fact it&#8217;s published by Forbes means I would feel smart agreeing with it.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px"><a href="http://netdna.copyblogger.com/images/einstein.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://netdna.copyblogger.com/images/einstein.jpg" height="288" width="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Check out this guy &#8211; he&#8217;s spelling it all wrong!</p></div>
<p>The problem is, I kind of disagree that public relations will necessarily &#8220;own&#8221; online content, search and social (whatever that is), because at its heart the public relations industry is captivated by words. It makes sense given the inordinate number of print journalists that helped found the industry before TV was invented, but it has also led to our over-reliance today on media relations as a core tactical skill set. It also makes sense because regardless how we think about an idea, the bulk of our day-to-day interpersonal communication comes as words.</p>
<p>And so even away from media, much of a public relations practitioner&#8217;s historical skillset comes from verbal communication rather than visual. We make phone calls, we have meetings, we do coffees or lunches or breakfasts&#8230;all in order to facilitate conversations. Exploiting new technology is a historical weakness for the PR industry because new stuff is expensive, and if we can get an outcome with a phone call then why would we buy a fax machine?</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.officeworks.com.au/ims_docs/4C/4C6900226FC50745E1008000AC193D36.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://www.officeworks.com.au/ims_docs/4C/4C6900226FC50745E1008000AC193D36.JPG" height="250" width="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These are still a thing, right?</p></div>
<p>When it comes to new forms of communication, whether they be web-based, &#8220;social&#8221; (you mean, two people talking to each other? No fucking way?!?), or anything else, first-mover advantage always belongs to people with a lot of free time who are able to experiment with the tech, followed by people with a lot of resources behind them who can afford to spend those resources seeking to exploit it.</p>
<p>The rise of the digital agency has shown this &#8211; so many great start-ups built on a handful of really smart IP, either growing to a decent small-business size, or getting themselves bought by a wealthy ad agency along the way.</p>
<p>The SEO business is arguably the same. Great technological insight, really clever people, and enough free time to establish a first-mover advantage. BAM &#8211; new industry, based on exploiting a loophole left open by the last new industry to arise (i.e. search in its own right). For all the stealth updates to search algorithms there will always be a new generation of wunderkund with enough RAM and ditched class time to come up with a smarter mouse to defeat the trap.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6jpzvQn13kM/Tm-IWE9zsDI/AAAAAAAAATY/NfNt87xNknU/s1600/mouse-trap.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6jpzvQn13kM/Tm-IWE9zsDI/AAAAAAAAATY/NfNt87xNknU/s1600/mouse-trap.jpg" height="288" width="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Seriously, this one stunt is going to revive my career and start a whole copycat thing, it&#8217;ll be awesome. Who&#8217;s got a sofa I can jump on?</p></div>
<p>So rather than buy into a debate about whether one technical skill set is going to defeat another in the battle for the marketing/communication dollar, I propose that in order for public relations to succeed over the next decade the industry has to attract diversified communicators.</p>
<p>Whether SEO is &#8220;counterfeit&#8221; as Ken claims, or whether ad agency studios are going to have higher production values than social media agencies shooting everything on hand-held kit, I think the bigger issue is really going to be: who understands the audience best?</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://www.inspiredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/twilight-101.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.inspiredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/twilight-101.jpg" height="289" width="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Clearly the answer is &#8220;Stephanie Meyer&#8221;, so long as the question involves&#8230;well, anyone who&#8217;s into vampires and predictable fairy-tale endings. Oh, did I just give it away? *spoiler alert*</p></div>
<p>Planted content, if good enough, will always find a willing passive audience. Similarly, invasive communications in any medium will piss some people off, although to be fair I still use the free Spotify despite the ads. What we should be discussing is the route to the most effective communication outcome rather than which horse to ride there.</p>
<p>In this arena I think public relations does have an advantage because as an industry we are not bound by the need to make products. We can write a press release, but we don&#8217;t have to if a phone call will also get the story up. We can hire a cammo and an edit suite for a few days to make a video, or we can make a donation to a film school and ask them to do it for us. What&#8217;s more important is that as individuals, public relations practitioners develop something of the hacker mindset, and invest some personal time in learning how technology can be used to enhance the communication experience, both for our client organisations and our own relationships.</p>

<p>My ex-husband died tonight.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written that into scripts and scenes and backstories and 1.4 million entries of my journals.</p>
<p>But then it really happens.  And luckily, God wrote this script.  Because, over the 22 years I&#8217;ve known my ex, it hasn&#8217;t been easy.  It was often fun.  I laughed and cried and laughed some more.  I got cancer.  I attended a lot of Al-anon meetings.  I wished his death on at least one major occasion, and luckily God knew me better than that weakness of character and said No.</p>
<p>I loved this man.  Even throughout the hurtful times, I would see what drew me to him.  A heart that was bigger than the ocean, especially for the downtrodden.  A desire to always laugh and have fun and go out where the people were young and alive.   A deep desire to be better than the addiction that plagued him most of his life, starting when he was just a kid.  An unwavering love for our boys, that kept him alive this past 24 days when the doctors kept saying, &#8220;He is dying.  We don&#8217;t expect him to make it until morning, so come now.&#8221; We came now every day, just in case.</p>
<p>He waited for us to come today.  It had been a very rough night, and an even worse day.  Over the past 23 days, he had been so present for them.  Inspiration.  Jokes and laughs.  Fatherly talks from his ICU bed.  The forced abstinence from alcohol had turned him back into the Prince Charming he could often be.  He asked me to stay one night, alone, so he could tell me important things before he died.  He told our boys how much he loved them every day.</p>
<p>But today had been awful, we were told.  He had had many, many, many visitors, but tonight, we were the only three there.  We wanted to give his girlfriend (my dear friend) a break after the awful day.  And when she left, we prayed together over him, our boys and I.  And we talked to him and told him we loved him.</p>
<p>It was the first day where he couldn&#8217;t talk to the boys, because he could no longer talk.  His breathing was loud and labored.  Which is how we knew when he had passed.  &#8220;Mom, he&#8217;s not breathing!&#8221; my son suddenly said, panicked.  We called the nurse.  He had died peacefully and with his boys by his side, just as he had hoped.  He was much too young.</p>
<p>So today I thank God for writing this script.  My ex could not stop drinking, and so he was fated to this future much too early.  But God gave him these beautiful weeks, and gave our boys not only these amazing extra hours with their dad, but a true dedication to the father they loved and didn&#8217;t always get to see as much as they wanted to.  They went every day.  They spent hours, happy to be there.  I hope that being there when he died eventually helps make the hurt less raw than it is for us all right now.</p>
<p>And that was the biggest gift God gave to me.  Over these past 24 days, I let go of all anger.  Begrudgingly.  With many set-backs.  Slowly.  But completely.  I saw again the troubled but truly good soul who had swept me off my feet and gave me the two greatest gifts in the world.  I am so sad.  And not just for our boys &#8212; though most especially for our boys.  Sad at what might have been for this sweet man.  Sad that he hadn&#8217;t been able to kick the demons.  Sad that it took his final month to bring us all back together, so close.</p>
<p>End.  Fade Out.  Bravo to the greatest screenwriter of all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="The Perfect Bookmobile" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/8074804516_ea28a265f0_c.jpg" height="800" width="554" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking lately about my former dream of owning a bookmobile. It was always a dream that stemmed from two of my deepest desires: to be surrounded by books and to make a home on the road. These days, though, that dream is little more than a fantasy that I only occasionally indulge, more frequently when I&#8217;ve been following the exploits of this traveling <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.thebookbarge.co.uk/"><span style="color:#808080;">book barge</span></a></span>. Recently, too, it&#8217;s been on my mind as I was reading Erin Morgenstern&#8217;s <em>The Night Circus</em>, which reminded me in many ways of Audrey Niffenegger&#8217;s graphic novel, <em>The Night Bookmobile</em>. Both feature magic, both feature a venue that, for modern readers, because they are rare and migratory in nature, feels wholly magical. It&#8217;s fitting, then, to infuse both these venues with actual magic. And so, if i were designing the perfect bookmobile, it would have to have something magical about it.</p>
<p>1. An <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.airstream.com/travel-trailers/classic/"><span style="color:#808080;">airstream caravan</span></a></span> would be the shell of my bookmobile, gutted and filled with retractable wall shelves and space-saving benches. I&#8217;d keep the kitchenette.</p>
<p>2. We would serve free tea (or coffee), an idea pinched from two of my favorite bookstore (<span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://fortheloveofbookshops.com/2012/09/26/the-book-barge-part-ii/"><span style="color:#808080;">here</span></a></span> and <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.mrbsemporium.com/"><span style="color:#808080;">here</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>3.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.artmeetsmatter.com/penguin_classics/penguin_deckchair_-_the_garden_party.htm"><span style="color:#808080;">Deck chairs</span></a></span> inspired by Penguin classic book covers for reading newly purchased acquisitions on the lawn.</p>
<p>4. Here&#8217;s where the magic comes in. I quite like the idea explored by Morgenstern and Niffenegger of the venue in question arriving unpredictably and operating at unconventional hours. So I would carry <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=580&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=FE4y2J_Z_xBHXM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.luxist.com/tag/exhibit/&amp;docid=Ypj9DnKwIkDOZM&amp;imgurl=http://www.blogcdn.com/www.luxist.com/media/2009/07/breguet-ref.-1160-pocket-watch.jpg&amp;w=470&amp;h=600&amp;ei=7NR1UOGWC4a69QTo8IDIBg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=98&amp;vpy=223&amp;dur=373&amp;hovh=250&amp;hovw=196&amp;tx=118&amp;ty=157&amp;sig=116091458863172429414&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=122&amp;tbnw=96&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=21&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:96">a <span style="color:#808080;">pocket watch</span></a> set for midnight, or whenever I plan on opening my doors.</p>
<p>5. Shoppers would have the option to pay for their book with a story of their own telling. I&#8217;d quite like to make the bookmobile a space where the oral tradition is celebrated.</p>
<p>6. Of course, we&#8217;re not total Luddites. All titles would have <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://fortheloveofbookshops.com/2011/03/11/selling-ebooks-instore-a-progress-report/"><span style="color:#808080;">QR codes</span></a></span>, which browsers can scan with their SmartPhones. Customers would then have the option to purchase and download the ebook from our website.</p>
<p>7. <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.riteintherain.com/inventoryD.asp?item_no=954T"><span style="color:#808080;">Rite in the Rain All Weather Notebooks</span></a></span>, would be for sale for the visitors who become inspired suddenly while browsing the many rows of literature. Hey, it happens, and when it happens, you want to be prepared with the most weather impermeable notebook on the market.</p>
<p>8. A functional <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.photo-dictionary.com/phrase/603/typewriter.html#b"><span style="color:#808080;">typewrite</span></a></span>. Again, for the inspired visitor.</p>
<p>9.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/stationery-set?before=1336827483"><span style="color:#808080;">Handmade stationary</span></a></span>: Have wheels, will deliver mail. Will also keep a well-stocked supply of fountain pens, bottles (with corks), stamps for purchase and wax seals.</p>
<p>10.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=153225101393277&amp;set=pb.153222811393506.-2207520000.1349900432&amp;type=1&amp;theater"><span style="color:#808080;">Secure shelving</span></a></span> so books do not dislodge while caravan is in motion.</p>
<p>11. The most important part of my vision is<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=580&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=oD2pDA5YRvlAkM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.primaryignition.com/2010/12/20/the-night-bookmobile-graphic-novel-review/&amp;docid=6LSGBWqqmdqcwM&amp;imgurl=http://www.primaryignition.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/guardian.co_.uk_.jpg&amp;w=460&amp;h=298&amp;ei=49h1UIrTJIOi9QTRuoG4DQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=87&amp;vpy=285&amp;dur=340&amp;hovh=152&amp;hovw=223&amp;tx=182&amp;ty=60&amp;sig=116091458863172429414&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=157&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:93"><span style="color:#808080;">summed up</span></a></span> perfectly by Audrey Niffeneger in <em>The Night Bookmobile. </em>As you know if you&#8217;ve read the book, the Night Bookmobile magically reflects each visitor&#8217;s personal library and reading tastes. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of impression I&#8217;d want every visitor to my bookmobile to have: that the inventory was selected exclusively with them in mind. I&#8217;ve transcribed the paragraph below.</p>
<blockquote><p>I drank my tea and explored the farthest recesses of my collection. Each spine was an encapsulated memory, each book represented hours, days of pleasure, of immersion in worlds. At the very end, on the lowest shelf, was the book I had been reading that morning. I picked it up and opened it. There was my bookmark, but the text continued on, for I had read the book many times. I replaced <em>The Complete Short Stories of H.G. Wells</em> on its shelf.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t actually have a guide for this yet, but I am newly pregnant and figuring things out! I dunno if it&#8217;s the case for every pregnant lady but I am HUNGRY, and especially hungry for iron-rich, red meat-y things that aren&#8217;t on my typical eating plan. Weight Watchers won&#8217;t allow you to attend meetings while pregnant, which is probably really good because there was a tiny part of me that was planning on losing the last 15 pounds while pregnant. When I have a day off, I find that I need at least a handful of naps, and sometimes I fall asleep sitting up. I&#8217;m working out still, but currently keeping it to prenatal yoga and pilates and long walks.  I haven&#8217;t had a major sweat in at least a month, and when I hit the doctor for confirmation that I was with child, I had gained three pounds.</p>
<p>I am crazy, insanely stressed out about weight gain, but I also suspect that carrying this pregnancy has the potential to fully and forever change my relationship to the body I&#8217;ve been struggling with for almost 30 years now. Josh doesn&#8217;t like it when I poke my tummy irritably because the baby is hanging out in there. My breasts are supposed to be fuller and heavier, my body is supposed to be fatigued, and I am supposed to be going a little slower. I think there&#8217;s the potential to find a lot of harmony during this time, if I honor what this experience is and fight through my anxieties about what it will mean for the temporal form of my body. It&#8217;s extremely unlikely that I&#8217;ll gain back 90 pounds&#8211;although Josh jokes that if we find out this week we&#8217;re having twins, all bets are off&#8211;and even if I DO gain back EVERY SINGLE POUND I have the framework and the knowledge to work my way back.</p>
<p>The loveliest thing that the partner of an anxious pregnant woman can say, by the way, is that they had a day-dream in which they were watching the baby while you got a chance to work out. I wouldn&#8217;t say that to any lady who hasn&#8217;t expressly explained her post-pregnancy weight loss regime though. We pregnant people have the hormonal strength of, like, bears. When those hormones rush through me, I could punch a dolphin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping this is nine-ish months of learning to love my body as the full miraculous piece of divinity I think it might actually be. I feel full and lovely and strong and my skin looks AMAZING. I&#8217;m off my anti-anxiety meds, with the world&#8217;s best psychiatrist a phone call away, and I am learning a whole bunch about full, holistic living. Also, I am crying. A LOT. I was just watching SNL and Christina Applegate introduced Passion Pit and the way she looked so proud of them got me weepy. That part is maybe the least fun.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! I hit the midwife this week for the first appointment, and I&#8217;m hoping we spend some time talking about diet and exercise and health. I&#8217;ve been scoping out cute maternity wear&#8212;there really IS some, I&#8217;m happy to report. I&#8217;m looking forward to designing a nursery and making Josh do all the work. I&#8217;m excited to get to a point where I&#8217;m clearly pregnant because my students have been asking me if I&#8217;m having kids since we first met. If things go according to plan, I&#8217;ll have a baby in late May and have the whole summer off for bonding. I don&#8217;t count as much of a mom yet but jeez if I don&#8217;t already love the experience a lot. Sometimes Josh comes home and says hey to us both individually and I feel like my heart might explode.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first picture I&#8217;ve taken since I found out. I was off that night for a haunted DC walking tour, and since I get cold pretty easily, I layered up. My friend Kelly swore I&#8217;m glow-y already, but I think it was really just a combination of Friday afternoon relief and ghostly excitement. I love Halloween.</p>

<p>That is a University of Maryland beanie, a Fossil scarf, my cute warm new sweatshirt material jacket, Sweetheart cut old navy denim, and my new Adidas runners. Those runners get me so many compliments, and they really are just a great pair of shoes.</p>
