			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Green Bay Packers are world champions. The Lombardi Trophy is coming back to Titletown after a 31-25 victory over the the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Next Man Up</strong></span></p>
<p>With 15 players on injured reserve, &#8220;Next Man Up&#8221; has been the Packers&#8217; unofficial motto all season long. Fittingly, the team destined to become champions of Super Bowl XLV lost two key players to injury in the first half. An injury-replacement player himself, linebacker Desmond Bishop, summed up the Packers&#8217; team identity nicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who we are,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s who we&#8217;ve been all season.  If you&#8217;re the next man up, you&#8217;re expected to find your helmet and find a  way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald Driver went down early with an ankle injury and cornerback Charles Woodson broke his collar bone. Both players are locker room leaders, and Woodson was so emotional during halftime that he couldn&#8217;t even <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/24063/page/espntexas/xlv-packers-move-woodson-to-tears" target="_blank">finish his speech</a>.</p>
<p>If I would have told you that backup cornerbacks Jarrett Bush and Pat Lee would play significant time in the Super Bowl, would you have given the Packers a chance? How about if I told you that Jarrett Bush would have a key interception; would you still believe me? Well, it all happened, and it&#8217;s been that sort of year for the Packers. No matter which number is sewn on your jersey, the coaching staff expects you to take the field and perform just as well as the guy in front of you. And perform they did.Â In Driver&#8217;s absence, wide receiver Jordy Nelson recorded 9 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown, breaking <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/statuses/34479939973554176" target="_blank">a Packers&#8217; Super Bowl record</a> for receiving yards set by the legendary Max McGee back in Super Bowl I.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Win The Turnover Battle, Win The Game</strong></span></p>
<p>Jarrett Bush redeemed himself in a big way. The last time these two teams met, Bush&#8217;s interception was negated due to penalty, and he never got the chance to play the hero. Super Bowl XLV was a different story. Bush came up with a big interception &#8212; one of three Pittsburgh turnovers &#8212; that Aaron Rodgers and the offense cashed in for 7 points.</p>
<p>In fact, all three Pittsburgh turnovers resulted in 21 points for the Packers. As big as Bush&#8217;s pick was, it was overshadowed by Nick Collins early pick-6 and Clay Matthews forced fumble of Rashard Mendenhall late in the game. The usually sure-handed Mendenhall only fumbled twice in the regular season and twice in the playoffs.</p>
<p>And the Packers? They had zero turnovers, which brings me to the most valuable player of Super Bowl XLV&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>MVP</strong></span></p>
<p>After the game, I wondered who the MVP would be. I thought maybe Greg Jennings for his 2 touchdown grabs and his big third-and-long reception to keep the Packers&#8217; hopes alive on their final clock-killing drive. I thought maybe Jordy Nelson for his record performance. But I was wrong, and a deserving Aaron Rodgers was named the game&#8217;s most valuable player.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to look past Rodgers&#8217; performance because the Packers demand so much of him. He didn&#8217;t record the best performance of his life, but his final tally was fantastic. Going 24-for-39 passing for 304 yards, 3 touchdowns, and zero interceptions is a great Super Bowl performance. I can think of one instance where Rodgers made a poor throw. And had his receiving corps not dropped 6 passes, Rodgers numbers would have been astronomical.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Elite Company</strong></span></p>
<p>Head coach Mike McCarthy joins some pretty elite company as a Super Bowl winning coach of the Green Bay Packers. The only other Packers&#8217; coaches to do that were named Lombardi and Holmgren. McCarthy said after the game that he drives down &#8220;Holmgren Way&#8221; on his way to work every day. And if he continues to prepare his players as he did all season, he&#8217;ll have his own street sign before he knows it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Final Thought</strong></span></p>
<p>How fitting was it that the unsung hero of the defense, Tramon Williams, broke up a pass on 4th-and-5 to seal the victory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go celebrate Green Bay, you deserve it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993366;">Everywhere I looked elephant seals were piled up like heaps of exhausted Sumo wrestlers. Â Sometimes it was easy to overlook them&#8211;mistaking them for sand hills. Â The penguins must have thought so too, as they paraded amongst them willy-nilly. </span></h3>
<div id="attachment_1381" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-large wp-image-1381 " title="P1000378" src="http://meanderingmatriarch.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/p1000378.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Penguins and Southern Elephant Seals mostly ignore each other on land</p></div>
<h3><span style="color:#993366;">The seals are not a threat to the penguins on land, it seems. Â But as clumsy as they appear on land, in the water these giant slugs-of-the-sea swim like super-sonic submarines. Â At the moment they&#8217;re moulting, which makes them very itchy and a bit grumpy. Â Mostly they just sleep, scratch, snore, fart, and occasionally flip a bit of sand over themselves. Â This goes on from about mid-November toÂ April, which I suppose explains their need for a hefty supply of blubber, as they don&#8217;t go into the water Â while they are moulting. </span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><div id="x-video-0" class="video-player" style="width:400;height:224">

<h3><span style="color:#993366;">Southern elephant seals are larger than their northern cousins. Â Males commonly weigh up to three tons, and can measure five meters or more in length. Â Females are much smaller, being less than two tons and three meters. Â The girls can dive for twenty minutes at a time, whereas the guys can go for an hour or more. Â But specifications aside, what I find so interesting about the bull elephant seals is their faces. Â They all just seem like huge blobs of blubber, until you see the face. Â I know, the scientists among you will be rolling your eyes at my anthropomorphic descriptions, but how can you <em>not </em>make something of these expressions?</span></h3>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gilligan&#8217;s Island style (and yes, I know the actual word is &#8216;marooned&#8217;). Except I have running water, a grocery store and means of transportation off the island. Maybe it&#8217;s just some island fever. Living on a little island has taught me that I never want to be stuck on a little island. I go stir crazy. The furthest away I can drive is the other side of the island&#8230;and that isn&#8217;t that far away. It&#8217;s like&#8230;20 minutes away by car.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to everywhere we&#8217;ve lived. The pros to living in Hawaii are obvious. It&#8217;s nice and sunny outside 364 days out of the year. The beaches. The surf (if you&#8217;re a surfer). Hale&#8217;iwa. Big Kahuna&#8217;s Pizza. Shaved Ice. Laughing at Hawaii 5-0 as they showed &#8216;Makalapa clinic&#8217;&#8230;only it wasn&#8217;t Makalapa, it was Navy Lodge&#8230;or when they were on a different island, but they showed the Witches Hat, which is on O&#8217;ahu. Palm Trees. Plumeria. Hula girls. Pork (if you like pork, there&#8217;s a plethera of it here&#8230;wild boar and all). Feral Roosters. Tropical showers. Kaneohe Bay (you lucky lucky Marines). The Likelike Highway (my husband doesn&#8217;t like like it because he got a speeding ticket the 4th day we were here&#8230;it&#8217;s also not pronounce Like Like but&#8230;I get a chuckle out of it). Kailua. The farmers markets. The &#8216;Toilet Bowl&#8217;. Little Village Noodle House. Chinatown. Jack Johnson. I&#8217;ll even say Bruno Mars even though I think the state is on Bruno Mars overload. Iz. The Dole Plantation (like pineapple, you must try the pineapple ice cream. Best thing on earth). Honu. I could go on and on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s cons too&#8230;Tsunami&#8217;s (they don&#8217;t happen often, but alarm goes off once a month and to this day I never remember and it makes me jump into the ceiling). Sun 364 days a year (this is only a con if you&#8217;re from somewhere that there are 4 seasons&#8230;the weather, not the hotel). The bugs. H-1. Everything costs more (even clothes are marked up). There is only so much to see/do in aÂ 596.7 sq. miles.</p>
<p>And the hero here. King Kamehameha the Great, who shoved something like 400 warriors off a cliff. I haven&#8217;t decided whether I think that is good or not, yet.</p>
<p>Either way, this has been a <del>interesting</del> fun tour. I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve been given the opportunity to be here.</p>
<p>One more pro from Hawaii: Macadamia nuts and coconut! I totally could have used the coconut from my backyard, but someone stole it.</p>
<p>My husband eats saltines like they are his favorite food. I think it&#8217;s really weird, but he also eats Navy food (and lives to tell me about it, &#8220;Not suitable for prison consumption&#8221;&#8230;haha),Â so maybe it&#8217;s not so weird. I have a whole box here and I was wondering what to do with them when I noticed the back has a recipe for Macadamia Macaroons. That could be yummy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Macadamia Macaroons</strong></span></p>
<p>Recipe By Nabisco</p>
<p>1 pkg sweetened flake coconut (7 oz)</p>
<p>1 cup macadamia nuts, chopped</p>
<p>1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 oz)</p>
<p>1 tsp vanilla</p>
<p>30 saltines finely crushed</p>
<p>3 egg whites</p>
<p>2 oz semi sweet chocolate.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a rimmed baking pan spread coconut and macadamia nuts. Bake for 10 minutes, Â stirring frequently. Cool.</p>
<p>Combine milk and vanilla in large bowl. Add the coconut mix and cracker crumbs and mix well. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add to coconut and mix gently until combined. Drop tablespoon clumps onto baking sheet 2 inches apart. (use silpat&#8230;or lightly grease) Bak for 12-14 minutes. Place on wire racks until completely cooled. Melt chocolate in double boiler and drizzle over cookies. Place on wax paper and refrigerate until chocolate is set.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Yum.</p>
<p><a href="http://thepatrioticbaker.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/macaroons1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1198" title="macaroons1" src="http://thepatrioticbaker.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/macaroons1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I dipped my macaroons in the chocolate because I think it puts more chocolate on than just a drizzle. I put them in the refrigerator and tried to be patient. I probably should have put them in the freezer.</p>
<p><a href="http://thepatrioticbaker.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/macaroons.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1197" title="macaroons" src="http://thepatrioticbaker.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/macaroons.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>A tasty, sweet, &#8216;tropical&#8217; treat. I don&#8217;t like Haupia or else I probably would have used my coconut to make that. These were totally delish. Here&#8217;s to hoping at some point it stops snowing long enough in the northeast so when we fly out we actually make it there. Sending you all some sunshine.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Dreams and Jobs</p>
<p>Iâd like to say Iâm a realist, but Iâm not sure thatâs true.Â  As a wannabe realist, Iâm in the habit of reflecting on what I think is the perfect job.Â  Iâve had several ideas, but usually people donât want to pay me for what I want to do, which is mostly sit around and think, or they donât want to pay me what Iâm worth.Â  In spite of all that, there are some possibilities.</p>
<p>My first choice was to be a kept man, but the prospects wereâ¦ummâ¦limited (read: not going to happen), so Iâve had to come up with other ideas.Â  After much consideration, I came up with the perfect dream job: Vice President.Â  Think of the benefits: Iâd get paid almost as much as the President, Iâd have my own plane, a car and a driver, and a really cool house.Â  Itâs not the White House, but on the other hand very few people want to go through it on a tour and most people donât even know where it isâa definite plus.</p>
<p>I know itâs not a fancy position, and historically itâs received its share of criticism.Â  John Adams, the first Vice President, called it &#8220;the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.&#8221; Thomas R. Marshall, the 28th Vice President, had his own opinion: &#8220;Once there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States. And nothing was heard of either of them again.&#8221;Â  Even with the criticism, though, Iâm in.</p>
<p>Think about the actual job the Vice President does.Â  He presides over the Senate on that really high bench seat, and he only has to share it with other people sometimes; otherwise, itâs all his.Â  When there is something going on, like the State of the Union address, all he has to do is smile and stand up and clap.Â  I can do that.Â  There is one drawback; the VP is front and center, sitting behind the President, so I couldnât make faces, or roll my eyes, or groan over what was being said, but I can handle that.Â  For a while, I thought it also might be a fun to be the guy who shouts: âLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,â when the big manâor womanâwalks in, but I donât know what he has to do the rest of the year, and I donât even want to imagine the sore throat he must have after all of that shouting.</p>
<p>The other thing the Vice President does is attend state functionsâweddings, funerals, coronations, stuff like that.Â  Iâm sure he gets a really good seat, and who wouldnât want to go to a wedding for some royal personageâI even know the lingoâor, for that matter, a funeral?Â  Iâd be great at the sitting-there-looking-official part.Â  What else is thereâ¦smile, shake hands, or bow?Â  Iâm sure my wife Kathi would love to join me in the traveling.</p>
<p>I almost changed my mind on the Vice President thing recently.Â  It sounded like a great gig, until Dick Cheney nearly ruined it all by getting involved.Â  Apparently, no one told him he was kind of like the understudy: show up and shut up, until they need you for something.Â  It doesnât mean other VPs would have to follow in his footsteps, but itâs very possible the expectations have changed. Â Oh, one last thing, Iâd be the tie-breaker.Â  When the Senate is tied, the VP gets to cast his vote.Â  I can do that.Â  Other than that, the VP doesnât even have to go to cabinet meetings.Â  Â </p>
<p>The part I donât like is actually having to campaign.Â  I decided Iâd rather be one of those appointed Vice Presidents; maybe a small scandal in the newly elected administration, and I could be ready to step in.Â  Iâm not sure what all of the requirements are, but Iâd imagine a couple of good suits, several red or blue ties, some white shirts, maybe a tuxedo and, above all, a good haircut.Â  I know the VP doesnât always have a good haircutâMr. Cheney comes to mind againâbut itâs probably best to have the good haircut.Â  Itâs not like Iâd be too busy doing other things.Â  Once clapping practice was over, and Iâd practiced smiling and looking bereaved into a mirror for a while, Iâd have plenty of time to get my hair cut.</p>
<p>I was actually hoping to be Hillary Clintonâs VP.Â  What a kick, huh?Â  Since that didnât happen, Iâm waiting for Joe Biden to say or do something stupid.Â  I mean r-e-a-l-l-y stupid, not just run-of-the-mill stupid, and Iâm there.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love Super Bowl Sunday.</p>
<p>Because of the football game?Â  Oh, hell no.Â  I could give a rat&#8217;s patootie about the football game.</p>
<p>No, I love Super Bowl Sunday because it&#8217;s like a de-facto holiday in L.A.Â  So many people are sitting on their couches downing snack foods and yelling at their TVs that the freeways are practically empty.Â  Not only does it make it a perfect day for a day trip, it allowed me to get from Orange County back to L.A. doing 80 mph.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just all kinds of cool.</p>
<p><span id="more-2772"></span>This year, I decided to do a little loop road trip.Â  I first headed out to <a title="Wikipedia Lake Elsinore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Elsinore" target="_blank">Lake Elsinore</a> to to pick up the <a title="Wikipedia Ortega Highway" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortega_Highway" target="_blank">Ortega Highway</a>.Â  I&#8217;d been wanting to travel the section between Lake Elsinore and the ocean through Cleveland National Forest for some time and had never done so&#8230; well, that&#8217;s not quite true.Â  I have driven it once before.Â  I&#8217;d actually done it on my return from Julian <a title="I Break For Hiking" href="/2010/10/24/i-break-for-hiking/" target="_blank">last fall</a>, but arrived so late in the day that I ended up driving most of the highway in the dark, followed by locals who knew every curve of the pitch-black highway and tailgated me mercilessly.</p>
<p>This time, the drive was much more spectacular.Â  I started by picking up lunch in town, enjoying the pleasant 78 degree heat, then headed out.Â  The highway leaves Lake Elsinore and starts climbing immediately, giving a view over the lake and the distant, snow-capped San Bernardino Mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 01 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5423611101/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5020/5423611101_9ed1771f4d.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 01" width="500" height="375" /></a><br />
<em> Looking out over Lake Elsinore and the distant peaks of the San Bernardinos</em></p>
<p>Behind me, hang gliders soared on the rising thermals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 02 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5424212426/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5424212426_e4d03479ef.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 02" width="500" height="375" /></a><br />
<em> Hang glider soaring on the thermals overhead</em></p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me about the west: to be in the warmth while looking up at the snow.Â  Weather is all about elevation.</p>
<p>I headed up the highway, stopped and ate lunch in a picnic area, then walked across the highway to the Visitor Center.Â  There, I picked up a couple of hiking guides, and the volunteer pointed out a short, 2.1 mile trail just a couple of miles down the road.Â  It sounded perfect, so I hopped in the truck and headed down the road.</p>
<p>Since this was basically a road trip, I didn&#8217;t bring the GPS to track the trail and do a write up.Â  But I can say that the trail, the San Juan Loop Trail, is a great little trail.Â  2.1 miles long, with a 350 elevation loss and gain, drops down from the highway to San Juan Creek, then climbs back up, briefly following the highway and passing the edge of Upper San Juan Campground.</p>
<p>At the canyon bottom, the trail also touches the creek in a couple of places, with shady trees and rocks for lunching or reading.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 03 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5423611579/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5423611579_c05cfb7c5b.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 03" width="500" height="375" /></a><br />

<em> Old oak tree towering over the rushing creek</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 04 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5423612021/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5423612021_61374b4e13.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 04" width="375" height="500" /></a><br />
<em> A quiet section of San Juan Creek</em></p>
<p>Returning to the car, I headed down the highway, then out to the coast.Â  My goal: <a title="Ruby's" href="http://www.rubys.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">Ruby&#8217;s Shake Shack</a> at Crystal Cove, which I had visited <a title="Crusin South" href="/2009/04/15/crusin-south/" target="_blank">before</a>.Â  I arrived just in time to enjoy a dark chocolate mint shake:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 06 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5423612463/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5423612463_43835c8d10.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 06" width="500" height="375" /></a><br />
<em> Crystal Cove and a shake (cell phone shot)</em></p>
<p>And watch the sun dip below the ridgeline of Santa Catalina Island:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Un Super Bowl Sunday 05 by GeekHiker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696810@N06/5424213306/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5424213306_8743860f6c.jpg" alt="Un Super Bowl Sunday 05" width="500" height="375" /></a><br />
<em> Sun setting behind Santa Catalina Island</em></p>
<p>All in all, quite the relaxing day, especially being able to drive all the way home at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Considering I spent most of my evenings last week AND all day Saturday studying, I think I&#8217;m allowed to have one of those every so often.Â  <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I attended <a href="http://tedxphnompenh.com/" target="_blank">TedxPhnomPenh</a> yesterday. First, I want to tell you that the organizers hit it out of the park. <strong>It was an incredible blend of thoughts &amp; cultures.</strong> We entered the conference to <a href="http://www.keeda.com/keeda/en/index.html" target="_blank">Keeda Oikawa</a>, a Japanese artist, doing a live large-format painting while <a href="http://www.cambodianlivingarts.org/people/kungnai" target="_blank">Kung Nai</a>, the âRay Charles of Cambodiaâ, sang and played the chapei dang weng (a traditional Cambodian lute). With a kickoff like that, we were bound to have a great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_766" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 485px"><a href="http://tedxphnompenh.com/2011/02/photos-from-tedxpp/"><img class="size-full wp-image-766 " title="tedxppOpening" src="http://njtosiemreap.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tedxppopening.jpg?w=475&#038;h=242" alt="" width="475" height="242" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(photos from tedxpp blog)</p></div>
<p>The conference consisted of <a href="http://tedxphnompenh.com/speakers/" target="_blank">13 live presentations</a> &amp; 3 previously recorded Ted talks that were projected on screen. The speakers and subject matter were diverse, but <strong>some common themes arose including the importance of sharing information (so appropriate at a Ted event!), engagement (especially of the target community), innovative solutions, and execution of great ideas. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p>What struck me most about the conference was the <strong>strong presence of Cambodians.</strong> Iâd guess that half of the attendees were young Khmers, many of whom are entrepreneurs &amp; students. Half of the speakers were Khmer, a few of whom grew up outside of Cambodia due to the Khmer Rouge but returned in their adult life.</p>
<p>This event was so thoroughly steeped in Cambodian culture and tradition. Beyond the performance of Kung Nai, there were two other presentation that resonated profoundly with the room. (I feel comfortable making such a strong statement because I was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23tedxpp" target="_blank">live tweeting</a> the event + had the benefit of seeing the reactions of my fellow participants in real-time.)</p>
<p>One was the <a href="http://tinytoones.org/" target="_blank">Tiny Toones</a> presentation. Tiny Toones is a local NGO that helps kids find their voice, a safe space and release through dance. <strong>Their team of teenage dancers delighted us with hip-hop theater</strong>: a mix of popping + locking &amp; bboy tricks partnered with passionate storytelling. They opened up their hearts and showed us their struggles â from drug &amp; alcohol abuse, sexual orientation, and being orphaned. These kids have found family + safety, and it was truly inspiring to witness their stories.</p>
<p>Phloeun Prim talked about returning to Cambodia. After living in Cambodia for ten years and working at Artisanâs dâAngkor, Phloeun returned to the spot where he was born and, â<strong>realized for the first time that I belong to this land</strong>.â Woah. Powerful. Since then, heâs been working at <a href="http://www.cambodianlivingarts.org/" target="_blank">Cambodian Living Arts</a> to find the living masters of the traditional arts (who werenât wiped out by the Khmer Rouge) in order to pass on these honored traditions.</p>
<p>One of the major themes of the day was <strong>the power of the arts</strong>. The power of the arts to transform a nation. How release through creativity can empower. And, the importance of preserving tradition for future generations.</p>
<p>Phloeun Prim captured this power when he said, <strong>âThe Khmer Rouge could not eliminate art; itâs the soul of the nation.â </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Yes, the Khmer Rouge was discussed. </strong>(As it needed to be.)</p>
<p>Typically, Cambodians do not discuss the Khmer Rouge and when they do itâs in hushed voices and small snippets. <strong>The country remains painfully silent, which is surely a barrier to healing and justice. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/thet-sambath" target="_blank">Sambath Thet</a>, one of the filmmakers behind <a href="http://enemiesofthepeoplemovie.com/" target="_blank">Enemies of the People</a>, discovered that <strong>telling the truth âacknowledging what happenedâ is cathartic to both the perpetrators and victims of the Khmer Rouge.</strong> Enemies of the People is a documentary chronicling Thetâs quest to understand why his family was killed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thearyseng.com/" target="_blank">Theary Seng</a> argues that the only true peace is that which includes justice. <strong>âPeace with justice is a human value with universal yearning.â </strong>While the Khmer Rouge Tribunal can offer limited political justice, its true value is as a court of public opinion capable of providing horizontal and restorative justice, which is encouraging dialogue. Cambodians are beginning to break their silence.</p>
<p>Both Sambath Thet and Theary Seng are looking for ways to heal the nation. <strong>The Khmer Rouge traumatized everyone, perpetrators and victims, so this push for openness is encouraging. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>The need for a more open society was echoed by Kounila Keo and Teac Sachak Reahou </strong>(the winner of the <a href="http://tedxphnompenh.com/essay-submissions/" target="_blank">Lift essay contest</a>).<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Kounila Keo uses blogging to encourage social discourse on topics that previously remained closed to commentary. <strong>Sheâs joined the movement of Khmer Bloggers (Khloggers) who use the medium to drive social change.</strong> <a href="http://blueladyblog.com/" target="_blank">Her blog</a> is the epitome of freedom of speech in action.</p>
<p>Teak Sachak Reahou dreams of creating an <strong>education</strong> <strong>watchgroup</strong>. This is desperately needed here in Cambodia. A place where teachers frequently skip class and charge their students for outside tutoring on the lessons that should have been taught during school hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Naturally, there was talk about community. Especially, how to leverage different communities. </strong></p>
<p>Sithen Sun, a passionate advocate (dare I say <a href="http://njtosiemreap.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/how-to-be-an-evangelist-without-religion/" target="_blank">evangelist</a>?) for self-education, implored the audience to create their Mastermind Club â a tribe of mentors and colleagues who can offer emotional, personal and professional support.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.17triggers.com/" target="_blank">Mike Rios</a> talked about the importance of investing in people to create long-term sustainable solutions. âY<strong>ou donât need to be a superhero to change peopleâs lives; all you need to do is invest in people</strong>.â</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/channe-suy/b/212/708" target="_blank">Channe Suy</a> reminded us that no one knows a problem better than the local people. <strong>Those directly affected most intimately know the parameters of a problem.</strong> They know whether a new technology is accessible. Great technology means nothing if people donât use it. Those directly involved are invested in finding workable solutions and therefore need to be part of the process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Ideas and communities are important, but action is everything.</strong> <em>Everything.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrisincambo" target="_blank">Chris Brown</a> got to the core of the issue, <strong>âAn idea is worthless unless you have the capacity to execute it.â</strong></p>
<p>Execution is hard. It can be costly and time-consuming. What can you do to make it easier? Cheaper?</p>
<p>First off, <strong>you need to Start With Why.</strong> If youâre unfamiliar with the phrase, watch the Simon Sinek video below Â immediately. (Iâll wait while you watch.)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://njtosiemreap.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/a-comprehensive-recap-of-tedxpp/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qp0HIF3SfI4/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>So happy that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/worldnomads" target="_blank">Chris Noble </a>introduced this to everyone. You need to get very clear and very specific about why you do what you do. Boil it down to the lowest common denominator. Once you know why, you can figure out what (the product or service) and how (marketing &amp; selling).</p>
<p>Now that youâve figured out your why, tackle the what. What product or service is a natural outpouring of your why? <strong>Before you commit to developing the product, Chris Brown recommends testing the market.</strong> He argues that customer development should always precede product development. Why develop a product if no one is willing to buy it? Why invest big money on something that may not sell?</p>
<p>So, invest small money in testing<strong>. Find the cheapest way to see if a product is viable.</strong> Use a website or Google adwords to drum up interest and test response. Ask people to sign up for notification of the product release (even if there isnât a product to speak of at the moment). Do people want what you hope to sell?</p>
<p>If they donât, and you havenât already begun development, then failure is cheap. You spent some money on a website and adwords. Or whatever test you utilized. <strong>Fail fast. Fail often. Fail cheaply.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And, trust that small gestures can turn into big movements</strong>. Chris Noble founded <a href="http://www.footprintsnetwork.org/" target="_blank">The Footprints Network</a>, technology for ecommerce businesses that allows their customers to make micro-donations of $2 to fund community development projects. <strong>$2 seems like peanuts, right? Well, over 418,000 people have made small donations to raise more than $1,000,000 to fund 65 projects.</strong> In my view, thatâs a big deal. <em>Thatâs a movement!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Central to all of these ideas and techniques is the need to innovate and experiment. </strong></p>
<p>Itâs what <a href="http://exilelifestyle.com/" target="_blank">Colin Wright</a> articulated so clearly: <strong>a willingness to envision your perfect lifestyle or solution then putting in the work to make it happen.</strong> Itâs a way of looking at an ideal end result, then working backwards to plan for it. A strategy that focuses on measurable results.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>TedxPhnomPenh was a full-day intensive on leadership. An immersion into creating and working for meaning. A lesson on intentionally impacting others in sustainable and helpful ways. </strong></p>
<p>We talked. We rallied. We dissected. We challenged each other.</p>
<p>Channe Suy stunned the room when she asked, <strong>âare you willing to give one hour to pass on your expertise and inspire the next generation?â </strong>Who can say no to that?</p>
<p><strong>The </strong><strong>event was courageous and humbling. Heartfelt and provocative. Intimate and expansive. </strong></p>
<p>Iâm already looking forward to next year!</p>

<p>At midnight, AOL announced that it will buy the Huffington Post for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/06/we-have-a-new-uber-boss-and-shes-greek-aol-buys-huffpo-for-315-million/">$315 million</a>.

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
AOLers,</p>
<p>We are taking another major step in the comeback of AOL. Today we are announcing that we have agreed to acquire The Huffington Post, one of the most exciting, influential, and fastest growing properties on the Internet.  We believe in brands, quality journalism, and the positive role of communities in the worldâThe Huffington Post shares our values and the combination of the two companies will create the premier global and local media company on the Internet.</p>
<p>Co-founded six years ago by Arianna Huffington and Ken Lerer, The Huffington Post has grown to become an industry leaderâone of the Webâs most popular and innovative sources of online news, commentary, and information.  Arianna and team have created a brand and a destination that focuses on the consumer experience.  By combining The Huffington Post with AOLâs network of sites, thriving video offerings, local expertise and enormous reach, we will create a company that is laser-focused on serving our audiences across every platform imaginable â social, local, video, mobile and tablet.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post is core to our strategy and our 80:80:80 focus &#8211; 80% of domestic spending is done by women, 80% of commerce happens locally and 80% of considered purchases are driven by influencers. The influencer part of the strategy is important and will be potent.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post is a strong influencer brand and it attracts a valuable audience, including a great focus on women&#8217;s content.  In addition, Arianna Huffington is a world-renowned expert on womenâs topics and issues, and has enabled The Huffington Post to grow rapidly by continually developing new audiences.</p>
<p>In the local area, the combination of the two companies will create a scaled connection between global and local communities on one platform.  This will create a new way for people to get local and global information in a timely and entertaining way.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post will join the family of AOL Brands that are destinations for an influencer audience, brands like TechCrunch, Engadget, AutoBlog, and Moviefone.  Uniquely, The Huffington Post is the platform for influential people &#8212; the people that drive trends, commerce, politics, entertainment, news, and information.  Adding this strategic platform to our already strong network of sites, including the AOL homepage, has the potential to make AOL the most influential company in the content space.</p>
<p>Arianna Huffington is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Internet space and someone that is even more successful in building communities and relationships in every corner of the globe.  The Huffington Post and Arianna have created a company that has partnered with the most successful and well-known leaders in all aspects of society that touch important topics to give consumers direct access to the most influential decision makers and community leaders.</p>
<p>This acquisition will create a high-quality and diverse digital ecosystem encompassing local, national and international news, politics, entertainment, technology, fashion, sports, health, personal finance, green, lifestyle, the arts and more.  This deal will combine the amazing talent at AOL with the innovative and talented staff of The Huffington Post.  Here are just a few high-level points around what this deal brings to market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Together, AOL and The Huffington Post will have 117MM unduplicated domestic monthly UVs, and ~270MM monthly UVs worldwide (according to comScore Dec 2010).</li>
<li>The Huffington Post is one of the fastest growing web properties on the Internet.  It grew 22% last year â thatâs faster than Twitter, which grew 18% &#8211; and 15x as quickly as the Internet grew last year (comScore Dec â09-â10).</li>
<li>Both AOL and The Huffington Post count powerful, affluent users among their top loyal visitors, significantly over-indexing in $100K+ income users.</li>
<li>AOL passed Hulu in unique viewers on video in the fourth quarter of 2010; video views on AOL are up 400 percent year-over-year.</li>
<li>Between AOLâs innovative Project Devil ad unit, engaging users for 27 seconds longer than traditional display ads, and The Huffington Postâs highly-vocal community, with 4MM+ comments per month, we will marry attention-grabbing content and brand experiences for both advertisers and consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the local area, the combination of the two companies will create a premier global/local syndication network at scale.  This will create a new way for people to get local and global information in a timely, informative and entertaining way.</p>
<p>To maximize the strategic advantage of this great deal, we will be creating a new group at AOL called The Huffington Post Media Group.  Within this group will be AOL Media, AOL Local &amp; Mapping, AOL Search and our new friends at The Huffington Post.  We will continue operating the towns structure, AOL.com and HuffingtonPost.com.</p>
<p>Iâm thrilled to announce that Arianna Huffington will join AOLâs executive team as President and Editor in Chief of The Huffington Post Media Group.  We have asked Jon Brod to lead the overall operational integration on the AOL side of the combined entities.  Jon will lead the local group integration and work closely with David Eun and the teams in AOL Media.  We will work quickly with The Huffington Post to create a combined organizational design to coincide with the deal closing.  While we wait for the required regulatory reviews to be completed and the transaction to close before implementing the design, we will move very quickly to plan the details of the integration of the two companies.  To this end, we will announce the new organizational structure as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will continue creating great content and products for our consumers within the town structure and stay laser-focused on the aggressive goals we have set for our winter luge.  We are on the right track and will continue our weekly operating cadence and town structure to drive successful results against our company goals.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a special message for all of you we taped to welcome The Huffington Post and Arianna to our AOL Family:</p>
<p>http://today.office.aol.com/company-news/2011/02/aol-agrees-buy-huffington-post</p>
<p>And of course we wanted to welcome Arianna to our &#8220;You&#8217;ve Got&#8221; video of the dayâcheck her out on AOL.com.</p>
<p>We will be holding a company all hands meeting to address your questions related to today&#8217;s exciting news. We will video conference from our New York office on the 6th Floor at 9:30 AM ET and will be joined by Arianna Huffington and key executives from her organization. We will also be holding a call for our west coast offices at 2:00 PM ET and for our Patch offices at 2:45 PM ET. See below for meeting info (conference rooms will be sent out shortly).</p>
<p>AOL is playing to winâ¦and The Huffington Post and AOL will occupy a unique place in the future of the Internet.  Letâs go get it done.</p>
<p>âTA</p>

<p><a href="http://therealfullhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dadd-t-shirt1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-799" title="DADD t shirt" src="http://therealfullhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dadd-t-shirt1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>This is my favorite t-shirt.Â  D.A.D.D.:Â  Dads Against Daughters Dating.Â </p>
<p>Two summers ago, DJ was at the beach with friends.Â  I received a call from her in the middle of the day.Â  I was at work.Â  &#8220;Dad, I found a t-shirt I think you&#8217;re really going to like.Â  It says<em> Dads Against Daughters Dating</em>.Â  It&#8217;s $11.Â  Do you want me to buy it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you crazy?Â  Buy two!!Â  I&#8217;ll have the money waiting for you when you walk in the door.&#8221;Â  Every time I wear it a father comes up to me to find out where I got it.Â  I proudly announce that my oldest daughter bought it for me.</p>
<p>I guess I have dating on my mind this week because the school dance is on Friday.Â  I&#8217;m fine for DJ to go.Â  I just don&#8217;t want her to go with a boy.Â  And frankly, I&#8217;d just assume her not dance with one either.Â </p>
<p>I used to share my dating philosophy with Lisa.Â  She would home-school the girls when they got old enough to date.Â  That would insure that there weren&#8217;t a lot of opportunities for them to meet the fellas.Â  They would attend Meredith College, two blocks from our house.Â  I&#8217;d drop them off on my way to work.Â  After class, they&#8217;d wait in the library until I could swing by and pick them up at about 5:30.Â  We&#8217;d come home, start their homework and watch a family movie each night at 10.Â Â </p>
<p>The thought of Lisa homeschooling our kids really does bring a smile to my face.Â Â I&#8217;m not sure exactly what would have happened, but I can assure you it would not have been pretty.Â  And she would readily admit that as I dreamed out loud.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sap.Â  I can never give my girls away at their weddings.Â  I was once in a wedding when the minister asked the father of the bride, &#8220;Who gives this bride to be married?&#8221;Â  And the dad responded, &#8220;Her mother.&#8221;Â  That&#8217;s my kind of man!Â  I was so counting on Lisa to do the heavy lifting on that special day.Â  This just adds to my angst about dating.Â  It just ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217; on Dellwood Drive.</p>
<p>I chaperoned the school dance DJ&#8217;s sixth grade year.Â  Lisa was running the student council at school and asked if I&#8217;d help.Â  I <strong>gladly</strong> volunteered.Â </p>
<p>I perched on the bleachers in the gym high enough up to see the goings on.Â Â The principal of the middle school was a hawk &#8211; I admired her so.Â  It&#8217;s a Christian School so she could rightfully walk through the crowd during the slow dance yelling, &#8220;Leave room for Jesus!Â  Leave room for Jesus!&#8221;Â  The kids laughed, but their arms got stiffer, exactly as Mrs. Reedy had planned.Â </p>
<p>When I would see one of those beadyÂ eyed eighthÂ grade boys snuggling up a bit too close, I&#8217;d leave my seat and stroll close to him.Â  I was sure to catch his eye.Â  A cold stare from a forty-yearÂ old.Â  Brow furroughed.Â  Chest poked out.Â  Eventually the kid would get uncomfortable.Â  Was it my demeanor?Â  Or was he just freaked out by the weirdo in the gym?Â  Didn&#8217;t matter.Â </p>
<p>Yeah.Â  Back away buddy &#8211; You heard me.Â  They&#8217;d break up and head over to the opposite end of the gym.Â  My job was done.</p>
<p>I felt I owed it to all of the other fathers who weren&#8217;t allowed to attend the dance.Â  My stare was for all of them.Â  My presence was a message to all those young boys.Â  Don&#8217;t get too close to our daughters!Â  Or else.</p>
<p>We have to look after each other guys.Â  If you see a dude at the mall making out with his girl, it&#8217;s your duty to intervene.Â  Wouldn&#8217;t you want that if it was your daughter?Â  Walk right up &#8211; demand that they stop.Â  Offer to call her father, she&#8217;s probably dying to get away.Â  Call the cops if necessary.Â  This is important.Â </p>
<p>Get out there men!Â  Take a stand.</p>
