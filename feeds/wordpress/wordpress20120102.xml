			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5819" title="wash mall" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/wash-mall.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></p>
<p>There are many, many good reasons why you should NEVER fly into Reagan National Airport in Washington DC. And I&#8217;ll tell you why you shouldn&#8217;t, and I mean <em>fly</em>&#8211;not sit on your butt in the back of the plane. Of course, it goes without saying that if pilots shouldn&#8217;t fly there, <em>neither should passengers</em>. And here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>1. The Postage Stamp Effect: like LaGuardia in NYC, the airport was built in the early days of commercial aviation, when the defining factors in aircraft design were slow air speeds, light weights, agile propeller aircraft. Fine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5822" title="Dc3 morning" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dc3-morning.jpg?w=300&#038;h=121" alt="" width="300" height="121" /></p>
<p>Maneuvering this thick-winged, lumbering prop job on final was routine at a relative crawl compared to today&#8217;s heavier swept wing jets, which need lots of room in the air and on the ground to operate safely. But Washington National is a postage-stamp sized airport from a bygone era, and the serpentine &#8220;approach&#8221; hasn&#8217;t changed:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5823" title="rnav19dca" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/rnav19dca.png" alt="" width="450" height="594" /></p>
<p>Look closely at the approach and notice the approach course&#8211;145 degrees, right? The runway heading is 194, so do the math: there&#8217;s an almost 50 degree heading change on final&#8211;<em>and look at where that occurs</em>. <strong>It&#8217;s at 424 feet above the ground</strong>. Which brings up my next point:</p>
<p>2. Extraordinary low-altitude maneuvering: The wingspan of the 737-800 is over 130 feet long, and the jet is normally sinking at a rate of 700 feet per minute on short final. Thirty degrees of bank at 400 feet with seconds to touchdown, with each wingtip dipping up to 75&#8242; in a turn less than 200&#8242; above the ground? And while a 20 degree offset is considered a challenge, the final alignment on such a typical offset approach happens early&#8211;but this turn is after the minimum descent altitude, and you get to finalize the crosswind correction at the last second landing on a marginally adequate runway length:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5828" title="dca 10-9" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dca-10-9.png" alt="" width="450" height="580" /></p>
<p>Look at the runway length of the &#8220;long&#8221; runway: that&#8217;s right, 6,800 feet&#8211;200&#8242; shorter than LaGuardia&#8217;s aircraft carrier deck, and often on final approach, the tower will ask you to sidestep to the 5,200 foot runway instead. So before you even start the approach, you&#8217;d better figure and memorize your gross weight and stopping distance corrected for wind and in most cases, you&#8217;ll note that the total is within a couple hundred feet of the shorter runway&#8217;s length.</p>
<p>Then figure in the winds and the runway condition (wet? look at the numbers: <em>fuggeddabout it</em>) So the answer is usually &#8220;unable&#8221;&#8211;<em>but at least half of the time I hear even full-sized (not just commuter sized) jets accepting the clearance</em>. I accepted the clearance (had a small stopping distance margin and <em>the long runway was closed for repairs</em>) to transition visually to the short runway one night and at 500 feet, that seat-of-the-pants feel that <em>says get the hell out of town</em> took over and I diverted to Dulles instead.</p>
<div id="attachment_5827" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 338px"><img class="size-full wp-image-5827" title="dirty harry" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dirty-harry.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Do you fell lucky today, punk?&quot;</p></div>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t hairy enough (get the pun? &#8220;hairy,&#8221; &#8220;Harry?&#8221;) from the north, approaching from the south, you&#8217;ll also get the hairpin turns induced because they need more spacing to allow a take-off. Either way you get last second close-in maneuvering that would at any other airport induce you to abandon the approach&#8211;<em>but that&#8217;s just standard at Washington Reagan</em>. And once you&#8217;re on the ground, stopping is key because there&#8217;s no overrun: you&#8217;re in the drink on both ends. Is the runway ever wet when they say it&#8217;s dry? Icy when they say &#8220;braking action good?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5834" title="jpx dca" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/jpx-dca.jpg?w=300&#038;h=259" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></p>
<p>And with the inherent challenges at the capitol&#8217;s flagship airport, you&#8217;d expect topnotch navaids, wouldn&#8217;t you? Well not only do they not have runway centerline lights or visual approach slope indicators (VASI) from the south, plenty of the equipment that is installed doesn&#8217;t work on any given day. Here&#8217;s the airport&#8217;s automated arrival information for Thursday night:</p>
<p><a href="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dca-atis.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5843" title="dca atis" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dca-atis.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Just a couple things to add to the experience, right?</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s review. If you&#8217;re flying into Reagan&#8211;and I&#8217;ve been doing it all month&#8211;to stay out of the headlines and the lagoon, calculate those landing distances conservatively. The airport tries to sell the added advantage of a &#8220;porous friction overlay&#8221; on the short runway that multiplies the normal coefficient of friction, but accept zero tailwind (and &#8220;light and variable&#8221; is a tailwind) and if there&#8217;s not at least 700 feet to spare&#8211;I&#8217;m going to Dulles (several deplaning passengers actually cursed at me for diverting) without even considering reentering the Potomac Approach traffic mix for a second try at National.</p>
<p>Think through the last minute alignment maneuver and never mind what the tower says the winds are, go to school on the drift that&#8217;s skewing your track over the river and compensate early: better to roll out on final inside the intercept angle (right of course) because from outside (left of course) <em>there&#8217;s no safe way to realign because of the excessive offset and low altitude</em>. A rudder kick will drag the nose back to the left inside the offset, but from too far left, you&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve landed, now you face reason number 3:</p>
<p>3: The northbound departure procedure. Noise abatement in places like Orange County-John Wayne are insanity off of a short runway with steep climb angles and drastic power cuts for noise sensitive areas. But DCA has an even better driving forces: the runway is aimed at the national mall <em>which is strictly prohibited airspace</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5839" title="DCA jepps3" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dca-jepps3.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="341" /></p>
<p>Again, no problem in a lumbering prop job&#8211;but serious maneuvering is required in a 160,000 pound jet crossing the departure end at nearly 200 mph: <em>the prohibited airspace starts 1.9 miles from the end of the runway</em>. We&#8217;re usually configured at a high degree of flaps (5-15 versus the normal 1) so you&#8217;re climbing steeply as it is&#8211;in order to prevent violating the prohibited airspace, you must maintain the minimum maneuvering speed which means the nose is pitched abnormally high&#8211;<em>then you must use maximum bank to turn left 45 degrees at only 300 feet above the ground</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/cfm-56-fan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5840" title="CFM 56 fan" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/cfm-56-fan.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>What do you think will happen with the nose high and the left wing low if you take a bird or two in that engine? Are there any waterfowl in the bird sanctuary surrounding the airport? Would the situation be any different with a normal climb angle with wings straight and level?</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the payoff for this complicated, difficult operation?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5845" title="dca concourse" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dca-concourse.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="602" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice terminal. Congressmen like their free parking at National. And they&#8217;re way too busy to ride the Metro to Dulles, despite the bazillion dollars appropriated to extend the metro line from the Capitol to Dulles, adding another twenty minutes to the airport travel time is too much for our very sensitive congressmen to endure.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s about it as far as pluses and minuses. Fair trade, considering all the factors?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5848" title="throttles 2" src="http://jethead.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/throttles-21.jpg?w=248&#038;h=300" alt="" width="248" height="300" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s for you to decide for yourself, but hang on&#8211;we&#8217;re going anyway. Just don&#8217;t chew my ass when I land the jet at Dulles instead of Washington Reagan National. Because for all of the above reasons, you probably shouldn&#8217;t have been going there anyway.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <em><strong><a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com" target="_blank">Google would suggest</a></strong></em>, 2011 has been an eventful year around the globe. Looking back on all the worldwide events also made me reflect on my own life. These last 12 months have been more than fulfilling. For one, I began to embrace my new found love for travelling, which I discovered in 2010. Thus, with fond nostalgia for the past and eager excitement for the future, I bring you: <strong>11 travel photographs of (my) 2011. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3268" title="Athens" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/athens.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />1. Athens, Greece. I travelled to the beautiful country in February and <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/a-city-for-athena/" target="_blank">visited Athens</a> </strong></em>and the <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/aegina-island-living/" target="_blank">greek island of Aegina</a></strong></em>. My blog entry on Athens was featured on WordPress. =)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3273" title="DSC_0086" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_0086.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />2. London, England. I lived in southern England from January to April, during which time <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/london-town-one/" target="_blank">I spent many weekends in London</a></strong></em>. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3269" title="Boston" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_3121.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />3. Montreal, Canada. I finally got around to <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/eating-through-montreal/" target="_blank">visiting Montreal</a></strong></em> in October of this year and feasted the entire time there. Being there also made me miss Europe and French cuisine.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3277" title="Prague" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/budapest.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />4. Budapest, Hungary. I ventured on a solo journey across Hungary, Austria, and Czech Republic. <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/budapest-looking-past-sights-to-see-people/" target="_blank">Budapest was my first stop</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/hungary-a-mysterious-kiss-of-the-hand/" target="_blank">where my hand was kissed by a stranger</a>.</em></strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3279" title="DSC_3121" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/wales.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />5. Wales, United Kingdom. I hiked <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/7-miles-in-wales/" target="_blank">7 miles through Snowdonia National Park in Wales</a></strong></em>. The next morning, I woke up to this beautiful beach scene in front of my hotel. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3276" title="Dublin" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dublin.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />6. Dublin, Ireland. I flew to Dublin to <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/celebrating-st-patricks-day-in-dublin/" target="_blank">celebrate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day in Ireland</a></strong></em>, it was a blast! <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/dublin/" target="_blank">Dublin is such a lively city</a></strong></em>, I highly recommend it!<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3278" title="Wales" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/boston.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" />7. Boston, USA. During the summer, I took a <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/boston-a-photo-diary/" target="_blank">weekend trip to Boston</a></strong></em> where I met up with my long term friend Rob who showed me around the Charles River. Having grown up on the West coast, I love a city that&#8217;s by the water. <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3270" title="Bratislava" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bratislava.jpg?w=497&#038;h=747" alt="" width="497" height="747" />8. Bratislava, Slovakia. I detoured from my Hungary-Austria-Czech Republic trip and made a <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/stumbling-upon-slovakia/" target="_blank">spontaneous stop in the quaint Slovakia capital, Bratislava. </a></strong></em><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3274" title="DSC_0414" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_0414.jpg?w=497&#038;h=747" alt="" width="497" height="747" />9. Oxford, England. When I got tired of weekend trips to London, I ventured further north to<em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/among-oxford-scholars/" target="_blank"> Oxford</a> </strong></em>with a friend to the widely-acclaimed university where the two of us pretended to be Oxford scholars. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3275" title="DSC_0613" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/prague.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="472" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">10. Prague, Czech Republic. One of the most beautiful European cities I&#8217;ve ever visited and one I&#8217;ve been recommending to all of my friends ever since, <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/prague/" target="_blank">Prague is simply stunning</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3298" title="DSC_0812" src="http://tracyzhangphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_0812.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="471" /><br />
11. Belfast, United Kingdom. I concluded my Europe trip at <em><strong><a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/giants-causeway/" target="_blank">Giant&#8217;s Causeway</a></strong></em> on the Irish coast. It truly is a breathtaking place. <a href="http://tracyzhangphoto.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/belfast/" target="_blank"><em><strong>My trip to Belfast</strong></em></a> also made me realize that there is still so much of  world I need to discover. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3271" title="Budapest" alt="" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/new-years-enviro-girl.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8369" title="New Years Enviro Girl" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/new-years-enviro-girl.jpg?w=150&#038;h=131" alt="" width="150" height="131" /></a>Everyone starts a new year with plans to improve&#8211;lose weight, save money, take a risk, accomplish a goal.  Enviro Girl thinks everyone should start the new year with an Eco-resolution, <strong>one</strong> small thing they can do to improve the environment.  The small things add up, as illustrated in this recent post over at <a href="http://myplasticfreelife.com/2011/12/michelle-has-refused-over-10000-plastic-items-how-many-have-you-refused/" target="_blank">Fake Plastic Fish</a>.  Here are some free, incredibly convenient and easy Eco-resolutions for you and your friends to try:</p>
<p><span id="more-8342"></span></p>
<p>1.  Quit the plastic bag habit.  Find that reusable shopping bag (Enviro Girl knows you have one somewhere) and stash it in your car/bike basket/briefcase.  Each time you forget to bring it in, refuse the shopping bag offered to you by the cashier and <em>carry your purchases out of the store in your hands.  </em>Using your hands or a reusable shopping bag reduces pollution, plastic use and can even result in 5-10 cent bag rebates depending on where you shop.<em></em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/index.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8345" title="index" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/index.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="237" /></a></em></p>
<p><em></em>2.  Quit the bottled water habit.  Get a PVC-free water bottle and fill it up.  Drink tap water.  Drink tap water flavored with lemons or oranges.  Drink tap water chilled over ice or straight up.  Drink tap water out of glasses, mugs or champagne flutes.  By using your own container and filling it with tap water you&#8217;ll save loads of money (<a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/BottledWater/Bottled-Water-Quality-Investigation" target="_blank">at a typical cost of $3.79 per gallon, bottled water is 1,900 times the cost of public tap water</a>) and reduce the pollution, plastic, fuel and environmental devastation that comes with bottled water.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/water-bottle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8346" title="Water-Bottle" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/water-bottle.jpg?w=167&#038;h=300" alt="" width="167" height="300" /></a>3.  <a href="http://ecowomen.net/2010/03/17/spring-clean-green-clean-your-kitchen-for-pennies/" target="_blank">Switch from conventional, commercial cleaning supplies to natural, environmentally safe cleaning methods</a>.  You&#8217;ll save money, reduce air and water pollution, detox your household and reduce the trash your household produces.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grocery-aisle-cleaning-supplies-thumb179642911.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8348" title="grocery-aisle-cleaning-supplies-thumb17964291" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grocery-aisle-cleaning-supplies-thumb179642911.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>4.  Start buying the locally grown organic version of one thing you consume.  Maybe it&#8217;s bananas, beef or broccoli.  Choose one product off your shopping list and commit to finding the locally grown or produced organic alternative.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_4931.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8349" title="img_4931" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_4931.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>5.  Turn it off.  Going low-tech saves electricity.  Switch off lights, stereos, computers, TV sets, video games and hair dryers.  You&#8217;ll reduce your noise and light pollution, reduce your electric costs and improve your quality of life.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tv-viewers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8350" title="tv-viewers" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tv-viewers.jpg?w=180&#038;h=224" alt="" width="180" height="224" /></a>6.  Quit using paper towels.  It&#8217;s easy&#8211;<a href="http://ecowomen.net/2009/01/27/taking-the-paper-towel-challenge/" target="_blank">Enviro Girl did it and here&#8217;s her story</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/405_lg.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8344" title="405_lg" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/405_lg.png?w=240&#038;h=224" alt="" width="240" height="224" /></a>7.  Reduce your trash by recycling more, consuming less or composting.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grocery-bag-trash-can.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8351" title="grocery-bag-trash-can" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grocery-bag-trash-can.jpg?w=240&#038;h=240" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></a>8.  Once a week, pass on the meat.  Meat is one of the biggest polluters on the planet, the major cause of deforestation and endangering species.  Raising cattle requires huge tracts of land for grazing and crops to feed them.  This might be the most challenging Eco-resolution, but will ultimately make the biggest environmental impact and save you the most money.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/index1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8352" title="index" src="http://ecowomen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/index1.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="125" /></a>&#8220;Going green&#8221; works a lot like going on a diet&#8211;it&#8217;s little changes that incrementally add up.  Just as you can lose weight by giving up soda, you can reduce your carbon footprint and environmental impact by giving up paper towels or bottled water.</p>
<p>Tell the Eco Women, what is your Eco-Resolution for 2012?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">I had little expectations for 2011. I always felt that some of my peers were a little too uptight with everything. Furiously scribbling down resolutions that – let’s be real – won’t get checked off the list, worried about job-hunting, boyfriend/girlfirend-catching, school-excelling, and place-going is a lot of pressure to put on oneself, especially when factors out of their control are involved. So I decided to go with it. That was my goal. To not be completely subject to the moody whims of life, but to accept them with an open mind and the thought that perhaps there is purpose behind the seemingly-random events that we like to label as ‘all of a sudden’. I feel like I did what I needed to do this year, but also a hell of a lot of what I wanted to do. Because life is too short <em>not </em>to do what you want. It’s also too short to just sit there and wait for things to happen to you. So the following is a short outline, a quaint marriage of what happened to me and what I made happen. That’s life in its most condensed forms, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>January</strong> showed me that I am not impervious to externalities like a touch of seasonal depression due to the short winter days. It came as quite a shock to be completely honest, because I’m always the one to waive off things like medicine and the side effects of stress: “It’s all in your head!” I would proudly proclaim, believing that the mind is in control of the body 100 percent of the time. It didn’t help that my window faced a back alley and my bedroom was devoid of sunlight even on the brightest days. In turn, I decided to start kicking-ass in my Russian program, and I think I did. It was a wonderful case of reciprocity: I put forth the effort, and the profuse tangles of Russian grammar started sorting themselves out.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #1: Despair can be avoided by teaching yourself something.</em></p>
<p><strong>February</strong> was a month of random dating. To some, dating is a wretched yet mandatory process, a channel for which to sort through the mud to get to the diamond. But I date simply because more often than not, I get a story out of it as well as the occasional reminder that there are people weirder than me (they probably think the same thing). Like the one young gentleman who, as it turned out, harbored severe anti-Polish sentiments and revealed them in a tale-worthy manner. I’m Polish. LOLZ. The other great thing about dating is that an immediate choice is traditionally attached to this social more – will you see that person again? If so, to what extent? This choice is sometimes awkward, confusing, or painful, especially if you’re on the receiving end. Or it could be the best thing you&#8217;ve ever heard. But a choice, the ability to directly alter your destiny &#8211; even if this resolution seems as inconsequential as a butterfly blinking its wings and choosing to rest on a Dahlia rather than any other flower &#8211; is what distinguishes you from the rest of the populace. February was also the month I had to watch my dad linger on the verge of death from an unforeseen hematoma. And all of a sudden, dating shenanigans seem altogether unimportant, and you reach the realization that sometimes choices should be made while you still have them.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #2: Choices are a luxury.</em></p>
<p><strong>March</strong> was a month of running around like someone lit a fire under my ass. My friend Blake can be blamed for this proverbial flame because he’s the one who forced me to do things like prepare for our summer trip by carrying out the tedious Russian and Chinese visa process. My iCal from March 2011 looks like a toddler scribbled all over it, and in retrospect I probably paid as little attention to my responsibilities and appointments as I would a toddler&#8217;s scribble. With an average of four consuming things to complete everyday, it’s a wonder how it all got done. In fact, it’s amazing that having such a firm grasp on life was at all possible. How can you have control over something as random, unpredictable, and mindboggling as life? I also went zip-lining on March 5<sup>th</sup>. It was an obstacle course in the trees and of the four long stretches of zip-line, I was the only one of the group to land ass-backwards 100 percent of the time &#8211; despite the reassurances of the guides that if you bicycle kick you can reposition your body to face forward while cutting through the air. But no. Bicycle kicks don’t fucking work. And so every time I would approach a landing spot, I would shut my eyes, hope for the best, and inevitably end up with a muddy ass and wood chips in unspeakable places. Zip-lining was advertised as something you should have control over, and somehow I ended up with no control, completely at the mercy of the laws of physics and I suspect a bit of karma. The day before, you see, I had scooped up the last of the cherry tomatoes at a salad bar to the disdain of an evil-eyed girl with long brown hair. Life surprised me that month, as it turned out I was the master of my fate and the captain of my soul. Except for fucking zip-lining.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #3: You have as much control as you perceive yourself to have.</em></p>
<p><strong>April </strong>was a month of academic shit-throwing. At every turn and corner, new work seemed to not only pile up but also increase exponentially. Then again, if you fail to tend the garden the weeds will start to grow. This was a burden completely of my own creation – I don&#8217;t feel as I&#8217;ve ever truly applied myself in academia, often leaving things to the last minute and failing to stir up a passion for metamorphic rocks, Rudyard Kipling, and the principles of economics. I had other things on my mind, like pork spare ribs, Beat literature, traveling the whole wide universe, hefty and thorough analysis of professional tennis, and how I was going to acquire my dream beach house in Zanzibar or pull that Delhi diamond heist à la <em>Pink Pather</em>. I believe that just as much time, if not more, should be donated towards emanating Peter Sellers as to silly things like academics. And if anything, my new diamond would pay for my beach house. But the day that catapaulted me into mental exhaustion was April 14<sup>th</sup> – I apparently documented this in my calendar. I had just realized that I couldn’t go home for Easter, a holiday that I view with utmost admiration simply because it’s the day my grandma makes my favorite soup. And now the soup-rug was suddenly pulled out from underneath my tired feet. So what do I do when so much shit is being thrown and I can’t get across the battlefield shit-free? I start throwing shit. Literally. April 15<sup>th</sup> just happened to be the university’s celebration of Holi, a spring festival for Hindus where you attack people with mushroom clouds of neon pink, yellow, and green powder. So I partook in the shit throwing, this time with some friends and a smile. And with one whole-body throw, a properly oversized Super Soaker, and a target hit, everything was made a little bit more manageable.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #4: Perspective is your shit shield.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/smile.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1536" title="Smile" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/smile.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>Sunday, <strong>May</strong> 15<sup>th</sup> was the day my sister graduated from university. It was also the day two friends and I would leave the States for one of the coolest backpacking trips of our lives. The ceremony was a beautiful one despite the rain. Toni Morrision spoke with an aged clarity and wisdom that breathes fresh inspired air into every listener. I don’t cry very often, but the combination of her moving words, the knowledge that I wouldn’t see my brother/family for three months, and the general momentousness that comes with leaving for a sufficiently unplanned trip that would take me from St. Petersburg to Kathmandu, well, it was a lot to take in. I live to travel, adventure is my middle name, I soak up the unknown like a liver in a lightweight, and I am the happiest when I’m on the road, but before every trip the dangerous question ‘what if?’ reliably pops up – what if something happens back home while I’m away, what if something happens to my friends or to me. While I can always count for this poisonous inquiry to emerge, it is always brief and fleeting, and I get back to my normal carefree senses pretty quickly. But when it did happen, its effect was deeply rooted. And like the symphony of rain that pattered against every umbrella, a waterfall of tears was uncorked. I did my best to hide it because tears don’t mesh well with my slightly callous exterior, so when my little brother said something about it, I responded with something along the lines of “don’t be stupid” followed by an affectionate yet appropriately tight headlock. I take my older sister responsibilities very seriously. At the end of May I would find myself in Siberia and then Mongolia, perfectly happy and in the position to spit in the face of “what if”. I was on the road, after all, and the road is my home.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #5: “What if” is the single stupidest phrase anyone can ever utter.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537" title="Grad" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grad.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p><strong>June</strong> was a month of delights and true pedagogy. I realized the breadth of my reach when one day, I set off running in a random direction in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Why, you ask? I answer this with why the hell not. It was a time of doing exactly what I wanted at the time that I wanted to do it, because people don&#8217;t abuse this inherent right nearly enough. It was a time of being ridiculous and spontaneous for the sake of ridiculousness and spontaneity. It was a time of going with the waves and the wind. We had no plan, no agenda. We were just some kids who dreamed of seeing the world and we were slowly but surely realizing that dream – that’s happiness if I’ve ever known it. Back to the running. My heart was pounding and I had a grin so large it probably split my face in half. I pointed to the distant horizon and told myself to stop when I reached the sun. In retrospect, I don’t think there is anything funnier than the image of a Mongolian in his daily routine and randomly seeing a white girl bolting across a still frame, charging towards the sun at an alarmingly anticlimactic speed. What I would give to be that Mongolian. June, and the whole trip rather, was a time for me to truly excerise my love for dramatic, colorful, and sweeping gestures in the name of excitement and simply doing <em>something</em>. Life is too ephemeral to do anything but. Mongolia and China hosted us in June and it was a time of veritable adventure and uninterrupted stimulus. Much was learned, little was lost. And hopefully you’ll see me running towards the sun sometime soon, the same sun that was denied to me last January.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #6: What was lacking before will be in abundance later.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/sky.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1538" title="Sky" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/sky.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p><strong>July</strong> was a month of carousing around Shanghai in drunken stupor, hiking tens of thousands of collective steps at Taishan, Huangshan, and Huashan, being chased by a very mean monkey, becoming *very* well acquainted with bus and train station floors, hanging out with awesome Nepali orphans, discovering the swankness of the Incheon airport, falling in love…with Chinese street food, meeting the most amazing people I could possibly meet; it was a month of constant motion, constant seeing, constant doing, constant learning; it was the month I realized that my wallet is small but my heart is big, that my tastes are simple but my dreams are expansive, that my faults are many but my merits are many more. July was a month of sheer discovery, life-changing adventure, a massive acquisition of stories, and a healthy dose of perspective. China and Nepal did that to me. Let’s say the average life expectancy of an American woman is 81 years of age, or 29,565 days. There are 31 days in July, which means all of the aforementioned events can account for roughly 0.105% of my entire life. One month. If I live every month like I did in July of 2011, I’m going to be very happy, very wise, and one hell of a storyteller. I take into account that perhaps I won’t live as long if I carouse around every city in drunken stupor, but I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it, should I not accidentally fall off of it.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #7: Never stop traveling.</em> (I knew this since day one, but a lesson of this significance cannot be reiterated enough)</p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/shanghai.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1541" title="Shanghai" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/shanghai.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>The high I’d been riding for three months ended in <strong>August</strong>. Kathmandu: Of my two comrades I was the last one to go. I said goodbye to Blake, then to Misha. Then to Jessica, my awesome Aussie girlfran who had been kind enough to stick with me while I got a sleeve of mehndi painted painstakingly from my shoulder to fingertips. It was the morning of my departure and I wasn’t ready to leave. I was going mad, you see, deliriously upset that that chapter of my life, one of the best ones, was closing for good. My bags somehow packed themselves. I checked that I had everything important, I returned my room key, and I left. As I turned toward the exit, I stood there. My eyes glazed over and I spaced out. I imagined my backpack and I &#8211; the best travel buddy I’ve ever had &#8211; as we caught a chicken bus south to the border, shirking my date with Flight 6051 to Delhi and then to Brussels and then home. I imagined us continuing like no one ever left, like I had no where to be, like I had no one waiting for me. I imagined how nice that would be. And then someone asked if I’d like a cab. Angry with this person for jolting me back to reality, I gave him a terse ‘no thanks’ and trudged off. I turned right on Kathmandu’s mud ridden streets and hailed a cab. As I haggled with the driver, I smiled the whole time, soaking in every bit of this energy-sucking economic ritual that is so customary around the world and yet finds itself to be absent in the US. He must’ve thought me creepy and conceded to lower the price. It came time to board the plane too soon. They had us walk across the landing strip as some personnel rushed to shoo some lazy cattle away. As people queued up to have their passports and tickets checked, I stayed behind and made sure to be last in line. I dropped my bags and turned towards the Kathmandu cityscape. Shacks and tenements covered the hills. They marked civilization’s expansion towards the regal temples that overlooked the city from the summit of each precipice. Kathmandu is covered in traffic, mud, and garbage, but it’s charming despite these things. Underneath is a city of smiling faces, food of immense flavor, and paramount beauty. The weather was typical of monsoon season – overcast but unusually bright. I swear to this day, the whole of Nepal has a green tint to it. I can’t explain further. So I looked back on Kathmandu and it’s so cliché, I know, but every single day of the trip breezed by my eyes like an extraordinarily epic flip book. Breathing heavy, I felt strange and truly foreign for the first time, for the road is my home and I was leaving it.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #8: Nothing lasts forever.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/kat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1539" title="Kat" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/kat.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>In <strong>September</strong> I fell into a rut. Being completely apathetic towards the whole working/university thing, living in the past three months, and being virtually taunted by all my friends who were studying abroad are comparatively good problems to have, but they are problems nonetheless. Makes sense. After all, what happens after a high? The crash. After months of which my only responsibility was staying alive, it was shocking that mundane academia didn’t appeal to me. I escaped to inside my head where I held precious memories, newfound knowledge, and a joke or two when the time called for it. It was a month of pointless impulses: driving to the middle of no where, picking a random book in the library and reading it no matter what it was, and ordering just one more pitcher of beer at the local pub even if it was last call and everyone had enough. Education became a towering roadblock in the way of my learning, and the control I enjoyed in March seemed far off and out of reach. But as per lesson #8, the nature of ruts and the highs is transience, as is the case with everything in between. And ever since I’ve been slowly climbing my way out with a little help from my friends and my own resolution that I am better than that. It was time to move on, get done what needed to be done, and plot my next move.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #9: Ruts and highs are inevitable and impermanent.</em></p>
<p>I didn’t know what ‘anything is possible’ really meant until <strong>October</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #10: Moments are fleeting by nature. Hold on to them, remember them, don’t lament when they’re gone but be grateful that they happened.</em></p>
<p><strong>November</strong> was a month of impulse; pure, liberating, unadulterated impulse. I woke up one day. I got dressed, brushed my teeth, threw on the kicks, and guzzled down a coffee. In the next hour I found myself in Southeast DC with a camera to capture some commonplace scenes that link the NW and SE communities together. I was there out of curiousity, trying to see if the Southeast is really as dangerous as the media, word-of-mouth, and supposed &#8216;common knowledge&#8217; makes it to be, if the situation is really that dire. Future explorations and documentation are coming, but what I have learned is not surprising. What can be found there is people. People with a similar way of life and people in a similar place physically and mentally. People who should not be confined by the construct of the place they live. Southeast is one in the same; the danger is there but it is wholly distorted by distant group perceptions. It was not a search for trouble but for understanding, a project of which the goal was personal introspection. I just wanted to feel I was doing something worthwhile and substantial for myself, not trying to save the world but trying to understand this world that so badly needs to be saved. If I applied the previous ten lessions of 2011, directly acknowledged them, and took them to heart, I knew I would be okay.</p>
<p><em>Lesson #11: Substance should never be sacrificed. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bloodandhoney.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1558" title="BloodandHoney" src="http://thesqueakyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bloodandhoney.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, is it <strong>December</strong> already? When the fuck did that happen. It&#8217;s difficult to be introspective about something that just occurred. The dust hasn&#8217;t settled, the smoke hasn&#8217;t cleared, and I&#8217;m still biased and completely lacking the wisdom that time always offers to an individual should she is willing to accept it. But I suppose December has been a month of observing the most convential wisdoms from the most unconvential sources. For example, after being handed an extremely large paycheck, a decision had to be made as to what to use the money for. Normally savings would be the primary go-to, but the holiday season has the uncanny disposition of complicating even the simplest of matters. So in the wise words of the talented Notoroious B.I.G., “mo’ money” indeed elicits “mo’ problems”. But even then, I just did what I am naturally inclined to do – store the money away, forget about Christmas, and then panic last minute when I am left present-less, stressed out, and inclined to turn to my go-to emergency gift in embarassing quantities. I firmly believe that every citizen of the world should watch Eroll Morris’ stunning, compelling documentary Fog of War, an expertly clipped and arranged interview with former Secretary of Defense, the ever controversial, ever fascinating Robert McNamara. It is truly amazing. One of those ‘bigger than yourself’ pieces, to be sure. And so the Fog of War shall rain down on unsuspecting family members. And they will thank me later. It&#8217;s been a whole 28 days of this month and that&#8217;s all I can think to write about. Which is fine. Come February or March, I will likely come back to this paragraph and view the last month of 2011 completely differently. This is one of life&#8217;s certainties &#8211; your present perceptions change how you perceive the past.</p>
<p>Then again, it is stupid to talk about oneself in such exhausting quantities. The world in 2011 was a pivotal one, truly unlike any other in history. What’s a little seasonal depression compared to the devastating January floods and mudslides in Rio de Janeiro that claimed 903 lives? While I fought for control with a zip-line as if it were a matter of life and death and not an ass full of pinecones, martyrs, heroes, villians, and victims were being made in split-second decisions that would change the course of history in the Libyan civil war. I will say: I do reckon my shit-throwing dealings of April much cooler than the royal wedding – history was made on that lawn that day when I pwned that n00b so hard with a handful of pink powder to the face. If only I got two billion people to watch. May: America celebrates the death (anyone else think this to be strange??) of head honcho Osama bin Laden, while I’m preparing for a trip that will eventually lead me to Pakistan’s general hood. Serious considerations ensue as to whether I should hop the fence, so to speak, from Nepal’s western most point into Uttarakhand, then Punjab, and then Pakistan simply to see what&#8217;s going on there. While I flee from a Gobi ger camp with an intended destination of the sun for absolutely no reason, thousands of Syrians flee to Turkey to seek refuge from a siege. Don’t I feel stupid. While I was gallavanting about China in July, a nation was born and she’s enjoying nominal unity under the appellation of South Sudan; this sounds great and all and I&#8217;ve heard some daft assumptions like: &#8220;Finally! The Sudan problem is solved!&#8221;. I remained silent as I would hate to play the role of dream-crusher by informing them that the problems have yet to see their end and there is likely to be a genocide there in the next decade. And so on, and so on. It&#8217;s been a great year for me, but the same cannot be said for others. This is why I constantly remind myself that it can always be worse, that I can never stop giving, that compassion and empathy are my most precious possessions in a world experiencing a deficit of them, that I am so lucky to have the life I have, and the most important lesson of all:</p>
<p><em>Lesson #12: There is a world beyond yours.</em></p>
<p>I took on the task of summarizing and analyzing a year in a few paragraphs. I cannot wait to read this in ten years and smile. Looking toward 2012, I have no expectations. I have goals, intentions, and dreams, and these will be completed or left unfulfilled by my action or inaction, my resolution to move forward or to stagnate, bucket-list-wise.</p>
<p>Speaking of the bucket-list, I&#8217;m off to <a href="http://thesqueakyrobot.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/blogging-and-the-roundabout-introduction-of-the-isle-of-x/" target="_blank">Isle X</a> now. Whether the Mayans were correct in their morbid prediction or not, I think people should view it as a pressing reason to either begin to live their lives to the fullest or to continue doing so. What else can you do, than to do what you need, do what you want, and play the cards you&#8217;re dealt.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my last post dedicated to Mexico City, at least until my next trip there!  One of the things on my must-see list was the <a title="Museo Soumaya" href="http://www.soumaya.com.mx/" target="_blank">Museo Soumaya</a>, owned by billionaire Carlos Slim.  Slim&#8217;s son-in-law, Fernando Romero, was the architect behind the museum covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum plates that stands out amongst the traffic infested streets and shopping mall.  It&#8217;s a sight to be seen, to say the least, and I was quite impressed at not only the size of the museum but the size of the art collection inside.  You take the elevator to the top floor and wind your way down ramps to be greeted by some of the most famous, prolific artwork in the world.  The top floor houses Rodin and Dalí sculptures, many of which took my breath away.  Dalí is an artist who captivates me and I had never seen any of his artwork in person, so to take in these life size sculptures was pretty mind boggling.  If you have the chance to visit Mexico City, don&#8217;t skip out on this fantastic museum that is free to the public.  It will totally make your day, I promise.  Museo Soumaya and Salvador Dalí sculptures below:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:14pt;"><a href="http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_4137.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9423" title="DSC_4137" src="http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_4137.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="590" /></a>Mt. St. Helens signature mountain biking ride is a combination of two trails.  Ape Canyon Trail climbs on a ridge above its namesake canyon.  Named for a purported Bigfoot sighting in 1924, the canyon is a <span id="more-9418"></span>steep ravine carved through the lower slopes of the volcano.  At the top of Ape Canyon, the path intersects the more gently graded Plains of Abraham Trail.  Here the route traverses a large volcanic ash field left by the devastating 1980 eruption.  Our visit in August of 2011 was the first chance Becky had to ride this premium piece of trail.  It was my second time on the route.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Since my <a href="http://anotherheader.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/mt-st-helens-ape-canyon-and-the-plains-of-abraham/">last visit in 2008</a> riding conditions in the area have improved.  The road to the trailhead is again open.  On the Ape Canyon Trail the brush and downfalls have been cleared.  The climb to the top no longer requires hike-a-bikes over downfalls.  One thing remained unchanged about the climb on Ape Canyon Trail—there are a lot of bugs.  Biting flies and mosquitoes accompanied our grind to the top.  Swarming flesh-munching insects inspire an unrelenting effort to get to the top.   If we stopped, we got eaten.  We tried not to stop.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:14pt;"><a href="http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_4159.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9426" title="DSC_4159" src="http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dsc_4159.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" /></a>The Ape Canyon/Plains of Abraham out and back is spectacular.  It is a unique trail.  Where else can you ride on the pumice field recently spewed by an active volcano?  The icing on the cake is the flowing slot car style Ape Canyon Trail descent.  And there is more trail to ride in the area than we’ve tried.  Mount St. Helens is more than a volcano; it is a mountain biking destination.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://communicatingacrossboundaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/january-25th-revolution.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8022" title="January 25th Revolution" src="http://communicatingacrossboundaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/january-25th-revolution.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a>During the 18 days that changed the course of modern-day Egypt Tahrir Square, in the heart of downtown Cairo, became known throughout the world as the epicenter of freedom and change. We couldn&#8217;t wait to get a glimpse of the square and talk to people about what had transpired and what is transpiring.</p>
<p>Just a few days before our arrival the area around Tahrir was in chaos, so much so that we made contingency plans for where we would stay. Our daughter lives just a couple of blocks away and by the time we arrived things had quieted down. Quiet is a relative term. We headed out on Friday with plans to eat Egyptian pizza (fateer) and head toward the Nile for a felucca ride. At one end of Annie&#8217;s street ten soldiers in full riot gear blocked any movement and just past the soldiers sat four army tanks, ready and waiting to be used at the sign of any trouble.</p>
<p>As we attempted to get to the Nile, every where we turned we ran into obstacles. Large circles of barbed wire blocked street after street. And then there were the walls. These walls are like nothing I&#8217;ve seen before. They are massive square boulders built into 12 feet high walls. They are strategically placed in the downtown area to restrict movement and prohibit protesters from gathering. They are quite simply a clever means to block civilian dissent. To put this into context, it would be like New York City blocking off all side roads leading to Zuccotti Park with massive, immoveable, concrete boulders, sending all traffic in the area into chaos and frustration. Taxi drivers shake their heads in disgust as all attempts to drive places are met with detours imposed by the walls.</p>
<p>As quickly as the walls have been built, the graffiti has appeared. It was my children and <a class="zem_slink" title="Shepard Fairey" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey" rel="wikipedia">Shepard Fairey</a> that first challenged me to look at graffiti as an art form and a means of expression. The graffiti on the newly constructed walls does just that as it communicates powerful messages from civilians related to both the January 25th uprising as well as the violence that has been perpetuated this fall. This graffiti is well done. A common theme includes a patched eye, an accusation toward a young soldier who is infamous for shooting out the eyes of protesters &#8211; &#8220;<em>Yes! I got another eye&#8221; </em>is his arrogant quote.</p>
<p>More than anything, the graffiti is evidence of frustration and division regarding the ongoing role of the military in the new Egypt. For me the graffiti was a look into a society where I am an outsider. My Arabic is not good and even as I struggle to communicate, I want to learn more of what people are thinking and feeling. As with any kind of art, those who create the graffiti wish to use more than words to communicate their thoughts and ideas. Take a look and get a glimpse of Tahrir Square through the graffiti in these pictures.</p>

<p>What can I say about this except bacon? If caramel and pepper sounds like a weird flavor combination to you, please reconsider. It is excellent.</p>
<p>Additionally, this recipe is almost mess free (if you do better than I did and put aluminum foil under your bacon), and it makes a wonderful impression (if you do this better than I and use thick-cut nice bacon instead of fake turkey bacon). Perfect for the after New Year blues, but maybe not for the after New Year diet. Sorry.</p>
<p><a href="http://pipingdreams.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bacon-candy-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2327" title="bacon candy 3" src="http://pipingdreams.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bacon-candy-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>

<p>It is perfect for those days, when all you want is a piece of toast and a whole lotta bacon. Which is what today is, because you&#8217;ve just read this.</p>
<p><a href="http://pipingdreams.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bacon-candy-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2326" title="bacon candy 2" src="http://pipingdreams.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bacon-candy-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>Forever presumptuous,</p>
<p>L</p>
<p><strong>Caramel Pepper Bacon</strong></p>
<p>Adapted loosely from a recipe I saw at <a href="http://cravingcomfort.blogspot.com/2009/04/brown-sugar-coated-peppered-bacon.html" target="_blank">Craving Comfort</a></p>
<p>Lay the bacon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or on a wire rack in a baking sheet. I put mine straight on the baking sheet, which was a pain to clean later. Generously sprinkle first pepper, then dark brown sugar on the bacon. Place the baking sheet in a cold oven and set it to 400 degrees F. Bake for 12 minutes, then drain the fat from the pan. Return to the oven and continue baking until the bacon reaches desired crispness. I would check it about every three minutes or so.</p>

<p>All we lost was a pair of earmuffs, a hat, and a black crayon. And maybe a few shreds of sanity.</p>
<p>What we gained was an unforgettable international adventure that included buses, subways, trams, a horse-drawn carriage, a thermal bath, monkeys, seals, a giant Ferris wheel, ice skates, ketchup-flavored Cheetos, glue guns, castles, and butterflies.</p>
<p>And two shots of Slovakian moonshine.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what made the top 10.</p>
<p><strong>Austria, Slovakia, Hungary: Kid Favorites</strong><br />
10. The longest, fastest escalators in the history of the industrialized world<em></em> in the Budapest metro.</p>
<p>9. The baboon at Vienna&#8217;s Natural History Museum. And his colorful butt cheeks.</p>
<p>8. The big pile of dog poop in the square with the giant Christmas tree.</p>
<p>7. Any machine that involves inserting a coin and watching it get squashed into a souvenir, <em>voilà</em>!</p>
<p>6. Kinder eggs. (Seriously, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise#Prohibition_on_sale_or_import_into_the_United_States" target="_blank">the U.S. is missing out</a>.)</p>
<p>5. McDonald&#8217;s. Anywhere.</p>
<p>4. Graffiti. Anywhere.</p>

<p>3. Elevator buttons. Anywhere.</p>
<p>2. Their first water slide. And bumper car. And can of pineapple soda.</p>
<p>1. The rotating, self-sanitizing toilet at our first hotel. (Hours of fun. <em>Hours.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Austria, Slovakia, Hungary: Grown-Up Favorites</strong><br />
10. Aforementioned Slovakian moonshine.</p>
<p>9. Kids who refuse to eat anything except single-serving packs of peanut butter. (More mushroom soup, sweet cabbage, schnitzel, and strudel for us!)</p>
<p>8. 38-degree-Celsius heated pools. Ahhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p>7. <em>Gone with the Wind. </em>And <em>Legends of the Fall.</em> And<em> The Lion King.</em> In Slovakian.</p>

<p>6. Hotel balconies and windows with wide ledges &#8230; For dirty-diaper storage, of course.</p>
<p>5. Locals. Who speak English. And offer directions. And help lift strollers onto buses. And return dropped mittens. And offer gingerbread to cranky children.</p>
<p>4. The espresso-cappuccino-hot-chocolate machine at the hotel breakfast buffet. Refill? Yes, please.</p>
<p>3. Highways, glorious highways. Romania, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/08/romanian-roads" target="_blank">take note</a>.</p>
<p>2. Being quiet and still so the kids can fall asleep. Then accidentally falling asleep ourselves. Before 9. Three nights in a row.</p>
<p>1. The five of us. Together. No matter what country we&#8217;re in.</p>
<p><em>What did your children enjoy most about Christmas vacation? And you? And have you ever had a Kinder egg??</em></p>
