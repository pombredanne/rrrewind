			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://siobhancurious.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/try.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1710" title="try" src="http://siobhancurious.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/try.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Last week, my students were preparing for their first in-class essay, and they were freaking out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re writing commentaries.  In a commentary, you read a short text you haven&#8217;t seen before and then comment on the themes or effects that the author has produced, and explain how he/she has produced them.  Commentaries are hard, but we&#8217;ve been working on them for weeks now, and they&#8217;re mostly getting the hang of it.  Now that they know they&#8217;ll be graded, though, they&#8217;re panicking.</p>
<p>In one class, a handful sat paralyzed during our final exercise, unable to write anything at all on their paper.  I visited each of them periodically, asking them probing questions and nudging them to put something, anything, down.  They scratched a few notes, then stared at the page, their faces immobilized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this ok?&#8221; Octavia asked me repeatedly.  &#8221;Does my thesis statement make sense?  If I want to talk about the point of view, can I do that?  What should I say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just write it down,&#8221; I said.  &#8221;We&#8217;ll discuss in a few minutes.  Just write it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the practice class, I asked all the students to share what they had come up with, and some seemed to have a handle on things.  Others who&#8217;d been floundering looked more and more relieved as I wrote thesis after thesis on the board and said, &#8220;Yes, this is what you&#8217;re after!  Please explain!  You see, it&#8217;s not easy, but with a bit of thought, you can get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went directly to my other section of the same course, and there, things went south much more quickly and noisily.</p>
<p>I asked them to do the same individual exercise, to be discussed together at the end of class.  It was clear that a number of them had no idea where to begin.  For a few, this wasn&#8217;t surprising: they&#8217;d missed classes and previous practice essays and were only now realizing that it was catching up with them.  Nevertheless, the instructions were clear, they had a rubric with all of the criteria in front of them, and EVERY SINGLE CLASS SO FAR THIS SEMESTER has been preparation for this essay.</p>
<p>Some students were working diligently away, but most, after a cursory reading of the assigned text and a few moments of simmering silence, began talking to their neighbours.  They were on task &#8211; they were asking for help, comparing notes, all things that would normally be par for the class.  But the noise was growing louder, and the purpose of this exercise was to do the work alone.</p>
<p>I reminded them of this.  &#8221;Next class, you have to write this essay by yourself.  Your neighbour can&#8217;t help you.  Why aren&#8217;t you taking advantage of the practice time right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The grumbles began.  &#8221;Miss, can we have, like, a five minute discussion after we get the text next class, so we can share our thoughts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But miss, it&#8217;s hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s hard!&#8221; I cried.  &#8221;If it were easy, there&#8217;d be no reason to study it in school!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I paused.  Something was happening here that I wasn&#8217;t acknowledging.  What was it?  I let them buzz a little longer, and then I marched to the front of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; I said.  They stopped talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am VERY CONCERNED,&#8221; I said.  &#8221;But it&#8217;s not because I don&#8217;t think you can do this.  I&#8217;m concerned because YOU don&#8217;t think you can do it.  You&#8217;re panicking and throwing your hands in the air and not even trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re like the girl in the passage!&#8221; Jamila piped up.  &#8221;She can&#8217;t do what she wants, so she just gives up doing anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221; I said.  &#8221;Jamila and I have been talking for twenty minutes and she&#8217;s been saying she doesn&#8217;t understand.  But see?  She understands SOMETHING.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not enough, miss,&#8221; Jamila said.  &#8221;What else am I supposed to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; I said.  &#8221;I guarantee you, if you come in next class believing you can&#8217;t do it, you won&#8217;t be able to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guaranteed!&#8221;  Zack nodded and pointed through the air at me in a &#8220;sing it, sister&#8221; gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can do SOMETHING, if you stop worrying about doing it wrong.  If you sit there for two hours and write a bunch of notes and come up with a thesis statement or a literary device or anything, I&#8217;ll give you any points I can give you.  Then, when you take it home later to revise, you&#8217;ll have something to start the next draft with.  You might fail this essay.  But if you fail the essay, THE WORLD WILL NOT END.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zack raised his hands to the sky.  &#8221;Thank you miss!&#8221; he yelled.  &#8221;I need to hear that.  I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just do it.  Even if you think your ideas are ridiculous, just write them down.  If the draft you do in class doesn&#8217;t make any sense, we&#8217;ll work on it, and you&#8217;ll do it again at home, and maybe next time it will be better.  Honestly, guys, if you get out of college not knowing how to write a perfect literary commentary, it&#8217;s not a big deal.  But if you get out of college knowing that now you can sit with a random text for a couple of hours and come up with some things to say about it, that will be an accomplishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I let them go.  I came home exhausted.  My New York Sunday Times was still sitting on the table, untouched.  I pulled out the Magazine, to discover, on the cover, Paul Tough&#8217;s essay <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/what-if-the-secret-to-success-is-failure.html?scp=1&amp;sq=failure&amp;st=cse">&#8220;What if the Secret to Success is Failure?&#8221;</a> In it, he interviews teachers, principals and other educators who believe that &#8220;character&#8221; &#8211; variously defined &#8211; is a more important ingredient in long-term life success than academic smarts are.</p>
<p>Tough writes much of his article about the American KIPP schools, remarkably successful charter schools for students in difficulty.  KIPP graduates an impressive number of its at-risk students, but followup studies have shown that these students don&#8217;t always thrive once they get to college, and a large number don&#8217;t complete their degrees.  According to one of his subjects,</p>
<blockquote><p> the students who persisted in college were not necessarily the ones who had excelled academically [at the KIPP schools]; they were the ones with exceptional character strengths, like optimism and persistence and social intelligence. They were the ones who were able to recover from a bad grade and resolve to do better next time; to bounce back from a fight with their parents; to resist the urge to go out to the movies and stay home and study instead&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another researcher tells him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;learning is hard. True, learning is fun, exhilarating and gratifying — but it is also often daunting, exhausting and sometimes discouraging. . . . To help chronically low-performing but intelligent students, educators and parents must first recognize that character is at least as important as intellect.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tough, reflecting on these observations, comments that</p>
<blockquote><p>the struggle to pull yourself through a crisis, to come to terms on a deep level with your own shortcomings and to labor to overcome them — is exactly what is missing for so many students&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Tough and some of his subjects, the key ingredient is <em>grit</em>, the ability to persist in the face of obstacles and even failure.</p>
<p>GRIT! I thought.  This is what I&#8217;ve been saying all along!  If I can face down my limitations, if I can labour to be, not perfect, but better &#8211; I will be &#8230; happy?  Is grit something we can learn?  If so, how can we teach it?</p>
<p>Two days later, my students were still labouring to be perfect.  In my first class, I had to visit Octavia several times.  &#8221;STOP SECOND-GUESSING YOURSELF,&#8221; I told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, miss,&#8221; she said.  &#8221;I always do that, always.  I don&#8217;t know how to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to help her stop, either.  But after I whispered &#8220;WRITE IT DOWN&#8221; one more time, and walked away, she began writing things down.  She filled a couple of pages.  I haven&#8217;t read them yet, but those pages, regardless of what&#8217;s on them, are an achievement.</p>
<p>Teaching them how to write a commentary is all very well, but what is it for?  Maybe the main thing is for is to help them practice <em>grit</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s hard.  Just keep going.  If you fail, fail as well as you can, and then try again.</p>
<p>We need to spend less time talking about literary techniques and more time talking about grit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thepasswordisswordfish.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/50501.png?w=478&#038;h=317" alt="" width="478" height="317" /></p>
<p>Attempting to make a movie that is both raucously funny and emotionally devastating is like trying to hit a target with an arrow from a mile away. You can either be so irreverent that the drama feels forced, or the drama can be so effective that it bums the audience out too much for them to laugh. So many movies have tried to walk this tightrope before, and very few have succeeded the way Jonathan Levine&#8217;s 50/50 succeeds. This film had me laughing until my sides hurt and actually had me, a jaded film critic, wiping away tears near the end. 50/50 is nearly 100% satisfying.</p>
<p><span id="more-3203"></span></p>
<p>Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man working for NPR. He is interested in creating perfect radio stories and trying to keep things interesting with his longterm girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), while his co-worker and best friend (Seth Rogen) seems to be more interested in getting laid. Suddenly, when Adam goes into the doctor about some back pain he&#8217;d been having, he finds out he has a very serious type of cancer, and he needs to start chemotherapy immediately. This sends him into a state of shock, and he tells his friend, girlfriend, and mom (Anjelica Huston) not to panic. Adam goes through a series of changes as he sees a young therapist (Anna Kendrick) and befriends two older gentlemen at the chemo sessions (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer). All the while, the reality continues to set in: his odds of dying young are very strong.</p>
<p>Words can&#8217;t describe how perfectly writer Will Reiser, director Jonathan Levine, and the actors nail the tone here. I was admittedly very skeptical on how this would work, especially so shortly after Funny People, a film with similar subject matter and Seth Rogen as the co-star, fumbled when it came to the emotional side of illness. Turns out this film, which deals more with the process of being sick than discovering how to live again after being sick, is nothing like Funny People at all. It can go straight from hilarious scene to affecting scene to a scene that somehow manages both. There are plenty of one-liners, yet there&#8217;s also plenty of truth. It&#8217;s enormously difficult to jerk the audience from one mode to another like this, but the feeling achieved when it&#8217;s done well is pretty damn close to bliss.</p>
<p><img src="http://thepasswordisswordfish.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/50502.png?w=447&#038;h=317" alt="" width="447" height="317" /></p>
<p>There is one subplot that keeps this film from being perfect: Bryce Dallas Howard&#8217;s girlfriend character, since it is far more one-note than a film like this deserves. She&#8217;s established as being a &#8220;bitch&#8221; by the best friend because she hasn&#8217;t slept with Adam in a long time, and from there forward, we know that Adam&#8217;s relationship with her won&#8217;t last because he can do better. In particular, the circumstances surrounding her inevitable departure takes the film into a scene or two of woman-bashing that made me slightly uncomfortable. The script of this film has so much heart and humor and complexity that it&#8217;s a shame that such a key character acts like a one-note &#8220;bitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet everything else about the film is executed wonderfully. The scenes with the mother could have easily become interactions with a one-note shrill harpy like we see so often in these films, but Huston is fantastic and her scenes with Gordon-Levitt are quite affecting. Kendrick is an intelligent actress who handles awkwardness with an unforced grace, and your heart goes out to her the second she appears. Baker Hall and Frewer are hysterical, again taking what could have been a stereotype and delivering the depth necessary to make the roles memorable. Gordon-Levitt is great at these sort of hip-young-man roles, because his physicality and squinty eyes hold worlds of life within them.</p>
<p>The real glue of the film is Seth Rogen, who it seems has played this role a million times yet here feels fresh. In movies like Funny People and Knocked Up, he plays selfish immature young men who try to find a heart, but here, his selfish immature young man has evident heart all along. It turns out this story is autobiographical for the screenwriter, whose best friend at the time was in fact Seth Rogen, so it&#8217;s no wonder the character is perfectly sculpted to fit his personality. The friendship between Gordon-Levitt and Rogen makes up the majority of the film&#8217;s laughs and most poignant moments&#8211; a buddy cancer movie. The repor between everyone in the cast is excellent, the laughs are plentiful, and the tears are cathartic. Pretty odd that a film about a deadly disease can make you feel so good.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People at our office are always coming up with events to try to keep the workplace interesting.  Recently they announced that, on some date in the near future, there will be an &#8220;ugly sweater&#8221; contest.  With that innocent, well-intentioned decision, they placed the fashion-challenged among us at enormous risk.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq52hyi40f1qlw12eo1_500.png" alt="" width="315" height="243" />The problem is that, once you get beyond a solid colored sweater, there is no sure way of distinguishing an &#8220;attractive&#8221; sweater from a repulsive one.  This isn&#8217;t an issue for men&#8217;s attire; few guys have a taste for sweaters as vivid and outlandish as those worn by Dr. Cliff Huxtable on <em>The Cosby Show</em>.  Women are another story, however.  You may see sweaters with hanging fuzzballs or swaying threads of yarn, scattered sequins, ribbons, or spangles, large Brutus Buckeye figures, bright orange pumpkins, or fake fall leaves sewn on, or blinding abstract designs that could have been ripped from the walls of the Guggenheim.  And there appears to be no rule of thumb that allows you to safely place one sweater versus another in the humorous, isn&#8217;t-this-a-razz,&#8221;ugly&#8221; category.</p>
<p>Therein lies the awful risk.  A guy might cheerfully tell a fellow passenger in the elevator that their sweater is a sure winner in the &#8220;ugly sweater&#8221; contest, only to realize from the icy response that the event isn&#8217;t until the day after tomorrow.  Or he might compliment a co-worker about her lovely ensemble, and then be advised that she thinks the sweater is hideous and certain to prevail in the competition.   The opportunities for a colossal <em>faux pas</em> are endless.</p>
<p>The safest course is to stay in your office, keep your head down in the common areas, and avoid any discussion until after the contest day has passed and a period of apparent sweater normalcy has returned.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I walked all of Sugar Beach on Maui&#8217;s southern shores with fellow photog, Matthew Nall.  We started walking from Haycraft Park in Ma&#8217;alaea and walked all the way to North Kihei.  It was quite an amazing journey and needless to say my ankles were quite sore from all that walking in the sand!  I had a good time goofing off, splashing around in the water and peering into the little tide pools.  It was also great fun bouncing creative ideas off with another photographer.  Must do more often!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">There is much to question regarding the current state of mainstream hip-hop, minus a few, fresh glimmers of hope (ahem J. Cole). For the most part, it’s become monotonous, overproduced, and lacking comprehensive, lyrical depth. But when a rapper is removed from his clichéd natural habitat (on top of a saturated beat, their mansion in the hills, the Rolls Royce dealership, the jewelry store, Nicki Minaj…kidding) and placed on a stage, grasping a mic in front of a crowd, there is a vigor released that almost make one forget how prominent they are. Instead of celebrated, entertainment symbols, these seven rappers are vulnerable, emotion-filled spoken word poets. And even if it only lasts a couple of minutes, it’s a breath of fresh air in an otherwise polluted environment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">Common</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“God is Freedom”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/wi6tatSEaas/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common is one of the few rappers that seems more comfortable on a stage than on top of a beat. He’s so publically revered that First Lady Michelle Obama invited the rapper to the White House in May for a poetry reading, infuriating the always open-minded Fox News.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">KRS-One and Doug E. Fresh</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“2nd Quarter-Free Throws”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/oJDO-NyNIKc/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that myself and this general cohort of readers are too young to understand the essence of KRS-One and how revolutionary he was in his prime. With a foundation of social activism, KRS-One isn&#8217;t as much a rapper as he is a teacher. His songs, like the one above, don&#8217;t implore you to sit back and listen, but rather to get up and act. KRS-One would be the perfect alarm clock.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">Kanye West</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“Bittersweet Poetry”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/y2uYk670HOY/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both pieces from this video may sound familiar. The showy intro is from West’s verse in <strong>Rhymefest</strong>’s 2006 hit, “Brand New,” and “Bittersweet Poetry” is a bonus track from his 2007 release <em>Graduation</em>, which features <strong>John Mayer </strong>(Don&#8217;t worry, he isn&#8217;t in this performance). Nowadays, West tends to steal the stage from others during their special moments, but in this 2006 video, the limelight is all his.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">Talib Kweli</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“Hell”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/DrjWcqWnk6A/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brooklyn native and once NYU student has garnered moderate commercial success, while juggling the status as an intellect and poet. In addition to that balancing act, what makes Talib Kweli special is no matter the song he is featured on, his diction and overall message is constantly thought provoking.  “Hell” being a great example of his bright, hip-hop infused poetry.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">DMX</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“The Industry”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qXjTaceF6ts/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! DMX is happy about something! Just kidding. He is pissed about the record business. But it’s quite refreshing to see him so stripped-down and open.</p>
<p>Footnote: With that growl, I suspect DMX could rap about his fondness for daisies and guinea pigs and I would come away thinking he has a deep seeded hatred for both.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">J. Ivy</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“Dear Father”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Xdta43fVmes/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may or may not know the name J. Ivy as the guy who rapped that really inspirational verse in Kanye West’s song “Never Let Me Down” from West’s debut release, <em>The College Dropout</em>. But it’s the lasting effect of “Dear Father” that should make him much more memorable than being featured on an elite rapper’s album.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="7" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">Sekou tha Misfit</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;">—“I’m a Rapper”</span></span></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://listsof.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/spoken-word-the-hip-hop-edition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/h2s0w2dx7Wg/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sekou tha Misfit is an accomplished slam poet and entertainer. He is not a rapper, despite what the title suggests. Although, in this piece, he embodies the character of a rapper, who flaunts all of the amenities noted at the top of this page. &#8220;I&#8217;m a Rapper&#8221; deliberately exploits the current culture of mainstream hip-hop in a compelling, conscious MC effort.</p>

<p>Designed to replace a series of locks, boats float out along a viaduct from the top of a hill, then enter one of two &#8220;baths&#8221;, 180 degrees opposed on the twin arms of a wheel. The wheel then rotates 180 degrees, swapping the top and bottom bath. Out the boat moves, 35 metres below/above its start point.</p>

<p>I used my recently acquired B+W ND 110 filter to get some nice skies and reflections in the water.</p>

<p>I processed the black and white images using Nik Silver EFX Pro 2. I was pleased with the results, and plan to write something up to show my workflow with it soon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left off last week realizing that school this semester was going to kick my ass. Fresh from that realization, my counselor told me that she had to work at getting my scholarship funds released as I was not considered &#8220;full time.&#8221; WTF is said! I&#8217;m only carrying 11 credits and I think that the full time threshold is 12. Couldn&#8217;t be because I was spending way too much time at school for me to be part time. So I added up my weekly hours:</p>
<p>Adv Baking &#8211; 8 hrs</p>
<p>Menu planning &#8211; 2 hrs</p>
<p>Beverage &#8211; 1 hr</p>
<p>Garde Manger &#8211; 8 hrs       Total hours = 19  But wait.  I have to factor into my Fellowship hours with Chef Tom at Class Act. That would be an additional 15 hours. Now it all makes sense. It would be an easy semester without my fellowship&#8230;Rats!</p>
<p>Anyhoo, the second week felt a little more comfortable. I&#8217;m getting to know the other students and finding the rhythm of working in them. Adv. Baking was another week of breads.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5392.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821" title="IMG_5392" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5392.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Scaling whole wheat walnut dough</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5389.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822" title="IMG_5389" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5389.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>750 grams of benched dough.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5393.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="IMG_5393" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5393.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Baked off walnut whole wheat rolls. Yum!<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5397.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824" title="IMG_5397" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5397.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></em>We did a lot of baking and some tasting. We sampled some awesome Sourdough, Olive Sourdough and Walnut Wheat. More bread next week.</p>
<p>We had our first quiz in Garde Manger. I got an 89%. First time ever I got below 90% for anything. How am I going to make up for that? You&#8217;ll see later. The topic for this week were salads. On Tuesday our groups were assigned to make 3 salads. Farro Salad with Roasted Vegetables, Beluga Lentil Salad with Fennel &amp; Tomato and finally Tabbouleh. There wasn&#8217;t much organization in the group but we all somehow found a task to do and did it. The Beluga Lentil Salad was mine to make. These &#8220;grain&#8221; salads, I learned, are divided into a body (whatever grain or main ingredient), a garnish (what I would call filling; roasted veggies, sauteed veggies) and a dressing. The best ratios would be 2 parts body and 1 part garnish. The amount of dressing would be up to you.  Check our salads out.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5391.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825" title="IMG_5391" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5391.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>Thursday was our first practical. We were required to make 2 composed salads using chicken breast and shrimp and mystery pantry ingredients. First, a composed salad is one that is carefully arranged, instead of being tossed. It usually has a focal item and is colorful. Each component should stand on it&#8217;s own but shouldn&#8217;t be out of place. With that said, our first salad was a Roasted Chicken, Blue Cheese and Caramelized Onion Tart with Apples, Figs and Arugula topped with a Lemon Vinaigrette. Our second salad was a Grilled Vegetable Napoleon with Shrimp, Spring greens and a Roasted Red Pepper Coulis Vinaigrette.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5396.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826" title="IMG_5395" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5395.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827" title="IMG_5396" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5396.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Chef Craig doing the evaluation.</em></p>
<p>Our dishes both looked really good and our evaluation couldn&#8217;t have been much better. Our Tart Salad was picked as the best salad of the day both in terms of taste and visually. Our review for the Napoleon wasn&#8217;t as glowing. It seemed that the shrimp was not carefully incorporated. Our first plan was to slice them thinly and layer into the Napoleon but we pitched that idea. Oh well, you can&#8217;t have winners every time. We got 48 points out of a maximum of 50. Go team SLNK!</p>
<p>As a &#8220;Fellow&#8221; in Class Act, I help Chef Tom out with the students and sometimes get assigned a task to complete for our service. My task on Friday was to make a potato chip garnish. It wasn&#8217;t your ordinary garnish, It was 2 paper thin potato slices with a fennel frond in between. Not as easy as it seems. All the air pockets must be pressed out of the envelope or it won&#8217;t crisp. It was very laborious and time consuming but it added a special touch.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5398.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828" title="IMG_5398" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5398.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5399.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-829" title="IMG_5399" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5399.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5400.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-830" title="IMG_5400" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5400.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>This was a very stressful week as Saturday was my sisters wedding at my house. I was initially asked only to make the cake, to which I responded &#8220;Um, I&#8217;ve only decorated 1 cake in Beginning Baking and you want me to make your wedding cake?&#8221; I reluctantly agreed and must have been drunk when having this conversation because I then said &#8220;Since I&#8217;m in culinary school, it makes sense for me to cater the food as well.&#8221; As a result of that, I&#8217;ve been prepping for the past 3 weeks and stressing for 6. I started working at 8:30 am and didn&#8217;t stop until the guests left a 9:30. If you think you&#8217;ve prepped it all, don&#8217;t worry, you always forget something. Here are some of the goodies served.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5431.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-831" title="IMG_5431" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5431.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Polenta with Roasted Red and Green Peppers, Parmesan Chees</em>e <em>and Pepper Oil.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5438.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-832" title="IMG_5438" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5438.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Tofu with Ginger &amp; Soy Glaze.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5458.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833" title="IMG_5458" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5458.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Vichyssoise Shots with Green Onion Oil.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5467.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834" title="IMG_5467" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5467.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Roasted Red Pepper Coulis Poached Shrimp (the natives were restless so I forgot the garnish.)</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5459.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835" title="IMG_5459" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5459.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Asian Chicken Skewers with Thai Peanut Dipping Sauce.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5468.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837" title="IMG_5468" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5468.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Fried Ahi, Okinawan Sweet Potato and Yam Nori Rolls with Ginger Soy Dippping Sauce.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5469.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-838" title="IMG_5469" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5469.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Pulled Pork with Caramelized Maui Onions, Dried Cherries and Mango on Homemade Portuguese Sweet Bread Rolls.</em></p>
<p>What I wasn&#8217;t able to photograph was the Pohole Fern Shoot Salad with Cherry Tomato Salad with Li Hing Vinaigrette. I do have a tip if you are using tomatoes in a salad. Always salt and drain overnight if possible. It releases a lot of water and doesn&#8217;t make your salad soggy.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5402.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839" title="IMG_5402" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5402.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>I suppose I could reduce this tomato water down and use it for something.</em></p>
<p>Oh the cake. Butter cream had become the thorn in my side. No matter what version I tried, it always had some solid bits in it. Oh well, I did the best and it tasted really good. The cake was a Butter Sponge and the Butter cream was made with a Swiss Meringue. Both recipes were from Martha Stewart. My sister insisted on orchids and she also got a cake topper that wouldn&#8217;t have been my first choice or any of my choices for that matter.<a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5405.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840" title="IMG_5405" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5405.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Shaping the cake layers to the proper width. Check out my ghetto set up&#8230;lazy susan on a box.

I have to find the lowest point on all 6 cakes and that becomes the height of all 6 layers. I thought it was rather ingenious of me to bust out a ruler instead of winging it. This process took me a long, long time.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5416.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842" title="IMG_5416" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5416.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>I used this amazing lilikoi curd as filling between the layers.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5417.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-843" title="IMG_5417" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5417.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Oh butter cream, please be good to me. Swiss meringue to be exact.</em><a href="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5428.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844" title="IMG_5428" src="http://tinfoilduck.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_5428.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>The final product.</em></p>
<p>The cake made it without falling over. The support straws even held up. The only thing this cake was missing was band aid. So before you judge, just remember this was my first one ever.</p>
<p>What a relief it was to wake up on Sunday with not a care in the world. No prep, no planning, just some homework. Until next week, see ya!<em></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our recent holiday to Lanzarote started off as a real adventure, driving through the fire mountains at night with no map, no street lights and only the moon to guide us! Even by moonlight the landscape was stunning, although I did wish Simon would spend more time concentrating driving on the right side of the road!</p>
<p>Waking up to see it by daylight didn&#8217;t disappoint either and exploring was a lot less treacherous when you could see where you were going. This wasn&#8217;t necessarily the case for the surfers, more on that in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The week was jam-packed with sports and activities of all kinds, one of my favourite being trekking up Pico Partido volcano in Timanfaya National Park. We were told by the guide, Jose Luis, about how the sea of lava reclaimed the land. It was certainly impressive and being told that if we fell into a lava tube we would never be found sure added to the excitement!</p>
<p>Along the way we were told about the culture of Lanzarote. My favourite was the fact that when a child is born it is tradition to plant one palm tree for a boy and two for a girl. Aside from the palm trees and a plant which apparently can be smoked in the absence of tobacco, we were told about the only fruit native to Lanzarote, the fig (simply known as &#8216;the fruit&#8217; to the locals).</p>
<p>We also had our first stab at creating a time-lapse video, a stunning sunset. We are just in the process of stitching all the photos together, but it should be a stunner.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe it would be fair to say everyone has a different impression of the Taj Mahal upon actually visiting because she presents herself in a different way to each different visitor. In pictures, I’ve always seen the calm, peaceful, deserted Taj Mahal with clear skies and untouched water. When I visited, I saw her on a relatively cloudy day with so many people I swore everyone was duplicating themselves multiples times once passing through the gates. Upon first glimpse, I was almost thinking “That’s not the Taj Mahal.” Rahul and I stopped to take pictures once entering, which <em>every</em> other tourist did as well. So if we took too long trying to get a shot wrong, or just stood in the same spot for too long, we would get shoved, slowly edged out of our spot, crowded, and number of things that would drive even the most weathered travelers mad.</p>
<div id="attachment_157" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0244.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-157" title="DSC_0244" src="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0244.jpg?w=490&#038;h=324" alt="" width="490" height="324" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Taj</p></div>
<p>But after moving away from the crowd clumps (appropriate term for where the highest amount of tourists would congregate, like ant hill mounds) and after taking a few moments to really let it sink in that I was staring at the <em>Taj Mahal</em>, it hit me: I was standing in front of probably the greatest testament of one person’s love for another that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Just a quick history lesson on the Taj Mahal; it was built by the Mughul ruler Shahjahan in the 1600s after his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, passed away giving birth to her 14<sup>th</sup> child at the age of 38 (she was getting busy to have had 13 children by 38). He wanted her burial place to be as beautiful as their love for each other, and so he had the Taj Mahal constructed. It took 20 years to build, and Shahjahan was overthrown and imprisoned by his son after its completion, spending the rest of his life in Agra Fort, only able to see his wife’s burial place at a distance.</p>
<p>Shahjahan also desired to be buried next to his wife, who is placed in the exact center of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is the greatest example of Mughul architecture, and the Mughuls were really big on symmetry and geographical shapes. The Taj Mahal is actually the exact same from all four sides, making it look like a little box with a building in the middle of it from a distance. Mumtaz’s tomb is in the exact middle of the Taj Mahal with Shahjahan’s tomb placed sloppily beside it, the only thing not symmetrically perfect in the whole grounds.</p>
<div id="attachment_155" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0485.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-155" title="DSC_0485" src="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0485.jpg?w=490&#038;h=324" alt="" width="490" height="324" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Taj Mahal from Agra Fort--looks like a little box!</p></div>
<div id="attachment_156" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0265.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-156" title="DSC_0265" src="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0265.jpg?w=490&#038;h=324" alt="" width="490" height="324" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mumtaz placed perfectly in the center, Shanjahan on the side</p></div>
<p>While the purpose for the Taj Mahal’s construction is amazing, so is the amount of people who come to visit it every year. We took an early morning train from Delhi to Agra. We arrived in Agra around 8 AM and were immediately followed for around five minutes by a cab driver vying for our business. We took an auto instead, dozens of them lined up near the train station waiting for business—surely more often than not tourists wanting to be taken to the Taj Mahal. We got there early enough that we didn’t have to wait in line at the South Entrance (by far the most beautiful entrance), which was packed with people trying to enter when we left. One of the things tour guide books warn against is fake tour guides—people who will promise a tour of the Taj Mahal, ask for payment, and then take off. We saw this happen to a few tourists when we were leaving but, the tourists caught on to the scheme before the fake tour guide could play the vanishing game.</p>
<p>All these people have to go somewhere, thus sprinkling themselves on the grounds of the Taj Mahal, pushing their way through the inside mausoleum, taking turns snapping pictures in the popular spots, congregating in large groups from spot to spot to spot. We had a joke going on while we were there about the “bros” at the Taj Mahal, as there was an alarming amount of teenage Indian boys wondering in clumps, as if scoping out the area for ladies.</p>
<div id="attachment_158" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0377.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-158" title="DSC_0377" src="http://wordifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0377.jpg?w=490&#038;h=324" alt="" width="490" height="324" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just to give you a small idea of how many people were there</p></div>
<p>Once getting past the crowds, I was able to appreciate more the wonder of the monument, and the hundreds of other people there became not an annoyance but another component of the majesticness of the Taj Mahal. The white marble looms over the surrounding gardens and fluid crowds. The first sighting almost doesn’t even make sense, the sight of the structure confirming its almost mythical existence. The Taj Majal was something we learned about every year in school and so to be standing in front of it was unreal. And it <em>did</em> feel unreal, for a moment, until I acknowledged the fact that this crowded, hot, sunny Taj Mahal I visited was the same Taj Mahal I had seen in dozens of pictures, and the same Taj Mahal now hanging in a picture in my own house.</p>
