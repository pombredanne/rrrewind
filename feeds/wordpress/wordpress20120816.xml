				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0003-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-178" title="IMG_0003-4" src="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0003-4.jpg?w=1024&h=677" alt="" width="1024" height="677" /></a></p>
<p>Some people get downright mad when their photo is taken.  People get violent even.  Case in point, a homeless man punched me yesterday for taking his photo (do not fret friends, your loyal blogger is ok).  On the other hand, there are those who love getting photographed.  Some people even come up to me just to ask to get their picture taken (I get so happy when this happens!).  The law of averages being universal, the vast majority of people react in a similar way - nonchalance.  Most people don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>So when we ask ourselves, is what we are doing ethically justifiable?  And further &#8211; what would make a photograph unethical?  These are tough questions to answer and therefore posing them is also somewhat tough.  However, as I like to emphasize&#8230; we are the intrepid and immune to trepidation.  So let us strap on our utility belts like Batman and bring evil doers to justice.</p>
<p><a href="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0008.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-176" title="IMG_0008" src="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0008.jpg?w=1024&h=688" alt="" width="1024" height="688" /></a></p>
<p>Johnathan Stuart Mill (henceforth &#8211; JSM or Mill) became very famous for his &#8220;Utilitarian&#8221; philosophy.  In short &#8211; whatever produces the highest good or highest pleasures for the greatest number of people should be promoted.   Now JSM did not create &#8220;Utilitarianism&#8221;, there were many thinkers before him, but his version of the philosophy is one I think worth exploring for today&#8217;s discussion.</p>
<p>The point of departure for Mill was that while his predecessors were very interested in hedonism, he maintained that there were a variety of different pleasures, intellectual pleasures being the highest.  So far, so good.  Mill also argued that people desire happiness (the ultilitarian end) and that general happiness is &#8220;a good to the aggregate of all persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what would Jonathan Stuart Mill do (WWJSMD)?  How does street photography fit into this picture?</p>
<p><a href="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0001-22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-211" title="IMG_0001-2" src="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0001-22.jpg?w=1024&h=694" alt="" width="1024" height="694" /></a>Are we producing the highest good for the highest number of people?  I would answer in the affirmative.  I believe that these images enrich our lives and promote empathy.  To make portraits of people, you have to study them.  The anonymous crowd pouring through the city is now a mass of individuals.  Each person is imbued with love, hate, and joy.  So it is in this sense I think we are philanthropists.  We love humanity.  How many misanthropes do you see shooting street photography?  We find beauty in humanity and accentuate it.</p>
<p>So we are the finders, keepers, distributers and multipliers of beauty.  And to prove another slightly different point, I think this is why I like to photo the grit and the grime of New York.  To show that there is something lovely in the destitute.  The lotus flower is one of the most beautiful&#8230; and grows in the muck of nasty swamps.  Our city of New York is covered in dirt, graffiti and rusty syringes.  There is also a suspiciously high number of used tampon applique&#8217;s on the beaches of Brooklyn.  But our minds crave beauty and we shall find what we seek.</p>
<p><a href="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_00101.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-214" title="IMG_0010" src="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_00101.jpg?w=1024&h=681" alt="" width="1024" height="681" /></a>What about the nay sayers?  Well&#8230; I suppose we could take a look at the hater&#8217;s argument.  While I don&#8217;t think there are many that get displeasure from looking at these photos, there are probably quite a few that get displeasure from their photo being taken.  How are we promoting the highest good if people are getting angry?  The paparazzi harass celebrities into shaving off all their hairs (shout-outs to my girl Brit).  This is where the fuzzy line of ethics in street photography is encountered.  Harassment is definitely the transgression into unethical photography.</p>
<p>Could you say that I am harassing someone when I snap the shutter and walk away?  Perhaps&#8230; but that&#8217;s a shaky espousal.  If I photo someone, they get upset and I continue to photo them, then the line was crossed (and no, I don&#8217;t do this).</p>
<p><a href="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0006-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-224" title="IMG_0006-5" src="http://stillthrill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0006-5.jpg?w=1024&h=994" alt="" width="1024" height="994" /></a></p>
<p>So here is my list of unethical situations that I do NOT participate in and I highly suggest you don&#8217;t either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harassing someone when they ask you to leave or stop.</li>
<li>Trying to photograph girls up skirt.</li>
<li>Peeping Tom-ery.</li>
<li>Failing to help someone in need because you&#8217;re too busy to take a photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Johnny Law has some things to say about this &#8211; upskirt photography and peeping tom-ery is illegal (coined unlawful surveillance).  And while not helping another person and harassing someone may not be illegal <em>per se</em>, I would argue they are unethical (according to Mill&#8217;s definitions of ethical behavior).  So since I don&#8217;t do any of that foolishness and never will, I am in the green.  How about you?</p>
<p>Happy, ethically justified, shooting!</p>
<p>J</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://samueldavidsmith.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/chew1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95" title="Chew1" src="http://samueldavidsmith.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/chew1.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Endings are weird. They’re incredibly common, but they freak me out. Whenever I finish a book, I always feel distressed and empty, despite my brain being a little bit fuller (apart from that time I read Russell Brand’s autobiography, lost a couple brain cells on that one). At some point, your game of Pac-Man is going to end, no matter how well you dodge the ghosts, because the kill screen on level 256 is always waiting in the wings. Not to be too deep, but get this: Life ends.</p>
<p>Comics are a respite from endings. Some heroes have been doing the same thing for over fifty years and they aren’t slowing down. Single issues end, but you always know that in two weeks Spiderman will swing back, Batman will punch another goon in the chest and Hulk will smash yet again. It’s an infinite, comforting cycle.</p>
<p>Which is why Chew scares me. Detective Tony Chu is a Cibopath, meaning he can tell where something comes from by eating it. He could take eat an apple and get a feeling of what tree it came from, what pesticides were used and when it was harvested. Or he could eat a burger and feel something completely different and completely awful. Or, he could take a bite out of a person, as he so often is force to when solving crimes. Cibopathy is incredibly rare in the Chew universe (or Chewniverse (or not)), he’s not the only one, and it’s certainly not the only weird thing around. Vampires, alien fruit and the scariest rooster you’ve ever seen all pile up in front of Tony, and he’s not too happy about any of it.</p>
<p>I love Chew. The story is wild, the jokes are sharp as a tiger’s incisor and the art hits a great balance between cartoon craziness and slasher movie style gore. It’s amazing, but it’s going to end. The writer, John Layman, has the whole story planned out, to the point where they were able to release issue #27 out of order, after issue #18. In issue #23, there’s a flash forward to one panel from #60, the final issue of Chew. While that’s not exactly round the corner, it should be about three years to reach the end, it will eventually happen and make me feel like I’ve lost a friend or a pet or a really nice pair of shoes.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing. Having an actual plan means that the narrative has been considered. Chew doesn’t suffer from the Lost affliction, where it seemed as if the writers were making it up as they went along, despite assuring us that everything was plotted from the start. Pacing would also have been laboured over, ensuring that the story moves along smoothly instead of slowly flailing around like so many never-ending Captain America arcs do. Chew never lingers too long on one sub plot. I could easily describe it as snappy, if I was the kind of asshole that uses the word snappy to describe things.</p>
<p>Some things just need to end. The Simpsons needs to end. CSI, in all its forms, needs to end. Chew needs to end, but for different reasons. It&#8217;s too good to survive forever. I’m not happy about it, but least Chew won’t outstay its welcome. I suppose it’s better to be prepared for that end instead of it coming out of nowhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did not grow up in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I grew up in Albany, Georgia.</p>
<p>While I still consider Albany my <em>home</em>, it wasn&#8217;t exactly a thriving metropolis.  Our city &#8220;center&#8221; wasn&#8217;t obvious, we had no skyscrapers and no sidewalks.  There were no favorite buildings, memorable interiors or picturesque parks.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my undergraduate year, I was only able to name <em>one</em> famous architect &#8211; and I quietly felt ashamed that I had not traveled to the exotic locations my classmates had.  These feelings quickly melted away as I discovered that knowing and naming great architects and their works wasn&#8217;t as important as I would have thought.  What became apparent to me was how important <em>my</em> memories were in shaping me at different times of my design career.  I will briefly share with you a range of projects that had a profound impact on me and why&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-439" title="Childhood playspace" src="http://dawntrimble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/cab_open.jpg?w=183&h=300" alt="" width="183" height="300" /> <em><strong>first memories:</strong></em>  This is an image of our built-in laundry hamper at the house I grew up in (where my parent still live).  It measured 42&#8243; high, 30&#8243; deep and about 26&#8243;wide.  My sister and I spent hours in cramped space when we were younger &#8211; this was our &#8220;pretend&#8221; car.  We would imitate the many conversations we overheard my mother and her sister having.  Not only a space for our imaginations, playing in it subconsciously made me aware of my body and the extents of my immediate surroundings.  There was an understanding of inside/outside and tension/release. My mother had no idea why two girls would want to play in a &#8220;stinky, dirty cabinet&#8221;, but we had a blast.  This was my first memory of my body in space &#8211; a space sized for me.  This memory was formed when I was about 6 or 7, but I didn&#8217;t understand its relevance until I read &#8220;The Poetics of Space&#8221; by Gaston Bachelard.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-444" title="Aerial infrared image of Washington DC, USA" src="http://dawntrimble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/e7800644-aerial_infrared_image_of_washington_dc_usa-spl.jpg?w=300&h=252" alt="" width="300" height="252" /><em><strong>intermediate memories:</strong></em>  This memory happened during my final year of graduate school when I visited the Nations Capitol.  We of course had studied L&#8217;Enfant&#8217;s planning early in my graduate program, but for me, talking about a space or place and visiting it are two different things.  I finally &#8220;got it&#8221; as I was leaving Washington, D.C. (via airplane) and watched the clearly delineated city plan grow smaller and smaller as we ascended into the sky.  I finally understood what positive outcomes a good city plan has on pedestrian life.  Before I saw the big picture, I toured the city so I had an idea of what was where and how I felt in the space.  I remember enjoying the walking so much that after graduate school, I moved back and lived for 4 years (sans vehicle)!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-445" title="The Pantheon, Rome Italy" src="http://dawntrimble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/rome-pantheon-786787.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><em><strong>influential memories:</strong></em>  Long before a visit, the images and discussion about this ionic place intrigued me.  The oculus, the coffered dome, the thick, dramatic walls &#8211; the Pantheon in Rome, Italy is easily one of my favorite spaces.  It&#8217;s grand and intimate at the same time.  The space, because of the oculus, never looks the same way twice. You have to admire the structure, the sculpture and the articulation of this space.  One of my undergrad teaches once had a fantasy that he would share with us regularly: he wanted to be dangled from a rope in center of the Pantheon.  Hopefully the rope can hold two people!</p>
<p>What are some of your most influential memories about spaces/places you&#8217;ve experienced? Please share&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a minute since I wrote up my thoughts on the presidential campaign. I thought I&#8217;d post about it now to let you know that this? This nonsense that&#8217;s been going on? This is why I think it&#8217;s important to pay attention to the primaries.</p>
<p>The primaries are where the real substance of the campaigns happen, regardless of which party is holding them. After the primaries, when the field is narrowed to one candidate from each side, that&#8217;s when all the meaningless, stupid, petty, shallow, dumb-ass mudslinging starts. And that&#8217;s the only thing most people see. No wonder they hate presidential elections.</p>
<p>I suppose one could argue that it&#8217;s a flaw in the system, that the real substance of the debates should continue when everyone is forced to pay attention. But by then, really, the candidates are just trying to get the majority of Americans to know their names and a few catch phrases that are easy to remember in a voting booth. Sure, it&#8217;s insulting, but it&#8217;s also effective because they&#8217;re appealing to the lowest common denominator who don&#8217;t really care about the substance as much as they say they do. If they did, they would have paid attention to the primaries.</p>
<p>Or at least read my blog about them. (Check out the Political Snark category for more stuff with which you can enthusiastically agree or disdainfully disagree. Or, if you stumbled drunkenly into this post, there are other categories you might hate less.)</p>
<p>Yet and still, it seems that this time around, the candidates have really missed the mark on each other.</p>
<p><strong>What Pres. Obama is doing wrong</strong><br />
President Obama&#8217;s camp keeps doubling down about Romney&#8217;s taxes and his wealth while never striking at the heart of the matter. Nobody cares that Mitt Romney is rich. Good for him. What people care about is whether Mitt Romney has any idea what it&#8217;s like <em>not</em> to be rich. And he seems to have demonstrated several times that, in fact, he does not. The president doesn&#8217;t have to replay Romney&#8217;s gaffes; he only has to make it clear to voters that Romney doesn&#8217;t know what it is to be middle-class or poor, so how could they trust him to make sure they don&#8217;t suffer under his economic policies, should he ever care to share them? That&#8217;s what the Obama campaign should be pushing. Instead they&#8217;re wandering around in these woods of &#8220;did he pay taxes?&#8221; and Sen. Harry Reid is going off half-cocked on the floor. It&#8217;s silly.</p>
<p>The president needs to stop blaming Pres. Bush for everything. He was right to do it from 2007 until maybe 2010 or so. After that, it&#8217;s time to own it. The people who were upset with Pres. Bush and his policies, who blame him for the situation Pres. Obama inherited, still remember that. The president need not remind them of that. The president needs to start appearing to take responsibility and carry a mantle.</p>
<p>They need to get Vice-President Biden to stop saying stupid stuff. You can&#8217;t tell voters in Southern Virginia that Mitt Romney would put them &#8220;back in chains.&#8221; Full stop.</p>
<p>They need to talk more about what they&#8217;ve done right. Fine, a lot of people hated part of the women&#8217;s care provision in the Affordable Care Act. (I didn&#8217;t happen to love that part, either.) But there is a lot in the Affordable Care Act (that&#8217;s its actual name) that is good, and not just the coverage for adult children or the end of exclusion for pre-existing conditions. Beat<em> those</em> drums. Beat the drum of national security. Beat the drum of education improvement. Beat the drum of a better image around the world. They&#8217;re getting all of that wrong.</p>
<p>What they&#8217;re getting right is beating the drum of 28 consecutive months of economic growth. But they aren&#8217;t really following through. They need to drive home the factual question mark about what happens if the country changes horses now. The <em>factual</em> question mark, not the emotional one. Emotional appeals, while hugely popular in campaigns, are hollow and see-through to those who have been paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>What Mitt Romney is doing wrong</strong><br />
Well, for starters, he&#8217;s making an ass out of himself all over the place. I don&#8217;t mean that disrespectfully. But he managed to piss off Israel and the Palestinians at the same time. It may have demonstrated the first time those two sides have agreed on anything, which is phenomenal, but it&#8217;s not good. He got off the plane in London and immediately said they weren&#8217;t ready for the Olympics, which was just stupid on a lot of levels &#8211; and also, turned out, incorrect. In Poland, his aide swore at a reporter and in the same breath called the place where they were standing a holy site. This was Romney on the world stage, and it wasn&#8217;t pretty.</p>
<p>It is still, all these months later, difficult to know what Mitt Romney stands for. Those who will vote for him seem more interested in voting <em>against</em> Pres. Obama, or in voting for the theoretical principles of the Republican Party, than in voting <em>for</em> Mitt Romney. While I get that, it&#8217;s not enough to sway those who feel something less than hatred at having Obama as president. Romney has been too vague. In comparison, Rick Santorum in the primaries made a lot of his ideas very clear: specifics on how to change corporate taxation to bring about more manufacturing, leading to a better business environment, more exports and more jobs, for example. Romney just says &#8220;we need more jobs.&#8221; He somehow manages to cross messages, shouting that government doesn&#8217;t create jobs, and then arguing that if he were president, he&#8217;d create more jobs. <em>Wha&#8230;?</em></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t take a firm stand on anything, ever. Maybe that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s seen it burn President Obama (see: unemployment). But, for example, when he talks about energy, he says in the same sentence that we&#8217;re using too much oil and we should drill for more here. Those points seem contradictory. When a radio host called a college grad student a slut for advocating for birth control availability, Romney moused that &#8220;those weren&#8217;t the words&#8221; he would use. If you can&#8217;t take a hard line about whether it&#8217;s appropriate to call that woman a slut several times on national radio, what<em> can</em> you take a hard line about?</p>
<p>He still comes off as stiff at worst, forcing it at best. He seems insincere. He seems <em>uncomfortable</em>. He seems only to know that which he&#8217;s heard anecdotally about the world of the unwealthy. He&#8217;s still Thurston Howell the Third to everyone else&#8217;s NASCAR Nation. And if this makes him better for the job, he&#8217;s not demonstrating that. Yes, Mitt Romney can stump for years on how President Obama hasn&#8217;t delivered on promises about unemployment or the economy, and that&#8217;s true. He was a fool for having made those promises to begin with. But Mr. Romney has run on words that gloss over issues and make it <em>sound</em> like he&#8217;s articulating an idea. Romney has run his entire race on the theory that the election is just a referendum on President Obama, and he need not do anything else.</p>
<p>Until he realized he needed to do something else. That&#8217;s when he picked Paul Ryan to run as vice-president.</p>
<p>Ryan doesn&#8217;t help make up any undecided voters&#8217; minds. So what&#8217;s the point? I think the GOP is worried that people will stay home on November 6th. Ryan will galvanize Tea Partiers who were lukewarm about Romney and maybe independents who didn&#8217;t think either candidate was firm enough on anything; he lends numbers and solid plans to a candidate who lacks both on the economy. And Ryan helps with states like Florida, which could mean more electoral votes for Romney. From now until the convention, the two men will not appear together. They&#8217;re dividing to conquer, which allows Ryan to go places where Romney alienates people. (The interesting thing about Ryan helping in Florida is that his budget plan calls for a $700 billion reduction in Medicare. Coincidentally, so does Obama&#8217;s.)</p>
<p>Make no mistake: the selection of Paul Ryan was a move to the far-right. The less flashy, more moderate picks would have been Rob Portman or Tim Pawlenty. But, like the campaign of 2008, the GOP needs energy. Like the campaign of 2008, they have disregarded the qualifier of whether the VP could actually be president and gone with the person who&#8217;d be sexier for the campaign. All that remains to be seen &#8211; besides endless attack ads &#8211; is who Americans can stomach the best.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone loves nostalgia, despite the fact that it’s a dubious use of one’s time (at best). Whether it’s your parents grousing about how kids have it easy these days or that they grew up in a kinder, gentler world, or just you, sitting on the couch in your jammies, watching reruns of <em>I Love the 80s</em> or having geek-gasms as you read Ernest Cline’s <em>Ready Player One</em>, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all nestled into our inner Wayback Machines and enjoyed a leisurely excursion back to Yesterland.</p>
<p>Thus, in the interest of freely indulging in this very dubious pasttime, I’d like to jump back an even thirty years and examine what just might have been the coolest year ever to be a little geek: 19-<em>freakin’</em>-82.</p>
<p>In 1982, I was seven years old, finishing first grade, starting second. My brother was 12, and I liked hanging with him and his friends way more than I did kids my own age (Bryan didn’t really dig my lamprey-like close proximity, but he didn’t really have a choice, either; I stuck like glue). I was already well on my way to proud geekdom, having been conversant in <em>Star Wars</em> since I was old enough to walk and talk. In 1982, I—like every other kid I knew—was wondering just what the hell was going to happen when <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> (the original title of <em>Star Wars Episode VI</em>) arrived in movie theaters in May of ’83, and I was still reeling from the awesomeness that was <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, released the previous summer.</p>
<p>But <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Raiders</em> were just my foundations. Onto that imaginary bedrock, I piled a parade of comic book superheroes, fantasy and sci fi films and TV shows, obsessions with various monsters of the moment, and music to daydream by ranging from John Williams’ film scores to larger-than-life metal fare by Kiss, AC/DC, and Iron Maiden. Little did I know my fertile little imagination was about to hit a motherlode. 1982 would serve up a heaping helping of steaming geek-erocity that would leave a mark on me for life.</p>
<p>In March of ‘82, we were all torn to shreds by the arrival of Iron Maiden’s seminal metal masterpiece, <em>Number of the Beast</em>. Before summer was out, Ozzy Osborne would be assumed to be (so far as our parents were considered) the Devil Incarnate after biting the head off a bat during a concert in Des Moines, Iowa, then pissing on the Alamo while in San Antonio, Texas. Before the year was out, we’d all know the lyrics to “Eye of the Tiger” front to back (along with every line spoken by Mr. T in <em>Rocky III</em>), see the debut of some nutty Detroit dame named Madonna (a passing fad—we knew she’d never last), and get a little album by Michael Jackson called <em>Thriller</em> issued to us as standard household accoutrement, like a telephone or a vacuum cleaner. On the radio: seminal 80s singles like “I Love Rock n’ Roll” by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, “Don’t Stop Believin” by Journey and “I Ran (So Far Away)” by Flock of Seagulls.</p>
<p>A lot of us (including my family) still didn’t have cable TV, and counted ourselves lucky if we had a friend who did. Barring that handy little switch-box, your televised entertainment choices usually consisted of three networks, one local PBS station, and one local ‘independent’ (which is where I found, and devoured, Saturday afternoon showings of <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, as well as endless reruns of <em>The Lone Ranger</em> and <em>Daniel Boone</em>). If you were really lucky, you might have a second independent that broadcast even weirder stuff than the first independent. In 1982, we lost <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, <em>In Search Of…</em>, and <em>Mork &amp; Mindy</em>, but we got <em>T. J. Hooker</em>, <em>Tales of the Gold Monkey</em>, and <em>Knight Rider</em> in trade. Saturday morning cartoons—<em>Thundarr the Barbarian, The Smurfs, Superfriends, Blackstar, The Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour</em>—were still interspersed with <em>School House Rock</em> clips—and most tantalizingly, with commercials for a toy-and-comic resurgence of everybody’s favorite action figure: G. I. Joe.</p>
<p>That’s right, 1982 was the year of <em>G. I. Joe: A Real American Hero</em>. The high-octane, animated commercials were repeated ad infinitum during Saturday Morning cartoons and had roughly the same effect on little Reaganomic America boys that fresh crack flakes have on a coke fiend just out of the county clink. The comic (if you could lay hands on the damn thing—it flew off the spin-racks at the local 7-11) told manly-man tales of covert ops and counter terrorism, while the toys themselves not only provided you with bio cards for each of the characters, they also told you exactly what sort of weapon the action figure came with. Many a gun fetish in my generation was probably born of a big, bad collection of G. I. Joe figures and paraphernalia.</p>
<p>That was also the year that the <em>Masters of the Universe</em> toyline debuted. Before ever there was a vaguely-homoerotic animated incarnation of He-Man, his dopy sidekick Orko, and a very whiny, very accident-prone Skeletor, we had an action figure franchise full of otherworldly heroes and villains sporting more muscle definition than a Boris Vallejo painting and more straps, gauntlets, swords and axes than your average Ace Paperback cover by Frank Frazetta. Adding to He-Man’s mystique was the fact that—unlike G. I. Joe—the world that He-Man and company inhabited seemed far more mysterious, far less fleshed out (at least until that damn cartoon came along). Consequently, an imaginative kid left alone in his room with his <em>Masters of the Universe</em> figures could build just about any mythology he wanted around those muscular, mysterious mannequins.</p>
<p>Being a little geek-in-training, mythology was a major concern of mine at the time. Not just the toy-world mythologies of G. I. Joe comics or Masters of the Universe toys—but also historical mythologies like those of the ancient Greeks (inspired by <em>Clash of the Titans</em>) and Arthurian legend (inspired by <em>Excalibur</em>), and fictional mythologies such as those undergirding seminal fantasy like <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, or Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories. This childhood fascination with mythology—remote worlds populated by heroes, gods, demigods and monsters—was further enriched (and enabled) by a little tabletop game known as <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>—which, in 1982, was at the height of its popularity (and infamy).</p>
<p>For those of you not in the know, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> was (and remains) a role-playing game wherein players act out the roles of fictional characters in the context of a quest or adventure (known as ‘campaigns’ in gamer-speak). It’s essentially make-believe, with rules; or, put another way, a kind of cooperative storytelling, where one person plays the role of narrator—the all-powerful, game-guiding Dungeon Master—while the other players adopt character roles and make important decisions at crucial moments in the narrative. If (for instance) your adventuring party comes across the gaping, ruined entrance to an underground crypt, do you delve in, or do you carry on through the forest above? If you go in, who goes first? And if the person who goes first springs a trap or finds themselves face to face with a monster, what do they do? Thus, a meandering tale unfolds, in which the Dungeon Master imparts the lay of the land, the players tell the Dungeon Master what their characters choose to do, and dice-rolls and percentile tables decide whether the actions taken are stunning successes or crushing (maybe even fatal) failures. Some people played out their adventures life-size, in real time, wearing costumes and cavorting about in various surroundings, from empty woods to unused school gymnasiums. This underground LARPing (live action role playing—a modern term but applicable here) and <em>D&amp;D’s</em> alleged reality-shattering, Satan-worship-inspiring hold on America’s children and teens inspired a 1982 made-for-TV movie called <em>Mazes &amp; Monsters</em>, starring the still-marginal Tom Hanks. Parental hysteria aside, most players kept things a little more grounded, eschewing the LARPing route in favor of reeling out their campaigns around kitchen or dining room tables, ingesting copious amounts of two-for-one pizza, Grape soda, and Chee-tos.</p>
<p>The dining room table in our house is where my big brother, Bryan, and his two best friends, Donald and Mike, did their campaigning (taking breaks between <em>D&amp;D</em> for rounds of <em>Risk</em>, <em>Stratego</em> or <em>Dark Tower</em>). Usually, I circled the table like a buzzard in search of roadkill, annoying the shit out of them until they let me create a character and play with them. Remember that scene in <em>E.T.</em> where Elliot keeps bugging Mike and his friends as they play a game at the kitchen table? Yeah, that was me. That scene could’ve easily been shot in our dining room. If they relented and let me in the game, they would usually kill me quickly (I was, conveniently, often the first into strange chambers or dark crypts). With my character speared by a Bugbear or dissolved by a Black Dragon’s acid breath, I would proceed to cry like a little girl and accuse them of doing it on purpose. Sure, they probably did, and I should’ve learned to just leave them alone… <em>but come on!</em> What precocious, annoying little brother <em>wouldn’t</em> rather play <em>D&amp;D</em> with big brother and his buddies instead of crashing Matchbox cars with the dopey kid down the street who smelled like beef vegetable soup? Despite my brother’s best attempts at chasing me away, though, I kept coming back, because <em>D&amp;D</em> was magical. It opened the door on all the stuff I might be doing alone in my room—creating characters, sending them on adventures, telling myself stories—but the collaborative group dynamic coupled with the logic matrix provided by the percentile tables and the rolling dice seemed to elevate simple make believe to something far more concrete… for more realistic and believable. I probably learned one of the great lessons of my life as a writer (especially a writer of the fantastic) at that dining room table: for the fantastical to be believed, there must be rules, and those rules must be adhered to.</p>
<p>But running through my memories of 1982, binding all the other disparate elements together like cable round a furled sail, were the movies. I didn’t realize it at the time, but 1982 was an absolutely insane year for geek cinema, chock full of films that made an impact on me at the time, or later, when I was finally old enough for my mom to let me watch them (gimme a break—we didn’t have cable or a VCR).</p>
<p>Although released stateside in December 1981, <em>The Road Warrior</em> effectively kicked off 1982, a bugnuts post-apocalyptic western where tricked-out S&amp;M hot rods replaced horses and Mel Gibson killed freakin’ <em>everything</em>, including crossbow-wielding dudes with mohawks and assless chaps. Along with <em>The Road Warrior</em> came <em>48 Hours</em> (the first buddy cop movie and Eddie Murphy’s screen debut), <em>Blade Runner</em> (a flop upon release, now recognized as a classic), <em>Cat People</em> (Kinsky, Kink, and David Bowie!), <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (still one of my all-time favorites, and the only grown up fantasy film until the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy came along), Conan’s agreeable but retarded cousins, <em>The Beastmaster</em> and <em>The Sword and the Sorcerer</em>, Stephen King’s and George Romero’s awesome horror comic anthology <em>Creepshow</em>, Jim Henson’s decidely un-Muppety trip-fest <em>The Dark Crystal</em>, the seminal <em>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</em>, <em>Firefox</em>, <em>First Blood</em> (which introduced us to an ass-kicking PTSD-afflicted Vietnam vet named John Rambo), <em>Friday the 13th Part III</em> (in 3-D!), <em>Halloween III: Season of the Witch</em> (which had nothing to do with Halloween I and II but made up for it with exploding heads), <em>Megaforce</em> (flying freakin’ motorcycles!), <em>Poltergeist</em> (because even sunny suburbs can have haunted houses), <em>Rocky III</em> (Eye of the tiger, Rock!), <em>The Secret of NIMH</em>, <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khaaaaaaan</em>, <em>Swamp Thing</em>, <em>Tron</em> (if only we knew how much CGI we’d have to put up with just a couple decades hence…), John Carpenter’s completely awesome remake of <em>The Thing</em>, and a little movie that came and went not with a bang, but a whimper: <em>E.T. The Extra Terrestrial</em>. Perhaps you’ve heard of it?</p>
<p>Yeah. Seriously. <em>That</em> was 1982 at the movies. I defy you to name another year when so many glorious, memorable, seminal, and just plain entertaining genre films graced multiplexes in this country. I loved every one of the movies listed above when I was a kid; I love at least a dozen of them still. <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> and <em>The Thing</em> remain two of my all-time favorites.</p>
<p>And this year, the movies listed above… the height of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons’</em> fame and infamy… the music… the toys… they’re all thirty goddamn years old. All these pieces of me, that I remember with such clarity and fondness, that seem like they were just yesterday… they’re nowhere near yesterday. They all came and went a really, really long time ago. And that just makes me feel <em>old</em>.</p>
<p>At least until I play Basil Poledouris’s brassy <em>Conan</em> score again. Then, I remember what is best in life… (which, if you didn’t know, is crushing your enemies, seeing them driven before you, and hearing the lamentation of their women. I can’t <em>believe</em> I had to tell you that…)</p>
<p>So, that’s where I was thirty years ago. That’s what 1982 meant to me. You’ve been gracious and frightfully indulgent as I took my gleeful wallow in memory’s slop trough, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p>Where were <em>you</em> in ’82?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">Not Another Mom Blog is a regular satirical feature exploring all the vital, life-saving, keeping-your-child-from-growing-old-alone advice out there. NAMB: Because every mother needs something else to worry about.</span> </em></p>
<p>Hey, I think breastfeeding is awesome. I breast fed, never even considered not breastfeeding, and I enjoyed doing it. Breast is the freakin’ best.</p>
<p>Good thing Mayor Bloomberg has finally realized this fact and is<a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mayor_knows_breast_WqU1iYRQvwbEkDuvn0vb1H?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local"> implementing some real change</a> in NYC hospitals. Moms have so many choices to make on the arrival of their little bundle. Cloth or disposable, infant or convertible seat, <a href="http://www.parentdish.com/2011/05/26/genderless-baby/">whether or not to use gender specific pronouns</a>…But there’s one choice mothers won’t have to make any more—bottle or breast!</p>
<p>Mayor Bloomberg, the world’s foremost expert on childhood nutrition, parenting, and health of all people in general, is also the father of <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-05-31/us/us_new-york-sugar-drinks_1_sugary-drinks-sugar-sweetened-beverages-obesity-issue?_s=PM:US">this program </a>that provides relief for those struggling with choosing soft drink sizes. Thankfully, size doesn’t matter with the <strong>Latch On NYC</strong> program. All sizes of formula will be kept under lock and key in special store rooms or prescription medication containers, to be signed out by registered nurses. It’s about time someone realized Enfamil should be a controlled substance. I mean, have you ever drunk that shiz?!</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. What if I have to put my baby in daycare in three weeks because I don’t have maternity leave? What if, due to infection, breastfeeding feels like sticking fire-hot pokers in my eyeballs? What if I take dangerous prescription medication? Don’t worry. Those are all myths.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! This regulation doesn’t stop at locking up the bottle. Call now and your order will include:</p>
<p><strong>More room for your giant maxi pads and epi foam</strong>—You know those pesky swag bags featuring the logos of formula companies? The ones with useless free stuff like bottle brushes and insulated cooler bags? Well, you won’t have to worry about how to pack that in your overnight bag anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Ad-free hospital stays</strong>—don’t you hate it when the nurse is leaning over you, and her Similac lanyard is all up in your face? Me too.</p>
<p><strong>Eight more hours of administration, totally free</strong>!—now you and your doctor will get to come up with a medical reason for every ounce of formula your newborn receives during your stay! Sharpen your creative thinking skills <em>and</em> reduce sleep time.</p>
<p><strong>Free lecture with every bottle</strong>—all your most creative medical excuse for your 2 ounces of formula will be matched with a totally awesome talking-to on how breast milk is better. Learn little-known benefits of breast milk, like how it makes your baby poop twenty-dollar bills!</p>
<p>Of course, the mayor knows that milk from a breast can only be drunk from a breast. A bottle is not a suitable conduit for the liquid gold that is breast milk. Drinking from a bottle turns your baby into a wuss, and will ensure that he never gets a date to prom. Thank God someone is finally doing something about this situation.  If I was 8 months pregnant right now, I’d be crossing my fingers to make it to September 3, 2012.</p>
<p><em>So seriously—what do you think about the Big Apple’s proposal?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ancient nerd-forum topic of which actors should play our favorite heroes seems to be re-energized now that Christopher Nolan&#8217; s Batman series has wrapped up.</p>
<p>His producer credit on Zack Snyder&#8217;s <em>Man of Steel</em>, and the Nightwing/Robin/Batman Jr tease of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, and the success of the laboriously hyped <em>Avengers</em> movie has convinced fanboys that a Justice League movie could finally happen.</p>
<p>Let me tell you: I have many thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler Warning</strong>: I think they should make an Alex Ross style old-man Superman movie and my casting selections are down below this wall of text arguing in favor of it.</p>
<p>In my moderately-informed opinion, the easiest way to distinguish DC Comics (redundant!) and Marvel Comics from each other is similar to the way Bernardo Bertolucci once qualified Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. He said you love Buster when you are younger, and you grow to prefer Charlie when you are older. (This came from an interview in Premiere magazine I read when he was releasing <em>The Dreamers</em>. I cannot find the interview online.)</p>
<div id="attachment_3516" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 339px"><a href="http://www.damian-blake.com/D.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-3516 " title="Chaplin_vs_Keaton_by_damianblake" src="http://dogmic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/chaplin_vs_keaton_by_damianblake.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chaplin vs Keaton by Damian Blake</p></div>
<p>I doubt I will ever love Charlie Chaplin nearly as much as I love Buster Keaton, but there&#8217;s an extremely apt bit of logic defending Berno Berto: Buster&#8217;s career was cut short, sold-out by his wife, and drowned in booze. Chaplin survived to make an older man&#8217;s movies, the 3-reelers of political merit. <em>Modern Times</em> and <em>The Great Dictator</em> are pictures that have no comparison in the oeuvre of Buster Keaton.</p>
<p>So I will steal Bertolucci&#8217;s frame: Marvel Comics are for young boys (Keatonesque) and DC Comics are for the boys who&#8217;ve grown up (Chaplinesque). Marvel&#8217;s stories focus on teenagers struggling with their powers as an analogue to puberty, and in so doing Peter Parker is cast as Buster Keaton, who simply does not have the opportunity to have stories to compare with A Death in the Family, The Killing Joke, and Crisis on Infinite Earths. Peter&#8217;s interminably <em>young</em>. Bruce is only young for a moment in time and then he is interminably <em>not young</em>.</p>
<p>See if you agree with my logic.</p>

<div id="attachment_3519" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 260px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3519 " title="Spider-Man_spider-bite" src="http://dogmic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/spider-man_spider-bite.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="366" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Exhibit M-A</p></div>
<p><em>sidebar: it&#8217;s difficult to find a single image that defines the origin of Marvel characters. Peter Parker stands out as the only easily-illustrated origin.</em></p>
<p>Since I cannot find images, I&#8217;ll just break it down for you Marvel-style. Peter Parker was a high school student when he had his run-in with radioactivity. The X-mutation takes hold during puberty. Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and Bruce Banner are characters that were <strong>full grown men</strong> before the incident that spawned their heroic careers. Thor is a god (boring).</p>
<p>The events that shaped Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne happened to them when they were <strong>very young and entirely defenseless</strong>.</p>
<p>Clark and Bruce have built their life around a response to something that happened before they could do anything, they&#8217;ve lived <em>singular</em> lives, much like the gods and aliens that fill out the Justice Society*. It almost doesn&#8217;t matter when they were born or when they are active. (In the Marvel universe, Thor and Wolverine fit this mold; one because he&#8217;s a god, the other because he&#8217;s a serial amnesiac.)</p>
<p>In short, the Marvel character arc can be summarized as &#8220;adapting to change&#8221; whereas the DC character arc can be summarized as &#8220;building to a purpose.&#8221; Too simplistic? Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>The problem Marvel has with longevity</strong> is that the nuanced characters lose their narrative drive <em>once they have adapted</em> to the change. Bruce Wayne can brood for decades about the murder of his parents, but you expect more out of Peter Parker. Please, let me know if you disagree.</p>
<p>I cite Joss Whedon&#8217;s <em>Astonishing X-Men</em>: the story belongs to Kitty Pryde, the rest were just given things to keep them busy. I love that series, but I do not want to keep seeing books about Wolverine and Beast fighting super-duper-aliens and mind-control.</p>
<p>Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and Aquaman don&#8217;t change. And that allows them to apply their talents/ideologies to many different eras. Marvel characters do change and that makes them 1) better characters and 2) worse products.</p>
<p>Even though I greatly prefer the nuanced characters of the Marvel universe, I&#8217;m less inclined to read redundant Marvel stories. DC has mastered redundancy as a business model.</p>
<p>All of this is to say: I don&#8217;t care about young Bruce, I don&#8217;t care about young Clark. They are personifications of values, not human characters. It makes them timeless and perhaps a little boring.</p>
<p>The world culture is now so self-aware, their simplistic values and old-world codes of honor don&#8217;t fit with the young man&#8217;s struggle to carve out his niche in his own generation. I&#8217;d like to see Batman and Superman cast as the older generation. Still tough, still brilliant, but with the wisdom of a collective consciousness, something that can only be earned together over time and after long reflection.</p>
<p>Let the Dog Mic forum commence. Here are my picks for casting with the actors&#8217; current ages.</p>
<p><a href="http://dogmic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/alexrossjla_cast.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3520" title="AlexRossJLA_cast" src="http://dogmic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/alexrossjla_cast.png" alt="" width="440" height="274" /></a></p>
<p>In the inimitable words (and caps) of <a href="http://fourcolorheroes.home.insightbb.com/killingjokescript.html">Alan Moore</a>: THE BATMAN IS BIG AND GRIM AND OLDER THAN WE ARE, BECAUSE AS I REMEMBER THE BATMAN HE&#8217;S ALWAYS BEEN BIGGER AND OLDER THAN I AM AND I&#8217;LL FIGHT ANY MAN THAT SAYS DIFFERENT.</p>
<p>*Arrow and Lantern and Flash were also full grown men when they became superheroes but they are the most vague characters in the DC universe. That is to say, there are four (4) Green Lanterns (plus an entire intergalactic GL Corps), there have been three (3) major Flashes, and I honestly cannot figure out where they hell Green Arrow came from or why he does what he does. One thing that stands out is that I never think of any of them as young men.</p>
