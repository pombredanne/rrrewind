<p>These photographs document a trekking and 4&#215;4 journey through the Western Desert of Egypt. Starting at Bahariya Oasis we travelled through the Sahara Suda (Black Desert) and Sahara Beida (White Desert) ending up near Farafra. As a compliment to these images I produced a second, more abstract series of photographs entitled<a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/2013/03/18/sahara-sands/"> &#8220;Sahara Sands&#8221; </a>from the same trip.</p>
<p>The journey was undertaken with desert explorer <a href="http://www.sam-mcconnell-expeditions.com">Sam McConnell</a> who runs highly recommended adventure travel expeditions to the region in collaboration with Abou Anis of Sub Sinai, off-road driver Khaled, and the bedouin of Bahariya Oasis</p>
<p><strong>Signed limited edition prints of this series are available at £195 each (60x40cm). To purchase please <a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/contact/">contact me</a>. Larger sizes also available</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Only a beautiful city can repair a broken heart. After having been turned away from my alma mater and missing the opportunity to bid my students adieu and congratulate them on successfully completing high school, I took my loneliness out for a walk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As usual, most of the crying was done on the train and by the time I reached the last station upon which I was to alight, I wasn&#8217;t sure if coming all this way was worth the effort. I risked disappointment and foreignness and being in a city that was so cruel to so many of its inhabitants. I boarded a jeepney, wary and out of sorts&#8211;but somehow, Manila embraced me in a way I didn&#8217;t ever think possible&#8211;especially in broad daylight, when the city itself showed its own scars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There we were, two vulnerable souls, each seeking refuge in the other. Thank you, Manila, for your quiet streets filled with birdsongs and bridges that lead me back to myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_1992" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01347.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992" alt="The Manila Post Office seen from Jones Bridge by way of jeepney." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01347.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Manila Post Office seen from Jones Bridge by way of jeepney.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My grandparents met at the Post Office when they were younger and that&#8217;s when my  grandfather claims to have noticed this beautiful, shy woman who would later become his wife. When I see this building, I miss them a lot and I remember the many times we drove past this bridge when they were still alive. They would brighten up at the sight of this building&#8211;even in their late eighties.</p>
<div id="attachment_1993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01348.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993" alt="Manila Cathedral" src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01348.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Manila Cathedral seen from its side.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You walk along these streets and you remember for a moment that once upon a time, Manila was the Pearl of the Orient. Its architecture and its people were cosmopolitan and though today we&#8217;re wont to say that this feels a lot like another place, I&#8217;ve finally come to be proven wrong. This is exactly what Manila ought to feel like&#8211;beautiful, opulent and still, very much our own. The ambulance was also a dead give-away of my state of mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_1994" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01349.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994" alt="Manila. " src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01349.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the older buildings in Intramuros that&#8217;s fenced and appears ready for demolition.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The birds sing loudest in empty spaces where the threat of man is so remote. They don&#8217;t sing sad songs and I love that when I was lonely, an even lonelier building cheered me up because of the life it allowed to flourish within itself. Reminds me of the true meaning of giving. Assuming the edifice felt anything, it would long to be whole again, to be used&#8211;but instead, it is seemingly at peace, giving birds a place to live, a place to sing. No matter how sweet the song, the birds can never repay the building&#8211;kindness without a cost.</p>
<div id="attachment_1995" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01355.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995" alt="San Agustin Church seen from the Ristorante delle Mitre." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01355.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a class="zem_slink" title="San Agustin Church, Manila" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Agustin_Church%2C_Manila" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">San Agustin Church</a> seen from the Ristorante delle Mitre.</p></div>
<p>The food was wonderful. It&#8217;s the kind of home-cooked set of meals you hope to arrive at after taking your loneliness for a walk. From across the table where I sat, I could see the San Agustin Church and I still recall the many field trips and school visits we would have that had this lot as our marker.</p>
<div id="attachment_1996" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01384.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996" alt="The former Philippine Constabulary." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01384.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The former Philippine Constabulary.</p></div>
<p>Set against the backdrop of Cumulus clouds at sunset and paired with the moon looking over us all, this scene was quite dramatic. I had come to witness some theater based on historical events&#8230;more on that next time but for now, this. How could any theater outdo this sky?</p>
<div id="attachment_1997" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01392.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997" alt="San Agustin Church at nightfall. " src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01392.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">San Agustin Church at nightfall.</p></div>
<p>It was Palm Sunday, after all. I had waited months for this day to come, for a completely different set of reasons. I was excited for my young ones&#8211;as I still am&#8211;but instead got served a heavy dollop of disappointment. Regardless, perhaps more than the joy of commencement, something can be said about going back home?</p>
<p>I knew my Holy Week would be meaningful when I found myself in San Agustin, attending mass spontaneously. Sometimes the Spirit calls and I don&#8217;t listen as much as I ought to&#8211;but as always, instead of punishing me, I am just led back home when I am most broken.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://xomariee.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-social-media-activism.jpg" width="100%" class="alignnone" /></p>
<p>Maharashtra is worst hit with <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/03/25/western-india-hopes-for-rain/" target="_blank">drought</a> this year since 1972 as 13 out of 35 districts are facing acute shortage of water. The situation in Vidarbha and Marathwada is dire. People don&#8217;t have enough water to drink. Every village is not lucky enough to get water tankers on time. It won&#8217;t be long before we start hearing reports of cattle and even people dying due to lack of water.</p>
<p>This has created ripples in the urban areas of Maharashtra, such as Mumbai and Pune, especially in the digital arena. People have decided to show solidarity with the drought-hit region by not wasting water in the festival of Holi. They are urging other people to play &#8216;dry Holi&#8217; through Facebook statuses, tweets and WhatsApp messages. Even celebrities have <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/03/26/celebrities-call-for-dry-holi-amid-drought/" target="_blank">joined the chorus</a>. This has generated a fair amount discussion about the issue on various social media forums and even off these platforms; and most of the people have agreed to the pledge of not wasting water.</p>
<p>But there are some dissenting voices too, who like to call this whole exercise tokenism. According to them, this digital activism farce is not going to change anything. It doesn&#8217;t take much efforts to post a comment or share or like a post (a post can be a text message, an image, a link to an article, a video, etc.) and most of these clicks are half-hearted. According to them, this is not activism, but <a href="http://www.cracked.com/funny-6978-slacktivism/" target="_blank">slacktivism</a>. (Read this New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all" target="_blank">piece</a> by celebrated author Malcolm Gladwell, which made this argument famous).</p>
<p>I disagree. Participants in digital activism are mostly students and young professionals. If they did not have an outlet like social media, what other options would they have? Rallies, protest marches, hunger  strikes, public gatherings or distributing pamphlets on the railway platforms? How many of the participants could give either their time or efforts for such activities, balancing college or workplace commitments? Is it fair to expect them to become full-fledged activists? Social activists have their own commitments and resources and they are fighting their own battles somewhere else. But does that mean, we, normal citizens can&#8217;t play any role in changing our society?</p>
<p>Calling digital activism slacktivism is outright derogatory. Though it basically tries to ridicule netizens who participate in such campaigns as lazy, it also unconsciously assumes that digital sphere is a separate entity. Nathan Jurgenson terms this argument digital dualism (you can read his critique on digital dualism <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/" target="_blank">here</a>). I am a staunch opponent of digital dualism, as it bifurcates digital and physical into two different worlds. It makes us believe that there is no interplay between the two, while I believe that they are enmeshed and affect each other&#8217;s behaviour.</p>
<p>People who participate in digital campaigns are not serious activists, but that does not mean they do not care about the society. They may not have studied the issues they are talking about thoroughly. Their solutions to the problems may be half-baked. But their intentions and the desire to do something meaningful is very genuine. And I believe, some of these very people are going to be tomorrow&#8217;s Medha Patkars, Arundhati Roys and Harsh Manders.</p>
<p>The major benefit of digital campaigns is that they create awareness about the issues they are espousing. The movement that emerged after Delhi Gang Rape is a case in point. Now we are at a better understanding as a society as far as women rights, violence against women and sexism is concerned than before and internet played a major role in this. Even the dry Holi campaign will not give water to the people suffering from drought, but it has at least brought their plight in limelight. I consider it a valuable contribution to the cause. (Here is an <a href="http://www.meta-activism.org/2012/02/digital-activism-101-the-5-activist-functions-of-technology/" target="_blank">article</a> which lists five other functions new technology plays in activism).</p>
<p>Internet offers a lot of resources to study a particular issue. Everybody who likes a post on Facebook about saving water on Holi will not go and read about <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/how-the-other-half-dries/article4456130.ece" target="_blank">drought in Maharshtra</a> in another tab, but there will be a small bunch of people who will. This small bunch mostly consists of people who are influencers and leaders in their own way, as they shape the opinions and lead the debates in their own circles. And I am banking on these people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m writing in response to Word Press’ Daily Post Writing Challenge about “<a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/writing-challenge-government/">The State of the State.</a>” The question was posted today, March 25th, “Where do <em>you</em> draw the line between a reasonable government attempt to maintain stability or solve a problem and an unnecessary infringement on your decisions?”</p>
<p>Interesting question; this is right up my alley.</p>
<p>NYC Soda Ban: preposterous. I cannot and will not support a nanny state mentality.</p>
<p>When you look at ordinances like the large soda ban in New York City, what do you think? Do you honestly think that the government cares about you individually, or do you think that perhaps there is an exertion of power beyond the limits of the functionality of a successful government? I think the latter. If the NYC government, with bologna Bloomberg at its helm, honestly cared about the health of each citizen of the city of New York, it/he would not focus on the menial task of banning sodas. That’s child’s play. It is so condescending and offensive to assume that people do not have enough self-control to regulate the amount of sugary beverage they intake in any given setting. Maybe some people cannot exercise that self-control as well as others, but it is not the role of the government to go around telling those with health issues how much they can or cannot consume at any given time&#8211; just as your parents no longer have control over minor decisions such as these in your life once you are over a certain age. Did Bloomberg just adopt 9 million children? Sure seems like he wants to.</p>
<p><i>Please</i> give the people education. That is far more important. Nutritional education would go a lot farther than banning a large soda. Lifestyle modification is what a lot of people need, not a quick fix substance ban. People who struggle with obesity or food and beverage self-control do not need someone breathing down their neck and demanding that they take measures to change. These people need encouragement and support, and a system to guide them to choose better options on their own. Rarely do people adhere to regulations forced upon them, but those who decide for themselves to make healthier choices are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Do I think that the government should play a role in education? Yes, to a certain extent. I think that Bloomberg’s efforts to curb the obesity epidemic in his small corner of the world would see better results if he were able to offer some kind of city-funded nutritional program, or some kind of reimbursement for a lifestyle modification program such as the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program, which is hosted at local YMCAs or other community centers throughout the city. Not only are programs such as these proven to better the health status of individuals who commit to them, but individuals enter these programs as a matter of personal choice. You see, people must make their own decision to change; Michael Bloomberg (or any government) cannot make that decision for them by punishing them like foolish schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Is the government overstepping boundaries by taking away a person’s choice in beverage? Absolutely, unequivocally, resounding YES. Would society be better off if the government offered the choice of education, which provides resources for people who need to make lifestyle changes? Oh yes. Please do not undermine the ability of a human being to make an educated decision when he is given the tools to do so. And do not underestimate the power of the resources that are already available and underutilized to help those in need make the decisions for a healthier life.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloomberg, back off of the rights of the people of New York City.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p dir="ltr"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/IQ-OtEdFAKI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am your child’s teacher.  My role as educator extends far beyond the walls of my classroom.  It is my profession, what I practice.   I have chosen to devote the better part of what will be <em>the years that make up my life </em>to educating your child. I take it very seriously and I should; I am a stakeholder in <em>your</em> child’s future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And so are you. You take it seriously also.  You take your role in your child’s life more seriously than probably anyone else ever will.  You have spent countless hours modeling empathy and kindness, teaching right from wrong, helping your child learn how to navigate through an increasingly complicated world and spending time to understand who your child is and where he/she is coming from.   You do this in order to help guide your child down the path to who he/she will become.  So I ask you, taking all of this into consideration, how willing would you be to allow some other parent to take over this role for you &#8211;someone who claimed to know “better” than you about what was right for your child?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Think about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because that is what is happening in my classroom.  And it isn’t because they know “better” than I do how to educate your child &#8211;<em>the undertaking I have chosen to devote my life’s work to becoming better at doing.</em>  It certainly isn’t because they have spent months getting to know the individual you have raised in an effort to better understand what your student needs to thrive in a responsive learning environment.  It has nothing to do with the relationship they have formed with your child in order to show respect and care for him/her as a person and as a learner.  It doesn’t, for a second, reflect the passion I have for the subject I teach &#8211;passion that I pass on to your student in every way I can and at every chance I get.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It simply has to do with money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has to do with the $500 billion dollars allocated by the United States government to children like yours.  Your money.  Tax-payer money intended to directly benefit students. Money that is being hijacked by for-profit educational management companies.  The same people who are using their voices to belittle me and my colleagues, and our schools, and <em>your</em> child’s performance, in order to rationalize their hidden agenda: making money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They are spending their own money too.  They are using it to pay lobbyists who help manipulate educational policy and dictate allocation of resources towards private companies&#8230; and it is working.  The $13 million dollars they had their hands on in 2005 had already risen to $389 million by 2011.  Don&#8217;t mistake it: there exists big profit potential in your child.  Three hundred and eighty-nine million dollars&#8230;and that was two years ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So <em>today</em> I ask you this:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>My life’s work.</em>  The countless hours I spend with your child presenting new material, creating on-going formative assessments that are authentic and based on your student’s individual needs at a given moment in time, the active learning and knowledge-construction happening in my classroom on a daily basis, the time I spend creating lessons which require students to build upon and re-evaluate prior knowledge and the work that reflects the relationship that I have worked diligently to foster with your student:  is it worth putting all of this hard-won expertise on the back-burner so that someone can divert money intended for <em>your</em> child?</p>
<p>The person your child is and how he/she learns and grows cannot be gauged by an answer bubbled onto a sheet of paper.  Your student deserves my full expertise, not a narrowed curriculum and hours devoted to my teaching to the test.  My colleagues and I deserve to be freed from the negative impact that the calculated teacher-bashing and union-bashing is having on our profession&#8230;because it is calculated, and by this point I don&#8217;t think I need to tell you by whom.</p>
<p>So please, educate yourself.  Have a voice in this issue.  Talk to teachers and administrators about what is happening in your child&#8217;s school as a result of America&#8217;s education reform; support teachers you know are there for your student; question media reports that claim there is a simple answer to so-called underperformance; and be aware of what is happening on a local and national level.  It is affecting <em>your</em> student . . . and it isn&#8217;t going away any time soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christine McCartney</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s writing challenge was so delightfully juicy that I couldn&#8217;t afford to pass it up. I could write pages upon pages about this topic, including my flirtation with libertarianism and then my subsequent falling out.</p>
<p>But if any topic made the most sense it would be about the government&#8217;s role in autistic rights.</p>
<p><span id="more-6012"></span></p>
<p><strong>Ableism Lives</strong></p>
<p>It may be surprising, but autistic people don&#8217;t have large groups that will vouch for them. Many of the groups that are purported to be advocates of those with autism are more interested in curing autism than accepting those who have it.</p>
<p>Autism Speaks for example, views autism as a disease and has focused a large amount on researching the former notion of vaccines having a connection. This was discredited in what was known as the &#8220;autism omnibus trial&#8221;.</p>
<p>The prejudice I spoke of in earlier posts, ableism, still exists. In some ways, it is has grown. I was strolling around Facebook when one of my friends sent me this image:</p>
<p><a href="http://eyesthroughtheglass.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/disability-rights.png"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-6040" alt="Image" src="http://eyesthroughtheglass.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/disability-rights.png?w=350" /></a></p>
<p>Recently, a gay teen with Asperger&#8217;s was<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/23/steven-simpson-gay-teen-burned-birthday-_n_2939092.html"> burned to death</a> at his own birthday party after being covered with tanning oil.  Anti-gay messages such as &#8220;I love dick&#8221; and &#8220;gay boy&#8221; were scrawled all over his body.</p>
<p>This also highlights a chilling intersection between the prejudices between those with Asperger&#8217;s and homosexuals.</p>
<p>And as in my case, I have not only been marginalized by my peers, but by my <a href="http://eyesthroughtheglass.com/2013/02/24/exodus-part-one/">own</a> <a href="http://eyesthroughtheglass.com/2013/02/25/exodus-part-two/">family</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A Source of Relief</strong></p>
<p>But of course, one may wonder what relevance this has to the government. That relevance lies in the fact that the government is really the only consistent form of assistance for us. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s certainly preferable to our treatment elsewhere.</p>
<p>In high school, it was not the benevolence of my private high school that allowed me success. It was the accommodation of my public high school.</p>
<p>In college, I was equally left to sink or swim in a system built for the mainstream. I had no anchors, and I came out miserably. Rest assured, I&#8217;m going to a school that takes much greater steps to accommodate.</p>
<p><strong>On Our Behalf</strong></p>
<p>It is heavily embedded in the American consciousness that the government exists primarily as an obstacle to greater individual success. I disagree with this notion.</p>
<p>I am not naive. I understand the shortcomings and problems within our government. However, I&#8217;d like to call attention to the fact that it is often forgotten that government has acted and can act on behalf of the compromised.</p>
<p> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to become a teacher a college student is subjected to many well-meaning professors of education who fill the prospective instructor with all types of theorems and philosophies, ways of writing objectives and best-practice research.   And while I felt equipped by my education program to navigate the world of adolescents in the classroom, no classroom teacher ever taught me more about kids than what I learned from a free-spirited, ex-hippie professor I had in grad school named Nancy Spejcher.</p>
<p>As far as professors go, she was about as far away from the wire-rimmed-glasses/leather-patch-on-the-blazer stereotype as one end of the rainbow is from the other.  She often eschewed the status quo, especially if toeing the company ever got in the way of caring for kids.  Quite simply she loved on kids in a way that sure inspired and challenged teachers.  One nugget of wisdom from her mouth has stuck with me, some eleven years later:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;<em>Everyone is dancing the best dance that he or she can.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>To buy in to this philosophy is to choose to think the best of kids, to extend grace in a way that they are not used to getting.  It means to drop the rocks of condemnation and use those arms to embrace. It means to refuse to snidely  pass judgment on the boy whose missing assignments are more routine than the morning newspaper.   To believe that the girl with the chip on her shoulder <em>is</em> truly dancing her best dance, instead of simply trying to bait me into the ring every day. To understand that maybe there&#8217;s a reason behind someone&#8217;s lack of productivity, and it&#8217;s not just pure laziness;  it&#8217;s because navigating a harrowing home-life requires just about every ounce of energy he can muster.</p>
<div id="attachment_1130" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdunitz/5103378512/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1130" alt="Photo by Claudia Crane, Creative Commons" src="http://writeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tap-shoes-2.jpg?w=529&#038;h=705" width="529" height="705" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Claudia Crane, Creative Commons</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to like the kids who are perfect, the kids whose educational pirouettes look sublime. What about the kid whose face comes to class with a permanent scowl?  Understanding that he&#8217;s dancing the best dance that he can might mean seeing that even his silent brooding in class is a lot better rumba than a spew of vitriol from his lips.</p>
<p>Granted, such an approach doesn&#8217;t merely tolerate everyone&#8217;s shortcomings with a pursed-lips pout of resignation.  No matter how spirited the waltz, improvement is always possible, especially if someone notices the dance and is willing to lead.  To believe in that possibility, to imagine the possibility of change, is to be fully human.  To join a student in the dance of life and lead him or her towards a new tomorrow is why teaching is a priceless endeavor.</p>
<div id="attachment_169" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://writeproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/girls-dancing1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-169" alt="Even with my own kids, I need to realize they're dancing with everything they've got. " src="http://writeproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/girls-dancing1.jpg?w=529&#038;h=350" width="529" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Even with my own kids, I need to realize they&#8217;re dancing with everything they&#8217;ve got.</p></div>
<p>Imagine what would happen if you approached everyone in your family or your office the same way.  Remember, it&#8217;s not about just summoning super-human levels of patience to deal with all the difficult people in your life.  It&#8217;s about giving the benefit of the doubt daily.  Maybe Janice from accounting&#8217;s constant negativity is enough to make you scratch the veneer off your desk . . . with your teeth.  Realizing that there&#8217;s more below the surface and that she&#8217;s dancing the best dance that she can might just give you the grace to lend a hand instead of throwing a stone.</p>
<p>Doing so might just make your change your own cha-cha.</p>
<p><em><strong>How could realizing this truth about people change your life today?  Who do you need to show a little more grace towards?</strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Preservation of a body is an interesting phenomenon, whether it be the evanescent embalming at a funeral home to prevent the body from decaying at the wake, or preservation for hundreds of years as is the case with Rosalia Lombardo in the Palermo catacombs. Embalming is a three-fold process of sanitation, presentation and presentation.
