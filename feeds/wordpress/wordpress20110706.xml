			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="DSCF0525 by Smallest Forest, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/book_wallah/5896593056/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5039/5896593056_2665c1618b_z.jpg" alt="DSCF0525" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>A very old, traditional way of transferring an embroidery design to fabric is by drawing the design on very fragile paper, basting it to the ground fabric, and then stitching the design with a running stitch through both paper and fabric. When the whole design has been outlined, the paper is gently torn away. This isn&#8217;t a how-to, by the way&#8230;it&#8217;s probably more like a how-not-to.</p>
<p>I tried this method the other day. I don&#8217;t know why I did—I already have <a title="The Feast of The Immaculate Embroidery" href="http://smallestforest.net/2010/02/10/httpwp-mepeep9-6u/" target="_blank">my preferred technique for transferring a design</a> to fabric that is clean, precise, and reliable—but I guess it all boils down to laziness and impatience. Didn&#8217;t feel like tracing the design to interfacing that night, didn&#8217;t feel like reversing the drawing, either. I just wanted to start stitching right away, so I plunked the drawing (of my camera) on top of some brown linen, and basted it down.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not disparaging this method&#8230;it&#8217;s been used for centuries by some of the greatest embroidering cultures of the world (<a title="Historical Chinese embroidery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_embroidery" target="_blank">Chinese</a>, <a title="Kurenai-kai School of Japanese embroidery" href="http://www.kurenai-kai.jp/" target="_blank">Japanese</a>, Indian) so it obviously works, and that it proves a little difficult is more likely the fault of the practitioner than the method.</p>
<p>The design moved a bit as I stitched&#8230;I found that by stitching down a large part on one side of the design, the paper would warp a bit between the stitched and unstitched parts. Very possibly because of the poor basting job I did!</p>
<p>Sometimes, a very short stitch would tear the bit of paper underneath it, so that the stitch would disappear beneath the paper, and often I couldn&#8217;t tell whether I&#8217;d stitched that part or not, and so had to push the paper aside with the tip of the needle to see whether there already was a stitch there.</p>
<p>I used a backstitch, rather than a running stitch, and found that because I couldn&#8217;t actually see the fabric, my lines weren&#8217;t always straight, my stitches didn&#8217;t always line up end-to-end. This little bit of crookedness didn&#8217;t bother me for most of the design, but for the little letters at the top of the camera, little gaps and crooked stitches did matter&#8230;</p>
<p>None of which compared with the annoyance of removing the paper, afterward. I didn&#8217;t mind the slow job of gently tearing paper away in small pieces, or having to pick dandruff-like fragments that were stuck underneath the stitches with a pair of tweezers. What really bugged me was how, no matter how gently one worked, the job of pulling the paper bits out would sometimes yank on the stitching, loosening it and creating loopy bits of thread&#8230;in some cases, when the part pulled on was the end of a thread, the bitter end would come popping up to the surface of the fabric—after I had so carefully woven these loose ends into the stitches on the back of the fabric, because I don&#8217;t use knots.</p>
<p><a title="DSCF0528 by Smallest Forest, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/book_wallah/5896593254/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5034/5896593254_c12a7dd3f0_z.jpg" alt="DSCF0528" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>It came out all right in the end, I won&#8217;t have to repeat the whole thing, though I must say the thread looked a bit scruffy and fluffy after all that, and the lines have a slight jitter to them, and some of the stitches are so loose that from the side they look like terry cloth. <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  Not really, but you know what I mean. And I don&#8217;t know if it really allowed me to start embroidering sooner&#8230;I was still picking bits of paper out with a pair of tweezers this morning.</p>
<p>The verdict? It works, and in a pinch (in a granite hut, in a remote rural area of Szechuan Province, during the Warring States Period) it&#8217;ll do the job admirably. It certainly isn&#8217;t an excuse for the subsequent embroidery to be poor—marvelous work has been done using just this method of transferral to first mark the fabric.</p>
<p>But there are so many more precise ways to do this, now, and I think any transfer pen or transfer paper, iron-on, or print-on method would be preferable.</p>
<p>Experiment over, I started stitching today. Had an intense craving for shades of green (I can crave certain colors the way others crave salt, or chocolate. For the next 48 hours I&#8217;ll probably be all &#8220;Green is my favorite color EVER!&#8221; And then I will drop it, fickle and unfaithful, and declare an all-time-high of passion for ecru. But right now, I am loving this Kermit the Camera.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ve spent the past week at the <a href="http://www.ilabliberia.com/">iLab in Liberia</a> and got what I came for: an updated reality check on the limitations of technology adoption in developing countries. Below are some of the assumptions that I took for granted. They&#8217;re perfectly obvious in hindsight and I&#8217;m annoyed at myself for not having realized their obviousness sooner. I&#8217;d be very interested in hearing from others about these and reading their lists. This need not be limited to one particular sector like ICT for Development (ICT4D) or Mobile Health (mHealth). Many of these assumptions have repercussions across multiple disciplines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following examples come from conversations with my colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kenyakate">Kate Cummings</a> who directs <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/?s=liberia&amp;submit_button=Search">Ushahidi Liberia</a> and the iLab here in Monrovia. She and her truly outstanding team—<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=106539580&amp;goback=%2Enpe_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1%2Enpc_15108329_*1_*1_*1">Kpetermeni Siakor</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=76406461&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=V-3r&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=f7878455-12f0-4ad8-8aac-f283e354c98a-0&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=23&amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_Carter+Draper_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2&amp;pvs=ps&amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link">Carter Draper</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=53120061&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=hyA8&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=a234d6a0-86b8-4269-812f-e4816ef3a987-0&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=2&amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_Luther+Jeke_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2&amp;pvs=ps&amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link">Luther Jeke</a> and Anthony Kamah—spearheaded a number of excellent training workshops over the past few days. At one point we began discussing the reasons for the limited use of SMS in Liberia. There are the usual and obvious reasons. But the one hurdle I had not expected to hear was Nokia&#8217;s predictive text functionality. This feature is incredibly helpful since the mobile phone basically guesses which words you&#8217;re trying to write so you don&#8217;t have to type every single letter.</p>
<p><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/nokia-old-phone.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5633 aligncenter" title="nokia-old-phone" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/nokia-old-phone.jpg?w=450&#038;h=600" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as soon as she pointed out how confusing this can be, I immediately understood what she meant. If I had never seen or been warned about this feature before, I&#8217;d honestly think the phone was broken. It would really be impossible to type with. I&#8217;d get frustrated and give up (the tiny screen further adds to the frustration). And if I was new to mobile phones, it wouldn&#8217;t be obvious how to switch that feature off either. (There are several tutorials online on how to use the predictive text feature and how to turn it off, which clearly proves they&#8217;re not intuitive).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the training workshops we just had, I was explaining what <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">Walking Papers</a> was about and how it might be useful in Liberia. So I showed the example below and continued talking. But Kate jumped in and asked participants: &#8220;What do you see in this picture? Do you see the trees, the little roads?&#8221; She pointed at the features as she described the individual shapes. This is when it finally dawned on me that there is absolutely nothing inherently intuitive about satellite images. Most people on this planet have not been on an airplane or a tall building. So why would a bird&#8217;s eye view of their village be anything remotely recognizable? I really kicked myself on that one. So I&#8217;ll write it again: there is nothing intuitive about satellite imagery. Nor is there anything intuitive about GPS and the existence of a latitude and longitude coordinate system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/walkingpapers.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5634" title="walkingpapers" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/walkingpapers.png?w=500&#038;h=370" alt="" width="500" height="370" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kate went on to explain that this kind of picture is what you would see if you were flying high like a bird. That was the way I should have introduced the image but I had taken it completely for granted that satellite imagery was self-explanatory when it simply isn&#8217;t. I really kicked myself on that one. In further conversations with Kate, she explained that they too had made that assumption early on when trying to introduce the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of the <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi platform</a>. They quickly realized that they had to rethink their approach and decided to provide introductory courses on Google Maps instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More wrong assumptions revealed themselves during these courses. For example, the &#8220;+&#8221; and &#8220;-&#8221; markers on the map are not intuitive either nor is the concept of zooming in and out. How are you supposed to understand that pressing these buttons still shows the same map but at a different scale and not an entirely different picture instead? Again, when I took a moment to think about this, I realized again how completely confusing that could be. And again I kicked myself. But contrast this to an entirely different setting, San Francisco, where some friends recently told me how their five year old went up to a framed picture in their living room and started pinching at it with his fingers, the exact same gestures one would use on an iPhone to zoom in and out of a picture. &#8220;Broken, broken&#8221; is all the five year old said after that disappointing experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://irevolution.net/2011/06/26/wrong-assumptions-tech/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KZP9C2Zsl2c/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final example actually comes from Haiti where my colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrissiy">Chrissy Martin</a> is one of the main drivers behind the <a href="www.digicelgroup.com/.../mobile-money-service-comes-to-haiti-with-tchotcho-mobile-from-digicel-and-scotiabank">Digicel Group&#8217;s mobile banking efforts</a> in the country. There were of course a number of expected challenges on the road to launching Haiti&#8217;s first successful mobile banking service, TchoTcho Mobile. The hurdle that I had not expected, however, had to do with the pin code. To use the service, you would enter your own personal pin number on your mobile phone in order to access your account. Seems perfectly straight forward. But it really isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of a pin number is one that many of us take completely for granted. But the idea is often foreign to many would-be users of mobile banking services and not just in Haiti. Just think about it: all one has to do to access my money is to simply enter four numbers on my phone. That does genuinely sound crazy to me at a certain level. Granted, if you guess the pin wrong three times, the phone gets blocked and you have to call TchoTcho&#8217;s customer service. But still, I can understand the initial hesitation that many users had. When I asked Chrissy how they overcame the hurdle, her answer was simply this: training. It takes time for users to begin trusting a completely new technology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are some of the assumptions I&#8217;ve gotten wrong. I&#8217;d be grateful if readers could share theirs as there must be plenty of other assumptions I&#8217;m making which don&#8217;t fit reality. Incidentally, I realize that emerging economies vary widely in technology diffusion and adoption—not to mention sub-nationally as well. This is why having the iLab in Liberia is so important. Identifying which assumptions are wrong in more challenging environments is really important if our goal is to use technology to help contribute meaningfully to a community&#8217;s empowerment, development and independence.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garage4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249" title="garage4" src="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garage4.jpg?w=490&#038;h=346" alt="" width="490" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>First, let me apologize for being away for so long. Between my eldest&#8217;s elementary graduation and then getting her off to camp and the general insanity that comes with end of school/beginning of summer &#8211; let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s been crazy here.</p>
<p><a href="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garagesale1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-250" title="garagesale1" src="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garagesale1.jpg?w=490&#038;h=495" alt="" width="490" height="495" /></a></p>
<p>So &#8211; I had my garage sale. And it went really well. Yes, I made some money and cleared out a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s been taking up so much space in our home. Most importantly, I didn&#8217;t have a nervous breakdown. For those of us that really don&#8217;t enjoy having strangers sift through our belongings, that&#8217;s HUGE.</p>
<p>There are many many places on the internet that will give you all sorts of tips on how to prepare, organize and promote your garage sale. I looked at a lot of them. And they were all helpful. But. (Doesn&#8217;t Dr. Phil say that when you say &#8220;but&#8221; you negate everything that came before it? I think so. That&#8217;s not my intention.) I think there are some things that those articles don&#8217;t quite cover. For example, how DO you deal with the creepy guy strolling around your garage holding one sundae glass? For thirty minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garagesale3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252" title="garagesale3" src="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garagesale3.jpg?w=490&#038;h=504" alt="" width="490" height="504" /></a><a href="http://realistmom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/garagesale2.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Allow me to present <strong>Realist Mom&#8217;s Garage Sale Tips</strong>:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Be ready to let the stuff go.</strong> This is important. If you&#8217;re not quite sure whether you&#8217;re ready to get rid of Aunt Fanny&#8217;s old skillet &#8211; do not put it out there. It will only make you crazy and upset. And you&#8217;ll secretly dislike anyone who even picks it up.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do not, I repeat do not have a garage sale a few days before another momentous event in your life.</strong> Or just after. Going through my daughter&#8217;s baby and toddler clothes just before she graduated was a bad idea. I was sobbing into the Rubbermaid bins. It also took me twice as long to sort through things because I was hugging almost every garment. And, if you really must know, I snatched a pair of socks out of the hand of a woman who was preparing to buy them. What? They were Kitty&#8217;s favorite socks &#8211; see rule #1.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Some people suck.</strong> But most people do not. I met some really nice people who were reasonable and fair as we haggled over prices. Then there were a handful of people who I would have liked to smack upside the head. Here&#8217;s a tip for buyers &#8211; don&#8217;t talk smack about me <em>when you&#8217;re standing in my garage</em>. It&#8217;s not going to encourage me to sell you that worn-once $80 girl&#8217;s party dress for 50 cents. It <em>will</em> make me want to dump my coffee on your head, though. And yes, that really happened. Except for the coffee. And then this lovely specimen of humanity proceeded to yell at me as she pulled away from the curb. Okaaaaayy.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Know your bottom line. </strong>Know the least you&#8217;re willing to accept for an item. You may find that you&#8217;d rather donate an item then allow yourself to be pushed into selling it for next-to-nothing. My husband is an avid reader. That&#8217;s his treat to himself: books. So, we had a lot of really current, like new books at the sale. It turned out, I would rather donate those books to my library rather than sell them to the woman who advised me that &#8220;at garage sales, people sell their hardcovers for $1, not $3. (Insert look of disgust here.)&#8221; On the other hand, I was okay with going way down on the price of some of the kids&#8217; clothing.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Do not let people push you around.</strong> This is sort of an addendum to my previous tip. People can be a little bananas. I think there are people who wear their aggressive bargaining skills like a badge of honor. My grandmother was like that. She would talk the grocery clerk into giving her two free packages of cookies instead of one on senior citizen day and then would brag about it the rest of the week. I could write pages on some of the tactics people tried to get better deals. Some were really effective, some less so and some &#8211; just plain offensive. Telling me you&#8217;re buying the clothes to help out a family on your street that doesn&#8217;t have much = effective. Trying to get me to lower a price because you&#8217;re not sure if the wall hanging will look good in your house = less effective. Trying to hide a more &#8220;expensive&#8221; item in your arms among a bunch of crap and then trying to get me to price the armload without mentioning the item I saw you pick up = offensive. If you need to brush up on your assertiveness, a garage sale is a great place to practice.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Have some friends available for moral support.</strong> I&#8217;m pretty sure I would not have gotten through it all without the support of some good friends who stayed with me and laughed with me. And brought me coffee.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Know that if worse comes to worse, you can always shut the garage doors and bring everything to Goodwill.</strong> I didn&#8217;t do that, but it was sort of comforting to know that was an option.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m not forgetting anything.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your best garage sale tip? What&#8217;s your most horrifying garage sale story? Please share it in the comments!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cake.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-315 aligncenter" title="cake" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cake.jpg?w=300&#038;h=212" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s Sight to Behold&#8217;s monthiversary today, and it has officially outlived all of the diaries I&#8217;ve ever tried to keep (by a lot)! Woohoo!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only been able to watch 2 of the movies from my <a href="http://sighttobehold.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/5-movies-im-most-excited-to-see-right-now/">list</a> (<em>X-Men: First Class </em>and <em>Little Dorrit- </em>done and done!), but <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 </em>is coming out in less than two weeks, <em>Jane Eyre </em>should be out on DVD sometime in August, and I&#8217;ll just have to wait till September to watch <em>Anonymous.</em> So, instead of learning my lesson and talking about movies that are actually coming out in the near future, I&#8217;m going to pick a bunch of movies that aren&#8217;t coming out anytime soon- 2 of them are coming out in 2012!  But here&#8217;s a list of the 5 book-based movies I&#8217;m most excited about right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry-potter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-316" title="harry potter" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry-potter.jpg?w=203&#038;h=300" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2- </em>Ok, I&#8217;m cheating a little on this one because it was on my other list, but I&#8217;ve read the book and I&#8217;m  excited to see it, so I decided that it counts. The first part was so good I can&#8217;t wait to see how they top it in this one. Plus it&#8217;ll be a great dollar-theater movie to go to with a bunch of people once I&#8217;m back at Covenant. It&#8217;ll be out in 10 days, and I&#8217;m totally planning on going on opening night. (I&#8217;ve always wanted to go to a movie&#8217;s opening night, but I&#8217;ve never actually done it yet.)<a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-hobbit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-318" title="the hobbit" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-hobbit.jpg?w=300&#038;h=208" alt="" width="300" height="208" /></a></li>
<li><em>The Hobbit-</em> I absolutely  adored this book the first time I read it (I think it was in 4th or 5th grade for school), so I decided to re-read it since the movie&#8217;s coming out and everything. It&#8217;s so much better than I remember, and I might just have to re-read <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>now. It&#8217;s crazy good.  Plus they&#8217;re bringing back all the actors from <em>LOTR;</em> Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee&#8230; everybody. <strong></strong>Martin Freeman looks like he&#8217;ll be a good Bilbo and from what I&#8217;ve heard Richard Armitage makes a pretty good Thorin Oakenshield. I think it&#8217;s a little weird they&#8217;re adding a character (a Mirkwood elf named Tauriel) but it&#8217;s Peter Jackson, so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll make sense when I see it.<a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-hunger-games.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-319" title="the hunger games" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-hunger-games.jpg?w=233&#038;h=300" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></a></li>
<li>I meant to save this for the ride to VA Beach but I got carried away and finished it before we even left. Whoops. This book is <strong>really</strong> addictive, and I loved the Greek-myth-influence (thank you classical education). Since I&#8217;m all excited about the book (hopefully I&#8217;ll get to read the sequel soon&#8230;) I&#8217;m really excited about the movie too, but unfortunately it comes out in 2012. So now I have to be patient. I think it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how they play the Katniss/Peeta relationship, because that seems like it&#8217;d be super tricky to get right.<a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-three-musketeers2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-320" title="the three musketeers2" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-three-musketeers2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></li>
<li><em>The Three Musketeers- </em>I actually hated this book when I read it because D&#8217;Artagnan is a jerk of epic proportions. Seriously, I can&#8217;t stand it. But this movie looks absolutely nothing like the book, so in this case I&#8217;m really happy. In the trailer it almost had a sci-fi feel, with all the ship/hot air balloon hybrids and Milla Jovovich as a ninja-assassin (not really) Lady de Winter. Plus it has Luke Evans (Bard from <em>The Hobbit</em>) and Matthew Macfadyen (Little Dorrit) in it, and Orlando Bloom looks like he&#8217;s having way too much fun hamming it up as one of the villains (but it looks like it&#8217;ll be pretty hilarious- he even has an earring!).  It should at least be entertaining, and it already looks better than the original novel.<a href="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/george-smiley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-321" title="george smiley" src="http://sighttobehold.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/george-smiley.jpg?w=300&#038;h=194" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></a></li>
<li><em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy- </em>I haven&#8217;t read the original John le Carre novel, but the trailer looks really interesting and I&#8217;ve kind of been on a spy movie bender lately. Plus when I was watching the trailer I was like, Hey it&#8217;s Gary Oldman! And Tom Hardy! And Colin Firth! And Mark Strong! So I&#8217;ll definitely have to read the book and then see the movie.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_9284" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 190px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9284 " title="100425eaarth" src="http://frontpsych.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/100425eaarth.jpg?w=180&#038;h=178" alt="" width="180" height="178" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Emergency on Planet Eaarth</p></div>
<p>Humanity ravished Mother Nature and Mother Nature fought back. Thanks to global warming, ice caps and glaciers are melting, forests and wetlands are vanishing, and temperatures and sea levels are rising, along with famine, disease, and natural disasters. Meanwhile, we’re running out of fossil fuels, the lifeblood of modern life and, ironically, the fuel that is speeding its destruction. Even if the world miraculously got green overnight, it’s too late now to undo all the damage, but if we dig down and get creative, we can cut our losses and insure our survival.</p>
<p>This is the essence of <em>Eaarth; Making A Life on a Tough New Planet</em>. In his latest book, writer and activist Bill McKibben adds an ‘a’ to the word ‘Earth’ as a way to argue that human despoliation has made the planet fundamentally different, i.e. worse, than ever before in its history. We will never live on “Earth” again, he says, but if we play our cards right, we can engineer a “relatively graceful decline” for life on “Eaarth.”</p>
<p><span id="more-9283"></span>McKibben speaks with authority. Some 20 years ago, he was among the first to write about global warming for a popular audience. He has published more than a dozen books and in 2009, organized a environmental campaign that CNN called “the most widespread day of political action in the planet’s history”</p>
<p>Early in the book, McKibben promises to make the reader’s eyes glaze over with statistics –and he keeps his word. Still, <em>Eaarth </em>stays lively with anecdotes about the author’s visits to China and Bangladesh and life in his current home of Vermont, which he sees as a microcosm of the world and a model for reform. Elsewhere, he lightens the tone with folksy analogies. Americans’ dependence on oil is “a 5,000 mile straw through which we suck hydrocarbons from the Persian Gulf.” If the Third World is a man on a treadmill, the First World is a sadistic personal trainer with his hands on the controls. Our current economic policy is “a jolt of Viagra” that has temporarily invigorated a flaccid system, but can’t make the good times last all night.</p>
<p>In the first half of the book, McKibben plays the prophet of doom with a litany of crises and natural disasters and predicts a future of compounded catastrophes. Through repetition and emphasis, the message is clear: Ecocide equals suicide. Or as McKibben says: “We’re running Genesis backward: decreation.” Along the way, McKibben doesn’t vilify specific corporations, polluters, or politicians (though he does take several potshots at <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman). Instead, he says we’re all responsible for the sickness –and health—of the planet.</p>
<p>In the second half, McKibben turns sunnier and more pragmatic. As he admits, any solutions will take time, money, sacrifice, and ingenuity. Many of his remedies are familiar. Up with bicycles and public transportation. Down with cars and SUVs.  Up with local, organic farms with diverse crops. Down with factory farms and monocultures. Up with farmer’s markets and community gardens. Down with supermarkets and Wal-Marts.</p>
<p>One of his larger ideas is to curb our addiction to economic growth. He acknowledges the position is “un-American,” but says that we don’t have any choice. Americans may think we are exceptional, but compared to the power of nature we’re as vulnerable as anyone on Earth. Or for that matter, Eaarth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102544.jpg"><img src="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102544.jpg" alt="20110629-102544.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given the choice of 20, 50, 0r 70 miles, we chose 50.  Mostly because if you went only 20, you didn&#8217;t end up finishing at the finish-line party at a winery, and if you did 70, well . . . you did s-e-v-e-n-t-y.  Even though it was the first really good, long distance ride I&#8217;ve done all year, I didn&#8217;t train.  Not to worry, though, because Dad didn&#8217;t either.  Not at all.  So at least if one of us was going to topple over from exhaustion, dehydration, or general blobishnees onto the sun-bleached, tire-poppingly hot asphalt, clipped-in to our pedals and pretzled around a road bike left helpless to be sidewinded (<em>sidewound</em>?) by a wayward desert snake &#8211; at least the other one wouldn&#8217;t be too far behind.</p>
<p><a href="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102958.jpg"><img src="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102958.jpg" alt="20110629-102958.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We didn&#8217;t really know what we were in for, or even what the Atlas ride was all about, until we got out there.  We hung around at the start line for a while, taking in all the free Power Bar Gummies our burgeoning jersey pockets could hold and posing for what would become our cameo in the background of the even footage on the local evening news.  (&#8220;<em>No papparazi</em>!&#8221;).  Once we started out, it seemed that we reached the 20-miler turnaround way too soon &#8211; we felt great.  Not wanting to jinx ourselves, neither dared to mention that we were already 20% percent through and feeling fine, but we rolled on by the rest stop sans re-fuel or restroom.</p>
<p><a href="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-103423.jpg"><img src="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-103423.jpg" alt="20110629-103423.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the halfway point, where the hulking 70-milers branched off from the puny 50-milers, they had peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches and smoothies.  Now THAT, my friends, is ride support.  Keep your Gatorade and Gu, just gimme the good stuff.  We still felt fine, but at this stop we dared to admit it.  Could it already be mid-morning and the cloud cover had not yet burned off?  Did we really just ride 25 miles?</p>
<p><a href="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-103610.jpg"><img src="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-103610.jpg" alt="20110629-103610.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the 3/4 point we stopped for water and orange slices because, really, you can&#8217;t find good orange slices anywhere besides a little league soccer match, and good luck trying to get in on that action without coming off like a TOTAL creep.  (<em>Don&#8217;t ask</em>.)  The clouds had burned off, but only just.  We weren&#8217;t too hot, too thirsty, or anywhere near bonking.  The PBJ-Smoothie combo had been the mid-ride snack of champions (<em>or at least of persistent finishers</em>).  From that point on, it was easy to settle in for the end of the ride knowing we&#8217;d soon be rolling into a winery, flashing our finisher&#8217;s writsbands, and enjoying all the free BBQ, beer, and glory we could handle.</p>
<p><a href="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102753.jpg"><img src="http://blobtoblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/20110629-102753.jpg" alt="20110629-102753.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we finally rolled in to the party we realized that 50 miles isn&#8217;t that hard, after all.  We&#8217;d spent the last leg of the ride marveling at how much fun we&#8217;d had, how great we felt that our pace has increased since last summer, and how next year we would DEFINITELY do the 70 miler.  In our post-ride euphoria, we even tried to sign up for the Atlas 4000 (70 Days, Texas-to-Alaska, bragging rights forever). Alas, that ride is only for UT students, so we are forced into our new campaign to convince Mom to let us ride our bikes to the family reunion next year (7 days, Texas-to-Kansas, bragging rights forever).</p>

<p>This month has been another amazing chapter of travel through Italy!! I&#8217;ve been to: Florence, Pisa, Venice and Verona, each of which have had their own unique sense of character. <em>Bologna</em> however, is my favorite city in Italy for it&#8217;s celebrated food culture<em>&#8230;</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12173" title="The most delicious pastries!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879937687_3e682a1536_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img title="The most delicious pastries!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879940117_8e8e6dce33_z-1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Memorable mornings in Bologna were spent at local café&#8217;s where I savored some of the best Italian coffee and pastries. The taste of rich cappuccinos, macchiatos and poached cherry tarts were like no other and the creaminess of the freshly roasted coffee beans used was so naturally sweet that the thought of honey or sugar was forgotten!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img title="The most delicious pastries!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880500714_a960ff2d4e_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12275 alignnone" title="The most delicious pastries!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879938687_273812064d_z-1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the heart of the city on <em>Via Clavature</em> I found a little Bolognese bakery named <em>Panaficio Aranando Priori</em>, where I experienced some of the most <span style="text-decoration:underline;">delicious</span> Lemon <em>Sfogliatella Santa Rosa</em>, a delectable shell-shaped pastry that originated in a <em>Salermo</em> monastery during the seventeenth century!! The woman that owns the bakery was very passionate about food and all of clients in the shop seemed as though they&#8217;d been buying pastries from her for years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12467" title="Fresh flowers for sale..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bm2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img title="The most amazing tomatoes!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880493952_9cae40be01_z-1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout Italy, some of the best moments of life and living that I&#8217;ve experienced have been at the tables of hidden Trattoria&#8217;s and at the bustling stalls of food markets!! I feel like one of the most interesting ways to really connect with the varied character and culture of a new city, is through it&#8217;s cuisine and market places. My favorite experiences of local life and living were on the streets of <em>Via Drapperie</em>! The early morning markets here are so vibrant with color, movement and Bolognese vibes&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12469" title="Delicate and handmade..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bm6.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the middle of all the hustle, I met a friendly old man who was selling his own handmade <em>Tortellini</em> and <em>Ravioli</em> from the region! Each yolk-yellow piece was made carefully and the dough used was of soft flour and other <em>Emilia-Romagna</em> ingredients. I savored a selection that I purchased from him with freshly sliced tomatoes from the countryside, crushed basil, garlic, fragrant olive oil and mediterranean sea salt.</p>
<p><img title="Fresh flowers for sale..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879999111_3e2b163047_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The market was outlined by colorful bouquets of June flowers! Bright yellow colors reminded me of the breathtaking sunflower fields that I saw in Tuscany days previous.</p>
<p><img title="Fresh flowers for sale..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880562476_7c402b4c78_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:normal;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12470" title="Italian soaps for sale..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bm4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /><br />
</span></p>
<p>- Handmade Italian soap&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12471" title="Café's of Bologna..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bm1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>- One of the many local coffee bars that outline the market alleys.</p>
<p><img title="Fresh flowers for sale..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879935095_d06149c1ab_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img title="I love figs." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879935723_9d92d98401_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>- Freshly picked figs from the outskirts of town&#8230;</p>
<p><img title="Walnut with cream..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880495112_9564ea34d8_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img title="Small berries and dark chocolate..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880494874_4e94ab68c1_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>- Decadent Bolognese cakes with silky layers of cream, berries and dark chocolate&#8230;</p>
<p><img title="Juicy blackberries!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879931937_7cb719214e_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img title="As well as blueberries..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5879936317_229e8310bb_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><em>- </em>Aromatic seasonal berries&#8230;<em> Cherries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries were a few to name.<br />
</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12472" title="Colorful plums!" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bm3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p><img title="Bologna cheeses..." src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5880560678_c9788aa020_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the labyrinth-like stalls of high quality cheeses that came from various regions of Italy! <em>Asiago</em> and <em>Provolone</em> were delicious with a few glasses of <em>Amarone di Valpolicella</em> wine from Bologna.</p>
