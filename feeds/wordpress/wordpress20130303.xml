				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have begun to refer to that period as</p>
<p><i>The Experience</i>.</p>
<p>As though some distant civilization</p>
<p>arrived and occupied the</p>
<p>Neighborhoods and alleys</p>
<p>of my Self.</p>
<p>Took over the garages with massive parties that</p>
<p>bled into the basement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And got ugly.</p>
<p>And did shit.</p>
<p>And changed.</p>
<p>And cleaned up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And fell down laughing, and</p>
<p>high again.</p>
<p>And wrote on walls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But only in chalk,</p>
<p>so as not to be too</p>
<p>assuming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(But the chalk wounded the</p>
<p>brick just with patient abuse).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And they let out the patients in my madhouse, let</p>
<p>out the criminal and the thief and the mini-Con.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The soft junk.</p>
<p>The spiral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The empty rooms turned</p>
<p>into impossible choreographed numbers</p>
<p>that can never be quite replicated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Short story notes</p>
<p>in frost of window</p>
<p>the only thing left is</p>
<p>some kind of crude arrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lyrics persist in the wind</p>
<p>The night of your birth and mine.</p>
<p>In a sub-state nobody will see</p>
<p>for another hundred years.</p>
<p> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/waffle-house.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-405" alt="Waffle House" src="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/waffle-house.jpg?w=580&#038;h=166" width="580" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>I have been having an affair.  For years now I have been going behind the back of my first true love, for the dirty, grimy, and greasy mistress.  The shame I felt over the last several years has finally culminated into this article, this declaration of my love/hate relationship.  I love mediocre food.</p>
<p>After a long week of <a href="http://eatathomecooks.com/">cooking every meal</a>, maybe going out to a good restaurant, and eating food that is generally good, my relationship with food goes dark and I reach for a distraction.  It’s hard to explain exactly why, but sometimes I feel the undeniable pull of a gas station hotdog or an assortment of greasy <a href="http://www.wafflehouse.com/">Waffle House</a> treats.  I know that they are bad for me, I know that they are unhealthy, I know that the enjoyment I’ll feel will always be followed by guilt, but <span id="more-404"></span>sometimes I just can’t help myself.  What is it about mediocre food that pulls us in?  Why do we feel the need to drive late night to eat a taco we never would have eaten only hours earlier?</p>
<p>The first thing I think of is the need for time away from the world.  The most common time I find myself in a booth at the local “I don’t know how this place stays in business” diner is late at night after a long drive to clear my head.  My body craves for more time to think and sort out my life, but needs to have a low impact activity.  Enter:  Diner.  After parking in that pseudo leather seat and placing my order I know that I won’t be bothered.  The restaurant is empty at this time of night and makes me wonder why exactly they stay open 24 hours a day.  Maybe it’s done as a service to the drunk and the deep in thought.  After the meal my mind has been made up and I am ready to once again face the real world.  That pancake, bacon, and egg combo is completely forgotten, as if I never ate it in the first place.  But I am able to return home and sleep in peace, my mind clear and my stomach full.</p>
<p>Next, I think of comfort.  Many of the foods we eat on a regular basis have some sort of tie to our past.  Here’s an easy <a href="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mac-n-cheese.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-406" alt="mac n cheese" src="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mac-n-cheese.jpg?w=348&#038;h=232" width="348" height="232" /></a>example:  <a href="http://www.kraftfoodsgroup.com/welcome.aspx">Kraft</a> Macaroni &amp; Cheese.  While mixing the concoction over a heated stove you know for a fact that you are getting a sub-par meal.  The pasta is low quality, the amount of butter seems so hefty you have to read the instructions a second time, and the addition of neon orange powdered cheese are all pretty big indicators of what is to come.  Yet it is rare to find someone who ate mac &amp; cheese as a child who doesn’t still open a blue box from time to time.  Why?  Our memories of better times, when things were simple and many of your actions were inconsequential, are tied to the contents of that box.  When a time machine can be made out of pasta, milk, butter, and dehydrated cheese, the appeal to go back is just too strong for most of us to resist.  Sure we may have now improved upon the recipe, higher quality cheese, better pasta, baking to form a nice browned crust on top, but the draw of the original is always there.</p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes the mood is just right.  <a href="http://www.divinecaroline.com/life-etc/home-food/ten-most-delicious-foods-eat-when-youre-drunk">Drunk food</a> is starting to become an industry all its own.  Food carts and small stands are staying open late to give victims of last call a place to sop up the alcohol and relive the adventures that were <a href="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/taco.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-409" alt="taco" src="http://tieattack.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/taco.jpg?w=239&#038;h=319" width="239" height="319" /></a>had in the hours prior.  Sometimes you just feel like you need to eat, and when you NEED to eat the quality of food takes a back seat.  In fact, I believe that many people have moments when they would rather have a greasy burger over a medium rare steak.  For some of us the sensation happens more than others, but we all have that same feeling.  When the urge hits me, greasy tacos or a spicy sausage are my weapons of choice in a war against ending the night on a low note.  I can’t complain, so far I have a 100% success rate.</p>
<p>So we enjoy mediocre food over great food from time to time, that’s nothing to be ashamed of.  If you need to work out some thoughts, go back to a simpler time, or end your night with a bang, run out and grab whatever sounds good.  Sometimes we all need a little affair in our culinary relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://leonidafremov.deviantart.com/art/TANGO-OF-LOVE-Leonid-Afremov-44733205"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2578" alt="ltdc" src="http://cristianmihaid.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ltdc.jpg?w=423&#038;h=260" width="423" height="260" /></a>If you&#8217;ve been following this blog for some time you know that a few weeks prior to a new release I like to write <a title="Jazz: A (sort of) Foreword" href="http://cristianmihai.net/2012/06/25/jazz-a-sort-of-foreword/"><strong>a long post</strong></a> about what it took to write it, how long, what inspired me, and what I learned by writing it.</p>
<p>I do so mainly because it&#8217;s fun, but also because people seem to enjoy reading about my process. So here&#8217;s this sort of foreword.<span id="more-2576"></span></p>
<p>Once upon a time I met this girl.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s actually true.</p>
<p>And we became friends. Kind of. For a brief period of time we used to talk a lot about all sorts of stuff, and, well, at one point she told me she had a secret. Just like that. She didn&#8217;t want to tell me what it was, she just said it was so terrible that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to understand.</p>
<p>That was like 5 years ago. For dumb high-school me that was quite an experience, mostly because it got me thinking (I don&#8217;t do that very often.) I wanted to know what her secret was, maybe just out of curiosity, but I also thought that to be the ultimate proof that she trusted me. But I didn&#8217;t insist either. I just thought that when the time was right, she&#8217;d tell me.</p>
<p>Actually, she never told me her secret.</p>
<p>So I wrote a novella, in Romanian, about a woman with a terrible secret. There&#8217;s more to it that just that, but I don&#8217;t want to bore you with the details. It didn&#8217;t take long to write it, mostly because, honestly, this whole terrible secret thing had a big power of obsession over me, and ultimately, while I was writing the damn story, I wanted to know what her secret was just so I could write it down.</p>
<p>I wanted to write the truth, not because it would have mattered to readers, but because it would have mattered to me. In fact, I never tried to publish this novella, I never submitted it to any contests, and more so, no one ever read it.</p>
<p>And I kind of forgot about it.</p>
<p>But it did change something in my writing: I found one of my most enduring themes: masks. Well, not real masks, but that thing that who we are, who we think we are, who others think we are, and who we want to be will never coincide &#8211; I think I actually wrote this line down, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Writer-ebook/dp/B009FVX9GW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362083409&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=the+writer" target="_blank"><strong>The Writer </strong></a>if I&#8217;m not mistaken. We pretend to be someone else than who we really are.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also when I came up with this line: &#8220;We&#8217;re all strong enough to endure someone else&#8217;s tragedy.&#8221; I used that one in The Writer as well, but I do tend to use it in a lot of my stuff, as some sort of signature. It&#8217;s just a simple line, but I kind of always find a place for it.</p>
<p>When I found out about <strong>NaNoWriMo</strong> in 2010 I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to write. I had plenty of ideas, but I just couldn&#8217;t concentrate. Call it writer&#8217;s block or whatever you want to, but I just couldn&#8217;t write. Of course, now I&#8217;m pretty sure it had to do with the fact that I had never written in English before (well, fiction), but back then I was terrified.</p>
<p>And I never really experience writer&#8217;s block as a total block; I can write, just that all the words seem wrong.</p>
<p>After about a week of struggle I decided to translate this novella. Technically, it was cheating, but I just wanted to be able  to have something at the end of NaNoWriMo.</p>
<p>Sometimes one of the best ways to beat writer&#8217;s block is just to type&#8230; just punch those keys, relax your mind. To those who have dealt with words for some time that&#8217;s music. And, slowly, you find more words.</p>
<p>So I wrote. And wrote, and you know, wrote more and more. I actually managed to write 50,000 words in 3 weeks. And, at the end of those weeks, I realized I had a completely different story. Yeah, there was still this terrible secret, and everyone pretended to be someone they were not, but the English version was much more complex.</p>
<p>But it was still crap. Like really crap.</p>
<p>As much as it hurts me to say this, but I wasn&#8217;t good enough to write a novel back then. I remember the fact that I did some research into writing a good kiss scene &#8211; actually I googled, &#8220;how to write a kiss scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I went ahead and edited it, because I wanted to self-publish it. Which I did, in January 2011.</p>
<p>The book was available for purchase for about 4-5 months, before I realized that it was really bad. During those months I sold 4 copies &#8211; 2 paperbacks and 2 e-books. I&#8217;m sure this is one of the worst debuts in the history of literature.</p>
<p>I received a 4 star review on Amazon from someone who hadn&#8217;t even read the book, just a short paragraph of it, and a 2 star review on Goodreads from someone who actually read 100 pages out of 160, but couldn&#8217;t make it to the finish line &#8211; hence the 2 stars.</p>
<p>I was devastated. All I wanted was to be a writer. I gave up on writing and decided that life&#8217;s not fair. I just didn&#8217;t want to admit that I just wasn&#8217;t good enough: a good enough writer, a good enough self-publisher, a good enough blogger.</p>
<p>But you know what was my biggest mistake? This novel wasn&#8217;t bad just because of the bad dialogue, the awful description, the (almost) nonexistent plotline, and all those philosophical mussing which I thought to be clever.</p>
<p>It was bad because all I did was write a story. There was no emotion there, nothing that belonged to me. Just before I took it down Amazon, I read it and realized that I had changed so many things that the story wasn&#8217;t mine anymore. It was a lie, a badly written one.</p>
<p>It was artificial.</p>
<p>After six or so months I decided that I would give writing one more try. And I decided to write my own stories, even if there was nothing &#8220;epic&#8221; or &#8220;glorious&#8221; about them.</p>
<p>When I began rewriting this new version of this novel I was very much in love. And that changed everything.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t I finish rewriting it?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Everyone who read it thought it was good enough. I received overwhelming positive feedback from the <strong>Wattpad</strong> community. Maybe I was scared that I would fail again.</p>
<p>Well I was certain that I would fail again. Every book we write is a failure, so maybe I just wanted to fail better, you know? To fail as good as I was capable of&#8230; I&#8217;m sure that last sentence doesn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>
<p>So I put this novel aside and focused on other projects. I wrote a movie-script (well, it was more like a hour long TV drama episode), I wrote a few short stories, and I wrote the first draft of <strong>The Writer</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically it. Of course, there are a lot more things I could write about, like the fact that there&#8217;s a connection between Jazz and LTDC, that when I was 6 or 7 I wanted to go to the US and change my name to Chris Packlem and become the richest man in the world.</p>
<p>That both Chris Packlem and William Bower have something that belongs to me, certain traits that I have or wish I had.</p>
<p>This is the novel I plan on publishing at the end of March. It&#8217;s almost complete, and I&#8217;m spending a lot of time working on it (by the way, tomorrow you&#8217;ll be able to read a new chapter.) And I want to get this novel properly edited (which costs money), I want to buy some paperbacks, host giveaways, send review copies, even pay for ads.</p>
<p>Dunno, I just don&#8217;t want to fail again.</p>
<p>You can order advance copies (or other cool stuff) and help me pay for all that stuff <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/322873/wdgi/584430" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mid-century Los Angeles was a corrupting place. Prohibition (1920-1933) had made mafia bosses millionaires and an oil boom had brought all sorts of chancers to the quickly growing city. Coupled with people fleeing the Great Depression to seek their dreams in the movie business, you have a world of rapid rises and dramatic falls.</p>
<p>Two writers drawn into this web of desperation and deceit were Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) and Nathanael West (1903-1940). The two men led quite similar lives. Both novelists had parents who were first-generation immigrants to the states: Chandler&#8217;s mother came from Ireland while West&#8217;s parents were Lithuanian. Both men moved to LA from other large cities: Chandler grew up in Chicago and London, while West was a New Yorker. Each man spent their younger years in Paris before taking up relatively humdrum occupations. Chandler worked as an oilman. West managed a small hotel. Eventually, their skill with the pen brought them to Hollywood, where they became successful screenwriters.</p>
<p>Cultural mores meant that the cinema of the time was a neutered beast where little of real life could be shown. Pumped out on a production line, the movie business would become the demise of many talented authors as their work was rewritten out of all recognition. To see LA as it really was, we have to turn to their novels.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://alastairsavage.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the-day-of-the-locust.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1187" title="The Day of the Locust (c) Penguin Design gray138" alt="The Day of the Locust (c) Penguin Design gray138" src="http://alastairsavage.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the-day-of-the-locust.jpg?w=194&#038;h=313" width="194" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>West&#8217;s classic is<em> The Day of the Locust </em>(1939). It is a dark, ambitious book. With its obsessive strangers living on the outskirts of society, it feels like a movie by David Lynch. As with Lynch&#8217;s films, women are the prime victim of much of the threat in the novel. The treatment of Faye Greener, an ambitious young starlet, is very disturbing indeed, especially when she moves in with a weird loner called Homer Simpson (yes, the inspiration for <em>The Simpsons</em> character).</p>
<p>Amidst the darkness, there is some superb prose:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the going was heavy and the stones and sand moved under his feet. He fell prone with his face in a clump of wild mustard that smelled of the rain and the sun, clean, fresh and sharp. He rolled over on his back and stared up at the sky. The violent exercise had driven most of the heat out of his blood, but enough remained to make him tingle pleasantly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Women also get a hard ride in Chandler&#8217;s stories featuring private eye Philip Marlowe. Like Faye Greener, they are usually femme fatales. However, the women that Marlowe encounters are rich, dangerous and occasionally murderous.</p>
<p>There is one other great threat in Chandler&#8217;s world: alcohol. Other than Marlowe, Chandler&#8217;s greatest creation is the alcoholic Terry Lennox in <em>The Long Goodbye</em> (1953). A great lover of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimlet_(cocktail)">gimlets</a>, Lennox becomes Marlowe&#8217;s drinking partner, even though Marlowe is not averse to giving him advice on how to go teetotal:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a different world. You have to get used to a paler set of colours, a quieter lot of sounds. You have to allow for relapses. All the people you used to know well will get to be just a little strange. You won&#8217;t even like most of them, and they won&#8217;t like you too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be much of a change,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>One other area of similarity is in their indifference to plotting. Perhaps in reaction to the strictures and rules of screenwriting, Chandler&#8217;s novels are peppered with dubious script devices. In <em>The High Window</em>, the entire plot revolves around the coincidence that a certain character has a camera ready at a certain time and in a certain place and, in the blink of an eye, took a compromising photograph. It&#8217;s utterly unbelievable but as it&#8217;s the pay-off to a beautifully written novel, the reader gives a shrug of the shoulders and moves on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://alastairsavage.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the-high-window.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1190" title="The High Window (c) Penguin Books Cover by Steven Marking" alt="The High Window (c) Penguin Books Cover by Steven Marking" src="http://alastairsavage.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the-high-window.jpg?w=194&#038;h=309" width="194" height="309" /></a></p>
<p>West is even more free-wheeling in <em>The Day of the Locust</em>. It&#8217;s a complex novel with multiple protagonists, no true plot, and a surreal, nebulous conclusion. By the end of the book, it&#8217;s not even clear why it is called <em>The Day of the Locust</em> at all (most people believe it&#8217;s a Biblical allusion).</p>
<p>Chandler and West are two writers from similar worlds whose books have stood the test of time. Reading them together is a great way of getting a peek at the real LA, the one that lay behind the silver screen.</p>

─Hey sister, give me two bottles of green.</p>
<p>The gap between the metal bars are just wide enough for bottles to pass through. 500 kwatcha ($1,5) is exchanged for two bottles of Carlsberg.</p>
<p>─Do you like the Gunners? I like the Gunners, the guy with the Arsenal t-shirt and the two bottles asks as he wanders off with a slight sway, not waiting for any answer.</p>
<p>We are having a drink in Woody woodpecker. The name sounds innocent enough, but the address is slightly nastier. This legendary bottle store is situated in Devil Street. This tiny strip of broken tarmac and dirt isn’t really called Devil Street, but as the three main sources of income here are booze, sex and illegal gambling the name serves it’s purpose: It attracts some people, and scare off others. Most, no to say all, mzungus stay well clear. To us it’s like a magnet. Not because of what they sell here, but because of who it attracts. When white people, or mzungus, are in Africa they spend more time with white people than they do at home. They work, play, eat and drink in an environment that would have made the inventors of apartheid proud.<br />
We came to Malawi to talk to Malawians. Therefore it makes more sense to have drink where the locals meet – despite the warnings given by guidebooks and expats.</p>
<p>It’s only five in the afternoon, but the bottle store has plenty of customers, and so much noise that we bring our brew outside.</p>
<p>─Have a seat, boys. Rodwell Ziyaya (42) and his friends nods towards the two empty chairs lined up outside.</p>
<p>Rodwell is a businessman dealing in Chinese suitcases and lady’s clothes. Business is slow at the moment. Still our new friend is optimistic. In a month the tobacco auctions will start trading again, and as the crop is very good this year things are about to improve. In the meantime drinking seems like a good way to pass time.</p>
<p>─Malawi, Rodwell says with a smile, is a very friendly place, and Devil Street isn’t as bad as they tell you. Just look for yourself.</p>
<p>Some of the pedestrians are definitely not fit for anything but walking right now, still no one is threatening or aggressive. It is afternoon and people are having a drink on their way home from work, just like in any other corner of the world. The bar with bars is neither nice nor cozy. But it has plenty of rugged charm, and a happy crowd.</p>
<p>After all, what more could you possibly ask for than a room with a brew?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t say this to evoke pity. Please don&#8217;t read it in a melodramatic tone in your head, or season it with melancholy. Think matter-of-fact. It is what it is.</p>
<p>I was a bit of an accident.</p>
<p>I asked my mother about it, once, and she paused for an uncomfortable moment before responding. &#8220;Honey, by the time you showed up, we were <em>so</em> happy to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as a child, I knew what that meant. That explained the six years between my sister and me. It explained why nine years separated me from one brother, and twelve from the other. It explained why I often felt like a child in a roomful of adults, and why, for many years, the taller people in the house took some precedence. It wasn&#8217;t all bad, though. In general, they also took the heat and the blame.</p>
<p>When we were all at home in our little red house, we piled atop each other, and tensions tended to rise. My parents hastily carved out the attic to make two bedrooms, one for my brothers, and one for my sister and me. When my brothers began to chafe at those close quarters, the eldest retreated into the basement with a black light bulb and day-glo Easy Rider posters. Once my sister hit her teens, though, when it became increasingly awkward for us to share a room, there seemed nowhere else to expand.</p>
<p>After much debate, it was finally decided that I should move into what was essentially a throughway, a roomy passage between the kitchen and the bathroom. As one might imagine, I had extremely limited space for luxuries such as clothing or books. There was a shelf put in, and a small dresser crammed under the stairs. There was a window which peered at the garage, and I hung a few things on the wall, but because everyone trooped through this space during waking hours, I couldn&#8217;t have my bed down there. Instead, I was allowed use of &#8220;the daybed.&#8221; Never <em>mine;</em> just <em>the.</em> This was a couch-like thing which served as a cot-sized bed at night. I didn&#8217;t really mind. Mostly. It beat witnessing my sister&#8217;s eighth grade make-out sessions.</p>
<p>The daybed was very simply designed. Very nordic. Imagine a cheap door, taken off its hinges and laid flat on skinny, pointed legs. An egg-colored foam pad, about four inches thick, lay on top, covered with an upholstery apparently conceived in the seventies. It was a magenta paisley, crossed with a parade of stripes and shapes which have never been seen together since. It was poorly made, too, so the rough metal zipper was entirely visible along the side, and I often grazed the backs of my legs against its voracious teeth. More inviting were the two long, wedge-shaped pillows which served as the back of the couch during the day. These were covered with corduroy of a very specific blue hue, one I still associate with all things quiet and comfortable. I loved to run my fingers along the nap endlessly, with it or against being equally zen-like.</p>
<p><a href="http://beretolsen.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/301c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" alt="301c" src="http://beretolsen.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/301c.jpg?w=121&#038;h=151" width="121" height="151" /></a></p>
<p>From the daybed, I would doze to the sound of the dishwasher, and wake to the sound and smell of the eternal percolator, a seemingly indestructible wedding gift from the fifties.</p>
<p>It was there that I lay through the German measles and the mumps; there that I listened to my mother read <em>Watership Down</em>.</p>
<p>One evening, my mother found the nuts I had stolen from the roasting pan full of Chex party mix in the basement. They were in an old bread bag, tied in a knot and tucked under the daybed. They might have escaped notice, too, had my mother not helped me put the sheets on that night. &#8220;What are you, some sort of squirrel?&#8221; she asked, but not too sharply. I was glad when she let it go, perhaps understanding how hard it was to get the good bits when your siblings are so much older and faster.</p>
<p>I remember lying on that daybed the night after the girl scout picnic in second grade, the one where I ate a hot dog stuffed with Velveeta and wrapped in bacon before grilling. I threw up six or seven times&#8211;a little daybed volcano&#8211;and have never eaten a hotdog since.</p>
<p>I remember lying there sniffling, lamenting my lack of space and privacy, when my medium brother heard me and tiptoed in. We were not a terribly affectionate family, nor emotionally adept, but he explained with such kindness and enthusiasm how he would make it feel big enough. I still feel deep gratitude for that night. He began to schlepp all kinds of things from his room, my sister&#8217;s, the kitchen, wherever. He filled that tiny place from floor to ceiling so I could be pleasantly surprised when he it emptied out again, and there would be room to roll over and even to stand with my hands outstretched.</p>
<p>But by far, my favorite memory of the daybed was a secret I neglected to tell anyone, lest I would have to share that, too. Ours was a frugal household, where finances dictated a thermostat set at a bone-chilling 58 degrees through even the worst of the South Dakota winter nights. But when temperatures outside settled well below zero, maintaining 58 degrees still necessitated occasional blasts of delicious heat. A major duct ran through the wall, all along the length of the back of the daybed. Who would know, with the blue corduroy pillows in place all day, what heavenly heat emanated from the wall behind me? I pressed my socked feet against it, snuggling like a cat to a sunny patch, and dreaming dreams.</p>
<p>These days, we set the thermostat at a balmy 62 at night, and I have a heating pad, which spares my spouse from my icy toes. But I think the comfort it offers is not simply a physical one. It is also a remembrance of those long, cold nights, pressed against the wall in my make-shift little roomlet. It is a reminder that there is always enough room for me, and more than enough of what I really need.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jones,</p>
<p>I certainly understand why you would want to be inside the mind of my sweet Potato. The creativity and imagination that he possesses must have been hard for you to pass up. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I have wanted to crawl up there and see the world as he sees it.</p>
<p>You have been a force to be reckoned with. You have hit, and bit, and scratched. You have thrown and broken stuff. Your running commentary has tried to dismantle the quality of our lives. You hang around and spew your foul, deceitful ignorance to my baby, trying to strip him of all his self-worth.</p>
<p>You have really been quite slick, disappearing every once in a while just to make us comfortable, then rear your ugly head and return with force. I have to admit, you have stayed firm and really established yourself in his mind. That really doesn&#8217;t say much for you though, after all, it is easy to prey on the frail and the innocent, but you know that; that&#8217;s why your still here, right? Sticking around to see just how low you can bring him down and then revel in delight.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time for you to listen!  You have chosen the wrong mind to invade, dear Jones. Your strength, albeit strong, is nothing compared to the strength that lies within my son. You may have had a stay in his mind for a while, but you have not, will not, and can not touch his heart or his precious soul. Consider yourself under attack.</p>
<p>Potato is never alone, I assure you. He is backed up by the greatest power of us all. He is being lifted up in  prayer a plenty and I assure you there is strength in numbers.  My young, charming boy has many angels in heaven that wrap him in love and watch over continually.  His spirit is gentle and kind, but don&#8217;t mistake that for weakness, as it is stronger than you might have initially thought.</p>
<p>He has a heart full of Grace and Virtue. His soul is spunky and loving. He is humorous, clever, abundance in spirit and sensitivity. Loving, enthusiastic, saucy, witty and considerate, he is a true original and not even you can take that away.</p>
<p>In his short eight years, he has run through more obstacles than most do in a lifetime. He didn&#8217;t get past those by waving the white flag. No, he has blood, sweat and tears to prove his fight well fought. He will overcome anything you send his way and you will not even be in our memories, because you are not worthy of taking any more space in his, or anyone else&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>Be warned, hell hath no fury like a mother scorned. I will stop at nothing to see you leave. NOTHING!  When my baby feels weak, I will fight for him. When he sees you I will cover his eyes. When he hears you, I will sing to him and drown you out. You are most certainly not stronger than the love I have for him. Let me be clear, you do not even come close to touching the admiration I have for and confidence I have in my amazing son.</p>
<p>My baby is a beautiful reality and you are nothing short of a fraud. So, I bid you an official goodbye Jones, forever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p><a href="http://brokenlightcollective.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/stay-strong-keep-fighting/photofinalwm/" rel="attachment wp-att-6919"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6919" alt="" src="http://brokenlightcollective.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photofinalwm.jpg?w=547&#038;h=392" width="547" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>Photo taken by a woman who has suffered from severe depression. She hopes that by telling her story that she will help fight stigma, and help people to understand things like self-harm that seem so hard to understand. She would also like to help other people suffering to feel less alone, and maybe even share the spark of hope.</p>
<p>About this photo:<em> “It took me fifteen minutes of searching through every drawer in my house, but I finally found the one piece of orange clothing that I have. I&#8217;m wearing orange in honor of <a title="harm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-injury_Awareness_Day" target="_blank">Self-Injury Awareness Day</a>. I know every day is some other awareness day, but this one happens to mean a lot to me. As someone who has been down the path of self-harm, and had people I love dearly who have been there, I feel terribly and empathize for all who are suffering enough to self-harm and those who love someone who does. It&#8217;s a serious issue, and should be treated as such, this day and every day.</em></p>
<p><em>The first time I really hurt myself I was in college. I was sad and in pain emotionally and I took it out on myself physically. I don&#8217;t want to be too specific in fear of it triggering anyone else, but it wasn&#8217;t pretty. I still feel terribly that my best friend had to find me slurring and covered in blood on the floor - I think I had a few drinks and some pills in me too. I was in the hospital for a night or two and released as not being a threat to myself. Life moved forward but m</em><em>y wound would not heal, not just the emotional wound, but the physical one. I needed a skin graft. When I went to the hospital to get the graft, I asked if the two skin locations would be numbed. The doctor looked at the nurse and then at me with cold eyes, and she said that since I did it to myself I should be fine with the pain and deal with it&#8230; This was just plain ignorance.</em></p>
<p><em>I learned from that experience and evolved my self-harm so it would generally not involve wounds. I thought I was being smart, but nothing about self-harm is smart. I kept coming back to it though. </em><em>For some reason it felt good. It felt like a release that I needed. It felt like it kept me from worse thoughts or actions. It felt like I was saving my life at times. </em><em>I recognize that my thinking was twisted, but it had some truth to it. It did feel like a release. It did keep me from worse things. That is how I managed to justify these unthinkable actions.</em></p>
<p><em>It happened on and off for many years, but I can now say I am harm-free! I can&#8217;t say I am trigger-free. I can&#8217;t say I am impulse-free. But I am action-free, and that is what counts. When I feel the impulses rising, I have learned to divert my energies, to distract and try to do something else, especially something creative. For some people it is yoga, for me it is photography. Also, when I know I am going to be in a triggering situation, I will plan a reward or something nice for myself afterwards. I&#8217;ll admit that these tools don&#8217;t always work, but I&#8217;m trying my hardest. If one thing doesn&#8217;t work then I try another. I&#8217;m fighting. Fighting for my family, my friends. Fighting for myself, my life, my future. </em></p>
<p><em>So other people out there who are struggling with this, please keep fighting the impulses. It is not easy, I really understand that, it can be like an addiction, but there are ways to help fight. There are therapists, and therapeutic tools, like DBT. You can make a harm-free contract with your therapist or loved ones and promise to go to them when the impulses start. You can try distracting or doing &#8216;opposite action.&#8217; If you want to isolate, and you know it will likely lead to injury, do the opposite of that &#8211; go be around people. Go somewhere, even outside for a little walk. Even if you are walking alone, you are not alone. You are never alone. I am there with you, and everyone struggling. We are walking together.</em></p>
<p><em>Stay strong. Keep fighting.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-1095 alignnone" alt="Abandoned Chairs" src="http://lucidedit.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/blog-dystopia.jpg?w=270&#038;h=203" width="270" height="203" /></p>
<p>It was snowing. Again. Heavy and thick, like the clouds themselves were bleeding into the wind. Greta watched through a hole in the wood that covered most of the window, wondering how the sky could contain so much snow in the first place.</p>
<p>Although it was difficult to tell, since the light outside had been the same all day, curfew was approaching. The clock in the kitchen said it was just after five o’clock and curfew began at six. Greta peered through the snow, hoping to catch sight of her father’s shape among the swirling, endless white, but she couldn’t see him. She tried not to worry, but he was never late.</p>
<p>Greta glanced over her shoulder at the pot bubbling away on the stove. She had made a stew with the rabbits she&#8217;d caught yesterday, mixed with dried herbs, potatoes left over from the fall, and a can of green vegetables she’d taken from the basement storage pantry. It actually smelled pretty good and Greta’s stomach grumbled gently in agreement.</p>
<p>They would eat just as soon as father arrived.</p>
<p>Outside, the light started to change ever so subtly. The grey grew a tiny bit darker and the shadows deepened. Greta pressed her face against the glass and scoured the bleak landscape for her father.</p>
<p>Every day he made the trek into the city centre, past all the burned-out shells of buildings, over the metal bridge that had survived the devastation of ’38, and into what was left of the heart of the city. There, the council met to discuss the state of the city, listening to heart-wrenching stories and soliciting ideas that would help them rebuild the city and re-establish communication with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Father said they were fools to believe there was a world left with which they could communicate. If there was, surely they would have come looking for us, he said. In his mind, their silence meant they had suffered the same fate – or perhaps one even worse.</p>
<p>Greta didn’t remember the storms that had preceded the devastation. She had been a baby then. But she had heard all the stories. How one storm after another had hammered the city for months on end, slowly taking out the power grids and the communication towers, sending residents into a panicked frenzy as they fought each other for supplies and food in the stores that were still standing.</p>
<p>And then the devastation had hit. Earthquakes that lasted for days, thunderstorms that blew down concrete buildings, set fires across the city, and caused flooding of Biblical proportions. Residents of the city had retreated to homes, malls and churches, hoping the buildings would still be standing when the devastation passed. Hoping that it would, in fact, pass.</p>
<p>Of course, it did pass. After a week of being pounded by every force nature could hurl at them, the ground stopped shaking and the skies cleared. The residents that had survived emerged to a completely different world. Greta vaguely remembered coming up from the basement in her father’s arms, shielding her eyes from the sunlight as they stepped outside.</p>
<p>Once the shock had worn off, the new world took shape. Limited supplies meant increased competition. Factions formed, with some groups raiding others for food, supplies and even women. It was a chaotic time, but eventually another group intervened. Members of the army, who had survived in their underground bunkers with plenty of food, access to weapons, fuel and a handful of vehicles, formed a regime and put the curfew in place. To protect our residents, they explained.</p>
<p>For ten years, the army had been the wardens of the city. Every night they swept through the streets, promoting a sense of order. In the early days some of the newly formed factions had tried to take them on. The army’s response was swift and brutal. If you were out after curfew there were no questions, no chances to explain yourself, you were simply cut down. Order requires cooperation, the army said. The safety of all of us depends on it. You must obey the rules if we are to survive.</p>
<p>Father didn’t agree with the army’s position, but, like most residents, he never missed curfew. He believed in the work he was doing at the council and said that you had to pick your battles. Greta wasn’t sure what that meant, though she knew one day she would carry on her father’s work. After all, she was his only child and this was her world.</p>
<p>The sky was almost dark now. Greta looked at the clock. It was nearly six. She wondered if she should go and look for her father, but knew how angry he would be if she did. No one goes out at curfew, except the very foolish and the suicidal.</p>
<p>She returned to the window, narrowing her gaze in the hopes that she would see something. And she did. A lone figure was struggling through the thick blanket of snow, head down against the wind. She couldn’t see his face, but she knew it was her father. Greta breathed a sigh of relief and walked over to stir the stew.</p>
<p>It was only once she reached the stove that she heard the rumble of the army patrol vehicle outside the house. Suddenly, Greta understood her father’s words. You have to pick your battles. Heart pounding, she pulled the rifle from under the kitchen floorboards. It was loaded, just in case of an emergency. Then Greta grabbed her coat and went to get her father.</p>
