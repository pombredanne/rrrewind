			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_904" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 180px"><a href="http://yearstruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/170px-samuel_johnson_by_joshua_reynolds_2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-904" title="170px-Samuel_Johnson_by_Joshua_Reynolds_2" src="http://yearstruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/170px-samuel_johnson_by_joshua_reynolds_2.png" alt="" width="170" height="229" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Samuel Johnson frowning at Shakespeare&#039;s puns (courtesy of Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Johnson/" target="_blank">Samuel Johnson</a> called punning the lowest sense of humor. I would take offense but the man is dead, and he wouldn’t care. When he wasn’t speaking ill of puns, Johnson collected words to put in his little dictionary of the English language, frowned through all of Shakespeare’s plays because they are full of puns and then annotated them out of spite, got grouchy and criticized literature (in a scholarly way), and tossed off poems, essays, and biographies before breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, yes, we have a lot in common. But, we do not share the same opinion about puns. I think of them as the dark chocolate of humor; good any time of the day, at or between meals, with coffee or wine, with or without nuts, and in all forms.</p>
<div id="attachment_903" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://yearstruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5704626269_4b6061be1a_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-903" title="5704626269_4b6061be1a_z" src="http://yearstruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5704626269_4b6061be1a_z.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Well known pharmaceutical company (photo by gabrielsaldana at http://www.flickr.com/photos/gabrielsaldana/5704626269/</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. No, friend, I am not addicted to chocolate. I use it purely for <a href="http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/6-health-benefits-of-dark-chocolate.html" target="_blank">medicinal purposes</a>. First, chocolate is good for the heart. I have loved chocolate since before I remember, and that’s how long my heart has been beating. If I stop eating chocolate, my heart may stop. I can’t risk that. Second, chocolate is good for the brain. You have only to read this blog to see the effects of lots of dark chocolate on my brain. Impressive, no? (Note: some questions on this blog are for rhetorical purposes only and in no way imply that you need to answer.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the compulsive punning, I have spoken of it once before, and it is a kind of brain disorder called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foerster's_syndrome" target="_blank">Foerster’s Syndrome </a>that I self-diagnosed years ago. I have been self-diagnosing for years and have experienced multiple medical miracles along with bouts of alliteration in which I have been healed of life-threatening diseases of the nervous system, the digestive system, and for a short time, the bubonic plague, all without any medical intervention whatsoever. My baffled doctors attributed my symptoms to indigestion and the common cold. As if. No doubt there’s a connection between their bafflement and lack of chocolate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I’m asking for is a little compassion, friend, if and when I publish a post full of puns, even if it’s tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend Sydney and I took a trip a couple of hours north-west of Denver to Rock Mountain National Park. Having been here in Colo. for a couple of years now I&#8217;ve been wanting to get up and camp in the RMNP for a while. We finally got our chance and made the trip up there this past weekend. Below are a few of my favorite images from the trip. Most of which were shot on our last morning up there when I finally managed to get up before sunset and get to some great locations when the light was just perfect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This semester was one of the most tiring periods of my entire academic education. Every single weekend and holidays were like precious diamonds for me. Luckily it passed away like the wind and when winter break was finally upon us, I have decided to visit my brother in Ohio and relax. Of course, it wasn&#8217;t just slacking off all day long and playing Skyrim(because that&#8217;s what Ece from two years ago would do), I also showed the decency to make small trips to nearby cities. I&#8217;ve been to Washington, Atlantic City, Philly and my favorite city of all time, New York! My final stop of my not-so-productive winter break was Buffalo, NY, with the intentions of seeing Niagara Falls. It kind of falls into the category of `Stupid things to do in the middle of winter` because it gets incredibly cold and windy in Niagara Falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" title="04" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/04.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>One of my first long distance train journeys was this one. It was only for three hours, but still, it included trains for a fair amount of time. Getting to the station was the stressful part because my know-it-all brother thought  he didn&#8217;t need any navigation. We ended up in a godforsaken(and wrong, I might add) train station and figured out which train station to go to 10 minutes before the departure. Luckily, I made it to the right station and got to the train. yes, stress had ended but something was wrong. As the sun shined upon my face, I suddenly got the urge to take a photo of the coach I was in along with the outside, and realized my camera lens wasn&#8217;t working. The pictures were blurry, shutter wasn&#8217;t working and I almost started crying because all my plans were on hold.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-557" title="01" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/01.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Above picture is the small summary of the pain I was in. Luckily for me, I texted my dear friend Hande immediately, and she told me we can go around the town to search for a cheap and compatible lens for me Nikon. As I got off the train, I started walking towards the voice that was calling me. It was coming from a pepper red Audi. Hande and his boyfriend Enver were there to welcome me to Buffalo. They were kind enough to search for a lens with me for my camera after a really nice breakfast that included bacon, eggs, pancakes and unlimited coffee!! We basically tried every single camera store—both local stores and Best Buy to find 18-55 mm lens(because lets face it I have no money). Our last line of defense was the successful one and I got my lens back after driving at least 25 miles around town.  This small adventure took us more than 2 hours, we then decided it was time to go home to relax and then head out for the Niagara Falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-558" title="02" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/02.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>We took a &#8220;lazy break&#8221; for about an hour, and this also gave me time to practice my blackjack skills, because we were obviously going to gamble after the falls. Our companions, tea, cigarettes, Oreo and internet didn&#8217;t let us go for a while, but then we knew we had to leave soon if we wanted to see the Niagara falls before dusk. So we grabbed our stuff and drove to Niagara Falls with the fire-red Audi! After thirty minutes or so, we saw the Canadian side of the falls with the fancy towers and casinos. We parked the car and started walking and MAN!!! IT WAS COLD AS HELL.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-559" title="03" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/03.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Seriously. If there is a hell, it&#8217;s not fiery and hot. It&#8217;s FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW ABSOLUTE ZERO(yes, absolute zero, I said!!) and it definitely is Niagara Falls because all the mist coming from the falls turns into small pieces of ice that sprays your skin like small bullets and if you&#8217;re not wearing any gloves like I didn&#8217;t(I admit this was a stupid thing to do), your hands are going to be the ones that suffer. And this becomes a terrible burden because it feels like small needles are piercing your skin as you&#8217;re trying to take some good pictures and have fun with your friends. Try to take a little break. Either put your hands in your pockets or try to warm up in the gift shop.<br />
So remember. If there is a hell, it&#8217;s going to be really cold and it&#8217;s going to be Niagara Falls. But hell is not always bad! Think of all the awesome things you&#8217;ve done to get there&#8230; Okay, this was a terrible metaphor so let&#8217;s drop all this and let me tell you why Niagara Falls is awesome in Winter:</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-565" title="07" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/07.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Because it&#8217;s as beautiful and white as heaven could be. All that ice, snow and water just turns this place into somewhere magical because it&#8217;s nothing but white there. There are several places you can see the falls and one of them is an observation deck just in the imaginary border between Canada and  United States. The above picture was taken in that observation deck. There is another place I completely fell in love with. It&#8217;s the rightmost end of the falls if you look really closely. Yes, as you can imagine, it takes a really long time to get there and road to that place is incredibly painful but beautiful as always. It took me around thirty minutes to walk that half a mile but it was definitely rewarding. This is how it looked like while walking:</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" title="06" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/06.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="858" /></a>As you can see, it&#8217;s all ice. Even the grass was covered with a really thick layer of ice because of all the mist coming from the falls. Trying to walk to the end of that road where the people are was one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. Seriously. I am a terrible ice skater by nature and walking on ice is even worse. Especially if you have a really large backpack and a huge camera with you. But in the end, it was all rewarding and the scene we came up with was this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="05" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/05.jpg?w=575&#038;h=384" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Luckily for us, Hande&#8217;s boyfriend came to save the day with his fire-red car and picked us up from the beautiful hell that is Niagara Falls. Later in the day we went to the Seneca Casino and guess what? There are shitloads of people in there. I felt so sad because one of the greatest wonders of the world only had 50 people around it because it was really cold but the casino just a couple of hundred meters away from it had all the people inside. Gambling is seriously a problem in everywhere. and believe me when I say this, because I&#8217;ve already seen Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-566" title="08" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/08.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Enough of the sadness. We should be enjoying the beauty nature has to offer to us! I, personally, consider myself lucky to have seen this wonder and would definitely recommend you to see it on winter when there aren&#8217;t many people around to ruin the joy of seeing the falls and when everything is white and gives you the illusion of purity. Maybe next time, I&#8217;ll go to Niagara Falls on summer and take the exact same pictures!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>And also, I&#8217;d like to thank Hande and her boyfriend Enver for enduring me the whole time I spent there and giving me the quick tour. Your hospitality is very much appreciated!</em> <em>I hope one day I could return the favor!</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a goal since 2003 to run a marathon in every state. I&#8217;ve now run 21 marathons and feel like I&#8217;m finally transitioning from someone &#8220;trying to run marathons&#8221; to a &#8220;long distance runner.&#8221; As a result, I&#8217;ve decided to start writing more about my running, the experience, the challenges, and what I learn as long distance running has become a much more central part of my life.</p>
<p>I was going to blog more about running on my blog at <a href="http://www.feld.com">Feld Thoughts</a> but I decided there was probably a limited audience, and possibly a different audience, for my running experience. So I&#8217;ll still write periodically over there about my marathons, but I&#8217;ll save the workouts, the long rambling thoughts, the frustrations, the injuries, and the philosophy for over here.</p>
<p>Join me if you dare &#8211; including for a run sometime.</p>

<p>First, I noticed the doors.</p>
<p>I took a bus from Menara airport to Djemaa El-Fna, a large square in the heart of Marrakech’s old city. The bus swerved through a sea of motorized bikes, past flat stretches of fanned palms and arches marking unlit alleys. On the sidewalk I counted more feral cats than I’ve ever seen, and on the rooftops I caught glimpses of oversized nests and tall, toothpick-legged cranes.</p>
<p>We zigzagged between buildings the colors of rust, orange-pink and off white, with unpainted brick exposed on the sides. Elaborate grates decorated the arched windows. The Arabic tile was all geometric shapes and primary colors: chaos and balance. But the doors.</p>
<p>The doors were painted turquoise, seafoam green, red. Some were patterned with raised studs, others with thin scrolls or contrasting diamonds. As the bus sped towards the center square, the doors become vivid blurs against the burnt orange skyline.</p>

<a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555243545/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6555243545_c1b65f568b.jpg" alt="BlueDoor" width="445" height="445" /></a><br />
Night fell by the time my friends and I arrived at our riad, which was tucked in the maze of side streets of a residential neighborhood. We turned a few corners, walked through a children’s game of football, and found the right alleyway. I saw a door marked 18, just like our directions said, so I pushed it open and the six of us walked inside, backpacks and all.</p>
<p>Inside I saw richly threaded pillows, candles flickering through the cut-outs of metal tins, and… a family of four eating dinner? The woman herded us out of her living room, back into the alley, and pointed further down. Wrong door marked 18. I’d been in Morocco for an hour, and I’d managed to walk into a stranger’s home.</p>
<p>We found the right door, knocked first, and settled into our riad.</p>
<p>We sat in the lounge and planned out our trip over a pot of mint tea – a super sweet drink consumed in tiny, steaming cups. The riad offered a two day excursion into the Sahara desert. We argued amongst ourselves before realizing we couldn’t travel this close to the Sahara without going in. As we came to the decision, I felt a raindrop, and looked up through the open roof as the sky began pouring.</p>

<p>I woke up early for the excursion. I showered on the rooftop terrace, under the starlit sky, and listened to the roosters crow just as my hot water ran out.</p>
<p>We loaded into a van – our home for the next two days. We drove out of the city, around crumbling red mountains and over rocky cliffs, past cacti dripping with ruby fruit. We stopped at villages along the way, where I haggled for silver bracelets and drank an Arabic coke.</p>
<p>By sundown we’d reached the edge of the desert, where we mounted our camels and rode into the Sahara. Here’s what I’ve learned about camels: I don’t like them. Mine was too tall, too fat, a little bow-legged, and very fond of spitting. I also managed to get the camel with the sassiest hips, and when I dismounted two hours later, I felt every ounce of that sass in my aching legs. Can a camel look smug? I think so.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6425819161/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6425819161_c1ca0f7a4d.jpg" alt="My camel" width="445" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>But we set up our tents and ate vegetable tagines for dinner. We danced around the campfire and sang to each other. The sand, cool as the night air and finer than sugar, slipped through my fingers like silk. I stayed outside as long as I could, listening to the camels gossip, looking up at the clearest stars I’ve ever seen, until I woke up to a glorious sunrise edging over the dunes.</p>
<p>(For the record, the camel ride back in the morning is worse.)</p>

<p><a title="Moroccan spices by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555241303/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6555241303_4538ea5fca.jpg" alt="Moroccan spices" width="216" height="216" /> <a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555312619/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6555312619_8f3f55872a.jpg" alt="Nightmarket" width="216" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>We drove back through the snow capped Atlas Mountains, and seven hours later, returned to Marrakech. That night I explored Djemaa El-Fna, a square full of snake charmers, henna artists, and monkeys with chains around their necks. The night market offers heaped spices, fresh orange juice, and bin after bin of roasted nuts. I devoured dried apricots, figs, and dates by the handful.</p>
<p>In the morning, Marrakech experienced a torrential downpour. My friends and I picked that morning to visit the Majorelle Gardens, and by the time we walked there, my socks squelched. But thanks to the rain, we were the only visitors to the garden, and the sight of thick palms, lilies in still ponds, and a forest of bamboo moved the rain to the back of my mind.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555297713/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7013/6555297713_eed3ceb0a5.jpg" alt="RainyStreet" width="445" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>With two hours left in the country, I fell in love with the Souks, Marrakech’s mazelike market. The stalls sell everything from slippers and earrings to glazed pottery and gunpowder tea. The market only has a few entrances, and the knot of alleys and streets of stalls were impossible to navigate. For about twenty minutes, thoroughly lost in the heart of the Souks, I thought, “There’s no way I’m making my flight back.”</p>
<p>Now I’m back in Seattle, my semester abroad finished. I’ve seen my old friends and had family dinner, and I’m happy to be home. But a little part of me misses standing ankle deep in sand, scowling at my camel. The weight of lifting the lid of a tagine pot. I probably won’t stop missing the crumbling archways, the brilliant fabrics, the thrill of feeling completely foreign – until my next trip to Marrakech.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sony was gracious enough to send me the NEX-7 camera for my photo trip to Cuba.  Now that I am back in the states and have internet access once more, I wanted to take a moment and share with you my impressions of Sony’s new “wunderkind.”  I brought both my Canon 5D Mk II as well as the Sony NEX-7.  While I have a bevy of lenses for the Canon, I was only able to obtain the kit 18-55 and the 55-210 lenses for the Sony.</p>
<p>So, how did the NEX-7 fare?  In a word, “Amazing!”</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-1000-f-10-iso-400-80mm-55-210mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-81" title="Viva la Habana" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-1000-f-10-iso-400-80mm-55-210mm.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Viva la Habana</strong></em><br />
<em>1/1000 sec., f/10, ISO, 400, 55-210mm @ 80mm</em></p>
<p>I have been a professional photographer for some time.  These days, I work almost exclusively with Canon gear, and I am quite comfortable with it.  I know its “ins and outs” and have everything configured just the way I like it.  I only had a few days prior to the trip to become familiar with the Sony, so, I am not professing to be an expert in the system.  That being said, the system is quite easy to get around, and it took almost nothing to become comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Now, this is not going to be a review in any sense.  This camera has been so poked and prodded that if you want to know any detail you can easily find it out online.  I am also not going to provide images for the “pixel-peeper”set.  There are also tons of these images available, and they are of no interest to me.  I shoot photographs, not pixels.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to shoot with the camera in a unique setting, for real work, for a week.  This write-up is going to be strictly about my experience with the camera and my feelings about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-100-f-5-6-iso-250-55mm-18-55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-83" title="Where's My Mommy?" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-100-f-5-6-iso-250-55mm-18-55.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Butterfly<br />
</strong>1/100 sec., f/5.6, ISO 250, 18-55mm @ 55mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day One –</strong></p>
<p>We arrived the day before.  This was my first day roaming the streets of Havana.  I packed both the Canon and the Sony and headed out.  Given the size of the Sony, I packed both the kit lens and the 55-210.  Given its size, I bolted the 24-105 on the 5D MkII and packed the 50mm.  Wandering the streets you quickly are confronted with almost too much too shoot.  The decay is everywhere and the people are so friendly and unique.  Almost everyone wants you to take their picture.  This was the problem.</p>
<p>I did not want to take “posed” shots.  Every time I picked up the Canon, someone turned on their smile, gave me “thumbs-up” and posed for the camera.  Not the shots I wanted.  However, I found with the Sony I could simply flip up the screen, hold the camera at waist level, grumble as if I was secretly having problems with the camera, and get the shot.  This was perfect.</p>
<p>We spent the entire day wandering through the vast network of streets photographing everything that we came in contact with.  We were feeling our way through an entirely different culture – one very much suffering from arrested development.</p>
<p>When I got back to my hotel I was anxious to see how the images came out; to see how the Sony compared to its Canon brethren.  To my surprise, there was very little difference.  Ok, so the Sony lenses are not quite as sharp as the Canon’s.  Ok, so I made a few more errors getting to know the Sony (hit a few buttons I shouldn’t have).  However, the images on the Sony looked great.</p>
<p>One hitch though, I was shooting RAW+Jpeg.  The Jpeg engine in the Sony is not very good.  There is no way to turn off the noise suppression; you can only set it to LOW.  The Jpegs come out quite “smeary” and overly compressed.  However, once you load the images into Lightroom (ver. 3.6 is in testing), you really begin to get what this camera is capable of.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-88" title="Aged Cuban" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm_.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Aged Cuban<br />
</strong>1/60 sec., f/1.4, ISO 1600, 50mm (soft focus)</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Two –</strong></p>
<p>More wandering the neighborhoods.  Havana is a LARGE city; housing over two million people.  There is a lot to see.  This time I bolted the 70-200 f/2.8 IS II on the Canon and headed out.  Without a question, the Canon lens is sharper than the 55-210 on the Sony.  That is to be expected.  One costs over $2,000 and the other, just over $300.  However, if you stay away from the extremes on either end of the 55-210, it is an excellent performer, and quite sharp.</p>
<p>Today I got a little frustrated with the Sony.  You see, I kept hitting the RECORD button and the camera went into Movie Mode.  Once you are in Movie Mode, you are kind of stuck.  I couldn’t find an easy way to get back out.  When reviewing images, you are either looking at stills or movies.  Once I deleted my accidental movie, my display showed that there was nothing else to review – when I knew I had more than 300 still images on the card.  I panicked!  I eventually got back to still image mode and found all my images, but I can’t remember how I did it.  I need to check the manual, but this should be easier.</p>
<p>Also, I found that the Menu and Focus buttons are reversed in where they should be, and I found no way to change them in the Menu.  You see the Menu button is naturally under your thumb when shooting, while the Focus button is at the bottom of the camera’s back, a little awkward.  I hope this one is easily fixed in FW as they are not labeled on the camera and are just soft-buttons.</p>
<p>Got some great shots today, but due to the nature of using the camera, I found that I used the Sony about 75% of the time and the Canon only about 25% of the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-250-f-6-3-iso-500-161mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-89" title="Sneaky Pete" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-250-f-6-3-iso-500-161mm.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Sneaky Pete<br />
</strong>1/250 sec., f/6.3, ISO 500, 55-210mm @ 161mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Three –</strong></p>
<p>Went to a Tai Kwon Do tournament and a Boxing tournament today; fast action in low light.  Put the 50mm on the Canon, and put a Canon FD 50mm on the Sony with an adapter from Fotodiox.  Both lenses are f/1.4.</p>
<p>Got great shots with both cameras.  Using the Focus Peaking feature on the Sony I was easily able to focus, even in really low light.  Used the Auto ISO on the Sony.  I really wish they let you set the possible ISO range (another future FW update I hope).  ISO 800 is great, with 1600 just beginning to get a bit too noisy (though I found Noise Ninja cleans it up nicely).  Auto ISO will only go up to ISO 1600, though I would have restricted it to 800.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I retired to the hotel’s rooftop bar.  Took out the Sony and took some great sunset panoramas.  Then I discovered the vertical panorama function.  This is very difficult to do with a standard camera/tripod setup and a breeze with the Sony.  Loved it.</p>
<p>Today, about 50%-50% with images from the camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-5-0-iso-400-86mm-55-210mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-90" title="Blood Red on the Tracks" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-5-0-iso-400-86mm-55-210mm.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Blood Red on the Tracks<br />
</strong>1/160 sec., F/5.0, ISO 400, 55-210mm @ 86mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Four –</strong></p>
<p>Took a ferry across the bay to some of the small towns across from Havana taking as little gear as possible.  Once again I am carrying the entire Sony kit, as well as the Canon with the 24-105.  Trying to shoot with the Canon as much as the Sony, but the Sony is just so much better suited to street photography.  Decided to try out some of the “Creative Functions” on the Sony.  Turns out I dislike them just as much as I do any camera.  Great for the novice, and not really worthwhile for anything but vacation pics.</p>
<p>Also, the bracketing on the camera is basically useless as the range is not enough, only .3 EV.  This definitely needs to be addressed in FW.  Others have mentioned this, and I really want to be sure I add my voice to theirs.</p>
<p>Once again, most all of my images are from the Sony.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91" title="Tai Kwon Do" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Tai Kwon Do<br />
</strong>1/60 sec., f/1.4, ISO 1600, 50mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Five –</strong></p>
<p>Hired a guide and driver and headed out to Hershey, Cuba.  Yes, you read that right, the Communist version of Hershey, PA.  Also founded by the Hershey Company in the 1920’s to process sugar for the purpose of creating chocolate.</p>
<p>The place is falling apart these days, but there are still the remains of the factory, some parts of which are still in operation, though not making sugar for Hershey or anyone else.  There are also the remains of the planned town (think Levittown) and the electric train which Hershey built to move people to and from the major city centers.</p>
<p>I have decided that, since we will be walking quite a lot today to leave my Canon at home.  This is going to be a 100% Sony day.  I know I am taking a risk here, but so far, the camera has proven to be a real winner.</p>
<p>Since I was using the camera exclusively today, I ran out of battery and had to swap with the spare.  When I did that, I noticed that the camera lost some of its settings (most noticeably the settings for the EVF – in which I had a histogram display).  No problem to reset, but I am hoping that this is corrected in the final FW.  I shot over 1,000 images today and went through two batteries.</p>
<p>Also, found that the electronic switch for the eye-control on the EVF prevents the camera from going to sleep.  You see when the camera is hanging on your neck, the switch is constantly activated, thus the camera never goes to sleep.  Another simple FW change to only use a button push to wake the camera, would solve this problem.</p>
<p>However, all in all, a good day.</p>

<p><strong>Day Six –</strong></p>
<p>Today was spent in Casablanca, Cuba.  Just to be fair, I took the Canon and its complement of lenses with me this morning.  What can I say, heavy and cumbersome.  I got some great shots, but I also think there are shots I didn’t get because of the size of the system.  No “sneaky shooting” here.  I screamed “PHOTOGRAPHER” wherever I went.  I tried to get into the shipyards, but was waived off.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have gotten had I had my little Sony with me.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I put the Canon aside and once again set out into the city with the Sony.  It is the last day in Havana and I want to get the most out of it.  I need something light and fast in order to get what I am after.  I head into Chinatown (yes, Havana has a Chinatown) and start shooting.  I wetn into stealth mode and no one knew what I was up to.</p>
<p>In the end, I am very pleased with what I am able to capture, and I am already planning my return trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-9-0-iso-640-82mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-93" title="Mark's Car" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-9-0-iso-640-82mm.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Mark&#8217;s Car<br />
</strong>1/160 sec., f/9.0, ISO 640, 55-210mm @ 82mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion –</strong></p>
<p>First, let me mention some items which I overlooked in my overview.</p>
<p>Once you use the EVF in the Sony you will miss it on every camera you own.  While it is not quite as clear as a true optical viewfinder, it is extremely close.  The ability to immediately see the changes to your images as you make them is invaluable, as is the ability to view the histogram in the bottom right of the display.  Shooting dark complexions against bright, colorful backgrounds was only possible with this feature.</p>
<p>The shutter responsiveness is truly lightning-quick.  This is not to say the autofocus is fast; it isn’t.  It is serviceable, though like most contrast detection autofocus systems, it hunts in low light.  However, when you press the shutter, the response is instant.  There are a few photos I could not have gotten without this feature.</p>
<p>The fact that the viewfinder is on the far-left edge of the camera is also a major plus and a definite advantage over those who add an EVF to the hot-shoe.  This way you can place the camera up to your right eye and leave you left eye open to see the scene and what is about to come into frame.  Photographing the old cars of Cuba was much easier when I left both eyes open.</p>
<p>The big Achilles heel of the NEX-7 is the availability of quality lenses at reasonable prices.  While the kit lens and the 55-210 are competent, they are nothing to write home about.  Given the capabilities of the system, it cries out for new and better lenses to go with it.  While the APS-C sensor in the NEX is clearly superior to the Micro 4/3rds sensors we have seen to date, Micro 4/3rds has the distinct advantage when it comes to lens quality and selection.  Hopefully, that will change with time.</p>
<p>I have briefly covered my experiences with the camera over a week in Cuba.  I should note that the FW version of the camera I had available to me was version .06, so I am certain a lot of the FW issues I mentioned will be fixed prior to, or just after the camera’s release.</p>
<p>In the end, I am now totally convinced that the future of digital photography will incorporate high-quality EVF in almost all cameras.  This is just the beginning of this technology.  Also, the need for the large SLR may also be starting to end.  Given the capabilities of the new mirror less cameras, I see no reason for overly large bodies (except that they can currently support much larger batteries).</p>
<p>I am already planning my return trip to Cuba.  The country is a photographer’s dream.</p>
<p>My Canon gear will be staying at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>UPDATE &#8211; December 9, 2011</strong></p>
<p>I have just heard from Sony that the NEX-7 (body only) will begin shipping the week of the 12th (next week).  These will be limited availability direct from Sony, with the Kit version and sales through third-parties following shortly thereafter.  This is great news for all who have been waiting.</p>
<p>At the same time, I should be able to post the PDF version of the manual so that anyone interested can begin to prepare for the arrival of their pre-orders.</p>
<p>Lastly, for those looking for a great, in-depth review of the NEX-7, how it works with third-party lenses, and just about anything else you would like to know, check out Luminous Landscape&#8217;s <a title="Luminous Landscape - Rolling Review of NEX-7" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/sony_nex_7_rolling_review.shtml" target="_blank">Rolling Review of the NEX-7</a>.</p>
