				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lifeintheboomerlane.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/aging-facefully/goldie/" rel="attachment wp-att-4610"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4610" alt="goldie" src="http://lifeintheboomerlane.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/goldie.jpg?w=300&#038;h=250" height="250" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>A favorite activity of celeb mags, when they aren’t detailing Taylor Swift’s boyfriend du jour or the imminent break up and/or marriage of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, is to haul out photos of older actresses and to shriek “More beautiful than ever!” “Never ages!” “What is her Secret?” “These Older Actresses Get Hotter Every Year!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>A favorite subject is Goldie Hawn.  In photo after photo, throughout the years, she flashes before our eyes. </strong> An adorable and hot twenty-something.  An adorable and hot thirty-something.  An adorable and hot forty-something. An adorable and hot fifty-something.  An adorable and hot sixty-something (67, to be exact).</p>
<p><strong>So it may come as a shock to some of us to have seen the latest photo of La Goldie in all her natural 67-year-old glory. </strong> Sans personal make up artist.  Sans personal hair stylist.  And most of all, in the moment, as opposed to fixing her facial expression to be camera-ready.  (If any of you have ever been out in the world and pass by a mirror unexpectedly,  you may know what I mean).</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get real here</strong>. Goldie Hawn is a great looking woman.  But she isn’t a great looking 30-year-old.  She is a great looking 67-year-old.  She has “good bones.” She works hard to maintain her body and she has, at her disposal any number of cosmetic procedures to help keep her face in line and her lips out of line.  But age is age. And cellular structure, whether it resides in the bodies of the most humble or the most famous, obeys natural law.  It is oblivious to how famous, how rich, how entitled, how desperate we may be.</p>
<p><strong>By elevating Goldie Hawn (and Demi Moore and Sophia Loren and Helen Mirren) to a category that defies natural law is to demean the age that they are.</strong>  Can we just acknowledge that Goldie Hawn is a great looking woman, period, without comparing her to a chronological age she left in the dust decades ago?</p>
<p><strong>And while we are at it, let’s bring this down to Real World level</strong>.  Let’s compliment/support each other, not by saying inane things like, “You look ten years younger than your age!” but instead to “You are a fabulous looking women.”  If I hear one more woman tell me that everyone she knows thinks she looks ten years younger than her age, I might spit.</p>
<p><strong>Now back to the photo that started all the fuss</strong>.  It’s Goldie, looking like she is headed to or away from the gym.  She is wearing a form-fitting tank top (I stopped wearing those in 1992).  Her hair is long and healthy (Damn her).  She is looking down (never the best view of anyone’s face, over age 12).  Her facial sags and wrinkles are on full view.  Give the woman a break.</p>
<p><strong>Now Husband is enamored of taking photos of me, in the moment, that would put Goldie’s photo to shame</strong>. He thinks it’s funny.  I think his camera is on borrowed time. I have no issue with morning hair (which does defy natural law) or seeing my face without make up (it’s how it looks most of the time, anyway.)  I do have an issue with seeing myself without a smile on my face.  I’ve noticed that the older I get, the bigger my smile is in photos.  This means that either I’m happier with life as the years go by, or that I’ve realized that smiling is a natural face lift. Or  maybe both.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s to you, Goldie</strong>.  You rock. If I hit the gym regularly for two years and spend hours pumping iron, will I be able to wear a tank top like yours at age 67?  Alas, I’ll never find out. I’m too lazy. But I will keep reminding myself to walk around with a perpetual smile on my face.</p>
<p>Say “cheese.”  Just don’t eat it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back, I did a post bemoaning my inability to <a title="I Can’t Write a Sex Scene" href="http://essaalroc.com/2012/11/08/i-cant-write-a-sex-scene/">write a sex scene</a>. At the time, I considered it one of the very rare areas of difficulty for me…at least in writing. I’m mainly bad at everything else I do. Dating, parenting, parallel parking, doing that thing with your thumb where it looks like you’re taking it off but you’re really not, pretty much everything is an ‘area of opportunity for me’. Except for writing. I always thought I was ok at writing.</p>
<p>Then today, I had to turn down a job. Why? Because I was incapable of doing the writing required for it. The subject matter? G-rated humor.</p>
<p>In the past, I worked for this company that runs a clever little website. You upload a photo, it uploads a caption for the photo. They hired me before to create those captions. It was actually a really fun job. 100 snarky, mean and sarcastic one liners. As I am the queen of caustic one liners, I whipped those things off like it was nothing. They were very pleased with my work and a little frightened of me as a person.</p>
<p>Then, they asked me to do it again. But this time, no snark. Instead, these captions would be for parents and grandparents needing baby picture captions and whatnot.  “Sure,” I said. “I can do G-rated. How hard can it be?”</p>
<p>Famous last words.</p>
<p>Today, I spent 2 hours (not even exaggerating) staring at a photo of a cute little baby boy with a sad face. I stared and I waited for inspiration…and waited…and waited. Oh and inspiration came, but it came in the form of my true, blue-style humor. Every thought that came to me was a mean quip about how annoying children are, about drunk babies, about breast feeding, about people who breastfeed for way to long. Then I thought about how ugly this kid was getting the longer I looked at him. Nothing clean. Nothing nice. All hilarious. The things I said about that baby in my head today will haunt me to my grave…and also make me chuckle a little. Then, I pictured the horrified look on some grandmother’s face as her adorable grandson&#8217;s picture was plastered with the caption “Stupid broken condom!!!” and I chuckled even more.</p>
<p>I am a terrible person.</p>
<p>I never thought that I would run into an area so large that I was incapable of writing about. Just as I was working thought my sex scene issues, with the help of a large amount of tequila and many, many photos of Julian McMahon,  I ran into an entire genre that isn’t just difficult for me to write. It’s impossible.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing; I was born a cynic. When my parents took me to see E.T., two year old Essa stormed out while everyone was sobbing, declaring that it was ‘sappy bullshit’. I don’t get the warm fuzzies. I don’t believe in happy endings (unless they are the kind you get at an unlicensed massage parlor) and I flinch if someone mentions feelings. It was how I was designed. For the most part, it’s done ok for me. Then this happens.</p>
<p>I’d like to say I’m going to work on it, but I probably won’t, because I know it’s a futile task. I will never be classy and I will never be clean. I will always be wrapped in a hard shell of cynicism and I will never giggle over baby shoes or tell a joke suitable for a church picnic. Even if I tried, it would all ring false and it wouldn’t be funny, it would just be sad.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite authors are clean. I absolutely love Dave Barry, but I could never be like him. His posts are family friendly and I am the exact opposite. I’m for ‘restricted audiences’. I’m the girl you don’t invite to the wedding because she gets in a drunken fight. I’m the girl you don’t ask to come to the funeral, because crying skeeves me out. I’m the girl that doesn’t get an invitation to the baby shower, because at the last one, I gave the expectant mother a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of gin. I am not ‘family friendly’. I am ‘family enemy’ and there is really nothing I can do but embrace it.</p>
<p>God bless those who appreciate blue humor.</p>
<p>***On another note, not related to my suckish writing, I released a novella today that is wildly inappropriate, filled with profanity, but lacks the sex scene that I am not yet comfortable enough to write. You can check out my new book, The Apology, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Apology-ebook/dp/B00AHI5R8K">here</a>.***</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, there have been all kinds of natural disasters, not to mention strange weather patterns in general. (One mild winter in <a class="zem_slink" title="North Dakota" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=47.5,-100.5&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=47.5,-100.5 (North%20Dakota)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">North Dakota</a> last season was awesome, yet terrifying, because it&#8217;s so uncharacteristic. This one&#8217;s rounding out to be pretty similar.) And even though I might have been a little nervous about it myself when I first heard of the whole &#8220;2012&#8243; thing a few years ago, I&#8217;m now convinced that <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html">there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;ve only got 19 days left</a>. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>1. The <a class="zem_slink" title="The Rise and Fall of the Maya Empire" href="http://www.history.com/topics/maya" target="_blank" rel="historycom">Mayans</a> made <a class="zem_slink" title="Calendar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">calendars</a>, not predictions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Why are we banking predictions of the future on a civilization that couldn&#8217;t predict its own demise? Yes, it&#8217;s still a mystery and archeologists aren&#8217;t sure what necessarily caused it, but it certainly happened quickly. You&#8217;d think a big disaster might have been something they could foretell. That is, if they ever claimed to be <a title="Prediction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">foretelling</a> anything. Let&#8217;s give the Mayans some credit here. They were pretty advanced people. They probably realized that the notion of predicting the future was quackery, themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_994" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 447px"><a href="http://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/quackery-snake-oil-and-local-fixes/"><img class="size-full wp-image-994" alt="I couldn't resist." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/quackery.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">So, their calendar happens to end on December 21, 2012. Ours ends on December 31 every year. What if some futuristic space people come to <a title="Earth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Earth</a> in a thousand years, find one of our old calendars, and assume we predicted the end of the world because of that? As for the 2012 thing, maybe they just got sick of making calendars at that point. Or maybe they were like, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s like, 900 A.D. I think 2012 is more than enough. Let&#8217;s take a break. We&#8217;ll make more calendars in like 1980.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 347px"><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?q=mayans+making+calendars&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tbo=d&amp;biw=1422&amp;bih=651&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=sxB6e_lTt6GGmM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.soberinanightclub.com/2010/01/mayan-calendar.html&amp;docid=ZJ4eh1rbTNVtFM&amp;imgurl=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_I2uQkGxIykM/S0F6V30uyfI/AAAAAAAAIVA/Ea3mbcuskcw/s400/calendar%252Bbizarro.jpg&amp;w=337&amp;h=400&amp;ei=6K-7UO6IFcOayQG4wYDADw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=4&amp;vpy=296&amp;dur=2571&amp;hovh=245&amp;hovw=205&amp;tx=81&amp;ty=196&amp;sig=110236641377929043143&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=141&amp;tbnw=118&amp;start=25&amp;ndsp=31&amp;ved=1t:429,r:33,s:0,i:190"><img class="size-full wp-image-993" alt="Oh, how I love this." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/calendar-bizarro.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, how I love this.</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>2. Some are catching on to the fact that <a class="zem_slink" title="Taylor Swift" href="http://taylorswift.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Taylor Swift</a> is not necessarily all that and a bag of gluten free popcorn chips. (Trust me, in spite of any &#8220;gluten free&#8221; connotations, those things are delicious.)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m not necessarily a Swift fan. At first, I thought it was an irrational dislike, but honestly, I just don&#8217;t see why everyone flips out and thinks she&#8217;s the greatest ever. As far as singing and songwriting, she&#8217;s pretty average among her competition. A majority of her songs are pretty much about the same thing &#8211; heartbreak, relationships, boys suck, yada yada. They all sound pretty similar. And now she&#8217;s not even staying true to her country roots, getting all &#8220;popified&#8221; with her new album. (Does anyone else think the, &#8220;WeeeeEEEEE!&#8221; in &#8220;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&#8221; sounds like a pig call? You know, &#8220;Sooooo Weeeee!&#8221; Maybe it&#8217;s just me.)</p>
<div id="attachment_995" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+GeekandSundry/posts/BKSSmBJjfjH"><img class="size-full wp-image-995" alt="She has summoned the pigs!" src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/teacuppig.jpeg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">She has summoned the pigs!

<p style="padding-left:30px;">But I always said jokingly, &#8220;If the world ends in 2012, it&#8217;ll be because Taylor Swift is some kind of spy and brainwashed the nation into trusting her and thinking she&#8217;s perfect.&#8221; I guess I just don&#8217;t fully buy her squeaky clean image. And my less-than-impressed opinion of her has gotten me yelled at multiple times. Each time, the yellers to try to convince me to love her. Why? If someone isn&#8217;t particularly a fan of any other music artist, people generally shrug it off thinking, &#8220;Eh, to each his own.&#8221;  What makes her so different? So, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s bothered me about her.</p>
<div id="attachment_996" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><a href="http://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/MjAxMi01MjExZjc4MWVkMDc5YzA0"><img class="size-full wp-image-996" alt="I'm just sayin'..." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/mjaxmi0znjqwm2jhyjrkzjhiytzk.png?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that opinion is starting to grow, much to my surprise. So, there goes that theory. One more point for the world continuing to exist.</p>
<div id="attachment_997" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://rainbow-machine.deviantart.com/art/Happy-World-210726016"><img class="size-full wp-image-997" alt="Yay!" src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/happy_world_by_rainbow_machine-d3hgl8g.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yay!</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>3. Hello, does anyone remember the whole &#8220;Rapture&#8221; thing?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Yeah, that didn&#8217;t happen. Although, it did make for an awesome excuse to have Rapture Parties and to sit around watching horror movies and drinking. December 21 will be an excuse to bring on the even more awesome <a class="zem_slink" title="Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">End of the World</a> Parties!</p>
<div id="attachment_998" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://beerstreetjournal.com/shock-top-brews-with-chili-for-end-of-the-world/"><img class="size-full wp-image-998" alt="Plus, it was a great excuse for Shock Top to make this beer that I couldn't resist getting last night.

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>4. We&#8217;ve only gotten through the mid-season finale of the Walking Dead. Every episode&#8217;s enough of a cliffhanger as it is. There&#8217;s no way we can hold out that long.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, we actually haven&#8217;t even made it that far yet, but in approximately six hours we will. I&#8217;m going to have a hard enough time waiting until whenever it starts up again; I really don&#8217;t need an apocalypse screwing it up. However, if zombies were to be involved, at least I would have learned some great survival techniques.</p>
<div id="attachment_999" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://www.gorestruly.com/2012/03/22/the-walking-dead-meme-invades/"><img class="size-full wp-image-999" alt="Lori made the zombie apocalypse so much worse than it had to be." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/lori-sucks.png?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lori made the zombie apocalypse so much worse than it had to be.</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>5. I <em>finally</em> bought an iPhone. I better get more than 2 weeks to use it.<br />
</strong>My <a class="zem_slink" title="Android phones" href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/?capcode=AGE" target="_blank" rel="tmobile">Android phone</a> spazzed out on me late last spring, so I got frustrated, went off the deep end, and downgraded to a dumbphone. It was nice to get away from paying for a data plan for a while, but this phone is even crappier than the phone I had in high school. I can only take teeny baby pictures on my teeny baby screen. I can&#8217;t take videos. It doesn&#8217;t like to send texts all the time, and it definitely doesn&#8217;t like to let me know when I&#8217;ve received one. So, a shiny, white iPhone 5 has become my <a class="zem_slink" title="Gift" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Christmas present</a> from me to me. It&#8217;s currently hurtling toward me and should be here by Wednesday, leaving me about 16 days with an iPhone if those who believe the end is near are right after all.</p>
<div id="attachment_1002" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://mybullfrog.com/zte-adamant-feature-packed-global-ready-and-affordable/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1002" alt="Hawt." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/verizon-zte-adamant.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hawt. My dumbphone.</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>6. This morning, I drank coffee with creamer that expired in September. If I made it through that, I can make it through anything.<br />
</strong>I know this doesn&#8217;t help the rest of the world have any hope, but I&#8217;m feeling particularly resilient for living through that. I made it through half the cup of coffee before I decided that something was really wrong, and those chunks floating in it probably weren&#8217;t just undissolved sweetener. So, if living through drinking curdled <a class="zem_slink" title="Non-dairy creamer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dairy_creamer" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">coffee creamer</a> adds any credibility to my End of the World Survival resume, let&#8217;s slap it on there.</p>
<div id="attachment_1003" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 180px"><a href="http://pushupsandcarrots.wordpress.com/2012/03/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1003" alt="Me, reading the expiration date." src="http://kaitlinring.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/yucky-face.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, reading the expiration date.</p></div>
<p>But in all seriousness, I am kind of interested in these apocalypse theories, no matter how whacked out they might seem, and I like the idea that this whole December 21 thing isn&#8217;t an apocalypse, but an <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/12/111220-end-of-world-2012-maya-calendar-explained-ancient-science/">ending of one cycle and the beginning of a new one</a>, as cheesy as it sounds.</p>
<p>But, hey, if you&#8217;ve been stockpiling food and alcohol for bartering, like a lot of the <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/">Doomsday Preppers </a>I&#8217;ve seen on TV, that won&#8217;t mean it was all for nothing. It&#8217;ll just make your End of the World Party that much more awesome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1581" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 137px"><a href="http://eagleeyededitor.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/comic-tales-from-the-church-side/christmas-tree/" rel="attachment wp-att-1581"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1581" alt="Christmas tree" src="http://eagleeyededitor.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/christmas-tree.jpg?w=127&#038;h=150" height="150" width="127" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Christmas tree image courtesy of sullivan, Morguefile.</p></div>
<p>For some unknown reason, funny incidents happen a lot at the churches I&#8217;ve attended. Once, a bat flew into the room during choir rehearsal and somebody chased it out with a rolled-up newspaper. There was another time when <a href="http://eagleeyededitor.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/the-magic-of-the-everyday-story/" target="_blank">the Advent wreath caught on fire at a country church I attended</a> or the time when a young choir member accidentally dropped a church bulletin over the choir loft railing and it smacked a startled parishioner on the head.</p>
<p>When I was younger, our minister held up a sprig of some three-leafed plant (three leaves to represent the Trinity) during one children&#8217;s sermon and asked the kids to identify what it was. One kid hollered &#8220;POISON IVY!&#8221; and the minister laughed, &#8220;Oh, I hope not!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s baptisms, which are always fun to watch. Baptisms involve one set of parents, one set of godparents and a baby. Each baby reacts to the baptism differently; some roar and some wail. (I can&#8217;t blame &#8216;em; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like cold water poured on my head from a stranger, either.) One baby I remember appeared comically bemused by the entire process. (&#8220;Who ARE all these people and why are they staring at ME?&#8221;)</p>
<p>One really funny baptism incident involving an older baby occurred during a church retreat. The baby gazed at the minister, turned her head downward to check out the font containing the baptismal water, looked up at the minister again and said, &#8220;Phhbbbt!&#8221; as if to say, &#8220;If you think you&#8217;re putting that cold stuff on ME, buster, you&#8217;ve got another think coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the most comic happenings occur at Christmas, it seems. We have two Christmas Eve services, an early service that happens around dinnertime and a later service that ends at midnight. At the late service, two acolytes carry torches, one carries the small cross and another carries the big cross. One year, a torch-bearing acolyte accidentally inhaled some of the candle smoke from the torch, got woozy and fainted. A young parishioner turned to her mother and said worriedly, &#8220;Mom, is he <em>dead</em>?&#8221; Her mom hastened to reassure her that the acolyte had only fainted.</p>
<p>Another year, our minister was doing a sermon at the late service. And then we heard it: &#8220;BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!&#8221; Somebody&#8217;s watch was sounding an alarm. Our imperturbable minister, used to these kinds of interruptions, calmly kept going while the watch&#8217;s owner hastily shut it off.</p>
<p>I remember another service where there was a Christmas pageant. Kids dressed up as the various people from the Nativity, animals and angels. I was sitting and waiting in the parish hall prior to the service and one angel bent her Christmas-tinsel halo into a different shape than the usual circle. She looked at me and explained in a mock-haughty huff, &#8220;Circular halos are <em>so</em> last season!&#8221; I had to laugh at this fashionista in progress.</p>
<p>But the best Christmas story (so far) involves a children&#8217;s sermon. The minister requested the parents to send their kids to the front of the church in order to tell them a Nativity story. The minister asked the kids to explain who was in the stable that night.  The kids guessed cows, sheep and other animals. &#8220;Who else?&#8221; the minister wanted to know. One little girl piped up at the top of her lungs: &#8220;AND MARY&#8217;S BOYFRIEND!&#8221; which caused the entire congregation to erupt with laughter at the way she phrased it.</p>
<p>One day, I&#8217;ll have to collate all of these stories from everybody at church and publish them in a small book, I think. It would be a good thing to collect all of these stories before they&#8217;re lost and forgotten.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>England&#8217;s monarchy has long been associated with the territory of Wales. From Edward of Caernarfon, the first heir presumptive to be named Prince of Wales in 1301, to Elizabeth II&#8217;s son Charles, who assumed the title in 1958, it has been portrayed as a indispensable part of the royal inheritance. Such claims, however, were only made possible by the conquest of Wales and the death, in 1282, of the last native prince of Wales&#8211;Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. These events were draw to a close with the appropriation of the princely title, but not before their main architect&#8211;King Edward I&#8211;left his indelible mark upon the Welsh landscape.</p>

<p>Throughout the northwest corner of Wales known as the Kingdom of Gwynedd (now Snowdonia) Edward built a series of castles unlike anything seen in the country until that time. Raised between 1283 and ca. 1300, the fortresses at Conwy, Harlech, Beaumaris, and Caernarfon(to name only the most spectacular) were an unmistakable statement of England&#8217;s martial prowess and sophistication.</p>
<p>For the most part, they were constructed close by the sea, where they could easily be provisioned by boat. This was a practical choice, given the difficult mountain terrain further inland, but it also enhanced the beauty of structures fit for royal residence. The picturesque (and imposing) setting of Conwy can be seen in the photo below, where the castle dominates a town still ringed by Edward&#8217;s mediaeval walls.</p>
<div id="attachment_1267" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/800px-conwy_castle_and_bridges/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1267"><img class=" wp-image-1267 " alt="Conwy Castle, situated along a riverbank, is still exceptionally well-preserved.

<p>This picturesque site had been the grounds of the abbey of Aberconwy, a large Cistercian house, as well as the burial site of Llywelyn the Great&#8211;a beloved Welsh hero. By relocating the monks, Edward clearly intended to overbuild or stamp out any reminders of independent Welsh greatness. The crassness of his gesture, however, is belied by the fantastical landscape of towers crowning his new construction.</p>
<div id="attachment_1268" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/conwy_castle_wales/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1268"><img class="size-full wp-image-1268" alt="When I visited Conwy, I used a whole roll of film trying to capture the skyscape from every angle.

<p>With two barbicans and 8 towers, Conwy presents an aspect at once militaristic and Arthurian. Its ample space inside the castle wards, accommodating a large hall, furthermore, clearly allowed for a leisurely enjoyment of the setting. All of this came at a steep price (an estimated £15,000) and was completed under the supervision of the king&#8217;s builder James of St. George.</p>

<p>By comparison, Harlech&#8217;s appearence is far more uncompromising. The site itself was probably associated with British royalty before Edward I&#8217;s arrival, since in the Welsh tale of the Mabinogion, it appears as the seat of the giant king Bendigeidfran.</p>
<div id="attachment_1270" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/harlech-castle-a-general-view-of-the-castle/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1270"><img class="size-full wp-image-1270" alt="The defences of solid Harlech are augmented by the outcrop of stone on which it was built. " src="http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/harlech_castle_-_cadw_photograph.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The defences of solid Harlech are augmented by the outcrop of stone on which it was built. (Cadw via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Harlech_Castle_-_Cadw_photograph.jpg">WIkimedia</a>)</p></div>
<p>In the 13th century, the towering rock on which the castle stood was linked to the sea by a purpose built canal. Easy to supply, but of difficult access (the 61m path to the top is exposed to the castle&#8217;s defenders), Harlech was a statement of the sophistication of English military architecture.</p>
<div id="attachment_1272" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/800px-harlech_castle_plan/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1272"><img class="size-full wp-image-1272" alt="Harlech's round towers and system of concentric walls were cutting edge features." src="http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-harlech_castle_plan.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Harlech&#8217;s round towers and system of concentric walls were cutting edge features. (Cadw via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Harlech_Castle_Plan.jpg">Wikimedia</a>)</p></div>
<p>Notable in Harlech is the symmetry of the design, as seen in the plan above. Although some elements of Conwy displayed this elegant sense of proportion, it is in Harlech that this preference is more strongly seen.</p>
<p>It culminates, however, in the unfinished behemoth of Beaumaris, often cited as the most technically perfect castle in Britain, if not in the whole of mediaeval Europe. From above, the similarities with Harlech are readily apparent, although the desire for ever more&#8211;of everything&#8211;has here been given free rein.</p>
<div id="attachment_1273" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/aerial-viewbeaumaris-castle-cd34angleseynorthcastleshistoric-sites/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1273"><img class="size-full wp-image-1273" alt="Beaumaris, on Angelsey, is a palace wrapped inside a fortress wrapped inside a moat.

(Cadw via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beaumaris_aerial.jpg">Wikimedia</a>)</p></div>
<p>Designed with the capacity to hold 11 different households, this castle is as much a residential palace as a military strongpoint, perhaps expressing Edward&#8217;s desire to integrate North Wales into the regular circuit of kingly travel.  By this point, however, Edward I had become in a costly battle over the rule of Scotland, and even the English monarch&#8217;s seemingly boundless purse ran dry. Beaumaris, his most ambitious project, was put on hold, and work never resumed.</p>
<p>All three of the castles we have already toured shared a similar design. High walls&#8211;ideally in concentric shapes&#8211;were combined with round towers and projecting barbicans designed to be impregnable. The last of Edward&#8217;s great castles, though, is radically different.</p>
<div id="attachment_1274" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/800px-caernarfon_castle_1994/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1274"><img class="size-full wp-image-1274" alt="From the Golden Horn to the Menai Straits, Caernarfon brought imperial aspirations to North Wales. " src="http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-caernarfon_castle_1994.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From the Golden Horn to the Menai Straits, Caernarfon brought imperial aspirations to North Wales. (Herbert Ortner via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Caernarfon_Castle_1994.jpg">Wikimedia</a>)</p></div>
<p>Those familiar with the walls of Constantinople will immediately recognise the polygonal towers and banded masonry which were famed across the mediaeval world. That Edward I used this quintessentially Roman and imperial style in his own construction is both a reflection of the realities of the conquest, and of the site&#8217;s older history. The (still extant) Roman fort of Segontium , near to Caernarfon, had led to the identification of this town as the burial place of Magnus Maximus, a Roman usurper from Britain&#8217;s Dark Age history.</p>
<div id="attachment_1275" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/crowning-perfection-the-welsh-castles-of-edward-i/450px-winchester_round_table_04/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1275"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1275" alt="Now hung in Winchester, this mediaeval round table was first used to indulge Edward I's flair for Arthuriana. " src="http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/450px-winchester_round_table_04.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" height="300" width="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Now hung in Winchester, this mediaeval round table was first used to indulge Edward I&#8217;s flair for Arthuriana. (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Winchester_Round_Table_04.JPG">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</p></div>
<p>Not only did Edward exhume &#8220;his&#8221; body (as he did to Arthur at Glastonbury) as an expression of his mastery over the heroes of Welsh history, but he also staged a series of Arthurian events which included the making of a round table.</p>
<p>Taken together, these castles demonstrate far more than Edward I&#8217;s military needs or the skill of his master architect. They also demonstrate how an ideological war was waged over the landscape of Gwynedd. Their careful planning&#8211;which maximised Edward&#8217;s ability to quash local pride and sense of history&#8211;and deliberately impressive design remain as a testament to the deep divide between Wales and England at the close of the 13th century.</p>
<p>When considered in this light, their perfection is more than a matter of harmonious proportions. It also embraces the totality of Edward&#8217;s campaign of conquest over hearts and minds, and not simply over territory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thoughtfulpastor.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/advent-candle-blur.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2407" alt="advent-candle-blur" src="http://thoughtfulpastor.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/advent-candle-blur.jpg?w=590"   /></a>Dear Christmas Advice-Giver,</p>
<p>Why are some of the religious Christmas Carols so sad when this is the season of happiness?  I mean, really, “In the Bleak Midwinter?”  Nothing like a downer.  Aren’t we all supposed to be just super joyful right now?  And what does “bleak” mean anyway?</p>
<p>Signed, “Bleakless”</p>
<p>Dear Bleakless,</p>
<p>Here’s the situation:  For much of Christian church history (i.e., before advertising took over the world), the four weeks before Christmas Day were weeks of soul-searching, fasting, and preparation.  The formal name for this time is Advent, which simply means “coming toward.”  So, we are “coming toward” the entrance of Jesus into the world.  The question before the people is this:  “Why?  Why does the world need a Savior?”</p>
<p>Let us think about it and take a few minutes to intentionally enter the suffering of the world.  As a starter, consider the untold millions who are what is called &#8220;food insecure.” They really don&#8217;t know if there is adequate food even for the day to keep them from gnawing, weakness-inducing, muscle-wasting hunger.  Next, notice the pockets of extreme political instability. We see people sitting on their spark-ready tinderboxes, just waiting for the next provocation, imagined or real, to appear.  Finally, we might look at economic and climate uncertainties. With a tightly interconnected world economy and a fragile and vulnerable infrastructure, the relative comfort experienced by many could realistically disappear within hours.</p>
<p>Now, does the world need redeeming?  Do we need to be set free from the binding chains of darkness?  Do we need healing?  Do we need to connect with people across the divide of intractable differences? Do we need to use our creative minds for the larger good rather than mutual destruction?  Do we need to relearn the rhythms of life, work, play and worship that nourish and fill us rather than overly-stimulate us and then squeeze the last drop of life-moisture from us?</p>
<p>If we can answer “yes” to any of those questions, then music that reflects the deep longings of the soul makes a lot more sense.  Seriously, most of us really do want world peace for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, let’s think a bit about the push to be “super joyful” right now.  Where do you primarily see that message?  Mostly from businesses who want you to buy their stuff, the more expensive the better and, lots and lots of it.  They hold out promises that if you do, you will find utter bliss upon either giving or receiving that stuff.</p>
<p>Certainly gift-giving is a great idea. I don’t want to dismiss that custom.  We need celebrations, and we especially need them as the days become shorter and the nights become longer. We need lights and music and festivities.  We need Christmas Day.</p>
<p>But a world with only lights, and never the darkness to appreciate them, quickly turns dull and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Look at some of the words to “In The Bleak Midwinter.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,</em><br />
<em>cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;</em><br />
<em>but his mother only, in her maiden bliss,</em><br />
<em>worshiped the beloved with a kiss.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><em>What can I give him, poor as I am?</em><br />
<em>If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;</em><br />
<em>if I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;</em><br />
<em>yet what I can I give him:  give my heart.</em></p>
<p>This song, originally written as a Christmas poem by Christina Rosetti in 1872, was set to music in the early 1900’s.  The words beautifully show both the loneliness (bleakness, empty, hard, cold) of Jesus’s birth and our human incapacity to give adequately in response to such a great gift given to us.</p>
<p>By entering into some of the sorrow of the season, we gain greater capacity to find the delight and joy in it as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you NaNo&#8217;d and are now in a post-NaNo writing coma, you may not be ready to face the harsh realities of the raw novel landscape. The world changed while you slept. You grew a beard. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114924/">Sandra Bullock visited you</a> and told your parents you were engaged to be married with hilariously unexpected results.</p>
<p>When you finally wake up, you&#8217;re going to have to edit. A lot. And not like, fix a couple grammatical mistakes or missed commas, but full-blown, angry, word-drunk edit in which you destroy your own art without impunity, in some weird backwards attempt to build it back up again, better, stronger.</p>
<p>I took a cursory glance at my &#8220;manuscript&#8221; and before I processed what I was doing, I had deleted massive swaths of content, rewritten several sections almost entirely, and realized that I still didn&#8217;t have enough distance from my writing to objectively make any meaningful comments. 4 hours later, I stopped.</p>
<p>Just kidding. I didn&#8217;t really stop, I just ran out of &#8220;being awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Editing is when you move your armies in to occupy the territory you won during your word conquests. It&#8217;s where you can use your left brain to clear the battlefield of all the dead metaphors and corpses of analogies that your right brain abandoned to rot. It&#8217;s your chance to hone your paragraphs to razor-perfection like blades on a whetstone. A chance to make those descriptions shine like a suit of full plate mail.</p>
<p>I love editing. It&#8217;s fun to find things that you just <em>nailed </em>the first time around, and equal amounts of fun to beat yourself up over the border-line brain damage you had when you wrote that scene about the army of ninja wolves who could fly (because they had jetpacks).</p>
<p>But you need to be careful when you edit; it&#8217;s too big a time investment with too much on the line to undertake unprepared. To see you through this harrowing journey, I offer the following boon(s):</p>
<p><strong>1. Train yourself to be offended by mistakes</strong></p>
<p>This ties loosely into <a href="http://literatureandlibation.com/2012/08/30/craft-and-draft-the-proof-is-in-the-reading/">proofreading</a>, but involves a lot more than just looking for passive constructs or dangling modifiers. This is about really noticing when something is wrong, and being actively disgusted by it. You need to learn the difference between &#8220;less&#8221; and &#8220;fewer&#8221; and have a visceral gut reaction when you see something like, &#8220;he needed less calories, due to his access to the liquid chocolate larder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Learn what pisses you off about bad writing and internalize it. Swallow it, eat it, live off of it as your only means of sustenance until those mistakes burn inside your body like the sputtering carbon of a dying star. <span style="font-style:normal;line-height:24px;">If you&#8217;re emotionally connected to the writing (especially to the negative) you&#8217;re more likely to catch and correct errors that a less invested editor might overlook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:normal;line-height:24px;">Get mad at your writing. Demand more of it and more of yourself.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Remove context</strong></p>
<p>Your mind naturally fills in blanks and establishes patterns of things it thinks it already knows. If you read your own work, in order, knowing exactly who does/says/kills what next, you&#8217;re likely to gloss over weak writing and glaring mistakes. To avoid this, pull the context blanket off of your scene. He&#8217;s been too warm and cozy, snuggled up in your plot line like a lazy teenager. Make him get up and go outside, look at him in other context, and see that he&#8217;s been under that blanket for so long that he&#8217;s thin and pasty and probably smells pretty bad.</p>
<p>Objectivity regarding your own work is really challenging, but viewing your work outside of itself can help you get that much needed distance. It&#8217;s easier to break apart a single scene or exchange and edit that, than it is to try and edit the entire work at once.</p>
<p>This has the added bonus of allowing you to analyze your tone and voice to see if it is strong enough to stand alone in a short example. If it is, chances are you&#8217;ve got a pretty decent manuscript on your hands. If it&#8217;s not, keep on editin&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>3. Know when to hold &#8216;em, know when to fold &#8216;em</strong></p>
<p>This is a personal editing weakness of mine. My editing kryptonite, if you&#8217;ll allow the cliche. Sometimes, you&#8217;re really, really, <em>really </em>committed to that scene where your protagonist has a steamy threesome with a sexy anthropomorphized grasshopper and a giant jar of honey, but it just doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with your realistic romantic comedy set in modern day Chicago. You can&#8217;t find the resolve to delete the scene, because you put a lot of thought and craft into it, and it seems wrong to just delete it.</p>
<p>I used to say, &#8220;Suck it up, cowboy. It&#8217;s for the sake of the story! Delete that shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I say, &#8220;Hey, that could work with other context, or if you made the grasshopper into an actual woman. Save that shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I edit, I leave a second document open. If I find a scene or piece of dialogue that I really like but just doesn&#8217;t seem to fit the theme or plot, I cut and paste it into this &#8220;holding document.&#8221; The writing isn&#8217;t lost, but it&#8217;s not cluttering up the main story, either. It&#8217;s a way to psychologically distance yourself from what you&#8217;ve fallen in love with.</p>
<p>After a while, you can go back and read the stuff you cut out.  Out of context, you might hate it and realize that it really wasn&#8217;t very good in the first place. Or you might find inspiration in some random aside to start a whole new story. You can&#8217;t lose!</p>
<p><strong>4. Alpha and Omega</strong></p>
<p>Writers spend a lot of creative energy on beginnings and endings. The middle seems inconsequential; just a means to get from origin to exit. It makes sense to really make sure your beginnings and endings work, as they are the delicious 9-grain bread to your literature sammich.</p>
<p>Pay attention to how you start things. Is the beginning of each section engaging? Does it transition well from the previous section? Is your reader going to want to keep reading, or did you leave them alone in the West-Virginian woods with nothing more than a pointed stick to fend for themselves? As you begin a section, be sure to set the hook in your readers mind, don&#8217;t just dangle it out there hoping they&#8217;ll nibble at it.</p>
<p>As you near the end (or an end) make sure things seem to be organically coming together. Make your endings have meaning, insight, purpose. Readers tend to like resolution to conflict, when and where possible, even if it isn&#8217;t a happy resolution.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t pull a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)">Lost</a>. Don&#8217;t leave me wanting to kill you after I&#8217;ve invested SIX FREAKING SEASONS of time by writing some cop-out, bull-shit, &#8220;they were dead the whole time but don&#8217;t worry because they&#8217;re in pseudo-heaven now, and please forget about all those other loose ends to really intriguing shit we left out&#8221; ending.</p>
<p>That shit is weak.</p>
<p>But whatever you do, make sure you actually get back to your manuscript and edit it. It&#8217;s great practice that will ultimately improve your writing, and there&#8217;s always the possibility that you can (after many hours of revision) turn it into something that a publisher may want to read without barfing! We can all dream, right?</p>
