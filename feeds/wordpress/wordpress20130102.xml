				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Santa, I don&#8217;t ask for much geeky stuff, but one very good gift in that area would be a Dvorak keyboard for my iPad. And please don&#8217;t give me a side real hardware keyboard, I am talking of a touchscreen keyboard (the combo external keyboard + iPad looses the battle with my Mac Air&#8230;).</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31512354@N00/730311163" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" alt="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1074/730311163_2912a98110_m.jpg" width="240" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (Photo credit: Gustavo da Cunha Pimenta)</p></div>
<p>I switched to the Dvorak keyboard map not so long ago, last July. Reason for that was not to be faster (like many others) even if this would be a nice side effect, but exploring solutions to solve the pain of a recurring carpal tunnel syndrome. My friend Paolo advised this, explaining it would make my finger, hand and wrist move way less, as a result, it should reduce the inflammation and then the pain. If you are interested in the Dvorak keyboard, jut read it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Wikipedia</a>, or from <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/">Ma.tt</a> already almost 10 years ago!</p>
<p>For learning resources, you will find plenty around the web so I won&#8217;t say much here beside a short feedback if you are interested:</p>
<p>I am not yet 100% up to speed but really happy with that switch &#8211; I am still fighting a bit for all special characters and also for french accents&#8230; but I made progress in speed compared to my Qwerty typing. I am finally touch-typing and have my pain slightly diminished, which was the main goal. While not perfect yet, still very positive change!</p>
<p>I must say though that I can&#8217;t type for a too long time or pain still comes back but it is definitely an improvement compared to Qwerty. I also still have a hard time using it when not really in a &#8216;typing mode&#8217;, for instance when taking notes in meetings. And finally, I am just a bit annoyed by the blind or Dvorak stickers that I use on my keyboards as it is not the most comfortable solution. One day I will take the time to remove and switch keys.</p>
<p>Actually, now, the very main issue is coming from iOS. The Dvorak keyboard would be a perfect story for me if only I could use it not only on my computers but also on my iPhone and iPad but I can&#8217;t! It simply seems impossible to find a way to have a Dvorak map configured on the iOS system. Come on Apple, what the heck!? Can you believe that?</p>
<p>This is supposed to be so easy to support, certainly not more than a bunch of configuration files to change. Instead of that, we are in the paradoxical situation where we were able to find a solution for hardware keyboard and not for purely software ones&#8230;</p>
<p>And let me add that this is a typical example (among plenty of others) where I would love iOS to be more open if not open source. We are so far from it now with Apple. Openness would enable a bunch of happy few to make this thing happen quickly, without hurting Apple or asking their contribution, and pleasing many other users&#8230; but no! This has a taste of &#8220;innovation is over&#8221;&#8230; I will certainly keep a very interested eye on Android phones and tablets, and feel the change coming stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>And to conclude, I took 20 minutes to write this post because, even if just a drop in the ocean, I wanted to contribute to the Dvorak keyboard cause! It is super interesting and deserves more attention from device and system makers. It also needs to be known by more users. I believe that it is an interesting option with lots of potential for people like me. When I think about people writing, typing, translating, transcribing all day; I strongly feel Dvorak could be a much bigger change worth to consider.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Turbo debriefs on IBM's 2012 "5 in 5," five projected innovations based on market and societal trends and emerging technologies that could dramatically change our world.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=6878&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IBM released its annual &#8220;5 in 5&#8243; list yesterday, the seventh year in a row whereby IBM scientists identify a list of innovations that have the potential to change the way people work, live and interact during the next five years.</p>
<p>The IBM 5 in 5 is based on market and societal trends, as well as emerging technologies from IBM&#8217;s R&amp;D labs around the world. This year, the 5 explores innovations that will be underpinnings of the next era of computing, what IBM has described as &#8220;the era of cognitive systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>This next generation of machines will learn, adapt, sense, and begin to experience the world as it really is, and this year&#8217;s predictions focus on one element of the this new era: The ability of computers to mimic the human senses &#8212; in their own manner, to see, smell, touch, taste and hear.</p>
<p>But before you try and spoon-feed your iPad some vanilla yogurt, let&#8217;s get more practical.</p>
<p>These new sensing capabilities will help us become more aware, productive, and help us think &#8212; but not do our thinking for us.</p>
<p>Rather, cognitive systems will help us see through and navigate complexity, keep up with the speed of information, make more informed decisions, improve our health and standard of living, and break down all kinds of barriers &#8212; geographical, language, cost, even accessibility.</p>
<p>Now, on to our five senses.</p>
<p><strong>1) Touch: You will be able to touch through your phone.</strong>  Imagine using your smartphone to shop for your wedding dress and being able to feel the satin or silk of the gown, or the lace on the veil, from the surface on the screen. Or to feel the beading and weave of a blanket made by a local artisan half way around the world. In five years, industries like retail will be transformed by the ability to &#8220;touch&#8221; a product through your mobile device.</p>
<p>IBM scientists are developing applications for the retail,<strong> </strong>healthcare and other sectors using haptic, infrared and pressure sensitive technologies to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric &#8212; as a shopper brushes her finger over the image of the item on a device screen. Utilizing the vibration capabilities of the phone, every object will have a unique set of vibration patterns that represents the touch experience: short fast patterns, or longer and stronger strings of vibrations. The vibration pattern will differentiate silk from linen or cotton, helping simulate the physical sensation of actually touching the material.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sight: A pixel will be worth a thousand words.</strong> We take some 500 billion photos a year, and 72 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. But computers today only understand pictures by the text we use to tag or title them; the majority of the information &#8212; the actual content of the image &#8212; is a mystery.</p>
<p>In the next five years, systems will not only be able to look at and recognize the contents of images and visual data, they will turn the pixels into meaning, making sense out of it similar to the way a human views and interprets a photographs. In the future, &#8220;brain-like&#8221; capabilities will let computers analyze features such as color, texture patterns or edge information and extract insights from visual media, having a potentially huge impact on industries ranging from healthcare to retail to agriculture.</p>
<p>But please, no Escher drawings, at least for now&#8230;that&#8217;s just plain mean.</p>
<p><strong>3) Hearing: Computers will hear what matters. </strong> Ever wish you could make sense of all the sounds around you and be able to understand what&#8217;s not being said? Within five years, distributed systems of clever sensors will detect elements of sound such as sound pressure, vibrations and sound waves at different frequencies.</p>
<p>It will interpret these inputs to predict when trees will fall in a forest or when a landslide is imminent. Such a system will &#8220;listen&#8221; to our surroundings and measure movements, or the stress in a material, to warn us if danger lies ahead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ever hopeful such systems will be able to &#8220;listen&#8221; to my golf swing and help me course correct so I can play more target golf!</p>
<p><strong>4) Taste: Digital taste buds will help you to eat smarter.</strong> What if we could make healthy foods taste delicious using a different kind of computing system built for creativity? IBM researchers are developing a computing system that actually experiences flavor, to be used with chefs to create the most tasty and novel recipes. It will break down ingredients to their molecular level and blend the chemistry of food compounds with the psychology behind what flavors and smells humans prefer.</p>
<p>By comparing this with millions of recipes, the system will be able to create new flavor combinations that pair, for example, roasted chestnuts with other foods such as cooked beetroot, fresh caviar, and dry-cured ham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top Tasting Computer Chefs,&#8221; anyone?</p>
<p><strong>5) Smell: Computers will have a sense of smell.</strong> During the next five years, tiny sensors embedded in your computer or cell phone will detect if you&#8217;re coming down with a cold or other illness. By analyzing odors, biomarkers and thousands of molecules in someone&#8217;s breath, doctors will have help diagnosing and monitoring the onset of ailments such as liver and kidney disorders, asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy by detecting which odors are normal and which are not.</p>
<p>Already, IBM scientists are sensing environment conditions to preserve works of art, and this innovation is starting to be applied to tackle clinical hygiene, one of the biggest healthcare challenges today. In the next five years, IBM technology will &#8220;smell&#8221; surfaces for disinfectants to determine whether rooms have been sanitized. Using novel wireless mesh networks, data on various chemicals will be gathered and measured by sensors, and continuously learn and adapt to new smells over time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The only unfulfilled love I&#8217;m willing to talk about openly is writing. And the realization that the love affair will never be reciprocated hurts just as much as that first time someone came out and said, &#8220;I like you. I just don&#8217;t like-like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing will never like-like me. I&#8217;m too old, and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m too old as much as born at the wrong time – the non-generation. I&#8217;m not a baby boomer. I&#8217;m not a Me. I&#8217;m too old to be a Gen-Xer. Or Y and Z for that matter. I missed the computer age – I didn&#8217;t even have a computer until I got married and I was forty-one before I actually owned my own – a laptop, which took me a year to finally use with any kind of regularity. My kids know the VCR as the machine next to the TV that has never worked.</p>
<p>I read Julie Andrews autobiography recently. She grew up in the fifties, and I was sad to discover that her voice is my voice. That&#8217;s how I write. Very formally, describing how the leaves rest on the rooftop, narrative on top of narrative with very little emotion unless it&#8217;s purple prose. I write like someone who grew up in the fifties, only I have no story to tell. My parents weren&#8217;t alcoholics, I did not overcome drug abuse, I wasn&#8217;t abused or molested. My parents sent me to college. I lived at home until I got married.</p>
<p>This non-generation of girls was expected to grow up, be prim and proper, but still know everything, go to school, college and be anything you wanted, anything boys could be even President of the United States. At least until you got married and had kids and in that order. And when the kids were in high school you could go back to work because women were independent now.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a writer. A writer is impractical. And they drink. They don&#8217;t have two nickels to rub together either.</p>
<p>Get a degree and then you can write.</p>
<p>Get married. You can write later.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re still young. You can&#8217;t wait to have kids. Writing will always be there.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Writing didn&#8217;t wait for me. Writing found someone else. Writing computerized. Modernized. Writing grew up, and changed with the times where it needed to. More do it yourself. More travel. More health care and fitness. New writers came along. Younger and prettier and having seen people like me get left behind knew just what to do to keep up.</p>
<p>Writing won&#8217;t ever come back for me, and I just can&#8217;t catch up. My writing is tired and old; timid. Like me.</p>
<p>My best friend, like any good friend, pushes me towards the love that got away, prods, challenges, shames, but he can only push so far. I keep my hand on the ledge. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s down there. I lean over, but I can&#8217;t see very far, and what I can see is dizzying.</p>
<p>What if I fall?</p>
<p>What if I catch up to writing and I&#8217;m just not good enough? Staying back and wondering is better than being rejected again, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m reading a bad book right now.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m in revision mode, or maybe it&#8217;s because I enjoyed this book as a kid and don&#8217;t find it living up to my expectations. The book is <a title="Vendetta (Memory Alpha)" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vendetta" target="_blank">Vendetta</a> by Peter David (yes ST:TNG for those of you clicking along at home). Normally I find David&#8217;s writing to be spot on and funny, but this one&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it started:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the one who was ankle-deep in blood,&#8221; said Crusher.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I sure was!&#8221; said Geordi hotly.</em></p>
<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>Yes, the writing&#8217;s bad but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s bothering me. What&#8217;s bothering me is that this isn&#8217;t how these characters would act.  Guinan wouldn&#8217;t say sir to Picard, Picard wouldn&#8217;t reveal his frustrations openly, and Geordi (hot-head that he is) would have a better comeback than &#8220;I sure was!&#8221; Sounds almost cheerful doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>This got me to thinking about my characters, are they full enough that something could seem OUT of character, or even IN character.  How do I give my characters a distinct personality, one that can have variation certainly, growth most definitely, but never have a moment like this one that jars you out of your suspension of reality and makes you think about checking your e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>1) Understand your character&#8217;s relationships to other characters: </strong>Your character has friends, enemies, family members, co-workers, and everything in between. Each relationship has a slightly different dynamic, but all stemming from the base of your character&#8217;s personality. It may be that your character doesn&#8217;t like to make enemies and so tries to be his gregarious self around someone who doesn&#8217;t like him, but awkwardly. Some relationships with co-workers are strictly professional, whereas others are more casual. One might think of this as a spectrum of intimacy, or the amount a character can be their &#8220;real&#8221; self around another character. What&#8217;s important is that this remain consistent. A superior is always, sir, until a situation arises to naturally make the relationship more casual.</p>
<p><strong>2) Characters will change with experience:</strong> But these should be experiences we see. If your main character is a gregarious and funny person and becomes somber and reflective, you had better show us why. Change is good, it enriches our understanding of the person we&#8217;re trying to bring to life, but that change needs to happen on the page. If a cop changes after he loses his partner, a partner who was alive and drinking in the previous book, then he&#8217;d better kick the bucket somewhere on the page. Otherwise we&#8217;re being left out of the important experiences of our character&#8217;s life, and that changes the reader&#8217;s level of intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>3) Know more about your character than your readers do:</strong> Your character&#8217;s favorite color may not come up on the first page. The kind of whiskey they like, their hobbies, a good story reveals these details gradually. If the leg work&#8217;s been done up front to establish this character, then when a new detail is revealed it is shown to be a part of the whole, even when it seems inconsistent. One of my favorite examples of this is Ron Swanson from Parks &amp; Rec. He&#8217;s a gruff libertarian man, who likes to play as Duke Silver, a saxophone playing jazz lethario. He remains consistent in that he keeps this part of himself separate from most of the people in his life, and it provides color to his outward gruffness to see such a suave and fun loving side.</p>
<p><strong>4) A measured response is often better than a freak out:</strong> Geordi freaks out all over the place in this book, with little provocation. It&#8217;s overly dramatic, even if the reasons for it are sometimes understandable. It&#8217;s like in singing, the louder moments are made all the better by the quiet ones around them. Frustration is best kept on a low boil that is then allowed to burst rather than constantly bubbling over. I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t people who react to crisis this way, and it may be that you want to portray a certain level of immaturity in your character, but make sure that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going for. This could also probably be distilled down to eliminating all or most of the &#8220;[character] said [blank]-ly&#8221; tags from sentences.</p>
<p><strong>5) It takes time to build a relationship:</strong> No character is fully formed in the first sentence they utter. There definitely is room to change the direction of a character, or flesh them out in later chapters, or even in later books. A certain about of leeway can be afforded so you don&#8217;t have to feel locked in. Just make sure that new details aren&#8217;t too drastically different from established norms, unless they&#8217;re a contrast like our good friend Ron.</p>
<p><strong>6) Your moral compass:</strong> Briefly it&#8217;s also a good idea to know what your character&#8217;s values are, would they never kill, do they oppose mastication, that sort of thing. Again, morality can change over time, but rarely all at once.</p>
<p>What makes your characters distinct? What would be out of character?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I&#8217;m late to the recent craft beer <a style="font-size:15.199999809265px;font-style:normal;line-height:19.200000762939px;" href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22189184/craft-vs-crafty-big-and-small-breweries-square" target="_blank">hullaballoo</a> that followed the Brewer&#8217;s Association&#8217;s <a style="font-size:15.199999809265px;font-style:normal;line-height:19.200000762939px;" href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/media/press-releases/show?title=craft-vs-crafty-a-statement-from-the-brewers-association" target="_blank">bitchy, little missive</a> about the Big Beer Boogeyman trying to swoop on craft beer&#8217;s game with brews like Blue Moon and Shock Top. There has been enough whining, though. So, this might not be popular, but the Curmudgeon must speak.</p>
<p>I drink beer. Period. And I&#8217;ve said it before: So as long as your beer is tasty, I’ll drink it&#8230;well, as long as it wasn’t made from orphan tears, or something messed-up like that. But I&#8217;m willing to make an exception if the orphans were already crying anyway.</p>
<div id="attachment_3597" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 261px"><a href="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/orphan.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-3597" alt="orphan" src="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/orphan.jpeg?w=251&#038;h=201" width="251" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Except for her. Keep this orphan&#8217;s tears the F away from my beer.</p></div>
<p>For me, it started on December 12th, when SABMiller executive chairman Graham Mackay asserted that the basis for craft beer success is the desire for more variation and interest and &#8220;it&#8217;s also local, anti-marketing, anti-global, anti-big, and more focused on experience and knowing that about where beer is from.&#8221; This elicited immediate mockery from the Big Beer haters about how Big Beer just doesn&#8217;t get it, and how it&#8217;s about quality and taste.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, the Brewer&#8217;s Association fired-off a press release reiterating their standard for what constitutes craft beer, lamenting Big Beer&#8217;s sinister foray into the craft beer market, and claiming that Big Beer should be required to clearly label their masquerading beers as being made by the Big Beer Boogeyman (and, thus, not true &#8220;craft beers&#8221;). Hmmm. So, apparently it&#8217;s not all about taste. Otherwise, why does this matter?</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://thisiswhyimdrunk.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/9-beers-americans-no-longer-drink-and-why-big-beer-doesnt-get-it-part-1-5/" target="_blank">thisiswhyimdrunk</a> makes a compelling case for the distinction between the Brewer&#8217;s Association lamentations and Graham Mackay&#8217;s claims of anti-big sentiment. However, it&#8217;s hard to deny the general contempt for Big Beer that courses through the veins of the majority of beer nerds. The accusations run the gamut: Their beers all taste like crap (not true); they are unrelenting and sometime nefarious in their efforts to gain market share (probably true); they like to eat kittens (totally true).</p>
<div id="attachment_3598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/whiplash.png"><img class=" wp-image-3598" alt="whiplash" src="http://beerbecue.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/whiplash.png?w=240&#038;h=328" width="240" height="328" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Graham Mackay thinking about kitten recipes.</p></div>
<p>But we operate in a capitalist system. Making money and gaining market share is what you&#8217;re supposed to do. It&#8217;s what makes the system function well, subject to smart regulation and enforcement, of course.</p>
<p>In fact, the capitalist system is like a zoo with lions, tigers, polar bears, and cute little animals like koalas and penguins. When a polar bear escapes and fulfills his lifelong fantasy of eating a penguin, or when the lions and tigers get out and eat the koalas and some zoo patrons, do you blame the lions and tigers and bears? No. Sure you might think the carnivores are dicks for eating cute animals and people, but that&#8217;s what they do (and partly what makes a zoo cool). You should be blaming the f-ing zookeepers.</p>
<p>And what do you think the purpose of the Brewer&#8217;s Association cockamamie definition of craft is (which actually seems simultaneously over-inclusive (Sam Adams Light) and under-inclusive (August Schell Brewing))? It&#8217;s about inventing a term to solidify a market niche and to gain and protect market share to the exclusion of others. Gasp!</p>
<p>And the label idea is silly. It&#8217;s not even worthy of the zoo&#8217;s suggestion box. These offending Big Beer brews are a completely different product line from their other beers and are geared to an entirely different market. Of course they&#8217;re going to label and market them differently. Are you mad that a Lexus doesn&#8217;t come with &#8220;TOYOTA&#8221; emblazoned across the back? The few people who actually care about this will know or easily find out.</p>
<p>It all boils down to this: I&#8217;ve had some good brews made by Big Beer and many terrible beers from so-called craft breweries. To me, it&#8217;s all about gettin&#8217; the yummy in my tummy and what&#8217;s best and available at the time, not about what constitutes craft beer or who gets to call it that. So, maybe the Big Beer Boogeyman realized that he needs to get in on selling tasty beer. Wah. Deal with it. Just drink beer.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Go read John Cochran&#8217;s thoughts (From Terrapin Beer) <a href="http://johnatterrapin.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/craft-vs-crafty/" target="_blank">here</a>. He masterfully drives home the point: This is all so silly. He also lists some of the goofier results from the Brewer&#8217;s Association line-in-the-sand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, in the state I am now, that there was ever a time when I was happy with myself.</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;ve never been thin—I&#8217;ve always, <em>always</em> been the fat girl, and though no one ever <em>said</em> anything, I could tell.  I could tell when all my friends went clothes shopping without me, when no one asked me to homecoming, when my horse riding instructor praised the other girls and told me to work harder.  Logic, of course, tells me: it was because I was fat.  I lived with seething hatred of this body for years, but only recently did this hatred manifest itself.</p>
<p>At 175 pounds and 5&#8217;5&#8221;, I was, less than a year ago, just beginning to fall into the pit.  One night I dragged a shaving razor across my thigh and watched as the bad feelings poured out.  I put a bandage on it and swore to never touch a blade again.  But the next night I did it again and soon there was an arsenal in my bedside drawer and red zebra stripes covering my hips and wrists.</p>
<p>It was around this time, too, that I decided I needed to rid myself of my second skin.  I was huge, fatter than fat, disgusting, a whale.  At first I tried something called intermittent fasting, which involved fasting for 24 hours at least 2 times a week.  The other days I was allowed to eat normally.  The idea was that it would cut calories effortlessly, while the pattern of fasting would rev up my metabolism.</p>
<p>While intermittent fasting is a legitimate method for losing weight, I couldn&#8217;t imagine that my parents would approve of me refusing food 2-3 days out of the week.  Thus to complete my fasts, I began coming up with all manner of crazy ways to hide that I was not eating.  I woke up early to avoid my parents&#8217; prying eyes as I had my breakfast of green tea.  When they got suspicious, I crumbled bits of toast onto a plate and left it out on the counter before hiding the uneaten evidence in the trash.  I made excuses to my friends at lunch time and hoarded sandwiches in my room until I could eat them again, though soon I began throwing out the whole brown bag.  Later on, I mastered the art of spitting my food into a napkin, and once chewed and spit two whole slices of toast, unnoticed and without swallowing a bite, right in front of my father.</p>
<p>As the pounds began to drop off, I became more obsessed, restricting even on my non-fasting days.  By spring I was eating 300-600 calories a day and beating my ass on the treadmill to make up for mistakes.  At 150 pounds, people began to notice.  &#8221;Oh, you look like you&#8217;ve lost weight!&#8221; they&#8217;d say happily, never suspecting something could be wrong.  My friends all paid more attention to me.  When I asked a boy to prom, he happily accepted.  And my riding instructor couldn&#8217;t stop telling me how much better I looked (skinnier girls look more elegant on horses).  I got nothing but positive feedback and I was over the moon.  After all, for someone as fat as I was, losing weight could only be a good thing.  But I still wasn&#8217;t skinny enough. No, not even close.</p>
<p>By summer I was falling victim to binges, and my self-hatred grew even more vehement.  As much as I jammed my fingers down my throat, I could not bring my mistakes back up.  After nearly slitting my throat one night, I finally told my mother that her daughter sliced up her skin.  I didn&#8217;t tell her that I wanted to die, nor that my nightmares consisted of fat-laden food that I could not stop eating.  No, I told her about the cutting, and she was kind and supportive and everything a mother should be.  And so I stopped cutting.  I found peace and I stopped starving.  With the pressure of senior year gone, something shifted and I was, for that blessed three-month period, happy.  At least I think I was.</p>
<p>And here I am now, in college—an art major, no less—with dreams of becoming a medical illustrator.  After moving into the dorms, it didn&#8217;t take long for the blades to make their way back into my drawer.  My weight has settled at 145; though this is the lowest I&#8217;ve ever been and is considered a &#8220;healthy weight,&#8221; I cannot be satisfied with it.  With every bite I put in my mouth, I can feel myself losing control.  There is too much here for me to handle, and I need the comfort of starvation again.  It&#8217;s disgusting, I know, and it&#8217;s wrong and no one—none of you—should ever think this way, but I&#8217;ve been eating less and less these past few weeks and making excuses again and I can feel the cold fingers of these thoughts wrap themselves around me, pulling me back into the arms of hunger.</p>
<p>This goes beyond wanting to be skinny.  I have pegged food as the enemy, you see, and I am finding that I can only feel sane when I do not eat.  I am strong when I starve.  I am powerful, I am in control.  I can feel yesterday&#8217;s mistakes and poisons clearing out of this disgusting body and soon, soon I will be clean and pure.</p>
<p>Call me insane.  But I <em>will</em> be thin.  I&#8217;ll be thin if it&#8217;s the last thing I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From here<br />
on the floor<br />
with the grains of the wood<br />
and the stains of blood<br />
and whiskey<br />
from here is where I rise.</p>
<p>Splinters in the wood<br />
and scratches all around<br />
become the grain of life<br />
and so we find a path<br />
and pattern<br />
in the most unlikeliest of places&#8211;<br />
on this floor.</p>
<p>There are lines that speak of order<br />
even down so low as this<br />
and it is God&#8217;s sweet grace<br />
to open our eyes that we might see<br />
the lines beneath the whiskey<br />
and dirt<br />
and blood.</p>
