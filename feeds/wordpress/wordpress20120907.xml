				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not original in any sense, but lately I&#8217;ve been in a fall mood.  This is clearly no surprise as it is now the very early beginning of September and Halloween decorations, sweaters and pumpkin paraphernalia already decorate all venues of mass consumption meant to make you think you discovered the season including Halloween and Thanksgiving on your own when really it is fully by design.  Fall does not necessarily need to be associated with a change in the weather.  If stores decided to start selling fall clothes in May while toting pumpkin everything, I&#8217;m fairly confident the season could take place in the middle of summer.</p>
<p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 574px"><a href="http://www.hm.com/us/life#comp_0000005fad"><img class=" " src="http://lp.hm.com/hmprod?set=source[/josh/media/sys_master/9126461571102/hm_life_interview_LDR_01.png]&amp;call=url[file:/life/largeArticle]" alt="" width="564" height="356" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: H&amp;M Lana Del Rey</p></div>September is an awkward month.  A few leaves may be on the ground, but the sun is still in a crispy state when you&#8217;re walking around town during the day, much too warm to wear a sweater, but you&#8217;ve already bought some new fall clothes and decide to wear it anyway, no matter the cost.  So, the dying embers of summer, still capable of burning you despite it being &#8220;fall&#8221; and despite the atmosphere starting to look like fall too, seep through the cotton, cashmere or wool and start to warm your soul a little as you perspire- even if you try so hard to be &#8220;original&#8221; in the face of a fake season brought on by the consumerist society in which you live.</p>

<p>What put me into the fall mood?  Well, it was actually a journey to Waffle House last Saturday morning with my boyfriend.  In order to survive the mass caloric intake without gaining weight in one solitary meal, we decided to walk to the Waffle House around the corner instead of driving there.  The simple act of walking brought us back to our collegiate days in which we walked to the dining hall, up Freshman hill or to the football games this time of year.  Already nostalgic, we were further reminded of school when everyone at Waffle House seemed to don their college football tees and discuss the schematics of upcoming games at the counter (you know it&#8217;s almost like watching TV at Waffle House because the people at the counter are right there in the middle of everything and seem to talk as if they are on stage anyway).</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/738833a4f44011e1aee522000a1e8a5f_7.jpg?w=137&h=137" alt="" width="137" height="137" /></a>But, there&#8217;s something about Waffle House itself, maybe the colors, maybe the comfort food, maybe the yellow <a href="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_71.jpg"><br />
<img class="alignright" title="fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_7" src="http://originaltitle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fb1c2dc6f43f11e1bacf1231380f8dc9_71.jpg?w=115&h=115" alt="" width="115" height="115" /></a>dangling teeth in the sky bearing its name, calling you inside that brings about a fall feeling.  The hanging bulbous lights against an off-white tile, the laminate wood tables and the atmosphere that makes you think of Friday Night Lights before and or after a football game inspires a scholastically-fall feeling.  Everyone eating breakfast with us that morning seemed to be &#8220;in it,&#8221; with us even though none of us knew each other.  There was just this swell of college football pride and a feeling that we were all in this changing season together.</p>
<p>Music also seems to set the mood and lately there have been several artists on my mind.  I&#8217;ll start with The Black Keys because their music reminds me of school.  Particularly, of Mississippi and perhaps that is because I discovered them while I was teaching in Clarksdale, MS.  When I hear <a href="http://www.theblackkeys.com/">The Black Keys</a>, I think of <a href="http://www.groundzerobluesclub.com/">Ground Zero</a>, the blues club co-owned by Morgan Freeman and Bill Luckett in Clarksdale where you can hear really great bands, you can scrawl in Sharpie on the wall and get a fried catfish sandwich.  The Black Keys have never played there, but I get that same sort of rustic feeling, that fall feeling when I listen to them.</p>

<p>Lana Del Rey, Mumford and Sons and also the Avett Brothers are also on my fall soundtrack this season. While I&#8217;ve been observing the small details of fall and writing away at a new short story, my graphic novel and various poems, these details find their way into the plot lines.  The music on my Pandora playlist could very easily be playing in the background of any of my settings.  Stories could take place in venues like Ground Zero or in the crispy sun of early fall.  I can&#8217;t seem to shake it.</p>

On the docket for this weekend: taking the GRE, reading more C.K. Williams, perhaps wearing a sweater at a coffee shop somewhere and listening to Lana Del Rey listlessly staring out a window, watching college football with family and friends, and baking something pumpkin-y or nutmeg-y.  <strong>What are your &#8220;original&#8221; fall plans? What&#8217;s your &#8220;original&#8221; mood as of late?</strong></p>

Their house, built in 1872, still stands on the park grounds.<a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/076-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2244" title="076 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/076-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>

Swimming and diving, which are the main attractions in the summer, are not allowed during the winter months (November to March), because as the river&#8217;s temperature drops, manatees seek refuge in the spring&#8217;s warm (relatively speaking) waters.</p>

For those who rather stay dry, there&#8217;s canoeing and boating. Fishing can also be enjoyed off the pier which is found at the point where the spring run meets the river. <a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/083-1280x853.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2248" title="083 " src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/083-1280x853.jpg" alt="" width="1026" height="683" /></a></p>

<p>In the afternoon the air temperature was in the 90&#8242;s. It was hot and humid and the spring water was enticing (that is, until I dipped my feet in). The water temperature in the springs remains at 72 degrees throughout the year. Though warm to the manatees, it felt very cold to me! One park ranger suggested we put our feet in first, so we could &#8220;acclimate&#8221;  and our body temperature could drop. This, however, didn&#8217;t help. There are no two ways about it, either you jump in or you don&#8217;t go in at all.</p>
<p>I was ready to take the second choice &#8211; I hate cold water! But, threatened to be thrown in, I decided to jump in on my own. After the initial shock, we swam up river to the spring head, where we found our biggest surprise yet &#8211; a manatee which was swimming among the visitors (see pictures <a title="Under Water" href="http://justmyecho.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/under-water/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/07.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2265" title="07" src="http://justmyecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/07.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a>After this incredible experience, we happily and lazily floated to the end of the run. Our bodies were numb as we climbed out of the water. The hot air which previously was so uncomfortable embraced us in welcomed warmth. And though I did not initially want to get in the water, I&#8217;m very glad I did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not an apron kind of girl. I don&#8217;t do bows, frills, flounces, or flowers.</p>
<p>But, I do like to cook. And if I am making something messy like <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/11/03/beautiful-biscuits-cream-no-shortening-and-a-gentle-hand/" target="_blank">buttermilk biscuits</a>, <a href="http://madteaparty.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/sunday-brunch-gobhi-parantha/" target="_blank">paranthas</a>, or <a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/2009/03/30/how-to-make-homemade-alfajores/" target="_blank">alfajores</a>&#8211;basically anything that involves working with dough and flinging clouds of flour around&#8211;I like to wear my grandmother&#8217;s apron.</p>
<p><a href="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1247_crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-968" title="IMG_1247_crop" src="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1247_crop.jpg?w=212&h=300" alt="Apron hanging on a kitchen door" width="212" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In a way, I never knew my &#8216;real&#8217; grandmother. When I was 3, she and my grandfather were driving home from a livestock auction on a rainy winter night when their white pickup truck was slammed into by a tractor-trailer. They both survived, but my grandmother&#8217;s injuries were serious. She moved from intensive care to a regular ward to a nursing home. When she finally did come home, she was, as my mom would say, &#8220;not the same person.&#8221; She was listless, petulant, distant. After the accident, she mostly sat still in her chair in the front room of their log cabin, beside the Franklin stove.</p>
<p>A look through family photo albums shows the lost woman my mom was missing. Grandma in a man&#8217;s winter coat and rubber boots, carrying a rifle, heading off squirrel hunting with her sister. On vacation, waist-deep in the Chesapeake Bay. Leading my 5-year-old mom around the barnyard on the back of a Holstein calf. Her white hair tucked under a hunting cap, riding on her Saddlebred mare, Sugar. She was a Yankees fan, a backyard geneticist (chickens!), and she eloped with my grandfather&#8211;a German sailor who had jumped ship in New Orleans and made his way north&#8211;and for months didn&#8217;t tell anyone in the family that she was married, just kept bringing her beau to Sunday suppers with the family. I don&#8217;t remember a single photo of her wearing a skirt or dress &#8211; quite an accomplishment for a woman born in 1910.</p>
<p>Pauline was the second youngest of nine children born on a farm. The boys worked in the fields and the girls worked in the house. That&#8217;s just the way it was. She was a good country cook, and she cooked for her German sailor, too: fried chicken, chipped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, fruit cake, peach pie.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time with my grandparents, especially after the accident, when we moved next door to help take care of them. I was always happy to visit&#8211; My grandparents were glad to see me, and they ate food that we didn&#8217;t have at home. There were packages of Nutter Butter cookies for my grandfather, and bags of chalky pink peppermints. There were cold slices of squirrel and rabbit refrigerated in margarine tubs, that we ate with Blue Ribbon margarine on Roman Meal bread. There was Braunschweiger and sliced genoa salami. Their dirt-floored cellar was a treasure house of canned peaches, pears, and fruit cocktail, jars of cinnamon-sugar applesauce, and big cans of Hi-C from the canning factory where they used to work.</p>
<p>And down behind the white Westinghouse fridge, where they kept six-pack glass returnable bottles of Coke (for Grandma) and Pepsi (for Pop-pop), was a flowered vinyl shopping bag, and two aprons &#8211; one red, one blue, hung on a hook.</p>
<p><a href="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/71103443_1323546286521.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-970" title="71103443_132354628652" src="http://alisaword.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/71103443_1323546286521.jpeg?w=300&h=225" alt="Pauline Schroll tombstone, 1910-1981" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like sports. I&#8217;ve never been hunting&#8211;I&#8217;ve been a vegetarian since I was fifteen. But, I, too, ran off and married my husband &#8211;another foreigner&#8211;and called my mom to tell her the news after the fact. I learned to ride before I can remember, and the feel of a horse under me is as natural as walking.</p>
<p>The cooking thing skipped a generation. My mom didn&#8217;t learn to cook until her husband taught her, and when he died when I was eight, I took over the cooking. It wasn&#8217;t until I had grown up and moved out and was visiting my mom, digging for some cobwebbed necessity when trying to make Christmas dinner in her neglected kitchen that I came across my grandmother&#8217;s apron.</p>
<p>It all came back to me. My whole childhood. My grandfather&#8217;s bolo ties, and his snoring in his armchair in front of the Orioles game. Eating squirrel sandwiches at the claw-foot table in the kitchen. Feeding the chickens, and stroking the feathers of the pale gold spring peeps. Sledding down the mountain lane in winter, and scrambling barefoot up trees in the summer, gathering black raspberries by the bucketful and spooning them with sugar over vanilla ice cream. Riding my Shetland pony, and falling under her feet when the girth slipped on her grass-fat belly. Crawling through barbed-wire fences, watching out for copperheads, playing tag with my cousins. Eating sassafras leaves, birch bark, and teaberries, and &#8216;cooking&#8217; grass and acorns in a beat-up old saucepot on the tar-paper roof of the springhouse.</p>
<p>My mom didn&#8217;t need the apron, and I took it with me. When I wear it, I know the Pauline who I never knew. When I wear it, I continue the best of the women in my family. Women who know the Appalachian woods from the inside, who ride horses without fear, who marry the men they love, and ask permission later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One-eyed aliens, giant butterflies, flying dragons, mermaids, superheroes, self-portraits and other masterpieces mask our aged refrigerator. Without that in my life, even my morning coffee wouldn&#8217;t make me happy.</p>
<p>All parents believe their child is the next Picasso or <a class="zem_slink" title="Frida Kahlo" href="http://www.biography.com/people/frida-kahlo-9359496" rel="biographycom" target="_blank">Frida Kahlo</a>, but we also recognize the need to connect with our child. Their art connects to a part of the soul where words can&#8217;t. At least, that&#8217;s what I find when I reach for the refrigerator door.</p>
<div id="attachment_177" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 189px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/famlaugh.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-177 " title="Famlaugh" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/famlaugh.jpg?w=179&h=240" alt="" width="179" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Family</p></div>
<p>The first time my daughter handed me a drawing a surge of pride and euphoria swept through me. I rushed to the refrigerator as if it were a wall in an art gallery, quickly selected a worthy magnet, and surveyed its magnificence on the refrigerator door. She has come to see the refrigerator as a showcase for her talent and superior abilities, a confirmation that she is the best.</p>
<p>Now, she snatches a piece of typing paper from the printer, grabs a pen or crayon and waits to see where I will display her next masterpiece.</p>
<p>There are moments when I silently grumble that we never have paper in the printer when we need to print, but all I have to do is reach for the refrigerator door and those words never materialize.</p>
<div id="attachment_178" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momday.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" title="MomDay" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momday.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mom&#8217;s Day</p></div>
<p>Over the years, this refrigerator art gallery has boasted various works of art that expressed her momentary whims and our family’s unique attributes, always with a positive spin. At one point it displayed a portrait of myself accentuated my ultra-curly hair in an afro-like halo with rays of light spraying from my head. When I asked why she added the light, my daughter explained that I looked like the sun in the morning.</p>
<p>My whole perspective changed. I went from being a giant, frizzy-headed mess to the sun. The day I couldn’t find that drawing was the day I realized how much I couldn’t live without my children’s art. I began to value it and make sure that, when it came time to replace old art with new art, the old art had a place to stay. I created a scrapbook where I could slip the ones that meant the most to me.</p>
<p>The depth of meaning has grown over the years. Early one morning, still holding a grudge over an unresolved problem, I made my coffee then reached for milk from the refrigerator. I looked up and stopped. Strange creatures jumped from the door with their disproportionate necks and misshapen lips, kissing each other, flying and floating. Despite all the masterpieces I’ve seen in museums and galleries, I finally fully grasped the value of art. Art exists to remind us of the beauty we forget about while attempting to maneuver through the difficulties in life. Even if the art stands as a testament of our bad behaviors, it still magnifies the beauty we’ve disregarded.</p>
<div id="attachment_179" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momdad.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-179" title="Mom&amp;Dad" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momdad.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Colorful</p></div>
<p>Once my son arrived, the art collection filled our house. The refrigerator art migrated to our walls and doors. One evening after a shower, I found his refrigerator art carefully taped to the hallway walls and bedroom doors. He proclaimed that the house was too boring and it needed some color. He placed each one at his eye-level—so I learned to look down for inspiration.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/butterfly.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-190" title="Butterfly" src="http://bravesmartbold.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/butterfly.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Butterfly Go</p></div>
<p>Eventually, I myself moved some of the artwork to my little nook in the corner of the dining room where I work. A brightly dressed ninja reminds me of the power to fight but to be careful about wardrobe choices. Two flowing girls, outlined in blue and red, tell me to overcome differences. A butterfly splashed with color spreads its wings across my magnetic bulletin board. I hear its voice say, “Open your wings Mama. You’re still a child inside.” And a turtle calls out, “Slow down!” So, I do. Each piece expresses a new discovery, a silent insight, and an imperceptible moment that I would’ve rushed past had it not been my own child who handed it to me.</p>
<p>Living without that, wouldn’t be living at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike his siblings, LA, aged 6, had no interest in reading or books whatsoever. This was a matter of great concern to his parents, as the rest of the family spent much of their time reading, and we believed this to be a critical life skill, both for work and during leisure time.</p>
<p>Bedtime stories were a regular thing (and had been all his life) and at school his teacher also tried to entice him to read using every encouragement possible. But all to no avail. The problem was that young LA excelled at phonetic writing and spelling, and this, he believed, was perfectly adequate &#8211; why would one need to bother wasting time learning a whole new set of reading/writing skills? It was a difficult argument to counter, and we just had to hope that one day a book would capture his imagination and start him discovering the power of the written word.</p>
<p>During this period, I was able to occasionally venture into large bookshops in our local capital city. It was on one of these trips that I &#8216;rediscovered&#8217; a series of childhood favourite books. Our local library had had a very limited children&#8217;s section, but one thing they did have was <em>Asterix</em> comic books and I loved them &#8211; I found the witty use of words and ideas very creative and entertaining.</p>
<div id="attachment_968" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gaulvillage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-968" title="GaulVillage" src="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gaulvillage.jpg" alt="The Gaul village where Asterix and Obelix live " width="500" height="367" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Gaul village where Asterix and Obelix live (From &#8216;Asterix and the magic carpet&#8217; by Albert Underzo (1987) page 5).</p></div>
<p>I could not resist buying the book I had found &#8211; thinking that I could relive some of the childhood pleasure I had enjoyed many years before.</p>
<p>But little did I realise the impact that this purchase was to have on my smallest family member. Not only did he enjoy the humour and the clever use of words and ideas, but he went back again and again to re-read it. Realising that I had struck gold <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I then looked in every bookshop for every book I could find in the series! And he loved them all. 15 years later, we still have all those dog eared <em>Asterix</em> books and I am still reading and enjoying them!</p>
<p>But that is not really what this post is about.</p>
<p>Even at this very young age, LA was a very creative person and decided to build a Gaul Village, like those he saw in the <em>Asterix</em> books. Using a cereal box, twigs from the garden, small stones, some glue and some sand, he set to work. He made the most beautiful model village and I have treasured and kept it ever since.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like.</p>
<div id="attachment_965" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/village1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-965" title="Village1" src="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/village1.jpg" alt="Gaul village built by LA (aged 6)" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gaul village built by LA</p></div>
<p>For those of you who are <em>Asterix</em> fans, you will recall features of a traditional Gaul village. All the buildings are surrounded by a high fence made of sharpened logs lashed together with twine (Gaul, it must be remembered was in conflict with the Romans at this time in history). Depending on the size of the village, there is usually a single gate which is guarded against invaders.</p>
<div id="attachment_969" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gate.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-969" title="Gate" src="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gate.jpg?w=300&h=199" alt="Village gate" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Village gate</p></div>
<p>The houses and buildings have roofs constructed from round timber poles and are all linked with neatly marked laneways.</p>
<p>And there is no mistaking the hut up on the tree stump (where the acoustics are just so much better according to <em>Cacofonix</em> the Bard!)</p>
<p>Each of these aspects has been loyally reproduced in the model. <em>Asterix</em>&#8216;s house can be seen in the village photo in the foreground &#8211; just near the gate. Below, the lashed fence provides a secure site for other houses in the village.</p>
<div id="attachment_967" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/houses1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-967" title="Houses1" src="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/houses1.jpg" alt="Village houses" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Village houses protected by the secure fence</p></div>
<p>There are two main characters in each <em>Asterix</em> story &#8211; there is <em>Asterix</em> the mighty warrior, and his superstrong friend <em>Obelix</em>, who likes to carry about a big stone (a menhir) for fun. Other characters living in the village include Chief <em>Vitalstatistix</em>, the village druid <em>Getafix</em>, and <em>Obelix</em>&#8216;s little dog <em>Dogmatix. </em></p>
<p><em>Obelix</em> has a quarry where he gets his menhirs, and below you can see <em>Obelix</em>&#8216;s quarry. It is complete with menhir shaped stones (and a sign for the uninitiated!)</p>
<div id="attachment_966" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/quarry1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-966" title="Quarry1" src="http://madoqua.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/quarry1.jpg" alt="Obelix's quarry" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Obelix&#8217;s quarry</p></div>
<p>Those tiny fingers had trouble with constructing a hut on <em>Cacofonix</em>&#8216;s tree house platform and the whole assembly still refuses to stand straight! In the photo of the whole village, this troublesome tree house can be seen on the top right.</p>
<p>As a final touch, the model has 3 pebbles glued under the base &#8211; three small feet ensuring that it remains stable when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>According to <a title="Wikipedia - Asterix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 325 million copies of 34 <em>Asterix</em> books have been sold worldwide and the books have been translated into over 100 languages from the original French. But I am willing to bet that I am the only mother in the world who has such a beautiful model made of this village by such a talented young <em>Asterix</em> fan! Definitely one of my favourite things!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://momopolize.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/adoption-paper-few-of-my-favorite-things3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-271" style="width:614px;height:140px;" title="adoption paper few of my favorite things" src="http://momopolize.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/adoption-paper-few-of-my-favorite-things3.jpg?w=614&h=162" alt="" width="614" height="162" /></a>From a distance, the yellowed, typewriter written, tattered papers appear to be nothing impressive .  But the information contained on those papers is what makes them amongst my most cherished possessions.  It is the only window I have into an unknown part of my life.  The only knowledge about my biological past.  My adoption papers.</p>
<p>The sketchy information does not even come close to telling the entire picture about the beginning of my life, but it&#8217;s enough for me to read between the lines to create a story in my mind.  Enough to take the blank slate and provide some understanding of the circumstances surrounding my birth and what makes me the person I am.</p>
<p>The first page of the paperwork contains details about my biological parents.  The brief description &#8211; only a few lines total - is the most valuable information to me.  I can peruse the traits and see glimpses of myself in the presentment, especially in the features and personality of my biological father.  &#8220;Green eyes, dark brown naturally curly hair, dark complexion&#8221; could readily describe me.  I like to think I also am somewhat &#8220;outgoing, happy-go-lucky and have a good sense of humor&#8221; which is how my biological father&#8217;s personality is portrayed.</p>
<p>My biological mother is also described as having brown hair but with brown eyes, and no curls.  From reading her description, however, I know where I got my left-handedness.  Drawing is listed as an interest.  Perhaps that is where my son, Jake, got his love of art.  Her personality is depicted as &#8220;moody, quiet and lazy.&#8221;  I choose to envision that she was understandably moody because of the turmoil she was feeling over giving me up for adoption.  She was uncharacteristically quiet.  Pensive, wistfully wondering what &#8220;could have been&#8221; under different circumstances.  She was not lazy, just weary.  Fatigued and distressed about the toll pregnancy was taking on her body &#8211; and soul &#8211; for a baby she was not going to raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Completed high school&#8221; is listed as the education for both, with the addition of &#8220;anticipates furthering her education&#8221; for my biological mother.  From this, I deduced that the pregnancy occurred during their senior year of high school and I was born the October after they graduated.  In another area of the paperwork, it states that pre-natal care began in mid-June.  I concluded that the pregnancy was concealed from her classmates, and most likely her parents, until after graduation to reduce the embarrassment of her predicament.  I wonder if either did go on to attend college after the adoption.</p>
<p>Some of the other tidbits of information tend to cause more questions than answers.  The papers state that I wasn&#8217;t given baby formula for the first time until three days after birth.  What happened during those first days of my life?  Was I still with my biological mother during that time?  What other explanation could there be for the delay in receiving formula?  My adoption wasn&#8217;t finalized until the end of January, more than three months after I was born.  I believe I was in a foster home during this time.  Was I living at a private residence or a group home?  Who were the kind people who took care of me?  What were they like?</p>
<p>Most of the remaining information is mundane medical records and daily routines.  But to me it is precious.  I don&#8217;t have anyone with whom to discuss those first three months.  No one to tell me how often I ate,  how I reacted to bath time, that I made a &#8220;coo&#8221; sound when I laughed.  These type-written words are all I have.</p>
<p>Will I meet my biological mother and father one day?  Perhaps.  There are so many questions that these papers can never answer.  Maybe one day I will try to fill in the gaps left by the words that are <em>not</em> written. But for now, when I feel overwhelmed by all the unknown, I will pull out the worn, aged papers and look for a clue I may have previously missed.  A clue to my biological past.  A clue to my adoption story.</p>
<p>______________________________________________</p>
<p>You may have noticed I only reference the parents who created me as my biological mother and father.  Not Mother and Father.  Not Mom and Dad.  I will always be grateful to the people described on those pages for making the difficult decision to give me to someone who could provide a better life for me.  But my adoptive parents were, and always will be my Mom and Dad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny that I should be writing a <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/weekly-writing-challenge-a-few-of-my-favorite-things/">tribute </a>to my car. I have never cared about cars, nor found any romance in them. I didn&#8217;t even bother to learn to drive until I was 19, which sounds like sacrilege for an American teenager, but back then I went to school in New York and never intended to leave. I thought I would take the M4, and then the F, and work my way through the alphabet for the rest of my days. Now I live in the Boston suburbs with two children, and when I told my five-year-old that his Manhattan cousin takes the bus and the subway everywhere, he said, &#8220;What is he, French?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what happened.</p>
<p>Now, too far from the diminutive Boston T, with its colonial-sounding stop names (like Alewife and Quincy Adams, and don&#8217;t forget Wonderland), we all ride around in another bit of alphabet soup, our Honda CR-V, and it is in praise of this car, which we call the Dreamcrusher, that I write.</p>
<div id="attachment_1242" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://fiveuninterruptedminutes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/crv.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1242" title="crv" src="http://fiveuninterruptedminutes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/crv.jpeg?w=300&h=217" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Dreamcrusher.</p></div>
<p>Half the people in this town must drive CR-Vs. The other half drive Subaru Outbacks (one of which we also own). Though I try not to meet the gaze of a passing driver in an identical navy blue car, I don&#8217;t really mind this type of conformity. For me, car choice is not where I choose to express my individuality. I don&#8217;t want to turn any heads as I drive down the street; I don&#8217;t put on bumper stickers (COEXIST!); I don&#8217;t even fix all the dings I&#8217;ve received in the nursery school parking lot (none of which were my fault, in case any insurers or my husband is reading this).</p>
<p>We chose the car to get from place to place safely; to have enough trunk space to tote groceries and a stroller; and not have to worry about a temperamental engine that might require service in the middle of any given hectic week. Which is what I guess every CR-V driver wants. They, like me, are probably in their thirties, with young children, and care that the passenger door opens to 90 degrees so you can haul a car seat out more than that it only has four cylinders. I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;d do with two extra cylinders. Route 2 is not the Nurburgring, though people drive as though it is.</p>
<p>My husband and I started calling the car Dreamcrusher after watching the CR-V&#8217;s latest the ad campaign. Open any <em>Real Simple</em> magazine, and you&#8217;ll see a pleasing two-page spread, featuring a little vignette about some guy who&#8217;s about to get married wants to tick x, y, and z off his bucket list (in the ad they call it a &#8220;<a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/leap-list/my-list/">leap list</a>&#8221; &#8211; ie, things to do before you make the leap to marriage or children). There&#8217;s also one about some nice young lady who wants to do ever so much before she has children. These hopeful types dream of backpacking in Yosemite, learning to fly, starting a garage band&#8230;the usual prosaic stuff that marks youthful accomplishment prior to settling down. The ads are meant to say: &#8220;There&#8217;s so much in life yet to do! This car will take you there!&#8221;</p>
<p>But anyone who is seriously contemplating buying a CR-V can read the subtext:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to buy that Mini, or the Jeep with no doors. It&#8217;s not practical now. I&#8217;m about to make the leap from the corner bar to my couch every night, so I might as well get it over with and get the boring family car. I can tell myself I can always throw a drum kit in the back, but I&#8217;d have to move all those reusable grocery bags I keep forgetting to reuse and the portable potty. The garage will house a Cozy Coupe now, not a band. Let&#8217;s face it; if I haven&#8217;t done it yet, it&#8217;s not going to happen in these last months of pregnancy. My dreams are officially crushed.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1241" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://fiveuninterruptedminutes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cozy.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1241" title="cozy" src="http://fiveuninterruptedminutes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cozy.jpeg?w=300&h=217" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Your new roadie van.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Why do you think Honda chose Matthew Broderick to front their new ads? An actor who, even in squidgy middle age, is still Ferris Bueller, still embodies that young American vigor, the spirit that tells you you can do anything, and then you do. Just take the Ferrari keys and go. But look at him now. He&#8217;s not that guy anymore, and neither are you. But I see him, with salt-and-pepper hair, and his shirttails hanging out hopelessly, and I think, I&#8217;m OK with that. Where do I sign? No, I don&#8217;t need a moonroof.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 148px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22601582@N08/6252205209" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Matthew Broderick" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6252205209_68d2fff2fb_m.jpg" alt="Matthew Broderick" width="138" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Ferrari&#8217;s been crashed. (Photo credit: nick step)</p></div>
<p>I like the ads. They&#8217;re not lying to me. They are letting me down easy. They&#8217;re giving me a little wink toward my past, and a reminder that my present and future is not about me, it&#8217;s about my boys, and their dreams. The places I&#8217;ll take them. In a car with five-star crash test whatever and side airbags. So Honda, for that, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vltUWa_tOhE&amp;noredirect=1">danke schoen</a>.</p>
<p>And now, in spite of the CR-V&#8217;s ubiquitity, the Dreamcrusher has become a microcosm for our own particular family life. There are the scrapes where the two-year-old threw a rock at the bumper (now you know, Dad), the Wiggles and the Guided by Voices discs that alternate in the CD player, and the Matchbox cars tucked into every available pocket. The sippy cup of sour milk under the seat. The Saint Anthony card from my grandmother&#8217;s funeral watching over us from the dash. Fourteen half-full wipe containers, and just as many empty sunscreen and Purell bottles. Sand from five different beaches. A Star Wars book I held out the window, threatening to chuck it if a certain someone didn&#8217;t calm down. A world of lost Lego.</p>
<p>Well, actually, not anymore. Somehow I felt that if I cleaned up our dirty family car, and organized it with color-coded pouches for every eventual necessity, that my whole life would feel more orderly and calm as well. So a week or so ago I took the car to be professionally cleaned. In the cool morning, with fall in the air, I pulled out the car seats. It was like when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Al_Capone's_Vaults">Geraldo Rivera</a> opened Al Capone&#8217;s vault. Remember all that dirt that fell out of that thing? That&#8217;s how many Goldfish crumbs were under those seats. I hoped that saint card on the dash wasn&#8217;t a secret portal to my late <a title="Growing up Italian in a mac-and-cheese world" href="http://fiveuninterruptedminutes.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/growing-up-italian-in-a-mac-and-cheese-world/">Italian grandmother</a>&#8216;s soul, because if she could have seen the carpet of bright orange nightmare that was under there, any protection she might have sent me from on high would be revoked. Oh, the shame.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s September. We&#8217;ve said goodbye to the beach, we&#8217;re getting ready for school (which we can walk to, thankfully). As I take the Dreamcrusher to the car wash to vacuum out the last bits of summer, I think back to when I was little, when my Dad drove us in his red 1966 Corvette down the causeway to the beach near where we lived in Long Island. I, the oldest, sat between the seats, with one sister on the floor, the other in my mother&#8217;s lap. He&#8217;d point out rabbits on the roadside as we sped along to the oceanfront, the salty wind whipping our hair. Those days we&#8217;ll never see again. Mainly because my parents would be arrested if they put all those kids in a car without restraints.</p>
<p>But thinking of those days reminded me how much romance there is in our cars after all. They don&#8217;t have to be red and screaming, but whatever they are, our cars do more than drive us from the supermarket to the playground to karate and home again. They represent the open road, the conveyance of our dreams, all the things we want for our families: vacations we&#8217;ll never forget, graduations, visits to friends and family, unexpected adventures. The Dreamcrusher will take us there. And when our kids grow up, God willing, we&#8217;ll take out the car seats and the potty and have room again for the drum kit, or the camping gear, or a <a href="http://www.mta.info/">Metrocard </a>- all those silly youthful dreams that took a backseat to what would be our best dreams. But hopefully we&#8217;ll have a new car by then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://freepennypress.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pic102410_9.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" title="Mi Padre" src="http://freepennypress.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pic102410_9.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Many of us have possessions from our childhood that are so precious we cannot imagine being separated from them. For me, it’s family photos and one in particular of my father when he was 21 years old. A simple picture of a young man before a marriage, children and over 50 years of living.<br />
His picture sits on my desk and if the house caught fire it would be one of the first things I grabbed.</p>
<p>Let me introduce my Father:</p>
<p>Daddy was one of two sons, and he was clearly not the chosen one in his Father’s world. For whatever demented reasons, he was the boy most likely not to be loved by his Father. The younger brother was chosen as the prodigal son and would always remain that way. I’m quite certain a lot of his interior strength, drive and determination to excel came from those lonely nights of sleeping in a shed in the backyard, while his brother slept warmly indoors. The amazing thing is I never heard him complain about those sleeping arrangements, only said that was life with no harm done. Perhaps he was right, and that is where he formulated a life plan that would carry him down the road head held high, heart wide open.</p>
<p>I used to listen each afternoon for that gravel-crunch in our driveway which meant he was home from work. Sitting at the kitchen table, I would be waiting with a smile and hello. I wanted to follow him around the house as he decompressed from his day’s work, but respected his need for a few minutes of silence. That must be where I get my need for quiet from. His examples of selflessness, compassion and care for all humanity were silent threads he wove around all who happened to enter his circle. There was no room for negativity against any race, creed or religion for you would quickly be chastised and then a patient explanation would follow. I learned much at his knee.</p>
<p>Of all the gifts he gave me, the one for my thirteenth birthday was the most memorable. He and I climbed a sand dune at the Outer Banks and atop that sandy crest he validated my existence with a most wonderful life lesson. We talked about many things that summer day, but the one that marked me for life was his saying he loved me. His actions had shown that , but for that moment he let down his protective guard and gave me a lifetime gift.<br />
He said, “I am the only man who will love you the entire length of your life”. At the time it sounded sweet and pleased me much, but it was not until many years later I would realize exactly why he said those words.</p>
<p>On October 22 at 7:27pm, my world was cleaved into a million fragments. My buddy had died. Just like that, he up and left me and there was no warning. All of my life force, blood and energy had been drained through my feet and poured into a gutter. I was a living carcass. I recall having nowhere to go but down, with my face parallel to carpet threads.</p>
<p>I made a vow to him we would speak each day to one another even if I could not see him. His voice might have been silenced, but through wonders of this universe he has kept his word. Whether it is a breeze, a sense of well being or that occasional bluebird feather found on my car’s windshield, his presence is always known to me. Whenever there are moments of great stress in my life, I sit quietly and ask him for guidance and the answers appear as if they were written in ink.</p>
<p>I will continue to live out my life knowing his eyes are forever watching over me. Through living my life caring about humanity, he lives on in me. In this lifetime I shall never meet a finer man and will go to my grave knowing I am always  loved.</p>
<p>And, I have the picture&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burning Man is an annual event in Black Rock City, Nevada, where people from all over the world come to celebrate art and life. Black Rock City is built, maintained, and dismantled every year by volunteers who pay admittance into the city and is also Nevada&#8217;s third largest city with sixty sixty-thousand attendants in 2012.</p>
<div id="attachment_723" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_1669.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-723" title="Burning Man 2012: Fertility 2.0. Black Rock City, Neveda. 01 September 2012" src="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_1669.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It is impossible to stay out of the dust at Burning Man so be prepared for it with goggles and a handkerchief.</p></div>
<p>Unlike conventional music and arts festivals with a central line up of music and events, Burning Man is a decentralized gathering where you are the event. Dress up and exchange compliments with all the beautiful looking people &#8211; they spend a lot of time and effort picking and choosing what to look like.</p>
<div id="attachment_722" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_1642.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-722" title="Burning Man 2012: Fertility 2.0.

Make sure you exit off of the slide before you go!</p></div>
<p>Camps at Burning Man are often elaborate and well constructed with furniture, decorations, and other creative items that are brought in. The popular theme between camps at Burning Man is goods and supplies are gifted and bartered. That is to say &#8211; many of the events, kitchens, and workshops are managed and maintained by burners and are free and open to others. Everyone is encouraged to visit each other&#8217;s camp, wherein a thick booklet that is handed out upon arrival lists a number of registered events.</p>

<p>Black Rock City hosts an unremarkable display of art and imagination &#8211; unlike a museum or gallery, the art is hands on and participants become the art as they engage one another.</p>
<p>One notable piece is in camp Area 51 that is decorated on the outside by <a href="http://alexgrey.com/">Alex Grey&#8217;s</a> artwork. The artist in here explains on his statement, &#8220;that it cannot be photographed, or videoed,&#8221; but only experienced. This artist builds a hollow box with an assortment of mirrors and openings from the outside so that eye contact can be made through it between two or more people creates a unique experience to share.</p>
<div id="attachment_717" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_1051.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-717" title="Burning Man 2012: Fertility 2.0.

<p>As art pushes the boundaries of the human imagination, Burning Man inspires a celebration of what this world is made of and the kinds of rolls one can have in it. Work shops are abound at Burning Man to explore one&#8217;s boundaries. Human suspension and tickling work shops are to name a few, but the list goes on in a book that is hundreds of pages long.</p>
<div id="attachment_709" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_0577.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-709" title="Burning Man 2012: Fertility 2.0.

<p>Black Rock City has its own unique lay out based on the clock watch and the English alphabet with The Man directly in the center. From two o&#8217;clock to ten o&#8217;clock is where everyone&#8217;s camped, plus there many other sculptures to see. The rest of the three-hundred sixty-degrees is called deep playa where more art and The Temple are located. Rides from Mutant Vehicles are popular here and are very helpful when moving across the playa or wanting to have fun and see the city.</p>
<div id="attachment_721" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://betabus.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012_07_28_burningman_1617.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-721" title="Burning Man 2012: Fertility 2.0.

<p>The culminating event at Burning Man is the lighting on fire of a forty foot structure called The Man. At the beginning of the evening fire troops – people that spin fans, staffs, poi, and other tools lit with fire, dance in syncronicity around The Man. Proceeding it are fireworks and then The Man is burned.</p>
<p>This is a spectacular event as people gather at a distance around The Man to sit down in a ring and watch it burn. Outside of this ring of people are hundreds of mutant vehicles that play music and give rides across the playa. This year a replica of Wall Street was built and burned, as were other unique pieces including big box letters that read “EGO.” Effigies are numerous and are burned the night before The Man</p>
