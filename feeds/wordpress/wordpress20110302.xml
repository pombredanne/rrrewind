			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://acleansurface.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dscf1571.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3211" title="boxes" src="http://acleansurface.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dscf1571.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I am approaching my tenth move in sixteen years.</strong></p>
<p>Those are my own moves, rather than moves I have helped with, although there have been some of those as well.</p>
<p>What have I learned from all of this moving? I learned to expect to move again, no matter how contented I might feel in a given location. I learned to be prepared.</p>
<p>I realized that the next move was guaranteed to arrive sooner than I would like, and I learned that certain choices made while stationary would have both physical and economic consequences during that next move. I made my furniture choices accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>My furniture purchases were based on how well a given item would fold, stack, disassemble or fit through a doorway, not to mention how easily the item could be lifted. </strong>I still have some folding and stacking oak shelves I purchased more than fifteen years ago, while other less manageable items have been left behind or given away. In some sad cases, awkward items were broken during a move. No wonder I became interested in minimalism!</p>
<p>Then, I became a wife and mother. I forgot some of the lessons I had learned in my life. I felt settled. I found a large (and still new-looking!) leather sofa at a secondhand store for $600. It <em>just happened to match</em> the almost-new leather chair and ottoman I had already brought home from another secondhand store for $150. It seemed like fate. I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>Now, after just a few years, I am forced to consider how exactly we will fit that large leather sofa up the switch back staircase in our future destination&#8230;there is another side to fate, you see. You win some, you lose some. Hopefully we won&#8217;t need to lose the sofa. That would be a hard lesson.</p>
<p>Something else I learned from my moves is to start packing early. Moving is like going on a trip &#8212; one that lasts a very long time (although sometimes not as long as we hope). I never liked packing for trips. I always thought I might forget some crucial item, like pants. Pants are important. Restaurant signs used to say &#8220;No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service&#8221;, but of course, pants (or a reasonable substitute for pants) are also expected. In fact, I am certain that pants are more of a priority than either the shirt or the shoes, despite what the signs used to say. (These days, signs are more likely to say &#8220;No Cellphones&#8221;.) I have not actually forgotten my pants on any trip, but I worry about these things. I can be a little bit forgetful at times, which is why I try to organize things so deliberately. I need to compensate for my poor memory.</p>
<p>My stress level and my mood on the days before leaving on trips were enough to teach my husband a lesson. Now he encourages me to pack a few days early. Sometimes he even brings my suitcase out. It helps. The very first trip we took as a family had a rough beginning. Now that I think about it, the middle and the ending of that trip were kind of rough, too. It started with my husband and the three boys sitting in the car for the better part of an hour. They were waiting for me to meet them after I finished work, trying to be efficient in their readiness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lack of communication was a problem that day. I was hungry after work and stopped for something to eat, without knowing they were already sitting in the car. The four of them were hot, fidgety, and cranky from being strapped in a parked car for so long, and I was horrified to find them there when I arrived. We left too late in the day, hitting some heavy traffic on the journey. Further crankiness ensued. I have heard that you don&#8217;t really know people well until you have traveled with them. I think it might be true. Lessons were learned on that trip.</p>
<p>At least traffic won&#8217;t be an issue in this move, as we will only be a few miles away from our current home. I wanted to start packing boxes as soon as I knew we were moving, although I knew it was unlikely that we would be able to transport anything for another four to six weeks. Starting early is my own version of efficiency. Now the boxes are stacking up, getting in the way, making the place feel a touch claustrophobic&#8230;but it is better than the anxiety of packing in a rush. At least, to me it is better &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t speak for my family. But really, who wants a stressed out wife or mother? No one. A few stubbed toes might be worth it.</p>
<p>I asked some friends for their own moving tips and I got a few good ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>My advice would be to label the HECK out of every  box. Add  the date and ALL the contents&#8230; unless you plan on unpacking   everything immediately (unlikely, right?). I actually listed all the   contents of each box on at least two sides of the box &#8211; not only don&#8217;t   you have to unpack a box to find something, you don&#8217;t have to unstack   all the boxes to find the right box!  ~J.I.</p>
<p>To move hanging clothes, cover 10-20 items (still on hangers) in a large trash bag and tie the bottom closed.  ~J.L.</p>
<p>Dust everything before you pack it, and always  ask  yourself, &#8220;Shall I pack this or donate it?&#8221; I put all small miscellaneous   breakables in socks. Socks work better than wrapping in paper.  ~J.F.</p></blockquote>
<p>I especially like the tip about socks. I have also read that towels and T-shirts are good for packing dishes, and like the sock idea, this helps eliminate paper waste, and allows you two pack two items at once.</p>
<p>Here are some of my other favorite moving ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pack one room at a time.</li>
<li>Label boxes &#8220;Open First&#8221; if you know you will be needing the contents in the first days after arrival.</li>
<li>Load the moving truck according to the order in which the large items will be moved into the house.  In other words, the last things into the truck will be the first unloaded, so they should be the ones you want to place first.  Pieces destined for the back rooms of the house are likely candidates for the back of the truck.</li>
<li>Pack a suitcase with changes of clothing and toiletries as though you were taking a weekend trip.</li>
<li>Take pictures of the wire hook-ups for your electronics to make it easier to reconnect them, and label all cords, wrapping them to avoid tangling in the move.</li>
</ul>
<p>I already have many of our cords labeled, and I plan to wrap them carefully. No one wants to open a box and release that tangled nest of mysterious black snakes, their threatening metal fangs extended, dripping with the toxic venom of potential frustration. I look forward to more wireless technology in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will settle for some organization, a positive attitude, and the hope that our leather sofa will make it up that switch back staircase.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was one coming out party Steve Jobs couldn&#8217;t afford to miss.</p>
<p>Apple Inc.&#8217;s iconic chief executive returned from a medical leave of absence on Wednesday to help unveil the latest edition of the company&#8217;s popular iPad tablet computer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on this product for a while and I didn&#8217;t want to miss today,&#8221; Mr. Jobs said during a special Apple event in San Francisco.</p>
<p>[np-related]</p>
<p>Officially kicked off the next chapter in the ongoing saga of the tablet wars on Wednesday, launching an updated version of the iPad.</p>
<p>The new iPad 2 will range in price between US$499 for a 16 gigabyte version with WiFi technology to a 64 GB model that features WiFi and 3G connectivity for $829.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 will go on sale in the United States on March 11 and will roll out to several international markets, including Canada on March 25.</p>
<p>Shares of Apple were up about $1.70 (0.5%) to $351.06 on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange in the half hour leading up to the event.</p>
<p>Despite his appearance at the iPad2 launch event on Wednesday, Apple did not say whether Mr. Jobs would be resuming his day to day duties running the company. Mr. Jobs announced <a href="http://www.financialpost.com/news/Apple+without+Jobs/4125754/story.html" target="_blank">he was taking an indefinite medical leave of absence from Apple on Jan. 17</a>.</p>
<p>He has previously battled pancreatic cancer and underwent a procedure for a liver transplant last year.</p>
<p><span id="more-31111"></span>Since its launch in the United States last April, Apple has sold more than 15 million iPads, more than any other tablet manufacturer, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/03/tablet_computers" target="_blank">accounting for about 80% of the global tablet market</a>.</p>
<p>However, much has changed in the computing world since Apple unveiled the first iPad <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2011/01/27/a-look-back-at-12-months-of-the-ipad/" target="_blank">at a special event last January</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/Strategy-Analytics-Android-bw-147962240.html?x=0">According to a recent report from market research firm Strategy Analytics</a>, about 9.7 million tablets were sold globally in the fourth quarter of 2010. About 75% of the tablets sold were iPads, while 22% were Android devices, led by Samsung’s Galaxy Tab.</p>
<p>Apple’s share of the market fell from 95% in Q3 due largely to the rise of Android devices.</p>
<p>While the iPad enjoyed a near-exclusive hold over the tablet market for much of 2010 &#8212; with Samsung Group Ltd.&#8217;s Android-powered Galaxy Tab the only true competitor to reach consumers last year &#8212; Apple is already facing stiffer competition for control of the rapidly expanding market for mobile tablets, a trend which is expected to intensify in 2011.</p>
<p>Research In Motion Ltd. is due to release its own tablet &#8212; <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2011/02/28/rim-may-have-missed-window-of-opportunity-with-playbook/" target="_blank">the BlackBerry PlayBook</a> &#8212; by the end of the month, Motorola Mobility launched its Xoom tablet in the United States last week, Hewlett-Packard Co. is preparing to launch a new tablet running the Palm webOS software and Samsung will be launching three different versions of its Galaxy Tab this year.</p>
<p>When RIM first unveiled the PlayBook at its developer conference in September, the company faced criticism for delaying the launch until the first quarter of 2011. Analysts worried the PlayBook&#8217;s launch could be overshadowed by a new Apple tablet if RIM waited too long to roll out the PlayBook.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, online BlackBerry news site Boy Genius Report <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/02/blackberry-playbook-launching-on-april-10th/" target="_blank">published a story saying the launch of the PlayBook has been delayed until April 10</a>.</p>
<p>RIM has still not offered a specific U.S. launch date for the first edition of the PlayBook. Sources have told the Financial Post that the device will go on sale to consumers in &#8220;late March.&#8221;</p>
<p>JP Morgan securities recently raised its 2011 tablet revenue estimates to to US$26.1-billion, up from its initial forecast of US$24.9-billion and expects manufacturers to ship as many as 47.9 million tablets worldwide before the year is out.</p>
<p>In 2012, JP Morgan estimates the market to grow to US$35.2-billion, with unit shipments topping 79.6 million.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[By nature, Heather's boys are nothing like me. By nurture, yeah, I'm probably starting to wear off. But it's an interesting experience finding those coincidental commonalities. Even when it's frustrating.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&amp;blog=256907&amp;post=4603&amp;subd=freshlypressed&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://storiesinmypocket.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/nature-nurture-or-none-of-the-above/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qBLnAhOTrzI/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>To be fair, it&#8217;s happened before in good ways.</p>
<p>But Thursday morning before the launch, as Finn and I were facing off and I found myself entering terra incognita of child discipline with a mad, hurt, yet staunchly stubborn and defiant seven year old in front of me, the thought entered my head, &#8220;This child is <em>so</em> much like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a weird feeling.</p>
<p>By nature, he&#8217;s not like me at all. He&#8217;s not mine. He inherited nothing from me. Genetically, he doesn&#8217;t have my stubbornness any more than he&#8217;ll ever have my nose.</p>
<p>By nurture, yeah, he&#8217;s starting to be a little bit like me. You can definitely tell where I&#8217;m starting to rub off a little on both of the boys. The little things make me smile &#8212; like hearing them tell a &#8220;One-hundred-and-one&#8221; joke like we do in the improv shows. The big things make me really happy, though &#8212; you can tell there&#8217;s an increased love of narrative that I think is really cool. And, Heather says, they pray more, and more personally, because of me. And, yeah, that means a whole lot. A whole lot.</p>
<p>But then there&#8217;s another category, the none-of-the-above comparisons.</p>
<p>You become friends with someone because you find things you have in common. At the beginning of a dating relationship, you&#8217;re amazed at all the commonalities &#8212; &#8220;You like movies!? I like movies! And, hey, we&#8217;re both bipedal mammals! How amazing is that!? Clearly we were meant to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>But you share those things not because of any shared background, but because you both just happen to have taken different roads that ended up in the same place in those areas.</p>
<p>Caden and I have a few of those, but, to be honest, any commonalities with Caden are more with an idealized version of me than with the real me. I wish I were as free-spirited as he is, able to enjoy life the same way, as gifted at encouragement as he just naturally is. I tell him I&#8217;ll do something, and get around to it a few days later, and am greeted not with a &#8220;finally&#8221; type of response, but with &#8220;Good remembering, David!&#8221; I wish I could master that outlook.</p>
<p>Finn and I, on the other hand &#8230;</p>
<p>I saw him standing there in front of me last Thursday, and could put myself in his shoes, standing like that in front of my own dad. Stubborn, proud, desperately wanting to be as much in control as I could be. I wished I knew how to tell him that. It also made me put myself in the shoes of my dad a couple of decades ago. I have a few things in common with him, too.</p>
<p>I also see myself also in Finn&#8217;s cleverness. He&#8217;s competitive, but he loves figuring out how to work the system, to find the loopholes that give him an edge. Like me, he&#8217;s an odd blend of introvert and extrovert. He&#8217;ll not speak to a schoolmate in public because he doesn&#8217;t know what to say, but he&#8217;ll do a chicken dance in front of friends at a Havoc game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun. I had no idea what it would be like having kids be a big part of my life, and that&#8217;s been one of the biggest surprises &#8212; that one of the most challenging and most rewarding parts of it has been discovering just who these two guys are as people. They have their own personalities, vastly different from each other, but each with so many things that warm my heart and probably more than a few things that try my patience. But they&#8217;re both just so wholly and fully and uniquely them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cool thing where my commonality with their uniqueness gives me a perspective that Heather doesn&#8217;t have; it lets me feel like I actually contribute something.</p>
<p>And knowing that being around me has an impact on them; seeing how they are shaped because I&#8217;m in their life, is one of the most rewarding experiences and yet heaviest burdens I&#8217;ve had.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong>Seriously, if you didn&#8217;t know the back-story &#8212; you didn&#8217;t know the trainwreck that Charlie Sheen&#8217;s life has become, and the history of drug use and decadence &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t Sheen&#8217;s recent quotes be impressive?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you were an employer, looking to add to your sales staff? Wanna play? Here are some typical job interview questions and REAL Charlie Sheen answers.</p>
<p>Admit it, you&#8217;d hire the guy if you didn&#8217;t know any better:</p>
<div><strong> </strong><strong>What is your greatest strength? </strong></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bi-winning. I win here. I win there.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Describe a typical work week.</strong></p>
<p>﻿&#8221;I&#8217;m proud of what I created. It was radical. I exposed people to magic. I exposed them to something they&#8217;re never going to see in their boring normal lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How many hours do you normally work?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes sleep is for infants. I don&#8217;t sleep. I wait. When I can&#8217;t sleep I don&#8217;t fight it. I just figure that there&#8217;s a higher calling.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What is your greatest weakness?</strong></p>
<p><strong> &#8220;</strong>I am on a drug. It&#8217;s called &#8216;Charlie Sheen!&#8217; It&#8217;s not available because if you try it once you will die. Your face will melt off and your children will weep over your exploded body.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe yourself?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a high priest vatican assassin warlock. I don&#8217;t know. All these words just sound cool together. They come from my grand wizard master.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the pace at which you work?</strong></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve got tiger blood and Adonis DNA, it&#8217;s like, get with the program dude.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What motivates you?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been the aw-shucks guy with this bitchin&#8217; rockstar life, so now I&#8217;m going to completely embrace it. I&#8217;m going to wrap both arms around it and love it violently, and defend it violently, through violent hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What are your salary expectations?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not [broke] but I was kind of counting on some of that money to get me through the summer. Now I&#8217;ve got to like work. But that&#8217;s alright. Work&#8217;s good. Work fuels the soul.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I am a peaceful man with bad intentions</p>
<p><strong>What do people most often criticize about you? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You borrow my brain for five seconds and just be like dude, can&#8217;t handle it, unplug this bastard. It fires in a way that is, I don&#8217;t know, maybe not from this terrestrial realm.</p>

Please see the Fair Use Rationale at the end of this post.</p></div>
<p>Today is the birthday of Theodor Geisel, that giant of children’s literature better known as Dr. Seuss. He wrote an impressive number of much-loved classics in his lifetime, including my favourite, <em>How The Grinch Stole Christmas</em>. (I’ve been watching the animated version every year since I was about 5 — it just wouldn’t be Christmas without the Grinch and all the Whos down in Whoville.)</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss is also the author of an exuberantly sweet story called <em>Oh, the Places You’ll Go!</em> It’s fast becoming a traditional high school graduation gift, and it’s easy to see why. The book chronicles the excitement of being on the cusp of something new, with an engaging sense of child-like wonder.</p>
<p>My own high school graduation took place in the Dark Ages (<em>ie</em>. pre-Internet) and now that I’m practically in my dotage, I find myself relating the book to the ups and downs of expat life. The experiences of the pint-sized protagonist are intimately familiar to anyone who’s been an expat or a repatriate, with situations that cover the emotional gamut:</p>
<h3><strong>Anticipation</strong></h3>
<p><em>Congratulations! Today is your day. You’re off to Great Places! You’re off and away!</em></p>
<p>The book begins as all adventures should: with exhilaration. I get the impression our unnamed hero has been eagerly counting down the days until this, the reddest red-letter day of his life. I felt exactly the same way whenever I began a new expat journey. The adrenaline rush — amplified by a healthy dollop of pure fear — made it seem as though life was just waiting for me to grab it and ride it hard.</p>
<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
<p><em>You’re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the guy who’ll decide where to go. You’ll look up and down streets. Look’em over with care. About some you will say, “I don’t choose to go there.” </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Erm</em> — maybe not. <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Career considerations and other factors mean we don’t always have a choice about where we end up. When one partner is unwilling to relocate but choosing <em>not</em> to go isn’t an option, the stresses on a family are considerable. Resentment is a tough cross to bear, and many expat marriages collapse under the weight.</p>
<h3><strong>Emotional Resiliency</strong></h3>
<p><em>I’m sorry to say so but, sadly, it’s true that Bang-ups and Hang-ups can happen to you. And when things start to happen, don’t worry. Don’t stew. Just go right along. You’ll start happening too.</em></p>
<p>Stuff happens, and it’s not always good — but it doesn’t have to destroy you. As the British government famously said during the Blitz: Keep Calm and Carry On. In other words, don’t hide away in your condo, don’t give up on learning the local language, and above all, don’t leave yourself open to regret that you squandered this amazing opportunity for growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Saying goodbye</strong></h3>
<p><em>And your gang will fly on. You’ll be left in a Lurch.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you’re the one who’s flying on, but the result is the same. Expat friendships are vulnerable things, susceptible as they are to the dictates of outside forces. When life feels like one long series of goodbyes, it can get you down.</p>
<h3><strong>Depression</strong></h3>
<p><em>You’ll come down from the Lurch with an unpleasant bump. And the chances are, then, that you’ll be in a Slump. And when you’re in a Slump, you’re not in for much fun. Un-slumping yourself is not easily done.</em></p>
<p>Depression is a widespread but largely invisible problem in the expatriate community. It sucks the joy out of life and makes daily tasks unmanageable. “Un-slumping yourself” can be difficult to do on your own; this is where a <a title="International Therapist Directory — a good place to start!" href="http://internationaltherapistdirectory.com/" target="_blank">licensed un-slumper</a> (doctor, psychologist, therapist, coach) can work wonders.</p>
<h3><strong>Uncertainty</strong></h3>
<p><em>You will come to a place where the streets are not marked. Simple it’s not, I’m afraid you will find,  for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.</em></p>
<p>When we first arrive at a new destination, we don’t have a clear understanding of what to expect or how to behave. Yes, we’re full of doubt, but that has its uses: it forces us to think through the consequences of our decisions. Too much doubt, however, leads to paralysis. The luckiest expats quickly find a cultural informant or mentor — either a local or a long-term resident — who can explain cultural norms and steer them in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Loneliness</strong></h3>
<p><em>All Alone!  Whether you like it or not, Alone will be something you’ll be quite a lot. </em></p>
<p>Just accept it: at some point in your expat life, you’re going to be lonely. Perhaps not “quite a lot,” but there’s no denying it’s an occupational hazard of this lifestyle. The most treacherous thing about loneliness is that it opens the door to other unpleasant emotions such as doubt and depression.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning from experience</strong></h3>
<p><em>You’ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. You’ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact, and remember that Life’s a Great Balancing Act. </em></p>
<p>If you’re looking for a life philosophy, you could do worse than this. The man pretty much covers all the bases with these lines. I especially like the reference to “great tact,” which is something every expatriate should have in her tool kit.</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss published <em>Oh, the Places You’ll Go!</em> in 1990, a year before his death. He crammed a lifetime of wisdom into this, his final book. I’m going to start giving it as a going-away gift to friends heading off on overseas adventures. And high school graduates, of course.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fritz and I both have a sweet tooth.  Luckily for me, I can usually distract mine from chocolate and candies with fruit&#8211;Fritz, not so much.  He says he doesn&#8217;t even have a real sweet tooth, more of a &#8220;snack tooth&#8221;.  The kid loves to snack. Like, he <em>really</em> loves a snack.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting this primal need of his, I try to keep the cupboards stocked with healthy snacks&#8211;granola bars, nuts, pumpkin seeds, yogurts, peanut butter, etc.  A lot of snack choices = a happy Fritz.  (This is supplemented by my parents generously supplying him with extra-large bags of peanut M&amp;Ms, of course).</p>
<p>I decided to make a sweet snack that would still be healthier than say, chips, but still have that grab-a-handful-on-the-way-by appeal that a true snack has.  I was looking through <em>Vegetarian Times </em>and stumbled upon the perfect easy snack recipe&#8211;Cocoa-dusted Glazed Almonds.  After I made them, I renamed them because they reminded me exactly of Mexican hot chocolate&#8211;sweet, spicy, and perfectly satisfying.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-116.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428" title="MHC Almonds" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-116.jpg?w=590&#038;h=786" alt="" width="590" height="786" /></a></p>
<p> Here&#8217;s the recipe for you to try:</p>
<p><strong>Mexican Hot Chocolate Almonds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 T maple syrup</li>
<li>2 T brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>1/2 t cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1/4 t cinnamon</li>
<li>2 C raw almonds</li>
<li>1 1/2 T cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-055.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1429" title="MHC Almonds Ingredients" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-055.jpg?w=590&#038;h=786" alt="" width="590" height="786" /></a></p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Combine everything except the almonds and the cocoa powder into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Add the almonds, and cook for three minutes, constantly stirring.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-060-horz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1430" title="Cooking Almonds" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-060-horz.jpg?w=614&#038;h=409" alt="" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p>Pour onto the prepared baking sheet, and spread them out into a single layer&#8211;this takes a little effort, &#8217;cause they are very sticky at this point!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-073-horz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1431" title="Mexican Hot Chocolate Almonds prebake" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-073-horz.jpg?w=614&#038;h=266" alt="" width="614" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Bake in the oven (middle rack) until the syrup around the almonds turns a darker brown, about 20 minutes.  Keep your eye one these, because nuts burn fast in the oven and there&#8217;s no way to turn back once you&#8217;ve gone too far!  When finished, remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Meanwhile, place the cocoa powder into a resealable bag.  When the almonds are cool, break them apart and toss &#8216;em in the bag until they are dusted with cocoa.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-107-horz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1432" title="Post Bake" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-107-horz.jpg?w=614&#038;h=409" alt="" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-139-horz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1434" title="Almonds" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-139-horz.jpg?w=614&#038;h=233" alt="" width="614" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>These almonds were a tremendous success.  They have a surprisingly complex flavor but it melds perfectly with the cocoa powder.  When I was just making the syrup, I was worried it was too salty and too spicy, but once you taste the toasted almonds with it&#8211;perfection.  These went pretty quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-178-horz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1435" title="MHC Almonds 1" src="http://laurenzietsman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/croque-monsieur-stir-fry-mexhc-almonds-178-horz.jpg?w=614&#038;h=298" alt="" width="614" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>And they go <em>perfectly </em>with a glass of milk.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_555" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/assisi-_01.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-555" title="Assisi-_01" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/assisi-_01.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="Our first view of Assisi" width="590" height="393" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our first view of Assisi.

<p>Assisi is an &#8220;overgrown village&#8221; with a huge cathedral, on the side of one of Mt. Subasio&#8217;s foothills. It has a population of about 3000 people, but hosts about five million visitors every year.  Frommer&#8217;s writes, &#8220;This constant flood of travelers has polished the usual hill-town charm right off Assisi.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if you stay in the town, as we did, like our experience in <a title="The medieval Tuscan town of San Gimignano" href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/the-medieval-tuscan-town-of-san-gimignano/">San Gimignano</a>, in the late night and early morning after the tourists in their cars and the tour buses have pulled away,  this area of Italy where St. Francis and St. Clare walked and prayed holds quite enough charm for me.</p>
<div id="attachment_536" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 475px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/02_piazza.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-536 " title="02_piazza" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/02_piazza.jpg?w=465&#038;h=700" alt="Piazza del Commune" width="465" height="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Piazza del Commune—the Temple of Minerva is on the right. It was built by the Romans in the 1st century B.C. and has since been converted into a church.</p></div>
<p>Our hotel was off a short alley from the main square in town called the Piazza del Commune.</p>
<div id="attachment_538" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/04_frescoes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-538" title="04_frescoes" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/04_frescoes.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="Frescoes inside the Basilica di San Francesco" width="590" height="393" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Frescoes inside the Basilica di San Francesco</p></div>
<p>Our first stop was the Basilica di San Francesco at the edge of town. Inside, frescoes by Giotto tell the story of St. Francis&#8217; life.</p>
<div id="attachment_537" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 475px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/03_cathedral.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-537" title="03_cathedral" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/03_cathedral.jpg?w=465&#038;h=700" alt="Basilica di San Francesco" width="465" height="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Basilica di San Francesco</p></div>
<p>&#8220;But suffice it to say that Assisi&#8217;s grandiose, gorgeously embellished  Basilica di San Francesco is an incongruous memorial to a man who  preached and lived an utterly simple life.&#8221; (Frommers).</p>
<p><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/06_camps.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-540 aligncenter" title="06_camps" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/06_camps.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="" width="590" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>Down the large stone staircase from the cathedral, open shelters were constructed for pilgrims as a place to camp for the night. We caught a taxi from here and went to see St. Francis&#8217; hermitage on Mt. Subasio.</p>
<div id="attachment_541" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 475px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/07_hermitage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-541" title="07_hermitage" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/07_hermitage.jpg?w=465&#038;h=700" alt="St. Francis hermitage" width="465" height="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">St. Francis hermitage</p></div>
<p>Monks now live in the hermitage tucked into the wooded hillside where <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/features/francis/who_was.asp">St. Francis</a> often went to meditate and pray. We saw the stone bed, a simple indentation in the stone floor, where St. Francis slept, and took a short walk along a trail in the woods.</p>
<div id="attachment_542" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/08_sunrays.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-542" title="08_Sunrays" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/08_sunrays.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="Sunrays—a view from St. Francis hermitage" width="590" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrays—a view from St. Francis hermitage</p></div>
<p>Our taxi driver waited for us a half hour. We were concerned about letting him go and not being able to get a ride back. Unfortunately, for me, a half hour was not enough to soak up the peace that can be found simply by sitting along the walkway in this place.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 475px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/11_castle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-545" title="11_castle" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/11_castle.jpg?w=465&#038;h=700" alt="Inside Rocca Maggiore" width="465" height="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside Rocca Maggiore</p></div>
<p>We decided to take the taxi up to Rocca Maggiore instead of back to town. Rocca Maggiore was built by Cardinal Albornoz in the 14th century to establish papal authority over Assisi—a striking visual of the medieval church&#8217;s reach for civil power. It was a fun, not very crowded place to tour.</p>
<div id="attachment_546" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/12_wall_to_tower.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-546" title="12_wall_to_tower" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/12_wall_to_tower.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="Rocca Maggiore" width="590" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of wall to octagonal tower taken from first tower.</p></div>
<p>We had free reign of the castle ruins. We entered the outer walls and saw the recently restored keep and soldiers&#8217; quarters.</p>
<div id="attachment_547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/13_tunnel.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-547" title="13_tunnel" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/13_tunnel.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="Rocca Maggiore" width="590" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walkway through wall to the lookout tower.</p></div>
<p>Then we took a very long, narrow corridor lit by repeating arrow slits (and a few electric light bulbs) to a polygonal watchtower with a panoramic view.</p>
<div id="attachment_548" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 475px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/14_walk_down.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-548" title="14_walk_down" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/14_walk_down.jpg?w=465&#038;h=700" alt="Rocca Maggiore" width="465" height="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Rocca Maggiore taken from the walk back down to town.</p></div>
<p>Our taxi driver assured us it was an easy walk back to town from the castle—all downhill.</p>
<div id="attachment_549" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/15_stclare.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-549" title="15_StClare" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/15_stclare.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="Santa Chiara" width="590" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A view of Santa Chiara taken from Rocca Maggiore</p></div>
<p>After stopping for gelato on our way back down, we went on to Santa Chiara—the resting place of <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/About/PressRoom/Magazine/prsam0703.asp">St. Clare</a>&#8216;s bones and St. Francis&#8217; miraculous crucifix. Inside the church, a small museum displays St. Clare&#8217;s handmade dress, her hair shirt and a robe St. Francis wore among other things.</p>
<div id="attachment_550" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/16_sunset.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-550" title="16_sunset" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/16_sunset.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="Sunset in Assisi" width="590" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset from the terrace in front of Santa Chiara</p></div>
<p>Santa Chiara is located on a terrace-like piazza with views over the valley.</p>
<p><a href="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/18_night.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-552 aligncenter" title="18_night" src="http://randomthoughtsfrommidlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/18_night.jpg?w=590&#038;h=391" alt="" width="590" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>In the morning Mark and I got up and went to a mass that was entirely in Italian (go figure). Then we left our cozy bed and breakfast with the rooftop patio and drove on to Rome.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many, I have been captivated by the news and images coming from the Middle East over the last month or two.  It has been fascinating to watch the virus of vocalized dissatisfaction spread from city to city, region to region, country to country.  I say with a bit of shame and awe, it took me completely by surprise.  I never had the thought in my head that things in that region might change so dramatically over such a short period of time.</p>
<p>I was on the phone with my father about two weeks ago, just after Mubarak finally resigned, and we were talking about Egypt.  He chuckled and said, &#8220;I bet you are half glad to be somewhere else, but half really wish you were there right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s true.  It must have been a sublime three weeks in Egypt – at times frightening and disheartening and at other time intoxicating.  Only someone who has actually lived through a revolution could really understand what it was like to be there, to experience the swell of energy that doesn’t just recede but breaks with enough force to create true change.</p>
<p>And while of course I am grateful to be in a safe and democratic country, I also am left so curious as to what it has really been like for people living through these tumultuous weeks. I try to imagine the feelings pulsing through the cities as things move up and down and back and forth, drama after drama unraveling.  I try to imagine the surge in will and determination that leads people into the streets day after day.  I try to imagine how frightened and impotent people must feel as their governments use harsher and harsher methods to control the protests and stifle the descent, as people&#8217;s capacity to communicate with the outside world diminishes or ends altogether, as people are killed. I try to imagine the moments of defiance, of hope, of fear, of exaltation, and then (at least in the case of Tunisia and Egypt) of euphoria.</p>
<p>But the truth is I can&#8217;t.  I do not know what it feels like to be so oppressed and to have so much at stake, nor have I ever been anywhere at the precise moment of the emergence of momentous change.</p>
<p>The closest I’ve come perhaps was being in New York on 9/11 or Paris when France won the World Cup in 1998.</p>
<div id="attachment_1474" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 365px"><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/paris-98-world-cup-win.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1474" title="Champs-elysees World Cup Win" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/paris-98-world-cup-win.jpg?w=355&#038;h=512" alt="" width="355" height="512" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thousands of people fill the Champs-Elysees in Paris on July 13th, 1998, as they wait for the French national soccer team.  The French beat Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final on July 12th. AFP photo by Gabriel Bouys.</p></div>
<p>In both cases I was part of an entire population brought together with a common feeling.  There was a sense of complete shared experience, in shock and tragedy in one circumstance, and celebration and pride in the other.</p>
<p>But these situations were so different because they were the experience of living through something that happens to a community, rather than something that a community makes happen.</p>
<p>How is it that things can go on one way for so very many years and then suddenly, over the period of a handful of days, change completely?  What is it that comes together to make that moment so different than all the moments that came before? What makes the perfect balance of specific factors that combine in a chemical reaction that cannot be reversed?</p>
<p>I guess what I wonder is how that moment, the moment on the way to change really happening, the moment just before the tipping point, FEELS to the people inside it, creating it?  When you are in the middle of it, part of it, riding the flow of it, do you have a sense of what is happening?  Do you feel as you act, as you watch, as you listen, that something is really happening, that you are in the middle of history in the making?  Is there a consciousness to it, or is it more raw and blind than that?  Do you act because you can imagine your actions having a positive outcome, because you can feel deeply that all of it is going somewhere, that there could be a breaking point right there in front of you?  Do you know somehow deep inside?  Or  is there a need to move and act, not because you feel the outcome, but just because you and those around you must, because you are carried along by an energy, a wave, a swell that must break some way or other for better or for worse?</p>
<p>Ostensibly I currently live in a country of protest; I would guess that the French strike more than any other nationality in the world.  As I said I have never been in a country during a period of true upheaval and dramatic change – but I think I can safely say that I believe that THIS is what it feels like to be in a country that is NOT on the verge of revolution.  THIS is what it feels like to be in a place that is not changing dramatically anytime soon.</p>
<p>In France, strikes happen all the time for one reason or another.  But every now and then (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><a href="http://zoetropic.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/a_good_day_for_a_strike/"><span style="color:#ffff99;">like much of last Fall</span></a></em></span>)<strong> </strong>they will get really serious.  And the results? Flights will be cancelled, trains will be held up, roads will be blockaded.  There might be some shortages of fuel, maybe less fresh produce available in the grocery stores.  And if things get REALLY bad, garbage won’t be collected for a while.  People will get irritated, inconvenienced, and the government will get mildly perturbed, wondering how much it will cost them this time.</p>
<p>There is something so traditional about French strikes, like national clockwork.  It is not really progressive at all; the people march less to change things, as much as to keep them how they already are or to make them ever so slightly more agreeable.</p>
<p>The French government constantly must weigh every choice and decide if it is important enough to face the consequences of upsetting the people.  While on the one hand this is obviously a far superior system than a dictatorship, it also limits the government’s capacity to make any long-term choices that may be for the ultimate good of the country but might also, in the short term, inconvenience people or cause them some small discomforts.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://zoetropic.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/protest-egypt-france-venezuela/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/zppIwQ-Kuik/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>While I think France does a lot of things really well, what I object to is how many people take it all for granted and are still dissatisfied, and don&#8217;t seem to recognize that sometimes small sacrifices are essential to the greater good and to a better future.  They protest, they complain, they show their anger, not with courage and idealism and a desire to start fresh, but a kind of pessimism.  They seem to be saying, &#8220;it&#8217;s still not good enough and it&#8217;s only going to get worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occasionally there is a different sort of protest here &#8211; a more sudden, explosive, destructive sort, where young men run around setting things on fire, breaking things and acting generally angry and disruptive. It&#8217;s usually disaffected young men from immigrant communities – they may be French, but are treated like ‘the other’, unaccepted and undervalued. These young people are angry – but as of yet it has always proven to be a somewhat directionless and vague anger, a kind of lashing out without any real goal apart from expressing rage.</p>
<p>Someday if this anger were to be channeled into real ideas about the changes that could be and should be in France in terms of multiculturalism, in terms of immigrant rights, in terms of religious rights, in terms of actually confronting the racism in France, well perhaps there could be a kind of revolution.</p>
<p>What would it be like if the immigrant community here really found a voice and found common ground and decided what they were fighting for?  It could be very powerful. But the people who currently feel disenfranchised and disaffected are not anywhere close to that.  They do not quite seem ready to find a common voice in order to verbalize what they want changed.</p>
<p>Apart from the immigrant community however most people in France don&#8217;t have a whole lot to complain about, although they relish doing so.   France currently feels like an arthritic sort of country &#8211; you just can&#8217;t expect it to move much or very quickly anymore. France of today is going to be a lot like France tomorrow and France next month and France next year.  But Egypt?  Tunisia? Libya?  What shape will they take in 5 years, one year, even one month? We can only guess.  I guess it’s precisely that – the numerous possibilities, both good and bad, that is what is both exciting and frightening about countries in flux.</p>
<p>This perhaps is what drew me to Venezuela.  I think I wanted to go somewhere in the throes of change – somewhere that wasn’t predictable, somewhere where something dramatic might happen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1484" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 507px"><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/october18-023_2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1484" title="Plaza de La Revolución" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/october18-023_2.jpg?w=497&#038;h=329" alt="" width="497" height="329" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Plaza in Caracas, Venezuela</p></div>
<p>I went to Venezuela in the months leading up to the presidential elections &#8211; what would become a second win for Hugo Chavez.  I think a lot of foreigners went to Venezuela at that time with a kind of “if shit is going to go down, I want to be there” attitude, expecting some kind of fireworks or intrigue during the elections.   I think I felt a little of that myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2450.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1486" title="IMG_2450" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2450.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>It turns out they were pretty normal, above the board elections.  Chavez won fair and square, his popularity at that time still very, very high.</p>
<p>At this point the opposition marches were still mostly composed of the upper-middle class, strolling through the streets of Caracas wearing their sunglasses and polo shirts, and delicately waving their flags.</p>
<p><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2369.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1488" title="IMG_2369" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2369.jpg?w=497&#038;h=372" alt="" width="497" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>These seemed more marches to show disdain than anything else, and greatly contrasted with the fervor of a Chavez march &#8211; which was more like a big party &#8211; everyone eating and drinking and clapping and singing and chanting and smiling and laughing.</p>
<p><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_24452.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1492" title="IMG_2445" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_24452.jpg?w=480&#038;h=500" alt="" width="480" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>But over the last few years there’s been a big shift as younger, more genuinely middle class people have gotten involved, particularly students.  A lot of these people never could feel part of the stodgy, old-fashioned opposition, whose only talking point seemed to be &#8220;no more Chavez,&#8221; and yet had either become disillusioned with Chavez or had never supported him in the first place.  This group became angrier, more vocal, more political, more idealistic, and more aggressive.</p>
<p>Thus the nature of the opposition marches has changed. They have became more angry and violent.  Clashes between students and the police have become the norm.</p>
<p><a href="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2949_21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494" title="IMG_2949_2" src="http://zoetropic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2949_21.jpg?w=497&#038;h=305" alt="" width="497" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>On protest days, during my last year in Venezuela, you could hear the sound of rubber bullets and smell the tear gas from my window.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://zoetropic.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/protest-egypt-france-venezuela/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/hSSAdGQSljg/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>I left Venezuela two years ago – but even then I felt a mounting energy, like we were all sitting on a powder keg, and like every day a bit of gunpowder was added to it.  All that potential energy might remain dormant, or it might someday, given a spark of some kind, explode.</p>
<p>But the energy I felt there wasn&#8217;t the mounting energy of revolution like in Egypt in which a government is cast aside by surging will of the majority of the people.  It was a much more muddled chaotic energy.  The risk I felt there was not so much that the people would rise up against the government but that &#8211; given the right series of events that might give a light to the fuse &#8211; the people would rise up in violence against each other.</p>
<p>There is a deep divide in Venezuela between those that support the government and those that do not (currently estimated to be roughly 50/50) that is more and more entrenched every day.  While the opposition is certainly gaining in power and influence, President Chavez has a very large, loyal, and passionate base.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://zoetropic.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/protest-egypt-france-venezuela/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/yIX_B2Oqx-o/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Increasing hatred is felt by each side for the other; the differences between these two groups have become much more important to them in general than the many cultural values that they share.</p>
<p>Meanwhile many Venezuelans are armed now with both legal and illegal weapons.  Violence is already deeply problematic, Caracas having one of the highest homicide rates of any city in the world.</p>
<p>And life is difficult, stressful and frustrating for many people throughout the country.</p>
<p>What might happen if that hatred and frustration is ignited?  If things were to get truly out of control, the fear I feel in the case of Venezuela, is that it might not be Egypt so much as Libya or Sudan &#8211; not a case of revolution so much as a potential civil war.  But I hope the feeling I had there was wrong.  And I hope we never have the opportunity to find out.</p>

<p>Today, the balancing act that is life, highlighted by poignant examples of the strength, and resilience of the human spirit, is happening on opposite ends of our earth.</p>
<p>The people of North Africa and the Middle East continue to mass, and protest for basic democratic reforms that I take for granted. Beginning with the action of Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi setting himself alight in early January, the domino effect of popular protest movements has taken down entrenched regimes in both Tunisia and Egypt, and currently has another multi-decade old despot in Libya hanging from the precipice. All of North Africa from Morocco to Sudan have felt the tremors, and governments from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, all the way to Gulf states like Bahrain, Yemen and Oman are having to deal with the aftershocks fomented by their own people. Today, hundreds of thousands of protesters are reported to be in the streets of Yemen alone.</p>
<p>These people are fighting against worsening economic conditions, corruption and political repression. A half world away, the people of Christchurch New Zealand, beneficiaries of a democratic system designed to protect its people from all of the above, observed two minutes of silence for those killed in a devastating earthquake at 12:51 p.m. local time, exactly one week ago. Jack hammers and rescue efforts ceased for the first time in seven days, traffic came to a halt, residents emptied into the streets, joined together while pondering the ground and the sky, as church bells rang, and for all intensive purposes Christchurch came to a standstill.</p>
<p>The little island nation of New Zealand has always impressed me. &#8220;Aotearoa&#8221;, the land of the long white cloud, as it is referred to by the Maori indigenous people, has always managed to punch above its weight class with regards to managing its affairs in a progressive and democratic manner. New Zealand isn&#8217;t perfect. But, this isolated island nation with a population less than the Greater Toronto Area, has always managed to keep its domestic house in order, whether it be social programs, indigenous people&#8217;s issues, or the environment. New Zealanders&#8217; energy and joie de vivre was not only epitomized in their physical pursuits, because, after all, this was the home of Sir Edmund Hillary, incredible multi-day hikes, ocean paddles, and the out-of-body experience of bungy jumping. But, it is the nation of taking things one step further, of seeing how many physical activities they can string together to quench a constantly increasing thirst for challenge. New Zealand is the birthplace of epic multi-sport adventure races such as the Southern Traverse, and the Speight&#8217;s Coast to Coast.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2011, the physical embodiment of  their democracy came crashing down around the 350,000 residents of Christchurch,  leaving hundreds dead and leveling, or severely damaging many of the city centre&#8217;s most recognizable buildings, including the iconic Christchurch Cathedral. According to engineers, roughly one-third of all the buildings in central Christchurch will need to be demolished.</p>
<p>I think about my Kiwi friends, former work colleagues, as well as individuals I&#8217;ve met in far-flung corners of the world. I think of the Blenheim-based, rudy-hued river guide Peter Bruce, a.k.a. Wild Wally, the young Christchurch couple whom I shared a game of Yahtzee with in the spartan Mountain Refuge Hotel in Sust, Northern Pakistan, and the wandering, hotel-working couple my life-partner Andrea and I met in a wind-swept campground while bicycle touring on the outskirts of Spain&#8217;s Cabo de Gata &#8211; Nijar Natural Park.</p>
<p>Christchurch will rebuild. I am sure of that. I am also confident that the fight for basic human rights in all parts of the world will succeed. It may not all happen in my lifetime. But, it will succeed because, despite all our failings, our greatest resource and attribute is the thing that authoritarian regimes and natural disasters cannot take away, the strength and resilience of our human spirit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://myparentsarecrazierthanyours.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0250.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-146" title="IMG_0250" src="http://myparentsarecrazierthanyours.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0250.gif?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You wouldn’t think that being 40, unemployed, and forced to live with your nut-job parents would provide any opportunity to feel your innate sexiness… But let me tell you, I am learning a thing or two about how life works and the miraculous surprises around every corner if you are just willing to put down your negativity and doubt for one second.</p>
<p>Maybe you already know that your experience of life is almost wholly determined by your attitude and the filter through which you see things.  I can say that life is just plain shitty sometimes.  But, when you open a smidgeon to the possibility of life and its adventures – IF you are willing to get out of bed and say <em>Bring it on, </em>then my friends, good times will roll.</p>
<p>The weather was gray and damp yesterday.  I was almost paralyzed by my thoughts of being condemned to a lifetime with silverware stealing, coupon scamming, incessantly arguing parents who would <em>never</em> get me.  I lay there, wrapped up in my brother’s old Thundercats comforter.  You could say I was curled up with my lifelong companion, the melancholy that doesn’t go away despite how nicely you ask.  I had no desire to do anything.  Life or any effort to live it seemed futile.  So, when Rob called me to see if I wanted to go to the old Printer’s Devil Bar downtown with him and his cousin, I surprised myself by saying, “What time should I be ready?”</p>
<p>No expectations for anything good, bad or otherwise, I took a shower (I know, can you believe it?) and got myself out there.  Two apple martinis in, and my mojo kicks in.  I’ve got so much of it, it’s coming out my ears.  I start talking to two guys <em>much younger </em>than me in those button-down shirts New Jersey and Long Island boys are notorious for wearing.  I treat them like I’m way too valuable for them.  So, of course they want to buy me a drink.  In one coup d’etat moment after another, I’m getting free drinks, attention, questions about myself, you name it.  I interrupt them to say, “Boys, forgive me.  There’s only one of me to go around.”  And I move on. </p>
<p>As I pass the guitar-wielding singer at the mic in between songs, I lean in and say, “Sing some Jane’s Addiction, will ya?” </p>
<p>At one point, I catch my reflection in the bar’s mirror and I like what I see.  When’s the last time <em>that</em> happened?</p>
<p>I’m talking to another group of single guys. One of them says to me, “Those are some great heels.”  I say, “Tell me something I don’t know.” I notice a few girls on the other side of the bar looking at me.  Don’t hate, AP-PRE-CI-ATE, ladies. </p>
<p>The singer is crooning “Jane Says,” when he suddenly stops mid-verse, and the only thing you hear in the bar is me singing. Everyone cheers.  I feel like I’m in a Stella Artois commercial where a nobody character rises to stardom in a nowhere bar.  It may not be &#8221;healthy&#8221; to say drinking is a good thing, but babies, apple martinis are good to me.</p>
<p>On the way home, Rob and his cousin talked in the front seat.  I sat in the back, my face pressed against the drizzly window.  <em>To think I almost didn’t go out.</em>  Those boys would have never had the opportunity to meet me.  But seriously, I would have missed out on the fun…and learning this great lesson.  It’s not the depression you have to fight &#8211; but letting yourself be crippled by it.</p>
<p>Everyone has a right to feel sexy.  Single or not.  Unemployed or not.  Living with maniacs, or all by your lonesome.  Lots of money in the bank or not a penny.  It’s an inside job.  And <em>this</em> is the neatly wrapped gift that life placed in my lap for simply saying YES <em>despite my depression.</em> </p>
<p>Rob finally pulled up in my driveway and asked if we’d all like to do this again on Friday night.  “What time should I be ready?” I asked.  I started to walk away – but turned back quickly.  Rob rolled his window down. </p>
<p>“Next time I’m getting digits,” I said before sashaying to the house.</p>
<p>I got in the house and ran up the stairs the way I always ran up the stairs as a kid because I was afraid there was a monster at my heels.  In my room where I left my phone, I saw there was a text message from my ex.  The one who so easily broke my heart.  It said, “Hi.  How are you?”</p>
<p>I deleted it.</p>
<p>I picked up Vito’s paws, got down on my knees and slow danced with him while singing Frank Sinatra.</p>
<p><em>…Someday when I’m awfully low,</em></p>
<p><em>When the world is cold</em></p>
<p><em>I will feel a glow just thinking of you…</em></p>
<p><em>And the way you look tonight…</em></p>
<p>Would you believe me if I told you that Vito put his big head on my shoulder?  I love my dog.  He’s got mojo, too.</p>
