				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://a3.img.mobypicture.com/cfb21e50b464395fb11c66032ba96227_view.jpg" width="600" height="447" /></p>
<p>As an individual who has taken four marketing classes (two of which were in high school), I feel as though I’m a bit of an expert when it comes to analyzing advertisements. I’ve always enjoyed watching commercials because they can be dissected in fun and interesting ways, and now that we don’t have DVR at my apartment, we have no choice but to watch them. After careful consideration (like 20 minutes), I’ve come up with three realistic commercials that the public deserves to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Pizza Hut</p>
<p>Lately Pizza Hut’s commercials have been featuring their latest abortion, the Big Dinner Box, which includes two rectangular pizzas, garlic bread, cinnamon dippers, some chicken wings or something, and sauces all for only $10. This sounds like a fantastic bargain, especially if you’re looking to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>The public deserves the truth. Pizza Hut’s next advertisement needs to stick with the same format that they’ve been using. Two or three young guys are sitting around on red couches, talking about how they don’t have enough money to feed themselves. One guy remembers having a nightmare about Pizza Hut and their new box of cholesterol, and they go through their apartment to find <i>exactly</i> the $10 that they needed – I shouldn’t have to explain why this is wrong. They call and place their order.</p>
<p>Pizza guy shows up, “That’ll be $13.78.” The two guys look at each other. “Oh shit, I thought it was only $10?” They forgot the delivery charge, plus taxes. Because they’re stoned out of their minds – did you see that coming? In exchange, they give the driver some weed and everybody’s cool. Finally! Time for the guys to dig in. They each grab a slice and take the biggest bite you’ve ever seen. There’s a loud <i>crunch</i>. They inspect the pizza. Turns out, it’s cardboard. Somebody at the Pizza Hut store put tomato sauce, processed cheese, and pepperoni flakes on a rectangular piece of cardboard. The two guys eat it anyway, because hey, they can’t let that weed go to waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Under Armour</p>
<p>Everyone has seen those obnoxious Under Armour commercials. They’re the ones where there’s a bunch of jacked 30-year-olds yelling at each other in some high school football locker room. They’re pumped up, man. They’re going to beat the shit out of some kids that haven’t even hit puberty yet.</p>
<p>In reality, <i>maybe</i> 5 percent of people that wear Under Armour actually look and act like that. The public deserves a commercial where you’ve got some flabby country-looking guy shivering out in the cold. He’s hunting, obviously, and didn’t wear the proper attire to keep himself warm. Instead of the typical Under Armour montage (guys wearing cleats and football pants – no shirt – and running up bleachers), you have this guy working late nights at the local gas station. He’s selling people scratcher tickets, mopping up puke, getting robbed at gunpoint, selling alcohol to minors, etc. Finally, he saves up enough money to buy a $60 long-sleeve Under Armour shirt that fits him until he washes it. He looks into the mirror with the shirt on, belly hanging out, and says, “Dammit.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Kay Jewelers</p>
<p>By far the most annoying commercials on TV today are the Kay Jeweler ads. If you’re ever having trouble deciding whether you should get married or not, watch a Kay commercial. Chances are that you’ll want to treat your love life like it’s a VH1 reality dating show after watching one of Kay’s ads. There’s one in particular where some dude proposes on a plane, and everybody onboard loves it. A more realistic ad would have the same proposal, except half the people are groaning and rolling their eyes. But that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>The public deserves a <i>real</i> proposal. A girl walks out of the bathroom at the local high school. Her eyes are red from crying and her head is hung low. She approaches her boyfriend, who begins to console her. “Everything will be alright, we can do this.” They move in together and drop out of school. They fight and she smokes. He drinks because his older brother works at the bar just down the road. One day, he comes home from his job working as a part-time mechanic. He drops a little black box from Kay Jewelers onto the fold-up card table that she’s sitting at.</p>
<p>“Since I got you pregnant, we might as well get married.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Screen cuts to black background with “Kay Jewelers” in silver writing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am pregnant. I am pregnant and unable to move off the couch. I am pregnant and a newlywed and instead of wearing cute, slinky things for my new husband, I live in bathrobes and don&#8217;t shower for days. I am pregnant and it sucks. I am excited, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but only as excited as one can be in between bouts of barfing.</p>
<p>This baby is due exactly 9 months and 2 days after our wedding date which is cute and efficient, but it was not my plan to be pregnant so soon. My husband and I had plans to spend the better part of our first year of marriage here in Kentucky near my family and our friends, getting our affairs in order before moving to Canada in June. Now instead of June it looks like we will be moving up to B.C. much earlier than planned and probably while it is still snowing- so much for easing into my new surroundings starting with the perfect Canadian summer. Oh how plans change.</p>
<p>I wanted to be in Canada before starting the baby-making because Kristan&#8217;s family farm in B.C. is the quietest, cleanest, most serene place I have ever been. I envisioned myself having a beautiful, calm pregnancy surrounded by gorgeous wilderness way out in the middle of nowhere. Instead, Anthem kicked me off my birth control months before my wedding (See: <a title="Baby by Anthem" href="http://curiodyssey.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/baby-by-anthem/">Baby by Anthem</a>), and while they did not technically impregnate me, I blame them for the fact that I am here in Louisville, pregnant, and far from the serene wilderness I had imagined.</p>
<p>The city, while fun, is not my idea of peaceful. We live downtown and it is noisy all day and night with cars and airplanes and sirens and music screaming from stereos. It is so bright at night that you can practically read without a lamp on and I often need to sleep with an eye mask on to get any rest at all, though the stupid mask falls off all night and keeps me up anyway. The city is crowded and people are irritating and scary- particularly on the roads where everyone turns into Stupidicus from Goofy&#8217;s driving videos. Instead of resting on a porch in a rocking chair high up in the Rocky Mountains, I am tossing and turning at night and cursing at people cutting me off in traffic and putting in ear plugs just so I can read peacefully on my couch. Here we are, my little Lump and me, in the noisy city, doing this thing despite my visions to the contrary.</p>
<p>I am excited to be pregnant, like I said. I waffled back and forth most of my life about wanting children until I met Kristan and then there was no question- from the moment I met him I knew this man would be a great partner and a great father. In fact, I started taking prenatal vitamins less than 6 months into our relationship- I was that sure about this one. While motherhood was not always a definite in my mind, I always coveted a cute pregnant belly in the same way I wished for my little boobies to sprout when I was a pre-teen. I was wrong about the boobies: they are far more trouble than they are worth, and even though I am far from having that cute, classic, pregnant-girl silhouette, I know already that I was poorly mistaken about this too.</p>
<p>This pregnancy thing is not fun, not glowing, and certainly not peaceful. I would like to rename it &#8220;pregnan-sucky,&#8221; because that is how it feels. I anticipated morning sickness and nausea, but those were just words that I thought I knew the meaning of and, as it turns out, I was very, very wrong. Nausea to me implies an upset stomach and an achy body, which I have, but this is not a nausea that I have ever known. Being a person who is prone to motion sickness, I am used to nausea and find it is usually tolerable and treatable with a short nap. THIS thing is not just nausea, and it&#8217;s not just morning either. This thing is the worst headache of my life all day, every day, and I was totally unprepared for the crushing, head-splitting, brain pain that accompanies this &#8220;beautiful event.&#8221; I feel like Peter from the movie The Office Space, when he tells the hypnotist that every day is the worst day of his life, to which the hypnotist replies &#8220;that&#8217;s messed up.&#8221; Yes, yes it is messed up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that my sickness is also exacerbated by the fact that I am a total wimp and complain all the time about how bad I feel. I am sure that if I simply switched my attention to something else I could possibly distract myself from my misery, but so far I have been unsuccessful with any strategy besides just wallowing in it. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be over soon,&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;ll all be worth it in the end,&#8221; are common, infuriating mantras that people spew at me all the time- words that are not comforting in the least because it&#8217;s not later I am worried about- it&#8217;s right now and the fact that my head&#8217;s about to explode like one of Gallagher&#8217;s watermelons. Saying these things to me while I am so pathetically miserable is like saying &#8220;I know how you feel,&#8221; when someone you love dies. It&#8217;s inappropriate people.</p>
<p>Another completely unhelpful bit of advice: &#8220;eat some crackers before you get out of bed to help control the nausea.&#8221; There is no amount nor type of food or beverage that prevents or even relieves this a tiny bit. A delicious pizza can distract me for a minute, but there are still a whole lot of non-pizza minutes in a day that must be tolerated. So the best thing I can do so far is to stay horizontal. I lay on the couch or in bed for 22 hours of the day right now because standing up escalates the pain exponentially and makes me 100% more prone to barfing. With Kristan home over the weekends it is much easier because he cooks for me when I am hungry and brings me what I need so I can rest. He is all about me and this baby eating homemade, unprocessed foods and he bakes fresh bread and makes casseroles and whole turkeys and all kinds of other delicious things nightly, which, unfortunately, I can barely eat any of because this baby seems to tolerate only foods with yellow #7 and red #40. It&#8217;s a travesty. I have the best husband in the world cooking for me and instead I hide Cheetos and Big Red in my car to sustain myself. This child is going to look like it was fathered by an oompa loompa.</p>
<p>While I already feel like an unfit mother, it is at least a little comforting to know that I am not the only one feeling duped and hating those smiling, lying women on the cover of books like <em>What to Expect When You&#8217;re Expecting</em>. There are actual books out there written by women like me &#8211; books based on the true reality and misery of this pregnancy thing, such as  <em>Pregnancy Sucks</em> by Joanne Kimes who writes the blog <a href="http://www.sucksandthecity.com">Sucks and the City</a>, and <em>It Sucked Then I Cried</em> by Heather Armstrong, author of the blog <a href="http://dooce.com">Dooce</a>. At least I know I am not alone in being unable to lie and tell people that this is fun and I feel great when in reality I want to roll up in a ball and cry. I haven&#8217;t read either book but I definitely will while I&#8217;m stuck here, glued to my couch, feeling pregnan-sucky.</p>

Thanks again to Andrea for this great submission! -J]</em></p>
<p>But. (There’s always a But.) The idea that introducing gender into the conversation is inherently unnecessary or somehow offensive is a little off the mark. And this is where I have to stop taking issue with The Brew Professor’s post and see where he’s coming from.</p>
<p>Advocacy groups like the two aforementioned still exist… why? Well, for the same reason this post <i>wasn’t</i> titled “Newbies, Don’t Fear The Beer.”</p>
<p>Because men have never been taught to fear beer. Men don’t have decades of marketing to unlearn. Men have not been <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/lady-liquor-beer-loving-ladies-rare-or-just-overlooked">overlooked</a> as consumers, creators, and connoisseurs. Men have very likely never been whispered at, “That has a <i>lot </i>of calories, honey.”</p>
<p>Women are fairly <a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/women-craft-beer-and-centerfolds">well represented in the craft beer world</a>, but the “mainstream” drinking woman is still heavily favoring wine over beer (see stats above). And here’s the rub. How does one entice a wine or cocktails gal over to “our side”? Clearly not by insulting her current beverage of choice, or her intelligence. (And let’s all agree not to place beer in any kind of antagonistic position to either wine or spirits. If anyone suggested my bourbon, gin, or champagne was inferior to beer in any way, I’d laugh at them.) You drink what you want and what you’re in the mood for. I’m not here to judge anyone. So how do you gently suggest that someone, who might not otherwise be so inclined, try a beer?</p>
<p><span id="more-1648"></span></p>
<p>Well, let’s start with the basics. First, you have to ask why they are <i>not</i> trying beer in the first place? If you ask a women – or a man, but let’s say a women here only based on our stats above – why she doesn’t like beer, 9 times out of 10, you’ll get the following answer: “I don’t like the taste.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. But whenever I hear that, I have to ask, “The taste of what, exactly?” There are, as The Brew Professor himself pointed out, at least 66 varieties of beer. When someone claims not to like the taste of beer, I always want to ask them to list the last five styles of beer they’ve tried. Chances are, if they are not well versed in beer, this might stump them – man or woman – a tiny bit. Because many, many people who answer thusly are, indeed, referring primarily to American adjunct lagers.</p>
<p>Fine. So let’s assume we’re talking to the average, non-nerdy, non-foodie, normal gal who only doesn’t like beer because she has not yet been introduced to the right kind of beer <i>for her</i>. This is a critical point. While I appreciate The Brew Professor’s guide to “introductory” beers in his<a href="http://queencitydrinks.com/2012/11/30/guest-post-by-the-brew-professor-women-dont-fear-the-beer-part-ii/"> follow-up post</a>, he makes one tactical error. Saisons, witbiers, and lambics and all awesome, but he overlooked the fact that a) these all, to some extent, may not be different enough to grab the attention of someone who already isn’t sold on the malt/hops/barely combo (except maybe the lambics) and b) these choices don’t take into account personal preference. Instead of trying for mildness, why not figure out what a person already enjoys, and then see if you can find a beer to match their tastes? You might discover a non-beer drinker who absolutely loves arugula and other bitter greens, grapefruit and citrus, and the bracing scent of pine, and who will be blown away by an amazing American IPA. Why lowball her with a witbier? Why underestimate her palate like that? Or why force a saison on a dark-chocolate and coffee lover who would go crazy over an imperial stout?</p>
<p>Flavor profile, especially with women who are attuned to their own palates, will get you farther than trying unadventurous beers. Hell, I love salt and vinegar chips and whiskey sours. Guess how much I like Gueze Tliquin? Exactly. Start with the flavor profile, then guide the newbie – male or female – to the beer they’ll love.</p>
<p>But, again, your newbie is far more likely to be female than male. These are just the facts. Women have been fed so much unbelievable crap by marketers and women’s mags, it’s no wonder they’re disinclined to try beer. The worst, by far, of all these myths is that beer is somehow “unfeminine” and it will make you fat. Unfeminine? Bullcrap. That’s marketing, pure and simple. I have no way to fight that. In point of fact the only difference between beer and wine is that one is fermented with grain and the other fermented with fruit. If grain strikes you as somehow inherently masculine, then I can’t help you. Stick with your Cosmos, your vodka tonics. Because potatoes are super feminine.</p>
<p>See where I’m going with this?</p>
<p>Okay, now that we&#8217;ve established the utter idiocy of classifying foods as masculine and feminine, let’s address this whole “fat” thing. Women have been warned of the dire consequences of drinking calorie-laden beers. Indeed, one <a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/2008/12/5-best-low-calorie-cocktails#slide=6">women’smagazine</a> posts their best low-calorie holiday drinks, and beer is not among them. Plenty of highballs, mixed with diet soda, are represented, but no beer. Champagne, however, is accounted for on this list. Four ounces of champagne represents a mere 85 calories! Amazing! You know what else has only 85 calories per four-ounce serving? Basically <i>any craft beer</i>. Will the good folks at said magazine tell you this? Nope. Why? I have no idea. And if anyone on their writing staff wants to explain why to me, I invite them to drop me a line.</p>
<p>So you can see that women have been taught to fear the beer. Not all women buy into this. Some, like the brilliant constituency who drinks craft beer and reads this blog, don’t buy it. They don’t buy crap like “women prefer fruit beers” either. Because they&#8217;ve seen men elbow each other out of the way for a taste of Cantillon Zwanze and Founders’ Blushing Monk. But if we can understand that women in the mainstream are still in the minority when it comes to beer, and if we can approach women with respect for their individual palates, then maybe those numbers in the Gallup poll will equalize some day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_5575" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://tonireavis.com/2012/12/10/hung-up-on-time/hawaiikai/" rel="attachment wp-att-5575"><img class="size-full wp-image-5575" alt="Aerial View of Hawaii Kai" src="http://tonireavis.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/hawaiikai.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Aerial View of Hawaii Kai</strong></p></div>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s 40th <strong>Honolulu Marathon</strong> was a breath of fresh air.  In fact, it was many, many breaths of fresh trade-wind-blown air as times for the 26.2 mile loop course out to Hawaii Kai over Diamond Head and back was severely slowed by the strong trade winds blowing out along Kalanianaole Highway from miles 11-16. In the end, any chance for an event record (2:11:12, 2004) was swept away as this marathon turned into what has been lost in the sport in recent years, a pure foot-race rather than a paced time-trial.</p>
<p>While speculation was rife all week whether Kenya&#8217;s <strong>Wilson Kipsang</strong>, the Olympic bronze medallist and second fastest man in history, could better Jimmy Muindi&#8217;s long-standing mark, it came down to whether Kipsang could put away his Ethiopian rival <strong>Markos Geneti</strong>, <strong><a href="http://tonireavis.com/2011/03/21/the-end-of-the-myth/">the Los Angeles Marathon record holder </a></strong>and 2:04 man from Dubai 2012.</p>
<p>Though overall time ceased to be the issue, it required a full-blooded 4:39 partially upgrade 23rd mile for Kipsang to dispatch Geneti, though the winning time of 2:12:31 was only the ninth-fastest time in Honolulu Marathon history, and a full 8:49 slower than Kipsang&#8217;s 2:03:42 PR from Frankfurt 2011.  So, are we to look at his win in Honolulu as a failure?  He did run the fastest second half in Honolulu history, 65:31.</p>
<p>The point here is the sport has become so hung up on time that we have all but eliminated personality-driven competition from the minds of a constantly dwindling fan base.  We even refer to our race fields as filled with Kenyans or Ethiopians, as if there were no distinctions among these men and women of neighboring cultures.</p>
<p>It has been a sad, tiresome, and in the final analysis debilitating focus which has allowed the sport to be subsumed by  the increasing emphasis on charity fund-raising.  Odd, too, because it was competition and personalities which first elevated road racing to public attention via the <strong>Frank Shorter</strong> versus <strong>Bill Rodgers</strong> rivalry.<span id="more-5531"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I remember going to the Lynchburg 10 Miler as a 16 year-old to watch Shorter versus Rodgers,&#8221; says sport&#8217;s agent<strong> Zane Branson</strong> of PossoSports Europe.  &#8221;It was more than a race, it was a drama, not about the clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Saturday we saw Mexico&#8217;s <strong>Juan</strong> <strong>Manuel Marquez</strong> KO Filipino rival <strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong> in the sixth round of their epic fourth match up in Las Vegas. Their Pay Per View broadcast generated $100 million of business.  While yesterday&#8217;s Honolulu Marathon generated $120 million for  the local economy, the professional athletes were playing for only $150,000 in prize money and a slightly lower amount in appearance fees, though contestants from both sports trained an equal number of grueling months for their one effort.</p>
<p>When the payoff is that limited, and time is emphasized over competition, the sport finds it impossible to generate interest beyond the running world bubble or the local event horizon.  Instead with an increasing number of young runners coming into what was once a veteran&#8217;s game, we have not simply accepted the inevitability of East African domination &#8211; hard not to given the results &#8211; but have replaced personality-driven competitions like Shorter versus Rodgers or even Kenya&#8217;s Paul Tergat versus Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie with the cold indifference of time trials.</p>
<p>While pro football markets itself as <strong>Tom Brady&#8217;s</strong> Patriots versus <strong>J.J. Watt</strong> and the Houston Texans, and basketball sells Kobe&#8217;s Lakers versus Lebron&#8217;s Miami Heat, running is marketed &#8212; if that&#8217;s what you want to call it &#8212; as how fast one anonymous interchangeable runner from a faraway land can run from point A to point B, rather than whether <em>this</em> guy can beat <em>that</em> guy.</p>
<p>The Honolulu Marathon will always be hilly, hot and humid.  And occasionally its challenge will increase when the strong trade winds come blowing down from the mountain passes to the north along the eastern edge of Oahu. Instead of seeing this as a unique test of strength and fitness, many top runners dismiss Honolulu because they can&#8217;t run fast here.  But fast times should be the cherry atop the cake of competition, not the focus of attention itself, especially when the odds are so heavily stacked against record performances in any race.</p>
<p>By continuing to make finishing time the focus of attention we are building our sport upon a foundation of ever-shifting sand which won&#8217;t stand up to any ill wind that may come blowing our way.</p>
<p>END</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I read an article in the <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/ben-lowy-virtually-unfiltered/">NY Times Lens Blog</a> about photojournalist<a href="http://www.benlowy.com/"> Ben Lowy</a> using his iPhone and the<a href="http://hipstamatic.com/"> Hipstamatic</a> app in the field, and was blown away when I saw the images, with the look of an old Polaroid film camera, and knew I had to apply this to my urban industrial photography.  As you have seen from my work I love to &#8220;embellish&#8221; the images I take and create a piece of abstract fine art instead of just a photograph, taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary, so to speak.</p>
<p>Despite the cold wet weather we had this weekend here in Astoria, I wanted to get outside and capture some urban grunge with this &#8220;new fangled&#8221; photo app.  So, armed with my iPhone and an umbrella (no DSLR, no lenses, no filters, no other photographic paraphernalia) I walked out into a steady but light rain to experiment. I must confess I really have never taken a &#8220;serious&#8221; photo with my cell phone before, I mean I have a DSLR why would I, right?  Well, the first thing that I liked about taking images with the iPhone was the freedom of just pointing and shooting again and became more exhilarated the more I shot. It took me a bit to stop fumbling and almost dropping the phone as I balanced the umbrella while turning the phone from horizontal to vertical (cursing and wishing it came with a wrist strap!) Luckily I did not have to worry about water getting into my camera or lens. The second thing I liked and the best part was, with this app I was able to change film, lenses and even the flash with just a swish of your finger. What fun! The only thing I didn&#8217;t like was that I had to wear my reading glasses to take the photos something I normally do not need to do looking through a view finder.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I walked along Ditmars Boulevard just to 31st Street (a little over a mile) taking images of some old familiar subjects and on Sunday, walked the same distance along Astoria Boulevard including views from the elevated subway; this is where I almost dropped the phone down on the Grand Central Parkway!  I guess I spent about two hours each day trying all of the different films and lenses. As Ben Lowy had stated in the blog article there is really no post processing other than downloading. All the artistic embellishments were done right in the camera or phone. I am one of those photographers that cannot take just a few shots and on a bad day will come home with at least 150 images.</p>
<p>I enjoy post processing because that is where I add my little artistic touches to my already abstract scenes and it will take me the better part of a day or days to complete depending on the number of images I have taken.  But, with these images my biggest decision was deciding what images were the best out of the bunch.  Not having much gear to carry around and knowing that the &#8220;camera&#8221; was doing most of the work I was able to devote my attention on the composition just like I did way back when with my little point and shoot camera.</p>
<p>Right now, I don&#8217;t think the cell phone camera and the Hipstamatic app will replace my DSLR and the wonderful zoom and fixed lenses that I love but, I will be more willing to use my cell phone camera and indulge in<em> iPhone photography</em> than ever before. I hope you enjoy my little &#8220;groovy&#8221;  trip back into photographic time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a paternally inherited urge to see action movies.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps the same compeller that drove David Foster Wallace to read every sports person’s biography he could put his hands on, knowing beforehand of his inevitable disappointment at the silly, boring prose that comes out of the physically exciting but otherwise mentally mundane athlete.</p>
<p>I go to see action movies in the theatre, certain I’ll grow bored as we get closer to the unveiling of the plot’s secrets, uncomfortable with the volume of the explosions, irritated at the stale manner some of the exotic cities I visited are portrayed in glossy, epoxy grit.</p>
<p>Last Sunday it was <i>Skyfall’s</i> turn.</p>
<p>I had no special expectations from this trip to the cinema other than trying to, for a couple of hours, artificially extend the weekend, trying to postpone the thoughts about the cliff that is Monday.</p>
<p>As I remembered, James Bond movies are supposed to be like Thai food: varied ingredients, very similar taste.</p>
<p>Some noodle gadgets that come in the whole-wheat variety of guns or stringy rice flour type of GPS transponders with Spicy Red Curry girls or blond kaffir lime babes topped with fish sauce casinos and shitake mushroom tuxedos.</p>
<p>A pleasing, falsely exotic mixture to shake up your diet (one man’s rice and beans is the other man’s rice and beans).</p>
<p>This one from the start felt like heavier, simpler food.</p>
<p>It’s still a Bond flick, don’t get too excited, but I’ll try to explain what I felt was interesting and worthy of a post. Since I was seven years old and attempted a critique of “The Great Mouse Detective”, I have never again written about a film, so bear with me.</p>
<p>I think it is a film about place, and that is what intrigued me. Not real place, I guess, but more of a “meta-place”, a recognizable place of movie culture, not exactly its own.</p>
<p>The plot circles the globe, as it should, but two places stuck out for me: an office tower in Shanghai and the estate in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Shanghai tower is a reference to the Sci-Fi obsession with deadly reflection. In this night scene Bond grabs the edge of speeding elevator to chase a hit man around an empty office space. Every glass surface reflects the lights and signage of the surrounding buildings in an implied continuum between street and interior. It is nostalgic for a certain 80s “enhanced urban” à la “Blade Runner”. Nothing is really high technology; nothing is present that would be unexpected in the headquarters of Barclay’s Bank. Still there is a feeling of multiplication, of the optic qualities that can arise from normal materials that seems to say, that if not used carefully, contemporary standard office architecture can kill you.</p>
<p><a href="http://endofarchitecture.com/2012/12/10/my-name-is/skyfall-set/" rel="attachment wp-att-174"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" alt="skyfall-set" src="http://endofarchitecture.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/skyfall-set.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Bond navigates this world without comfort but in the end gets to use the building’s height to make gravity act in a negative way towards his opponent’s vital organs (he throws the bad guy through the window). This scenario is all about vectors, kill shots, rays of green light, piercing looks across the glass. There is still time for a glance at the girl across the street with the intimacy only the highest floors of towers allow.</p>
<p><a href="http://endofarchitecture.com/2012/12/10/my-name-is/skyfall-james-bond-daniel-craig-shanghai/" rel="attachment wp-att-173"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-173" alt="skyfall-james-bond-daniel-craig-shanghai" src="http://endofarchitecture.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/skyfall-james-bond-daniel-craig-shanghai.jpeg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Jump to the final scenes of the movie, Bond is back to his ancestral home is Scotland. Finally, we understand where the generic flu pill name Skyfall comes from.</p>
<p>The house is great because it’s a prefab ruin. Just by looking at it in its splendid autumn isolation, one can figure out that this house was made to be destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="http://endofarchitecture.com/2012/12/10/my-name-is/tumblr_mef4d497xn1qbau8oo1_500/" rel="attachment wp-att-175"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-175" alt="tumblr_mef4d497XN1qbau8oo1_500" src="http://endofarchitecture.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/tumblr_mef4d497xn1qbau8oo1_500.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Bond can expect this house to be an ally in the same proportion the office tower’s reflections almost killed him. His worn down manor collaborates by being a helpful albeit sacrificial ruin. Like an adult version of “Home Alone”, the defenders know there keep much better than the invaders and are able to turn space to their advantage. The cracking floorboards conceal homemade explosives, the seigniorial chandelier is a deadly fragment grenade.</p>
<p>In the end the house goes up in flames and we are left to imagine it settles into the moss covered artifact it was always meant to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://endofarchitecture.com/2012/12/10/my-name-is/skyfall-lodge-explosion-scene-007-surrey-set/" rel="attachment wp-att-176"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-176" alt="skyfall-lodge-explosion-scene-007-surrey-set" src="http://endofarchitecture.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/skyfall-lodge-explosion-scene-007-surrey-set.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=651" width="1024" height="651" /></a></p>
<p>Skyfall might not present any durable addition to the “film space” I was referring to, but it acknowledges its existence and pays homage, which for a Sunday night action flick, is more than I could ask.</p>
<p>P.S. – While I was writing this post I came a across <a href="http://nuirs.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/237/" target="_blank">this scholarly revue of the films scenography</a> written in a very interesting blog that I’ll be following closely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_5714" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 443px"><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5714" alt="The Bees Knees." src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bees Knees.</p></div>
<p>Since Hanukkah is the &#8220;Bees Knees&#8221; of holidays (&#8220;dude, eight nights of presents, not just one&#8221;), we figured it&#8217;s time for a celebratory cocktail. And the Bees Knees not only tastes good, you can make a kosher version of the cocktail&#8230;.really. In all seriousness, we do have some Jewish heritage in the family and we host an annual Hanukkah dinner with homemade latkes, jelly donuts and now, this cocktail. And the Bees Knees does fit the Hanukkah theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5715" alt="bees1" src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees1.jpg?w=590"   /></a><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5716" alt="bees3" src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees3.jpg?w=590"   /></a>At first, we looked for Hanukkah cocktail themes and it was a challenge. It is a festival of lights (not that helpful, flaming tiki drinks?) and oil is a main theme (there are a few cocktails with oil, but we aren&#8217;t going there), but happily the promised land is &#8220;the land of milk and honey&#8221; so we found a theme to build from. And as it turns out, raw honey is kosher, and we have plenty of raw Putney Farm honey. Even better, you can get <a href="http://distillery209.com/gin/our-kosher-cousin">kosher gin from the No. 209</a>, a San Francisco based distillery (we used Bluecoat gin in this post, but will have the No. 209 at Hanukkah dinner). And it looks like fresh lemons are kosher, and we have plenty of Meyer lemons. Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5717" alt="bees4" src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees4.jpg?w=590"   /></a><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5718" alt="bees5" src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees5.jpg?w=590"   /></a>Well, guess what? You just read the recipe for a Bees Knees cocktail. The Bees Knees combines dry gin, lemon juice and <a href="http://putneyfarm.com/2012/09/12/cocktail-diy-grenadine-simple-syrups-honey-syrup/">honey syrup</a> (1 to 1 very hot water and honey) and is served up or on the rocks. Created in the prohibition era, the Bees Knees is easy to make and very tasty. And if you prefer rum, a light rum version makes a Honeysuckle, a dark rum version makes a Honey Bee. Add some champagne to the Honeysuckle and you get an Airmail. If you use rye or bourbon you get a <a href="http://putneyfarm.com/2012/09/21/weekly-cocktail-29-the-daisy-black-and-a-new-cocktail-book/">Daisy Black</a>. So you do get four or five drinks out of the deal (it&#8217;s not eight, but five cocktails from one basic recipe isn&#8217;t too shabby).</p>
<p><a href="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5719" alt="bees6" src="http://putneyfarm.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bees6.jpg?w=590"   /></a>While almost all cocktail writers have positive feelings about the Bees Knees, many describe it as &#8220;inoffensive&#8221;. But we will take some issue with that. If you use basic store-bought clover or orange blossom honey, the flavors are pretty light. But if you use raw &#8220;forest&#8221; or wildflower honey in the Bees Knees you get much deeper herbal and bitter notes. Putney Farm honey is a forest honey made mostly from wildflowers and herb blossoms, it has some herbal and minty notes with a slightly bitter and piney finish. Good stuff, and perfect with a dry earthy gin. Along with the sweet acidity of the Meyer lemons, the herbal notes of gin and forest honey make for a very substantial cocktail with layers of flavor. So we suggest you get some raw honey from a farmers market and then try the Bees Knees, it won&#8217;t be simply &#8220;inoffensive&#8221;, it will be a special cocktail and a fitting celebration of Hanukkah.</p>
<p><strong>The Bees Knees:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 oz. dry gin (No.209 kosher, if you like)</li>
<li>1/2 oz. honey syrup* (a bit more if using Eureka lemons, rather than sweeter Meyers)</li>
<li>1/2 oz. fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>Lemon wheel, for garnish</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If my life was a movie, this day would have been titled: One Funeral, One Proposal and Four Faintings. OK, I only saw two people faint, but you get my drift.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4414" title="Colorful Smiles" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4547.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>As, I wrote <a href="https://ltomkiw.wordpress.com/2012/11/24/hiking-through-torayas-rice-harvest/" target="_blank">earlier</a>, I wasn&#8217;t entirely comfortable with the idea of being a foreign tourist at the funeral of a complete stranger, but our Torajan guide, Pak Agust, reassured us we wouldn&#8217;t be intruding and that people were used to tourists. The day before the funeral, Pak Agust told us that it&#8217;s customary to bring gifts for the family, including bags of sugar or cartons of cigarettes. So we walked into a little shop with Pak Agust and bought some cancer sticks — really I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about giving cigarettes, but welcome to the gray area of travel, again.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4519.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4470" title="Singing" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4519.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>We drove for nearly an hour to a small Torajan village named Kampung Dole. The drive was picturesque — green rice fields and rolling hills. When we arrived at the village, we followed a steady stream of people up a hill to an area with structures built for the funeral. As we arrived, men stood in a circle chanting, telling the life story of the man who had died. Pak Agust said the chanting was also a prayer in <em>bahasa Toraya </em>(the local language). One of the man&#8217;s relatives served as the master of ceremonies for the event. He would occasionally cackle into the microphone, it was a haunting sound. Pak Agust said he did it because the funeral is not supposed to be a somber affair. This was day one of a five day funeral.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4540.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4471" title="MC" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4540.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>As we walked up the hill, several animals were also headed that way. Poor guy, I think he knew what was about to happen. The squealing sound pigs make towards the end is one of the most horrific noises I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4511.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4472" title="No Chance" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4511.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>I want to warn you that after the jump there are some graphic photos of the water buffalo slaughter, this is, however a part of life and culture in Toraja.</p>
<p><span id="more-4412"></span></p>
<p>After the chanting, the coffin was lifted on to an upper platform, the best view for the funeral.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4533.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4473" title="Coffin" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4533.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The traditional dress and bead-work that the women were wearing was truly stunning. I asked if I could photograph them, and they agreed.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4551.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4474" title="Dressed" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4551.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4335.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4519" title="Beaded" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4335.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>I had a good chuckle when I caught the beautifully dressed lady checking her cellphone. Even in a rural village, Indonesia&#8217;s mania with cellphones has taken hold, I guess somethings have become universal.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4526.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4475" title="Texting" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4526.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Pak Agust explained to us that Torajan society, even today, is very stratified with upper and lower nobility. You could leave Toraja, become an international celebrity and billionaire but it wouldn&#8217;t change what class you were born into. We were attending the funeral of a high class member. Pak Agust said the man was a grandfather.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4554.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4476" title="Bored" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4554.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure how I would react to watching a large animal being slaughtered. But it was all done in such a matter of a fact way, that I wasn&#8217;t in the least bit squeamish. Men tied down the buffalo while kids ran around in flip flops. Then with one swift swing, the buffalo was killed. The buffalo fell to the ground. It moved violently and then after a few minutes it stopped, but then suddenly, a minute or two later, it would spasm. A European tourist fainting caused more of a commotion among the Torajans than the slaughter did. Some wealthier villagers can afford to give the gift of a water buffalo for a funeral, and you can go and pick one out at the water buffalo market (stay tuned for that post).</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4569.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4477" title="The Kill" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4569.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The water buffaloes are immediately butchered on the spot and the meat and all other parts are distributed to the family and other villagers. The stereotype around Indonesia is that Torajans are very wealthy because of their elaborate funerals. Pak Agust laughed when we asked him about this. He said that Torajans live poorly to save for a funeral. The big funerals will involve the slaughter of more than 24 water buffaloes, a sign of wealth. The buffaloes help transport the soul to the Torajan version of heaven. Traditional homes are decorated with the animal horns, the more horns, the more prosperous the family. Sometimes when people die, there isn&#8217;t enough money for a funeral, so the body will remain in the family home, sometimes for years, until enough money is saved for a proper send off. Funerals are usually held from June to October, during the dry season, when it&#8217;s easier for people to return home.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4598.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4478" title="Butchering" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4598.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>All of the foreign tourists were taken to a sitting area. There were large buckets of rice and traditional Torajan food, including pork that is cooked in bamboo. Torajans are officially Christians, but obviously this is blended with old traditions. Missionaries converted Torajans, and Pak Agust told us that before that, in the old, old days, funerals could last months.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4558.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4479" title="Bamboo Pork" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4558.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>On our way back down the hill, we stopped to meet the family and give them our gift. One of the female relatives of the dead man, offered us snacks and deliciously sweet black Torajan coffee. We sat around and chatted with her and then with some other guides and I spoke some French with a tourist from Paris. The amount of French and Spanish tourists in the area was astounding, some guidebook must have really highlighted this. We didn&#8217;t meet a single American during our whole trip. While drinking coffee, Pak Agust and another guide, Rudi, told dirty jokes about the type of &#8220;flowers&#8221; women are. As we prepared to go, the female relative, who was delighted by our Indonesian, decided to tell us she had two sons. We were a bit confused and then a mischievous smile appeared on her face and we knew exactly what she meant. So we all smiled and then took a group photo together.</p>
<p><a href="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4602.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4480" title="Coffee With the Family" alt="" src="http://ltomkiw.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4602.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>So, perhaps funeral is a bad word to describe all of this. It really was a celebration.</p>
