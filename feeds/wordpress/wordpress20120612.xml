			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://domestocrat.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/photo.jpg"><img style="padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-left:0;float:left;background-image:none;padding-top:0;border:0;" title="photo" src="http://domestocrat.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/photo_thumb.jpg?w=288&h=288" alt="photo" width="288" height="288" align="left" border="0" /></a> I picked up <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/the-happiness-project-book.html">The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin</a> after hearing many glowing recommendations from friends and the interweb. The premise sounded interesting yet light. Rubin, not suffering from depression or any tragedy, was feeling a noticeable lack of happiness in her own life. She spent a year researching happiness and carrying out her Happiness Project. It was an academic pursuit but also a practical one – she sought to enjoy and appreciate the wonderful things <em>already in</em> <em>her life</em> after realizing she may be taking them for granted. I think we all are guilty of this a bit, having it good and expecting that to be the norm. Rubin knew she wasn’t being present in her own life, letting negative thoughts and bad moods run rampant, pushing extraneous joy away to make sure she was being productive and not frivolous. I can <em>totally relate</em>. I often times let my sense of duty to my own life take over, for better or for worse. I was intrigued and inspired by Rubin’s approach: setting twelve happiness goals, one for each month, and spending a year tackling the whole project.</p>
<p>Within the first few pages I knew I was going to love this book. Rubin felt like a kindred spirit to me with her purposeful nature, a hint of contemplation, as well as her “insatiable need for credit.” She wasn’t in the wrong for dutifully living her life, but she knew she was existing only at the surface level. Her realization that she may be in danger of wasting her life inspired her to start her Happiness Project.</p>
<p>I’m not going to rehash the whole book because I do think it’s worth a read. However, I do want to touch on some of my favorite themes. As I said, Rubin’s Happiness Project devoted each month of an entire year to exploring and engaging in a specific topic (eg. Boost Energy, Lighten Up, Buy Some Happiness, Pay Attention, etc.) Here are my favorite take aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold stars may be an idle, self righteous pursuit. Instead of <strong>wanting credit for doing good deeds</strong>, do them because you want to do them for yourself and not for the credit that is associated with them.</li>
<li><strong>Clutter</strong>, when out of control, confronts you with your own mistakes. Rubin categorizes clutter into nostalgic clutter (yearbooks, old papers, all the birthday cards you’ve ever received), conservation clutter (things kept because of their <em>potential </em>usefulness), bargain/freebie clutter (i.e. usually crap), clutch clutter (old standbys that are probably junk – a paint splattered tshirt, ratty yoga pants, etc.), and aspirational clutter (my own personal biggest “mistake,” a whole closet full of things I “might be able to fit into someday”).</li>
<li>Start applying the <strong>One Minute Rule</strong>: don&#8217;t postpone anything that can be done in less than one minute (an email, tidying up, folding socks, etc.)</li>
<li>&#8220;Although we presume that we act because of the way we feel, in fact <strong>we often feel because of the way we act</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>Aim for a <strong>high standard of behavior</strong> (extreme nice, genuine appreciation, acting polite, little negativity, no gossip).</li>
<li>Stop thinking that in some idealistic, far reaching future you will be happier, things will be better, life will be easier. <strong>All you have is right now</strong>. The &#8220;arrival fallacy&#8221; (the belief that when you arrive at a certain destination, you&#8217;ll be happy) is an idea the prevents us from enjoying now.</li>
<li>&#8220;Enthusiasm is more important to mastery than innate ability, it turns out, because the single most important element in developing an expertise is your <strong>willingness to practice</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>We seek to control our lives, but the <strong>unfamiliar and unexpected</strong> are important sources of happiness.</li>
<li>&#8220;I have an idea of who I <em>wish</em> I were, and that obscures my understanding of <strong>who I actually am</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>Denying bad feelings intensifies them; <strong>acknowledging bad feelings</strong> allows good feelings to return.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t overrate the fun activities that you didn&#8217;t do and <strong>underrate your own inclinations</strong>. The things that others do are no more enjoyable, valuable, cultured, or legitimate than those you do.</li>
<li><strong>What did you do for fun as a child</strong>? Revisit those passions.</li>
<li>There is an <strong>I</strong> in &#8220;happiness.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Pouring out ideas is better for <strong>creativity</strong> than doling them out by the teaspoon.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes later becomes never</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude</strong> is important to happiness: it fosters forbearance, brings freedom from envy, makes it easier to live within your means, and be generous to others.</li>
<li>Irony and world-weariness allow people a level of <strong>detachment</strong> from their choices.</li>
<li>The belief that unhappiness is selfless and happiness is selfish is misguided. It takes <strong>energy, generosity, and discipline</strong> to be unfailingly lighthearted.</li>
<li>The desire to change is meaningless unless you can find a way to <strong>make the change happen</strong>.</li>
<li>Last but certainly not least, the most influential mantra I&#8217;ve adopted since reading this book: <strong>It is easy to be heavy, hard to be light.</strong> (&#8220;Dying is easy, comedy is hard.&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>These tidbits and take-aways aren&#8217;t new ideas. But Rubin&#8217;s purpose is to remind us of ways we can be more aware and appreciative of our own happiness in the present moment. I know when I get caught up in my own day to day, these basic principles are the first to go.</p>
<p>My goals of <a href="http://domestocrat.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/looking-towards-2012/">balance</a> and being present are always on my mind but sometimes it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how to achieve those things or how to measure them, if they can be measured at all. I think happiness is a great baseline measurement for any goal though. Even if it doesn&#8217;t directly relate, being happy may keep you motivated, focused, energetic. For example, when <a href="http://domestocrat.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/the-one-where-i-meet-joy-the-baker/">I met Joy The Baker</a> I was feeling a little blog-dead. My creativity was low, the motivation to whip up new recipes was nowhere to be found, my desire to sit in front of my computer and edit photos was nonexistent. But then I met Joy and felt <em>so inspired</em>. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Baker-Cookbook-Comforting-Recipes/dp/1401310605/">her book</a> cover to cover and couldn&#8217;t <em>wait</em> to get back in the kitchen. When I go back and think about the whole thing it was really the happiness I felt from the experience that reinvigorated me.</p>
<p><strong>What are your happiness mantras? What keeps you actively engaged in Right Now?</strong></p>

<p>Alright, I&#8217;m finally going to contribute to <strong><a href="http://coolandcollected.com/introducing-pop-culture-pundits/">The League of Extraordinary Bloggers,</strong></a> a fellowship of pop-culture-minded bloggers who contribute to a weekly topic. This week&#8217;s topic is:</p>
<p><strong>What is something you absolutely hate or love or just don’t get, or maybe it’s something you have never even seen or read. What is your deepest, darkest geek confession? </strong></p>
<p>Deep breath. </p>
<p>Here it is. I&#8217;ve never beaten Super Mario Bros. on the NES. Never got to the end of the game. Never reached the final castle. Through countless issues of Nintendo Power Magazines and the invention of the Game Genie; through game guides and multiple cartridges, ports, and emulations, through childhood to adulthood, I have failed to do one thing: save the princess. Not with warp zones and infinite lives tricks. Not with cheat codes and secret tips. Not even with the Power Glove. Although let&#8217;s face it, you couldn&#8217;t do anything with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!&#8221; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the story of my life.</p>
<p>Beating Mario Bros. was something of a prowess in elementary school. There were kids who could beat it no mushrooms, no one-ups, and no warp zones. Kids who could beat it in one turn, no damage and no deaths. There was even a kid who claimed he figured out how to jump over the flag pole, but nobody believed that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even a difficult game. Mario Bros. invented the archetype for platformer games to come. The game is comprised of just thirty-two levels with intuitive controls that are easy-to-learn. The basic controls are just two attack moves, stomping and shooting fire balls. The beauty of the game is that it does have a deeper complexity, however it&#8217;s also simple enough that it can be beaten in a world record five minutes and eight seconds.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t like I&#8217;d run blindly into the first Goomba I&#8217;d see in World 1-1. It wasn&#8217;t like I was a slouch at video games.  I knew the Contra Code. I knew the code to Mike Tyson. I knew the secret cave in the Legend of Zelda, the secret to beating King Hippo, and the secret to the Power Pad by pounding your fists onto it instead of your feet. We didn&#8217;t call it cheating. We called it efficiency. </p>
<p>Our Nintendo was hooked up to the television in the family room&#8212;a television that was shared by my mother&#8217;s daily appointment with Judge Wapner and <em>The People&#8217;s Court</em>, my father&#8217;s sports, my sister&#8217;s cartoons, and of course, my own schedule of cartoons. Some families run their lives by a calendar. We ran ours by the TV Guide. </p>
<p>Between television, catching up on my Choose Your Own Adventure books, devoting time to advancing our plots in the ongoing saga between the Ninja Turtles and Barbies with my sister, and spending time outside riding bikes and collecting sticks in the woods for my &#8220;top secret&#8221; project, getting in quality time with Mario was difficult. Not to mention quality time with Link, Pac-Man, Jimmy and Bimmy. </p>
<p>No wonder I didn&#8217;t have time for extracurricular activities, organized clubs, and summer camps. Sure, I&#8217;ve paid the price as an adult being a social weirdo who doesn&#8217;t know how to swim, pitch a baseball, or play nicely with others in board games of Monopoly, but at least I can score 50,000 points in Double Dragon on an arcade machine at a bus station.</p>
<p>And seriously, you put a hotel on that Boardwalk and I&#8217;m flipping this board upside down and scattering the pieces everywhere. </p>
<p>Mario and I drifted apart by my teenage years. We didn&#8217;t move on together to Mario World or Mario Sunshine. Mario went into the back of the closet for twenty years, and though I had a brief affair with one named Sonic and his cool 16-bit Genesis ride, for the most part I moved away from gaming. That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t suck at my other hobbies. Alright, I&#8217;m about make a couple more gory confessions. I&#8217;m a writer, and I&#8217;ve never read Hemingway. I&#8217;m a rock fan, who&#8217;s never listened to Hendrix. And I&#8217;m a vegetarian, and I don&#8217;t like vegetables.</p>
<p>Seriously. And what the hell are my excuses? Oh you know, the usual: lazy, tired, working, too much delicious bread to eat, playing Minesweeper obsessively until eyes bleed, <em>For Whom The Bell Tolls</em> too heavy to lift off bookshelf, busy listening to corny 1980s R&amp;B instead, busy wiping blood from tear ducts, still collecting sticks for secret project.</p>
<p>Jesus, I&#8217;m a horrible person. </p>
<p>People, I&#8217;m going to do it. I&#8217;m going to read Hemingway, eat some baby carrots which are very good for my complexion, take Bell Biv Devoe off my record player, and beat Super Mario Bros. In the end, I&#8217;ll be a better person. I&#8217;ll be nicer to old people and kinder to animals. I&#8217;ll have ten percent fresher breath. I&#8217;ll go better with Coke.</p>
<p>Or I&#8217;ll die in world 4-1 after getting hit by a Spiny, curse the game, throw the controller down, and sulk&#8212;because I never learned how to lose games with dignity, a skill that I would have no doubt picked up at summer camp, along with swimming and macaroni art. And I&#8217;m talking <em>precision macaroni art</em>, which is a true art form, not the kind where you get glue smeared all over the paper.</p>
<p>But just you wait. One day I&#8217;ll reveal my big secret stick project and I&#8217;ll take the art world by storm.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone sent me the transcript from a commencement speech.  The title and beginning featured a slightly shocking pattern interrupt. In other words, they caught me by surprise. I found myself so intrigued I read further, and eventually realized that, unlike 99% of everything else I ever receive, I could not stop reading this. I have included it below in its entirety for your enjoyment and pondering. I love how it concludes, and think there are many, many fine points made along the way. Oh, if we could only think and behave thus!</p>
<p>Here it is!</p>
<p>Here’s a new one in the annals of commencement speakers. A teacher at Wellesley High School in Massachusetts gave his address to the Class of 2012 and blasted the students, telling them over and over, “You’re not special.”</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________<br />
(Dennis R.J. Geppert/AP)</p>
<p>David McCullough Jr., an English teacher at the school, delivered his rather unusual speech:</p>
<p><em>Dr. Wong, Dr. Keough, Mrs. Novogroski, Ms. Curran, members of the board of education, family and friends of the graduates, ladies and gentlemen of the Wellesley High School class of 2012, for the privilege of speaking to you this afternoon, I am honored and grateful. Thank you.</em></p>
<p><em>So here we are… commencement… life’s great forward-looking ceremony. (And don’t say, “What about weddings?” Weddings are one-sided and insufficiently effective. Weddings are bride-centric pageantry. Other than conceding to a list of unreasonable demands, the groom just stands there. No stately, hey-everybody-look-at-me procession. No being given away. No identity-changing pronouncement. And can you imagine a television show dedicated to watching guys try on tuxedos? Their fathers sitting there misty-eyed with joy and disbelief, their brothers lurking in the corner muttering with envy. Left to men, weddings would be, after limits-testing procrastination, spontaneous, almost inadvertent… during halftime… on the way to the refrigerator. And then there’s the frequency of failure: Statistics tell us half of you will get divorced. A winning percentage like that’ll get you last place in the American League East. The Baltimore Orioles do better than weddings.)</em></p>
<p><em>But this ceremony… commencement… a commencement works every time. From this day forward… truly… in sickness and in health, through financial fiascos, through midlife crises and passably attractive sales reps at trade shows in Cincinnati, through diminishing tolerance for annoyingness, through every difference, irreconcilable and otherwise, you will stay forever graduated from high school, you and your diploma as one, ‘til death do you part.</em></p>
<p><em>No, commencement is life’s great ceremonial beginning, with its own attendant and highly appropriate symbolism. Fitting, for example, for this auspicious rite of passage, is where we find ourselves this afternoon, the venue. Normally, I avoid clichés like the plague, wouldn’t touch them with a ten-foot pole, but here we are on a literal level playing field. That matters. That says something. And your ceremonial costume… shapeless, uniform, one-size-fits-all. Whether male or female, tall or short, scholar or slacker, spray-tanned prom queen or intergalactic X-Box assassin, each of you is dressed, you’ll notice, exactly the same. And your diploma… but for your name, exactly the same.</em></p>
<p><em>All of this is as it should be, because none of you is special.</em></p>
<p><em>You are not special. You are not exceptional.</em></p>
<p><em>Contrary to what your soccer trophy suggests, your glowing seventh grade report card, despite every assurance of a certain corpulent purple dinosaur, that nice Mister Rogers and your batty Aunt Sylvia, no matter how often your maternal caped crusader has swooped in to save you… you’re nothing special.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, you’ve been pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped. Yes, capable adults with other things to do have held you, kissed you, fed you, wiped your mouth, wiped your bottom, trained you, taught you, tutored you, coached you, listened to you, counseled you, encouraged you, consoled you and encouraged you again. You’ve been nudged, cajoled, wheedled and implored. You’ve been feted and fawned over and called sweetie pie. Yes, you have. And, certainly, we’ve been to your games, your plays, your recitals, your science fairs. Absolutely, smiles ignite when you walk into a room, and hundreds gasp with delight at your every tweet. Why, maybe you’ve even had your picture in the Townsman! And now you’ve conquered high school… and, indisputably, here we all have gathered for you, the pride and joy of this fine community, the first to emerge from that magnificent new building…</em></p>
<p><em>But do not get the idea you’re anything special. Because you’re not.</em></p>
<p><em>The empirical evidence is everywhere, numbers even an English teacher can’t ignore. Newton, Natick, Nee… I am allowed to say Needham, yes? …that has to be two thousand high school graduates right there, give or take, and that’s just the neighborhood Ns. Across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high schools. That’s 37,000 valedictorians… 37,000 class presidents… 92,000 harmonizing altos… 340,000 swaggering jocks… 2,185,967 pairs of Uggs. But why limit ourselves to high school? After all, you’re leaving it. So think about this: even if you’re one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you. Imagine standing somewhere over there on Washington Street on Marathon Monday and watching sixty-eight hundred yous go running by. And consider for a moment the bigger picture: your planet, I’ll remind you, is not the center of its solar system, your solar system is not the center of its galaxy, your galaxy is not the center of the universe. In fact, astrophysicists assure us the universe has no center; therefore, you cannot be it. Neither can Donald Trump… which someone should tell him… although that hair is quite a phenomenon.</em></p>
<p><em>“But, Dave,” you cry, “Walt Whitman tells me I’m my own version of perfection! Epictetus tells me I have the spark of Zeus!” And I don’t disagree. So that makes 6.8 billion examples of perfection, 6.8 billion sparks of Zeus. You see, if everyone is special, then no one is. If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless. In our unspoken but not so subtle Darwinian competition with one another — which springs, I think, from our fear of our own insignificance, a subset of our dread of mortality — we have of late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more than genuine achievement. We have come to see them as the point — and we’re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we suspect that’s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about, something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the social totem pole. No longer is it how you play the game, no longer is it even whether you win or lose, or learn or grow, or enjoy yourself doing it… Now it’s “So what does this get me?”</em></p>
<p><em>As a consequence, we cheapen worthy endeavors, and building a Guatemalan medical clinic becomes more about the application to Bowdoin than the well-being of Guatemalans. It’s an epidemic — and in its way, not even dear old Wellesley High is immune… one of the best of the 37,000 nationwide, Wellesley High School… where good is no longer good enough, where a B is the new C, and the midlevel curriculum is called Advanced College Placement. And I hope you caught me when I said “one of the best.” I said “one of the best” so we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition. But the phrase defies logic. By definition there can be only one best. You’re it or you’re not.</em></p>
<p><em>If you’ve learned anything in your years here I hope it’s that education should be for, rather than material advantage, the exhilaration of learning. You’ve learned, too, I hope, as Sophocles assured us, that wisdom is the chief element of happiness. (Second is ice cream… just an fyi) I also hope you’ve learned enough to recognize how little you know… how little you know now… at the moment… for today is just the beginning. It’s where you go from here that matters.</em></p>
<p><em>As you commence, then, and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance. Don’t bother with work you don’t believe in any more than you would a spouse you’re not crazy about, lest you too find yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison. Resist the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction. Be worthy of your advantages. And read… read all the time… read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect. Read as a nourishing staple of life. Develop and protect a moral sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it. Dream big. Work hard. Think for yourself. Love everything you love, everyone you love, with all your might. And do so, please, with a sense of urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer; and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and you’ll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that eventuality no matter how delightful the afternoon.</em></p>
<p><em>The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life, is an achievement, not something that will fall into your lap because you’re a nice person or mommy ordered it from the caterer. You’ll note the founding fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness–quite an active verb, “pursuit”–which leaves, I should think, little time for lying around watching parrots rollerskate on YouTube. The first President Roosevelt, the old rough rider, advocated the strenuous life. Mr. Thoreau wanted to drive life into a corner, to live deep and suck out all the marrow. The poet Mary Oliver tells us to row, row into the swirl and roil. Locally, someone… I forget who… from time to time encourages young scholars to carpe the heck out of the diem. The point is the same: get busy, have at it. Don’t wait for inspiration or passion to find you. Get up, get out, explore, find it yourself, and grab hold with both hands. (Now, before you dash off and get your YOLO tattoo, let me point out the illogic of that trendy little expression–because you can and should live not merely once, but every day of your life. Rather than You Only Live Once, it should be You Live Only Once… but because YLOO doesn’t have the same ring, we shrug and decide it doesn’t matter.)</em></p>
<p><em>None of this day-seizing, though, this YLOOing, should be interpreted as license for self-indulgence. Like accolades ought to be, the fulfilled life is a consequence, a gratifying byproduct. It’s what happens when you’re thinking about more important things. Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you. Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your list and congratulate yourself for being worldly. Exercise free will and creative, independent thought not for the satisfactions they will bring you, but for the good they will do others, the rest of the 6.8 billion–and those who will follow them. And then you too will discover the great and curious truth of the human experience is that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself. The sweetest joys of life, then, come only with the recognition that you’re not special.</em></p>
<p><em>Because everyone is.</em></p>
<p><em>Congratulations. Good luck. Make for yourselves, please, for your sake and for ours, extraordinary lives.</em></p>

<p><strong>Prometheus</strong> [2012]<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> Ridley Scott<br />
<strong>Genre:</strong> Action/Horror/Sci-Fi<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Logan Marshall-Green<br />
<strong>Runtime:</strong> 124 minutes</p>
<p>Ridley Scott&#8217;s latest film is one that I had minimal interest in at the beginning of the year. Sir Ridley has been very much hit-or-miss with his work in the last decade, and a return to the deteriorating Alien universe seemed to have all the makings for another disappointment. But then the viral marketing kicked in.</p>
<p>First it was a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdx4Qd-_yg">Guy Pearce</a>, as the character Peter Weyland, delivering a speech about his vision for the future. Soon after came a new batch of <a href="http://www.anomalousmaterial.com/movies/2012/03/mesmerizing-viral-image-from-prometheus/" target="_blank">breathtaking promotional images</a>. Longer trailers were released, as were teaser clips. In April, a video clip introducing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgJs7uluwlU">David 8</a>, a robot played by Michael Fassbender, began making its rounds. My level of anticipation began to grow with each new piece of promo material, and by the end of May I was genuinely excited to see what Prometheus had to offer.</p>
<p>While the movie&#8217;s marketing campaign ranks as one of the all-time greats, it may have been a little <em>*too*</em> good. Could a film looking this awesome possibly deliver the goods? Well, yes and no.</p>
<p><a href="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-fassbender.jpg"><img src="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-fassbender.jpg" alt="Prometheus [2012]" title="Prometheus [2012]" width="440" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4822" /></a></p>
<p>As far as recent sci-fi films go, Prometheus is one of the better ones I have seen. I am generally not a huge sci-fi guy, but I was hooked right from the beginning. It helps that the film&#8217;s concept is an intriguing one &#8212; one that asks all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green star as Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, respectively, an archaelogist couple that has discovered an amazing star map that may shed some light on the origin of mankind. After receiving funding from the Weyland Corporation, the duo join the crew of the scientific vessel Prometheus to follow the map and see if their findings are legit. When they reach their destination, it doesn&#8217;t take long for the shit to hit the fan. They quickly realize that they are not alone.</p>
<p>Who/what else is on this moon? Why did the star map point in this direction? Is this really the home of the creators of the human race? What&#8217;s up with this black gooey stuff? Why is there a giant statue head inside this large dome? Why is there a decapitated body inside? What does all this mean?</p>
<p><a href="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-rapace.jpg"><img src="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-rapace.jpg" alt="Prometheus [2012]" title="Prometheus [2012]" width="440" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4823" /></a></p>
<p>The characters, not to mention all of us viewers, ask so many questions but get so few answers in return (certainly not unexpected given that <em>Lost</em> creator Damon Lindelof co-wrote the script). There are some serious thought-provoking ideas in place here, especially when it comes to religion and evolution. Prometheus is one of those movies where you&#8217;ll want to talk about it with your friends immediately afterward. There are just so many big ideas mentioned that it would be impossible to get answers for all of them. Undoubtedly, this will infuriate some, but it will at least lead to some fruitful (albeit often polarizing) discussions.</p>
<p>Prometheus is hampered a bit by its batch of characters. With such a large crew on board, it&#8217;s difficult for the majority of them to receive fleshed-out storylines, and therefore we don&#8217;t really feel too attached to most of them. They also have a habit of falling into sci-fi/horror stereotypes, occasionally acting irrationally for no reason. In a way, this is expected for the genre, but it does feel a bit out of place when compared to the cerebral nature of the overall film.</p>
<p><a href="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-theron-elba.jpg"><img src="http://twscritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prometheus-theron-elba.jpg" alt="Prometheus [2012]" title="Prometheus [2012]" width="440" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4824" /></a></p>
<p>Regardless of their actions, not enough can be said of the very impressive cast. Noomi Rapace is tremendous to watch as her character evolves into a spiritual successor for Sigourney Weaver&#8217;s Ripley, and it&#8217;s great to see her continue to succeed in Hollywood. The other absolute highlight of the film is Michael Fassbender&#8217;s performance as the android, David, in a role not too far off from <em>2001</em>&#8216;s HAL 9000. Quite simply, he owns the screen every time he makes an appearance. Charlize Theron fits in well as the supervisor from Weyland Corporation, a strong assertive female with a strict set of rules for her ship. I was also particularly pleased with Idris Elba (<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPS9YKGaKQE" target="_blank">Stringer f&#8217;n Bell</a></em>) and his charismatic ways as the vessel&#8217;s captain.</p>
<p>Prometheus is a visually stunning film that delivers some impressive eye candy (which everyone can enjoy), and it has a killer concept with a bunch of great ideas. It doesn&#8217;t quite live up to its lofty potential and excessive hype, but it&#8217;s still a damn good sci-fi film that is engrossing from beginning to end. Fans expecting a direct prequel to Alien will be disappointed, but if you go into the movie with an open mind you should walk out mostly satisfied.</p>

I&#8217;ve been interested in shoe design since college, but had no idea that a normal person like me could actually make a pair of shoes until I stumbled across <a href="http://www.kstar-nyc.com/pages/about" title="Keiko's" target="_blank">Keiko&#8217;s</a> class on <a href="http://skillshare.com" title="Skillshare" target="_blank">Skillshare</a> in January. Keiko is the designer and owner of <a href="http://www.kstar-nyc.com/" title="k*star" target="_blank">k*star</a> shoes in Brooklyn and has a tremendous amount of energy and passion for sharing her craft. Her shoes are adorable &#8211; check out <a href="http://www.kstar-nyc.com/collections/made-in-nyc-fall-2012/products/armadillo-demi-polka" title="this pair" target="_blank">this pair</a> of polka dot booties!</p>
<p>The first class was an introduction to shoe construction and discussion about places to buy shoemaking supplies in NYC. By the second class we were taping up our lasts and creating patterns from our designs. I decided to design a pair of wedge ankle boots&#8230;wedges are the only type of heels I can bother to stand and walk in. Constructing the wedges was tough because I had to match them perfectly to the lasts and make sure they were symmetrical (they&#8217;re not!). The wedge materials are laminated foam and cork. The cork keeps the foam from compressing, and yes, they look like tasty ice cream sandwiches. </p>

<p>Maze 342: I was at the park drawing this maze and there were so many happy people it came thru in the maze.  I chose the quote because I have a major challenge for myself to tackle tomorrow.  I&#8217;ve been avoiding this task for weeks probably a few years.   So I&#8217;m trying to remind myself about the past to help me take action in the future or at least tomorrow morning.</p>
