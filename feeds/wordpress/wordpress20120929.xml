				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://carryingthegun.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/chemical_weapon1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944" title="Trench" src="http://carryingthegun.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/chemical_weapon1.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="401" /></a></p>
<p>Clarissa Ward: <em>&#8220;When you look back at all the lessons that were learned from Rwanda, from Bosnia in the mid &#8217;90s, and yet here we are in 2012 in Syria, and it feels like we&#8217;re back to square one?&#8221;<br />
</em>Kofi Annan: &#8220;<em>Yeah, says something about us human beings, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Annan replied. &#8220;Do we ever learn? Is it in our DNA to keep fighting each other</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is how an interview concluded with former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on CBS Sunday Morning a few weeks ago. The <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57509058/kofi-annan-the-man-in-the-middle/?tag=mncol;lst;1" target="_blank">entire interview</a> is worth watching. Annan&#8217;s thoughts on diplomacy, the failure of mediation, and the international community are bared raw, and they might surprise you.</p>
<p>This interview and the violence that is flaring up in the Middle East started me thinking about why we fight.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The Army guidance counselor sat in front of his computer, quickly scanning my biographical information and test results. He was hispanic, probably in his late thirties. A Master Sergeant. In good shape and seemingly out of place and uncomfortable at the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) at Fort Hamilton, New York. I remember staring at a pin he wore on his Class B shirt. It was a <a href="http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Badges/expert_infantryman.aspx" target="_blank">long silver rifle on a blue background</a>. I didn&#8217;t know what it meant at the time, but from posters in the recruiting office, I knew it had something to do with the infantry.</p>
<p>He turned to face me in his chair, hands folded in his lap, and like he has done hundreds of times before, said &#8220;So, what do you want to do in the Army?&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied, emphasizing my choice with a firm nod, &#8220;Infantry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held back a smirk and asked me, with apparent slight disappointment, why I wanted to go infantry. I scored well enough on the ASVAB and could have chosen anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t imagine joining the Army and doing anything else&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>I joined the infantry over ten years ago for a number of reasons which vary in degree of intensity. Teenage angst, lack of direction, unfulfilled patriotism, romantic notions of military service, fantasy, college money. If I had to boil it down though to a single thing, I joined for the adventure. A 19 year old kid looking to be a part of something.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. I&#8217;ve seen the white elephant. Most of it&#8217;s pretty terrible. After getting out, my time in college afforded me the opportunity to reflect on my military service. What did it all mean? Was it worth it?</p>
<p>I never figured it out. After five years of sitting on the sidelines the only conclusions I came up with was that I was proud of my military service and I believed in the &#8220;system&#8221; &#8211; for all its flaws &#8211; that sends men and women to war. I knew that I missed the Army and I missed being a part of it. That <a href="http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2012/02/answering-the-silent-call-joining-the-army-twice/" target="_blank">longing</a> was enough to bring me back. And back to the infantry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what it all means. &#8220;It&#8221; being one&#8217;s own service and the way it intertwines with and legitimizes violence. I spend a lot of time in my own mind thinking about it. I&#8217;m sure others do to. To not think about it is to ignore what makes military service unique; the legal authority for and the application of violence. Individuals carry out that violence, so it only makes sense that individuals grapple with that notion and (hopefully) come to a personal solution as to why they can do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why we fight&#8221; is a question that has no ultimate answer. Social scientists can offer a number of reasons as to why &#8220;we&#8221; fight on a macro level, but what about the individual who analyzes the intelligence, fuels the Predator, or pulls the trigger?</p>
<p>That &#8220;why&#8221; can only be answered by the individual. Everyone is going to have a different reason. God, country, family, money, glory, anger. It&#8217;s probably not that simple for most, but rather a mix of things that makes it acceptable. As for me, some days I think I have it nailed down and I can proudly go about my day. Other days I tumble with different thoughts and ideas and have to patch together a jumble of reasons to reach an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the interview with Kofi Annan held my attention. I was completely drawn in by Annan&#8217;s conclusion that maybe we as a species just aren&#8217;t ready to be peaceful. It&#8217;s a sad thought, but it&#8217;s grounded in history, experience, and reality. In his interview, he suggests that there are times when violence might be the only way to reach a solution. It&#8217;s a conclusion that he has reached from decades of experience trying to untangle some of the world&#8217;s most troublesome conflicts.</p>
<p>That interview coupled with the flaring violence across the Middle East seems to indicate that there is absolutely a time for violence. It&#8217;s terrible and not preferred, but it is the status quo. It&#8217;s the way things are. To completely accept violence as the best way to problem solve, though, doesn&#8217;t work for me (that&#8217;s why we have Marines). And to ignore violence or to self-righteously abstain because it is terrible doesn&#8217;t work for me either. I know it does for others, and I respect that decision and I&#8217;m glad that the abstainers exist &#8211; when there are more of them than the rest of us, we&#8217;ll probably be in a better place.</p>
<p>But for the time being the world is as it is, not as we imagine it or hope it to be.</p>

<p>Just because I&#8217;m feeling great lately doesn&#8217;t mean I have to be nice to door-to-door hucksters. Those people irritate the living daylights out of me. Brad&#8217;s really nice to them. I, on the other hand, tend to cut them off right away and get on with my life as efficiently as possible. The only ones I&#8217;ll make an effort to listen to are cute kids who come right out and say they&#8217;re fundraising for sports or a school trip or something. Otherwise, I consider it my duty as a human being to discourage the obnoxious occupation of door-to-door &#8220;not selling anything,&#8221; as they always seem to want to reassure me right before they try to sell me something.</p>
<p>I mean, a bit of advice, for goodness&#8217; sake: If you&#8217;re going door-to-door to present your bullshit &#8220;promotion&#8221; or &#8220;free opportunity&#8221; or whatever the &#8220;anything&#8221; is that you are &#8220;not selling,&#8221; and upon ringing the doorbell (a sure tip-off that it&#8217;s nobody I know), the first thing you hear is a pack of insanely yapping little dogs and some crazy person yelling and cussing at them behind the door to <em>SHUT UP!</em>, then your best bet is just to save your spiel and move along to ring the doorbell of your next victim (usually my in-laws, who live next door, lucky them). Because you have already disrupted my life more than I wanted, and I am not about to stand there blocking multiple pets from escaping and let you recite your whole script before I shoo you along on your merry little way.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s exchange:</p>
<p>Doorbell rings. I crack the door open enough to acknowledge the pimply little bespectacled guy standing there, but not enough to get my head all the way out the door. He starts right in moving his lips, and I can make out a long sentence including the words &#8220;ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and &#8220;promotion,&#8221; but I can&#8217;t hear any more than that because the part of my head that includes my ears is still inside the house, where my dogs are gleefully getting their bark on in a most piercing fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I&#8217;m going to cut you off right there and say I&#8217;m not interested&#8230;&#8221; I say, to which I hear him reply something to the effect that (of course) he is &#8220;not selling anything&#8211;&#8221; to which I interrupt again with &#8220;Sorry, have a nice day,&#8221; and close the door, trying to be firm without being outright mean.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re done. Unfortunately, as the door closes, this young whippersnapper finds it necessary to toss out an appalled-sounding, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; This tells me I may have failed in my firm-yet-polite effort somewhat, which I kind of knew anyway. Well, regardless, it&#8217;s too late now, so I might as well roll with mean.</p>
<p>I whip the door back open. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say <em>wow</em> to me, dude! I said I&#8217;m not interested! I don&#8217;t have time. Can you hear these dogs barking? I&#8217;m trying to work here.&#8221; Which I was. <em>SLAM.</em></p>
<p>Then it briefly occurred to me that this kid might have been one of the legitimate fundraising types I usually give a listen to. I doubt it, though. If he were, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone with the &#8220;not selling anything&#8221; angle. So you may call me a mean, intolerant, Scroogey recluse, but I don&#8217;t care. These people come to MY door, unwelcome, cause a big ruckus here at the zoo, and generally disrupt my little world, so they shouldn&#8217;t be surprised when I&#8217;m less than receptive to dealing with the same old sales pitch from yet another shifty little runt who insists he isn&#8217;t selling anything.</p>
<p>Since, I&#8217;ve been feeling pretty creative lately, I think I&#8217;m going to paint up a charming little sign for the front door that says in cheerful lettering, &#8220;<em>The last door-to-door guy sold me <a title="Mace Pepper Sprays and Self-Defense Products" href="http://www.mace.com/personal_defense/pepper-sprays-and-gels.html" target="_blank">Mace</a></em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now have a nice day. And good luck out there, door-to-door guy. I hope you don&#8217;t sell a single thing. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>I always wondered how people would live in space. Sure, sci-fi shows us how crew members live in space ships and how essential crew on space stations live. But what about the hoards? I hope it turns out nice when five hundred years from now people are actually living up there forming economies and governments not based on Earth. I kinda think we&#8217;ll be living in container like homes. Homes that more closely simulate the trailer park, prefabricated homes here on Earth. Maybe or maybe not with the same negative stigma trailer-parks here have. Yes, the rich will always live better, but I doubt the middle-class and poorer will be able to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">I don&#8217;t want to be Freshly Pressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I get.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Consider the lovely pressed blouse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It&#8217;s wonderful, but I&#8217;d have to stand still all day, and I&#8217;m just not that kind of gal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">It&#8217;s lovely, of course!  It&#8217;s a rouse though, her peeps have a rack of them waiting for her, just in case&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There&#8217;s one thing that REALLY gets under my skin and it&#8217;s jeans or dungarees that have been Freshly Pressed so many times,  and right down the front of the leg&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">  <strong>What year do people think it is?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Food likes to be Freshly Pressed too!  Apples, for example&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Freshly Pressed Cookies!  What&#8217;s not to love?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I hope you&#8217;ve never Freshly Pressed your tongue!  I Freshly Pressed my tongue on a frozen <a class="zem_slink" title="Popsicle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popsicle" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Creamsicle</a> as a kid, and&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> There&#8217;s nothing like a Freshly Pressed cup of coffee, from my <a class="zem_slink" title="French press" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">French Press</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Come on over, anytime.</p>
<div id="attachment_2281" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 370px"><a href="http://seapunk2.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frenchpress-tdg-greengourmet-fb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2281" title="FrenchPress-TDG-GreenGourmet-fb" src="http://seapunk2.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frenchpress-tdg-greengourmet-fb.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="460" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Complete with grounds, if I grind too finely&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">And what&#8217;s not to love about this Freshly Pressed kid?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Then again, there are things of great beauty, Freshly Pressed on glass&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The last of the blackberries don&#8217;t seem to be picking themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I use one of these to separate the good stuff from the seeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I used to have one of these for Freshly Pressed potatoes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This press gives your potatoes a good mashing and a Freshly Pressed texture.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">There&#8217;s nothing like the smell of a Freshly Pressed newspaper!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">And of course, while you read your paper, you can have your suit Freshly Pressed!  And then again, there&#8217;s golf!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">People have been saying, &#8220;Freshly Pressed, please!&#8221;  for a long, long time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I need a new one of these.  I Freshly Pressed so much  garlic that it broke down and cried.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Ah, the good ol&#8217; days.  People getting low wages and maimed or injured, no protection from that nasty pressed steel.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">to make sausage</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Lucky for them, they didn&#8217;t have the option of sexualizing their little girls with kits like this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Actually, I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s anything  in those Freshly Pressed sleeves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">  Maybe her hands are like the fake ones I had when I was clowning, just stuck up there in the sleeve&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_444" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/abandonedmanor2howzey.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-444" title="abandonedmanor2howzey" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/abandonedmanor2howzey.jpg?w=300&h=212" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The prosaic humanity of an abandoned manor (image courtesy howzey)</p></div>
<p>An astounding number of web pages document abandoned materiality, encompassing a broad range of architectural spaces including <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/asylums/pool/with/3600343215/#photo_3600343215">asylums</a>, <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2010/10/17/a-striking-beauty-10-eerie-abandoned-bowling-alleys/">bowling alleys</a>, <a href="http://www.hfinster.de/">industrial sites</a>, <a href="http://www.jeremyblakeslee.org/photography/">Cold War sites</a>, and <a href="http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2012/01/faded-americana-19-abandoned-motels-diners-and-gas-stations/">roadside motels</a> as well as smaller things like <a href="http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2012/03/abandoned-pianos-an-unlikely-urbex-attraction/">pianos</a> and even <a href="http://www.lorinix.net/the_city/index.html">scale models</a> of abandonment.  This ruination lust is not simply the province of a small handful of visual artists, hipsters colonizing Detroit, or recalcitrant trespassers; instead, it invokes something that reaches far deeper socially, has international dimensions, extends well into the past, and reflects a deep-seated fascination with&#8212;if not apprehension of&#8212;abandonment.  The question is what explains our apparently sudden collective fascination with abandonment, ruination, and decay.  The answers are exceptionally complex and highly individual, but there seem to be some recurrent metaphors in these discourses.</p>
<div id="attachment_451" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tampere.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-451" title="tampere" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tampere.jpg?w=300&h=208" alt="" width="300" height="208" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An abandoned roof felt factory in Tampere Finland (image courtesy Tiia Monto)</p></div>
<p>For “urban explorers” (a term that might loosely include artists, photographers, archaeologists, and curious folks alike), such journeys seek out <a href="http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2010/10/introduction-urban-exploration/">“abandoned, unseen, and off-limits” spaces</a> that imagine ruination in a wide range of artistic, emotional, scholarly, and political forms.  Many of these urban explorers and artists see themselves as visual historians, documenting the architectural and community heritage reflected in abandoned spaces.  For instance, Jonathan Haeber’s urban exploration blog <a href="http://www.terrastories.com/bearings/about-bearings">Bearings</a> explains that “I’m just an eye.  I’m just a camera. … An urban explorer is just a documentarian. …  We only appreciate the creations that are overlooked. … It is what remains that is the democratic equivalent of a revolution.”</p>
<p>This is a politically circumspect expression of the explorer as a visual chronicler who records the prosaic material dimensions of abandoned material heritage.  It focuses on the power of aesthetically documenting abandonment, often to fortify a general appreciation for the breadth of heritage but not always in especially articulate ways.  <a href="http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/about/">Urban Ghosts: Forgotten Places and Urban Curiosities</a>, for example, argues that its mission through such images is to underscore that “History is all around us, on every street corner.  Almost every place has a story to tell, but so much goes unnoticed, or simply pales into insignificance alongside heavy-hitting giants like the pyramids.”</p>
<div id="attachment_456" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spreeparknorbertlove.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-456" title="spreeparknorbertlove" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spreeparknorbertlove.jpg?w=199&h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The abandoned Spreepark near Berlin (image courtesy Norbert Lov).</p></div>
<p>The thorough <a href="http://guerillahistorian.net/info/">Guerilla Historian page</a> argues that urban exploration can produce a historical narrative that is complicated by the physical and aesthetic depiction of ruination, arguing that “Staring into the unfamiliar past, artificial environments and composites of micro-histories is a way to construct a depth perception for our own timeline.”  This focus on the experience of exploring ruined materiality is not at all novel, but the Guerilla Historian envisions this producing a historical narrative focused on people’s story-telling.  Such a people’s history of ruination is based on grassroots commitment to the details of everyday heritage that some observers believe is outside conventional academic history.  <a href="http://guerillahistorian.net/info/">Guerilla Historian</a> suggests that “If his­tory is writ­ten only by the win­ners, we are all losers.  I come from a place where his­tory is some­thing you can walk on and climb on, some­thing to be found and felt. Come with me.  Our past has been relegated to weighty dusty bookshelves in this culture, treated as dead weight that holds modernity, innovation and progress itself back—I disagree. Our past is always obscured behind the veil of contemporary interpretation, and this work represents mine: a world where the past is freed from rotting pages and can teach us who we are.”  Some urban explorers share a comparable vision of their historiography as a foil to mainstream narratives; this risks over-stating the conservatism of academic historians, but it does capture that much of everyday materiality is absolutely irrelevant to mainstream historians, and urban explorers (including most historical archaeologists) celebrate the everyday world even as they acknowledge the profoundly complicated histories of loss in America.</p>
<div id="attachment_475" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/asylum.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-475" title="VLUU L310 W  / Samsung L310 W" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/asylum.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Child&#8217;s chair and walking stick in an abandoned asylum boiler room (image courtesy World of Good)</p></div>
<p>Many of these projects focus on how the photographic representation of abandonment is utterly dependent on the bodily experience of a creative, curious, and sympathetic eye moving through ruined landscapes.  Matthew Christopher’s <a href="http://abandonedamerica.us/">Abandoned America</a> page has thoroughly chronicled urban abandonment, and his assessment of abandonment hinges on the physical experience of moving through these ruined landscapes, which he refers to as the “visceral experience of entering a parallel universe.”  In an<a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2012/01/psychology-ruin-porn/886/"> Atlantic Cities</a> article on<a href="https://paulmullins.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-politics-and-archaeology-of-ruin-porn/"> &#8220;ruin porn,&#8221;</a> Christopher acknowledged that &#8220;It was a case of that old cliché, &#8216;a picture speaks a thousand words.&#8217; &#8230; When I&#8217;d try to talk about the presences that seem to linger in these places, people would look at me like I should be in an asylum myself. When I showed them pictures — they&#8217;d suddenly get it.&#8221;  Many if not most urban explorers believe that a visual record of a place is uniquely documented by a photographer who thinks creatively and embraces prosaic ruination, taking pictures in ways that our sight may not otherwise have seen and stressing what <a href="http://travisparno.org/2012/08/21/some-thoughts-on-the-aesthetics-of-ruination/">Travis Parno calls &#8220;the potency of the imagination.</a>&#8221;  <em><a href="http://carpetbombingculture.co.uk/index.php?action=what&amp;subaction=beautyindecay">Beauty in Decay</a></em>, for instance, aspires to “<a href="http://carpetbombingculture.co.uk/files/beauty_in_decay.pdf">walk in the eerie footsteps of long departed souls</a> through haunted houses turned to dust and industrial complexes surrendered to nature,” arguing that “to understand the siren song of these places requires a certainly more poetic mindset than one might be used to occupying.  Think back to your childhood for a moment and it all begins to make sense. … At the very point we cross the border from childhood into adolescence we cross real physical borders too. It’s the moment in our lives when we test the boundaries.”</p>
<div id="attachment_459" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nikemissilesilo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-459" title="nikemissilesilo" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nikemissilesilo.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nike missile silo SF-91L in Belvedere California (image courtesy www78)</p></div>
<p>For some of these explorers, this is more than an exercise in taking good pictures or breaking into buildings.  The <a href="http://carpetbombingculture.co.uk/files/beauty_in_decay.pdf"><em>Beauty in Decay</em></a> project acknowledges that with “a digital SLR camera and High Dynamic Range software it has become very much easier to take awesome photographs,” yet they do not reduce it simply to an aesthetic exploration; instead, they argue that “photography appears to be the symptom and not the disease.”  Rather than reduce urban abandonment to voyeuristic curiosity or shallow artistic vision, the <em>Beauty in Decay</em> project suggests that explorers “in the comfortable and over-protected ‘first world’ are living in an enforced and extended state of childhood.  They have remembered that they are capable of having unmediated experiences of reality and they welcome the fear that may (or may not) come with those experiences.  The fear itself is the gateway to go through. It’s the gateway that leads for many to ‘wonderland’. This is the world through the looking glass that in some dark corner of every soul, we are all looking for.”  This frames urban exploration as the pursuit of meaningful experiences in an over-built world that provides a false security; it is in the ruins of that very world that we encounter ourselves and our society and plumb the depths of our most unsettled sentiments about ourselves and modernity.</p>
<div id="attachment_464" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cocoapalmsresort.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-464" title="cocoapalmsresort" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cocoapalmsresort.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The abandoned Cocoa Palms Resort on Kauai, Hawaii (image courtesy peptic_ulcer)</p></div>
<p>Many urban explorers characterize ruin as “beauty,” a romantic nostalgia with deep historical roots.  For urban explorer Jonathan Haeber, for instance, the ruined <a href="http://www.terrastories.com/bearings/about-bearings">landscape provides “beauty and ephemerality,”</a> securing its aesthetic appeal from its very ruination and the decay inevitable in all materiality’s return to nature.   The implication of this notion of beauty is that <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/paul-virilio-506-v17n9">the seeds of decay are in all materiality and technology</a>, and we acknowledge this transience through our own willingness to see that ruination all about us.  <a href="http://www.gingkopress.com/08-pho/beauty-in-decay.html">One somewhat overwrought description of the <em>Beauty in Decay </em>project</a> rhapsodized that urban explorers “collectively put forth a ground cry against a modern culture that embraces the new, polished, uniform, and mundane.  Urban explorers find the beauty—layers of graffiti by years worth of writers, multi-hued peeling paint, antique objects, someone’s initials left in the dust on a broken stained glass window—and physical manifestations of memory that abandoned, impermanent urban spaces can hold.”  This views decay as traces of memory, a somewhat romantic notion of the ruin as a pleasing fantasy whose materiality haunts the present but does not invoke the future.</p>
<div id="attachment_467" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cork.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-467" title="cork" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cork.jpg?w=300&h=198" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An abandoned building in Cork, Ireland (image courtesy slinky2000)</p></div>
<p>The most distinctive definition of the relationship between beauty and ruin is a rapidly emerging school of photographic art that uses abandoned ruins as the stark backdrop for fashion images or nudes (for a relatively SFW example, see <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151241768078824.518309.723313823&amp;type=3">Beauty in Decay</a></em> compiler <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jeremy.gibbs.777">Romanywg’s facebook page</a>).  For instance, visual artist <a href="http://mirukim.com/">Miru Kim’s “Naked Spleen” series</a> depicts her nude in a variety of urban ruins, explaining that “Experiencing feelings of alienation and anxiety in the city–a city that has increasingly become more surveilled and commodified–I began to understand how many artists and authors suffered from severe bouts of depression, inertia, and isolation, which the term spleen embodies. One of the ways I escaped such feelings was to visit desolate and hidden places in the city. … Exploring industrial ruins and structures made me look at the city as one living organism. I started to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with miniscule life forms. These spaces—abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, catacombs, factories, hospitals, and shipyards—form the subconscious of the city, where collective memories and dreams reside. … As I momentarily inhabit these deserted sites, they are transformed from strange to familiar, from harsh to calm, from dangerous to ludic.”  This actually invokes a common urban explorers’ desire for an unmediated experience, it simply inflates the sensory dimensions of that experience and produces more jarring images by juxtaposing a nude with ruination.  Others have used urban ruins as a very different sort of backdrop: For instance, the <a href="http://gakuranman.com/the-hazards-of-haikyo-and-urban-exploration/#Film_Crews_and_Adult_Video">Gakuranman</a> site’s guide to urban exploring includes the story that one urban explorer “tells us that she has also bumped into crews shooting adult photography and video on more than one occasion, which was quite embarrassing for both parties.”</p>

<p>Matthew Christopher has a sober explanation for the meanings of his images of abandonment.  He <a href="http://abandonedamerica.us/blog-post-youre-on-your">somewhat counter-intuitively (if rhetorically) argues that his images have no intended moral or political lessons</a>, arguing that each picture of an abandoned place “filters a fraction of another microcosm of loss.  This place was many things to the many people who knew it: a source of income, memories of good times with family and friends, maybe even an inspiration or an ideal. Those things are gone now. Here is the corpse left behind, which we can parade around for our entertainment, and wax philosophical.”</p>
<p>The specific reasons for focusing our gaze on those “corpses” reveal the complicated sociopolitics of ruination.  <a href="http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/20/dillon.php">Brian Dillon</a> argues that late-18<sup>th</sup> century Romanticism turned the mutilated remains of classical artworks or the fragments of buildings to a “randomly chosen instant,” celebrating decay and the ruined fragment but resisting a unified narrative.  This perspective would seem well-suited to many urban explorers fascinated by material details and idiosyncratic experiences in abandoned spaces, and their fascination with preserving the moment is reflected in the recurrently invoked “code of honour” to “take only pictures, leave only footprints.” That code aspires to freeze the moment of abandonment, merging the abandoned ruin with nature and leaving it to “natural” decaying processes.</p>
<p>Yet many observers approach abandonment as an exposition of the “ruins of modernity,” casting ruination scholarship as fascination with the “corpse” of a history we believed to be resistant to transience if not permanent.  This is a perspective that risks romanticizing stability, even if at least obliquely reflecting a simultaneous discomfort with modernity’s lust for “progress.”  In 1911 <a href="http://www.allyouknowistrue.net/download/Isaiah/simmelruin.pdf">Georg Simmel argued </a> that ruination is inevitable, and he suggested that ruins emphasize the folly of political and cultural permanence.  Julia King’s fascinating study <em><a href="http://utpress.org/bookdetail-2/?jobno=T01199&amp;authorsm=King,%20Julia%20A.">Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past</a></em> has examined how contemporary historic sites have constructed “ruins” to frame historical interpretations on otherwise blank landscapes.  Her assessment of such manufactured ruins in Southern Maryland dissects the inelegant ideology of aestheticized historical ruins that borrow from 19<span style="vertical-align:super;">th</span>-century romanticization of ruins, seeking a permanence that inelegantly effaces the landscape of racism in places like Southern Maryland.  Such permanence is what Albert Speer aspired to ensure for the Third Reich in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruin_value">“theory of ruin value”</a>, which described architecture designed to decay gracefully and aesthetically.  In <a href="http://archive.org/details/Inside_the_Third_Reich_Albert_Speer">his 1970 memoirs</a>, Speer indicated that during a construction project the</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuremberg streetcar depot had to be removed. I passed by its remains after it had been blown up. The iron reinforcements protruded from concrete debris and had already begun to rust. One could easily visualize their further decay. This dreary sight led me to some thoughts which I later propounded to Hitler under the pretentious heading of `A Theory of Ruin Value.’  The idea was that buildings of modern construction were poorly suited to form that `bridge of tradition’ to future generations which Hitler was calling for.  It was hard to imagine that rusting heaps of rubble could communicate these heroic inspirations which Hitler admired in the monuments of the past.  By using special materials and by applying certain principles of statics, we should be able to build structures which even in a state of decay, after hundreds or (such were our reckonings) thousands of years would more or less resemble Roman models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this pronouncement coming from a Nazi, Speer voiced a common aspiration for architecture to provide a state a historical, ideological, and material presence long after its fall.  <a href="http://naomistead.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/stead_value_of_ruins_2003.pdf">Naomi Stead</a> cleverly argues that Speer’s caricature of the ahistorical ruin was a reaction against the relics around him that were obviously part of his social moment and testaments to its failures.  The distinction between most contemporary ruins and Speer’s idealized relics is that most of the abandoned factories, theaters, and asylums in our midst have a historical patina but are nevertheless clearly of a moment we recognize as “ours.”  Speer instead aimed to produce ruins that belied their age and merged with nature, casting these buildings as timelessly historical.</p>

<p>Matthew Christopher persistently uses the metaphor of “death” to describe his images of abandonment, arguing that “At its core, the photography of ruins is fundamentally about death. … the very basis for the entire genre is that the photographs are of abandoned&#8211;or dead&#8211;spaces.  … the key element is that what they once were created for is no longer.  Much in the same way, a host of chemical and biological processes continue in a corpse but it is still no longer considered living.”  This assessment of ruination art, exploration, and abandonment discourse focuses on the corpse of modernity retaken by nature, a gaze that can be reduced to romantic nostalgia (ironically, a central feature of modernist gaze), or it can view the ruin as an active entity that has a genuine politics revived by an aesthetic gaze.</p>
<p>This “death” underlies Christopher’s political argument that <a href="http://www.abandonedamerica.us/ruin-pornographer-part-ii">his images document not simply an abstract notion of abandonment and decay</a>; instead,</p>
<p>&#8220;Each one represents failure.  On a micro level, this is evidenced in the building itself and the failure of the owners to fund/maintain whatever it was established for.  On a macro level, it often applies to the community&#8217;s inability to support the business, and to an even greater extent can be indicative of lost industries and economic collapse on the county and state level. I would argue that the culmination of these failures shows a trend even greater (and more ominous), that of an overall social decline leading to the fall of an entire empire.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sober if not dystopian perspective views images as “a eulogy for the lost ways of life they represent, a statement of their emotional, spiritual, and metaphoric relevance to our everyday lives, and a sense of the visceral experience of entering a parallel universe of silence, rust, and peeling paint.”  These profoundly consequential tales of abandonment are counter-intuitively told with exceptionally prosaic spaces, but many artists of ruination and post-apocalyptism routinely depict the world’s most famous landmarks, with appearances from  <a href="http://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=97702">Big Ben</a>, <a href="http://englishrussia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/0_26ab8_2f0229f7_orig.jpg">Red Square</a>, <a href="http://mediamaster.deviantart.com/art/Rain-of-a-Thousand-Flames-147058305">Cristo Redentor</a>, the <a href="http://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=47821">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, the <a href="http://deadly-wanderer.deviantart.com/art/The-End-177001941">Eiffel Tower</a>, the <a href="http://etwoo.deviantart.com/art/Washington-DC-Pentagon-179690206">Pentagon</a>, <a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_02/barrierDM1403_800x424.jpg">Harrods</a>, and of course <a href="http://3mmi.deviantart.com/art/Facing-A-New-World-128910186">the Statue of Liberty</a>.  This casts ruination into the future and places us clearly within a material and historical landscape constantly in processes of decay and ruination.</p>
<p>Christopher invests his politics into his images but is counter-intuitively reluctant to assume the political meanings of the pictures.  Instead, he argues that “As is often the case, I have the question&#8211;not just an idle curiosity, but a big gaping hole where meaning is supposed to be&#8211;but not the answer. …  Why does the husk of the building photographed matter? Why does the moment this image captured matter? Why does it matter that you&#8217;re looking at it now and reading this?”  For Christopher those are open questions posed by images, and it remains for us to turn them into political and policy statements that address built preservation and illuminate the structural conditions that produce contemporary abandonment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Follow me, o reader, as we wander into one of the most bizarre landscapes this planet has to offer. This is a train cemetery located a few kilometers outside of Uyuni, a smallish city in the south of Bolivia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setting is wide open spaces, deep blue skies and clouds rolling in and out faster than wild horses, ever changing the colors and the contrasts. Young couples come here to find a little privacy away from peering eyes. Small groups of people play the most classic of games: hide and seek. Children of all ages clamber up, down, into and out of these hundreds of rusting locomotives and cars, many of which are well over 100 years old.</p>
