				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>joy </strong><em>n. </em>a feeling of great pleasure and happiness</p>
<p><a href="http://oedaday.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/joy/ravi-shankar-horizontal-gallery/" rel="attachment wp-att-339"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-339" alt="ravi-shankar-horizontal-gallery" src="http://oedaday.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/ravi-shankar-horizontal-gallery.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The word joy is inevitably being said more these days as it is the holiday season. &#8220;Joy to the world&#8221; yadda yadda yadda. I was thinking about joy today while eating lunch. I must have heard it on some Target commercial or perhaps on a sign somewhere. In my mind, joy has a more profound meaning than just &#8220;great pleasure.&#8221; I feel like I often feel happiness or, more often contentment, but joy seems somehow more pure and untainted. I think we all have moments of happiness in our lives, but our moments of joy are far, far fewer and yet more crystalized in our memories.</p>
<p>I think the OED may have fallen short in defining this word so broadly. I associate joy with childhood. It is happiness that knows no cynicism &#8211; pleasure in its purest form. When we are children, we find joy in simple things &#8211; like climbing trees or being tickled. The idyllic childhood has you feeling this happiness in an unfettered, unspoiled way. The longer your span of enjoying this joy &#8211; or untainted happiness &#8211; the happier your childhood. When we are young, we haven&#8217;t experienced a lot of evil yet &#8211; hopefully. We are naive. We aren&#8217;t looking around the corner for the catch or the ghost that spoils it all. It&#8217;s a lot like the way a child runs &#8211; with complete abandon &#8211; because they don&#8217;t know to expect fatigue or pain yet. The moment is singular and completely in the present.</p>
<p>When we grow older, we collect the moments when our joy was abbreviated, either by the course of nature or by other people. We become cynical, hardened, expecting our happiness to be short lived or false. We are far likelier to experience contentment &#8211; joy&#8217;s smug, adult counterpart. Contentment is what we settle for when we are adults because joy is so fleeting and hard to attain intentionally. In this day and age childhood has been expanded far into the twenties, but I don&#8217;t think that childhood joy endures. It morphs into a strange hipster irony &#8211; almost a reflection of joy &#8211; that mocks its existence because it&#8217;s easier to be cool and impress people than to get to the unattainable joy.</p>
<p>There are moments in my adulthood when I have experienced joy like I used to as a child. It was not on the day my son was born. Watching him fly out of my body into the arms of my doctor while my husband held my left leg and stared in horror is not what I would describe as joyous. It was a wonderful moment in some ways, but there was too much fear and surprise involved to call it joy. I most often find joy in music&#8230;and I&#8217;m not talking Beethoven or a Puccini opera&#8230;although those would work. I find joy in just listening to all sorts of music and just being there, in the moment&#8230;or sometimes singing in the car while Graham bops around. It could be Katy Perry or Metallica, there&#8217;s just something about music that brings on a moment of joy for me.</p>
<p>Today marks the passing of a great musician, Ravi Shankar, who I became familiar with when I was 19 years old. My father was very sick from radiation treatment for his brain tumor and I had a job working in a factory soldering circuit boards. I was supposed to be a freshman at Providence College but had to stay back a semester because my father&#8217;s health was so precarious, as was our financial situation. I used to go to the public library after work and check out CDs from the basement music department. I had heard sitar and raag in the Beatles music I sometimes listened to so one day I checked out a Ravi Shankar CD. I brought it home and listened to it over and over. There was something very relaxing and quietly joyful in the strings, something I really, really needed during that difficult time.</p>
<p>My father&#8217;s tumor was in the occipital lobe of his brain and he had lost a great deal of his eye sight when they removed the tumor and could no longer read books &#8211; which was one of the ways I am convinced that my father found joy. I remember sitting in our small living room listening to my CD on a set of headphones when my father asked to hear what I was listening to. So I played him the Ravi Shankar music that I was so fond of. I like to think that that moment was one of joy for my father &#8211; just existing in the music the way he used to escape in his books. We played it many times after that and it became our habit to listen to music in the same way we used to share books. There was something about the sound of the sitar that healed both of our pain. It was like listening to audible peace. The memory brings me joy whenever I hear those strings.</p>
<p>R.I.P Ravi Shankar</p>

<p>Twas the night before finals, when all through the house<br />
The computer was whirring, with the clicks of a mouse.<br />
The Eigen values were calculated and written with care,<br />
In hopes that my A+ soon would be there.</p>
<p>The <a class="zem_slink" title="Schrödinger equation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">TISE</a>&#8216;s were nestled, all snug in their function,<br />
Later the time dependent was added in junction.<br />
When writing operators, remember the hat,<br />
Or suffer the fate of <a class="zem_slink" title="Schrödinger's cat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Schrodinger&#8217;s cat</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty Principle, give <a class="zem_slink" title="Werner Heisenberg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Heisenberg</a> his due,<br />
<a class="zem_slink" title="Inequality (mathematics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_%28mathematics%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Greater than or equal to</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Planck constant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">h bar</a> over two.<br />
A hard working student with an excellent teacher,<br />
Makes acing the PGRE an attractive feature.</p>
<p>Angular momentum equal r cross p,<br />
Without <a class="zem_slink" title="Spherical coordinate system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">spherical coordinates</a>, an atrocity.<br />
Commutator [x, p] means x times p minus p times x,<br />
a canonical relations gives you h-bar complex.</p>
<p>Mechanics of quantum, and the vibrations,<br />
Give <a class="zem_slink" title="Quantum computer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Quantum Computing</a> and more applications.<br />
The giants before me gave quantum its birth,<br />
The proofs they came up with are of great worth.</p>
<p>I am amazed how the Schrodinger equations,<br />
come round and round with completing permutations.<br />
Fingers are numb and brain is so tired,<br />
Must keep going so Clark won&#8217;t get fired.</p>
<p>We love to learn the <a class="zem_slink" title="Quantum mechanics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">quantum theory</a>,<br />
But the convoluted algebra makes us all teary.<br />
DeBroglie says that lambda equals h over p,<br />
This elegant solution has filled me with glee.</p>
<p>Quantum proving mechanics gives me delight,<br />
I throw my hands up, exclaim &#8220;This is the life!&#8221;</p>

<p>A draft declaration from talks in Marrakech on the situation in Syria from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_Syria_Group" target="_blank">Friends of Syria</a> has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/world-powers-recognize-syrias-opposition-coalition-draft-084140301.html" target="_blank">recognised</a> <em>the opposition</em> as &#8216;the legitimate representative of the Syrian people&#8217;.  Which is nice for them, I guess.  Not so nice, one would presume, for the president of Syria, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad" target="_blank">Bashar Al-Assad</a> and his friends.  Syria <a href="http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Syria-FOREIGN-POLICY.html#b" target="_blank">has generally been</a> on the wrong side of US foreign policy, and even when the US has needed its support, for example in the lead up to the Invasion of Iraq in 2003, the extent to which it was willing to court Syrian support was arms length and defensive.  President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/world/middleeast/united-states-involvement-in-syria.html?hp" target="_blank">declaration of support</a> for the opposition coalition yesterday was not unexpected, and is likely to hasten the demise of the ruling family in Syria, which has been in place for over forty years.</p>
<p><span id="more-173"></span>It&#8217;s a funny language that&#8217;s used, though.  In essence, this is more of a negative statement about the legitimate government (i.e. Assad) than it is a positive statement about the pretenders.  France has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/07/france-funding-syrian-rebels" target="_blank">offering hard support</a> to those fighting the régime, while Russia may be creating the space necessary to stand down its support for Assad, not withstanding a <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/russia-criticizes-us-for-recognizing-syrian-opposition/1563252.html" target="_blank">public persistent support</a>.  The Assad government is legitimate (or at least has been legitimate in the past) because of its erstwhile monopoly on the use of force, international recognition through institutions such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and bilateral acknowledgement even in the management of hostile relationships, such as that with the US.  Domestically, the Syrian government had been taking steps in recent times to accede to popular demands for increased democratisation in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.  The <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/81771718/Qordoba-Translation-of-the-Syrian-Constitution-Modifications-15-2-2012" target="_blank">new constitution</a> was passed in February this year, in a much criticised plebiscite, but it has not been able to take hold give the upheaval in the country &#8211; cynics would argue that it was never going to be anything more than a bauble to throw at the critics in any case.  China, people would argue, has <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html" target="_blank">a constitution</a> with an exhaustive bill of rights, for all the good it does.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that should the opposition groups find some cohesion amongst the factions, tribes, and interests that drive them, and present some kind of unified front, then the pronouncement in Marrakech will afford them some prospect of power in post-Assad Syria.  There are almost certainly spooks and diplomats from the West scouring the ranks of the opposition for sound leaders, people with whom they can work, people who they can influence, and reason with.  There are efforts being made to cajole and coerce, to shape and to influence the machinations of the opposition, and to try and find some points of agreement, some common platform upon which a stable régime can be constructed.  <em>The West</em>, should such an infrastructure be forthcoming, will legitimise such a government once Assad has been deposed, and will bolster the position of the fledgling administration by ensuring financial and military support in order to suppress dissenting voices, in particular those of the old order.</p>
<p>That, in effect, delivers a legitimate government.  It is legitimate because it has control; it is legitimate because it is recognised; it is legitimate, because it is in the interests of those in the region, and those with interests in the region, to be legitimate.  As for the people of Syria themselves, the ruling elite will be protected by the process of legitimation.  They will bring with them the people who they represent, and apportion power and gold as appropriate to secure the bulk of support.  There remains a question beyond that, however.  Syria is a very large country, with over twenty million people in an area more than four times the size of Switzerland.  Bringing everyone along will be tough, and just as with the Ba&#8217;athists in post-Saddam Iraq, any small minority will in absolute terms remain potentially very large.  They will not be without support, especially if the new régime is seen as being a puppet of the US.</p>
<p>The question then remains whether the new government will be genuinely legitimate from the perspective of the people themselves.  The protection of fundamental human rights &#8211; and by that we&#8217;re talking very fundamental &#8211; security, access to food, shelter, water &#8211; will afford the government some cover.  Civil and political rights will be harder to guarantee, but in the absence of civil war, that is likely to be OK for a little while.  Regional and border relations will be important too &#8211; relations with Israel and Iran, two firebrands in the region, and with Egypt, will be telling.  The new government, legitimised by the international community, will need to build its legitimacy over time with the people.  And to torture some metaphors, it will take baby steps, while walking on eggshells.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My son is over two years old now, and aside from a very minor trim session (not a double-entendre), <a href="http://dadandburied.com/2012/03/28/sweeney-toddler/" title="Sweeney Toddler">he&#8217;s never had his hair cut</a>. His hair is quite long and very curly, and as a result, strangers occasionally mistake him for a girl. </p>
<p>The first ten times it happened, I was annoyed. But eventually it got me thinking:</p>
<p>Would my son make a good-looking girl? And how would my life be different if I had a daughter instead of a son?</p>
<p><span id="more-5439"></span></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is an unequivocal YES. He would be a beautiful little girl. He has perfect skin, gorgeous hair and absurdly long eyelashes. Pretty sure he&#8217;d be walking runways, if he were a she. <a href="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fry.jpg"><img src="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/fry.jpg?w=590" alt="Futurama, Simpsons, pretty boy, youngblood, gender, toddlers, nature, nurture, children, parenting, funny"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-5818" /></a></p>
<p>The second question is more complicated. I only have the one kid, so obviously I&#8217;ve only done the son thing. But even without having a daughter, I&#8217;m pretty sure the early stages of raising a girl aren&#8217;t all that different from the early stages of raising a boy. The first few months are a total wash (literally; you&#8217;ll be doing laundry NONSTOP for the first year, at least). Once the personality starts to emerge, it starts out pretty gender neutral and likely remains that way until about the year-and-a-half mark. That was when my son started doing more boy-centric stuff.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s barely over two and he&#8217;s just now really getting into cars and trains and playing catch and etc. But he also <a href="http://dadandburied.com/2012/08/31/overstuffed/" title="Overstuffed">loves his stuffed animals</a> and plays with my wife&#8217;s makeup brush and occasionally wraps things around his neck like a boa. So while he&#8217;s been gravitating towards more stereotypically male interests, there&#8217;s still a bit of overlap. Which is totally fine; he&#8217;s two! And my wife and I try not to stifle any instinct he may have, one way or the other. He&#8217;ll figure himself out, eventually, and we&#8217;re not going to stand in his way. After all, I&#8217;m at home all day <a href="http://dadandburied.com/2012/09/18/stay-at-home-cad/" title="Stay-at-home Cad">doing women&#8217;s work</a>, so what right do I have to limit his choices?</p>
<p><a href="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/kitchen.jpg"><img src="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/kitchen.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="kitchen, toys, toy kitchen, gender roles, sexuality, stereotypes, trucks, dolls, sons, daughters, boys, girls" width="224" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5812" /></a>So when he seemed to really enjoy a friend&#8217;s play kitchen, despite objections from some traditionalists in our circle, we got him one. And when he wants to play catch with his little football, we let him. Maybe he likes trucks and fire engines more than the average girl, but it also seems like he likes to dance more than the average boy. Parents seem to agree that boys are dirtier and more rambunctious, which may be true; my son is certainly a bit of a spaz these days. And he <em>is</em> usually pretty filthy. But he also HATES when his hands get dirty, whether it&#8217;s from eating or playing in the sand or picking his nose, and begs us to clean them off immediately. I&#8217;m not actually sure if that&#8217;s a gender-based thing or just common sense. Sticky hands are nasty!</p>
<p>The TV shows and music he likes are pretty gender neutral too, or so I assume. Every kid likes Elmo, right? And <em>Yo Gabba Gabba</em> is prety devoid of any gender signifiers, unless you want to have a discussion about the geometry of Moono. I do not. </p>
<p>I really feel like the only thing that would be significantly different about having a two-year-old daughter would be the clothes she would wear, and that wardrobe would be largely be under my wife&#8217;s control (and full of dresses and hats and sparkly things). I&#8217;d also guess that a little girl might be more into princesses than superheroes, but <a href="http://dadandburied.com/2012/06/07/just-one-of-the-guys-geeks/">that needn&#8217;t be the case</a>. To be honest, I&#8217;d make damn sure my daughter liked Superman, regardless of whether she liked Cinderella too. The same way my wife is going to make sure my son enjoys musicals, even though I&#8217;m pretty sure <em>Die Hard</em> will be his favorite movie. These things needn&#8217;t be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_5810" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/photo-2.jpg"><img src="http://dadandburied.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/photo-2.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="gender, hair, haircut, toddlers, parenting, parents, dads, boys, sons, girls, superheroes, sports" width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5810" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He&#8217;s mad, I tell you! MAD!</p></div>We really don&#8217;t care about our child&#8217;s gender; we just want it to be happy. If that means veering outside the lines of stupid, often arbitrary gender assignations, so be it. It&#8217;s not our job as parents to decide who our son will be; it&#8217;s our job to help him become the best version of that person he can. So he&#8217;ll get exposure to a whole world of interests, regardless of what gender they&#8217;re typically associated with, and then he&#8217;ll get to choose what he likes best, without judgment. Odds are it will be a mix of boy stuff <em>and</em> girl stuff. And if strangers want to keep mistaking him for a girl, that&#8217;s their problem. Hopefully we&#8217;ll instill in him enough self-confidence to be himself, regardless of what a still-largely-traditional world may think.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t go so far as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/28/daughter-raised-as-boy_n_2204575.html">denying his gender</a>, or pretending he&#8217;s something he&#8217;s not. We&#8217;ll let him decide for himself, somewhere down the line. But we will probably get him a haircut soon. He looks like a mad scientist when he wakes up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Oxford Dictionaries <a title="OUPblog: Oxford Dictionaries USA Word of the Year 2012: ‘to GIF’" href="http://blog.oup.com/2012/11/oxford-dictionaries-usa-word-of-the-year-2012-gif/">named</a> the acronym <a title="Wikipedia: GIF" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF"><em>GIF</em></a> (graphics interchange format) as their US word of the year (in its verb use), debates resurfaced over its correct pronunciation. The short answer is that both /gɪf/ and /dʒɪf/ are fine – you can say <em>GIF</em> with the hard <em>g</em> of <em>gift</em> or the soft <em>g</em> of <em>gin</em>. Or you can say the letters: “gee eye eff”.</p>
<p>Some people <a title="The GIF Pronunciation Page" href="http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/">insist</a> on soft-<em>g GIF</em>, as in “jif”. They say it’s “up to the creators”, and “jif” is what the format’s inventors indicated. But this presumes a non-existent authority: the creators don’t get to lay down a planet-wide law, nor does anyone on their behalf. Pronunciation develops through general agreement – it’s up to everyone who uses the term – and most people seem to prefer hard-<em>g</em> <em>GIF</em>.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://stancarey.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/how-do-you-pronounce-gif-does-it-matter/philosoraptor-meme-is-it-gif-or-gif/" rel="attachment wp-att-14082"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14082 alignleft" style="border:1px solid black;" alt="Philosoraptor meme - Is it 'gif' or 'gif'" src="http://stancarey.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/philosoraptor-meme-is-it-gif-or-gif.jpg?w=200&#038;h=200" width="200" height="200" /></a>Gi</em>- is inherently ambiguous, pronunciation-wise. We have hard-<em>g gift</em>, <em>gills</em>, <em>giddy</em>, <em>give</em> and <em>giggles</em>, soft-<em>g</em> <em>gin</em>, <em>giblets</em>, <em>Gilly</em>, <em>giant</em> and <em>gist</em>.* (There’s a Scandinavian flavour to the hard-<em>g</em> set.) So it’s not surprising the pronunciation of a new <em>gi-</em> term would split this way. But there aren’t many <em>gif-</em> words apart from <em>gift</em>, so it’s not surprising either that hard-<em>g GIF</em> predominates. The <em>g</em>&#8216;s origin in <em>graphics</em> is another factor in its favour.</p>
<p>But there’s no question both are acceptable: Oxford Dictionaries sanction both, as do Merriam-Webster and the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em>, each of them based on extensive data of what people say. There is more than one right way – there often is – and declaring otherwise doesn’t make it otherwise.</p>
<p>Soft-<em>g GIF</em> may gradually fade, or it may retain minor currency. A continued split would not be a problem. Millions of people pronounce <em>schedule</em> with a <em>sh</em>- sound; other millions go with<em> sk</em>-. Communication is roomy enough to contain such discrepancies, and if confusion arises people are smart and imaginative enough to figure it out. Though I can&#8217;t speak for <a title="Know Your Meme: Philosoraptor" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/philosoraptor">Philosoraptor</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sunnysideupwithbacon.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/december12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1532" alt="Image" src="http://sunnysideupwithbacon.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/december12.jpg?w=580" /></a></p>
<p>Up until a few minutes ago, I was one of those people who had to have a very special 12/12/12. It&#8217;s going to be the last day where the month, date and the last two digits of the year will be identical; obviously, it won&#8217;t ever happen again. So initially, I wanted that day to be extra special. I was just telling my friends the other day that we had to do <em>something </em>to &#8220;celebrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then earlier, I suddenly realized something. December 12, 2012 is just like any other day. <em>They all won&#8217;t ever happen again. </em></p>
<p>I think a lot of us get too caught up in petty little things like this. We use &#8220;special&#8221; things with &#8220;special&#8221; appearances as an excuse to treat everything else, well, un-specially. Why is it that on Valentine&#8217;s Day people show more affection toward one another than on any other days? Why is it that people are more grateful on Thanksgiving? Why are they kinder and more loving during the Christmas season?</p>
<p>The only leverage those days have over all the other days in the year is that they have a name, a title. Besides that, they&#8217;re all the same. Why can&#8217;t we just be kinder and more loving period? Why can&#8217;t we be as grateful as we are on Thanksgiving all throughout the year? Why can&#8217;t we simply show the same Valentine&#8217;s Day affection every day?</p>
<p>I know it doesn&#8217;t seem all that significant. But if you will look at a calendar, how many special days are there compared to all the non-special ones? That is literally hundreds of days when people might feel that being a kind person isn&#8217;t really someone they need to be [yet], that taking your husband or your wife for granted may not be okay but is still socially understandable, that taking a moment to appreciate everything you have will just distract you from school or work or Facebook.</p>
<p><i>That&#8217;s hundreds of days when we can be our best selves, when we can be a blessing to others, when we can do good&#8230; yet we choose not to because December 26 is not December 25. </i><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a homeless man when I walked out of a restaurant and gave him a few bucks. My friend looked at me questioningly so I told her, &#8220;It&#8217;s Christmas season.&#8221; Do you see? At the time, I was sure I was doing something nice. Now, I&#8217;m not so sure anymore. Now, I feel like I did that not out of the kindness of my heart, but out of this need I have to act on my idea of what the Christmas season should be like.</p>
<p>Look at it from the man&#8217;s point of view. <em>Does he really have to endure the whole year and wait until Christmas for someone to actually help him? </em>The same question goes for anyone else who isn&#8217;t in a good place in life. Because I think a lot of people, I have to say, myself included, would wait until Christmas to feel the need to help others.</p>
<p>Now is usually the time when someone will say things like, &#8216;Live every day like it&#8217;s your last&#8217; or &#8216;Every day should be like Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8217; or &#8216;Carpe diem.&#8217; But I won&#8217;t because one, it&#8217;s cliche and, therefore, has probably lost its desired effect on people, and; two, technically, I kind of already did when I mentioned them.</p>
<p>I will just say this instead: Always be nice. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<description><![CDATA[“I’m spiritual, not religious” I wish I had a back massage for every time I’ve heard this line. What gets me most is the presupposition it stems from, that “spiritual” is the assumed equivalent of “good” and “religious” is the assumed equivalent of &#8220;evil.&#8221; Who made up this language game? Honestly, who decided that “spiritual” [...]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=661&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
