				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ecclekticgh.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-20130318_141840_01.jpg"><img title="20130318_141840_0.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" alt="image" src="http://ecclekticgh.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-20130318_141840_01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;ve been oscillating between apathy and the kind of anger that makes my chest feel tight, that makes my voice tremble when I shout. Sometimes I&#8217;m despondent; the silver lining on Ghanaian clouds is the first flash of a lightning bolt, watch out for that, it&#8217;ll get ya. Sometimes I&#8217;m hopeful; it&#8217;s still better here (for me) than elsewhere (and I don&#8217;t mean the places with war and strife, I mean the UK and the US). Sometimes I pray. I&#8217;m Christian but I never understood why people prayed for their country till now. God gave us free will and a country runs on the amalgamation of that free will. So sure, I&#8217;d pray that <em>I</em> wouldn&#8217;t do something stupid with <em>my own</em> free will but praying for the country sounded like an infringement. If people chose to drive like maniacs, vote like lemmings and lead like pirates then far be it from God to stop them, right? That was then. This is now and what the fuck else am I supposed to do? I am so tired. I&#8217;m tired of thinking and analyzing, problem solving and solution hunting. I&#8217;m tired of talking, writing and typing onto screens that people can&#8217;t read or afford to read, whispering in front of my elders and screaming at the top of my lungs to anyone else who will listen. My God, I&#8217;m tired of talking. I&#8217;m tired of risking my life every single time I sit in a car, whether it&#8217;s moving or not. I&#8217;m tired of telling policemen I don&#8217;t have any money to give them (the state pays them to do a job that they&#8217;re not doing in the first place.)  I&#8217;m tired for the people on the street whose government couldn&#8217;t care less and who can&#8217;t get a couple of coins from passing cars because the police got to the car first. I&#8217;m tired of not having lights, water, internet or phone reception and I&#8217;m tired of listening to people complain about lights, water, and internet as if these problems just started when 90% of our country hasn&#8217;t had any of these things at all for the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Do you really think that a ten percent tithe and a couple of cedis to a handicapped person at a traffic light constitutes a social security net? Do you really think that spending three extra hours at your nine to five and then spending a fraction of your paycheck at a local market is enough to pick the country up? Do I think that if I write a book or a blog that only half the country can read and only a fraction of that half can understand I&#8217;m somehow helping?  Do we honestly believe that if we run this country just like those places where we got our fancy degrees everything&#8217;s gonna turn out alright? As if our only issue is an inability to emulate our &#8220;gods&#8221;. I ain&#8217;t mad atcha, though. A man could go insane in a country like this if he didn&#8217;t believe in fantasies like that.</p>
<p>They are fantasies, though. Lies too. Whether the liars knew it or not. &#8220;If you all just work for yourselves everybody will be better off&#8221;. No. They won&#8217;t. That&#8217;s not true here. Maybe they&#8217;re lying to themselves too. Maybe this recent slew of recessions is proof of that. Maybe it isn&#8217;t. But here, in this place, I know for a fact that that &#8220;selfish motivations for the greater good&#8221; line is just well researched manure. Out here that shit is just not gonna cut it. We are not them. We are so very different from them. This much I know: If everyone in this country woke up at dawn tomorrow and worked as hard as possible for eight hours a day, everyday for the next ten years and made all their economic decisions based on their own selfish needs we still wouldn&#8217;t have lights or water consistently or good roads or proper rule of law. Economics as we know it is based on behaviour and we do not behave the same way as them. So I&#8217;ll say it again. That shit. Is not. The way. </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe that we&#8217;re so different that we need to follow a fundamentally different economic model then believe this: Our government is so broken that all the basic assumptions of that economics are moot here. Not just this incarnation of the government, either. I&#8217;m talking about our government as an institution, as a concept. That government will fail us at every turn. That government has embraced every-man-for-himself at a level that would shame Bernie Madoff. Don&#8217;t get it twisted, people. If you want this country to be better tomorrow that it was today then nine times out of ten you&#8217;ll be fighting, begging, clawing and dragging our government kicking and screaming into that brighter future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of talking about the government. Selflessness as economic activity. That&#8217;s my bottom line. Acknowledging the part of us that isn&#8217;t inherently selfish. Even if at the beginning it&#8217;s only because you don&#8217;t want those &#8220;other people&#8221; banging on your gate and demanding your selflessness. Make no mistake this is still Africa and we don&#8217;t deal with inequality by going on camping trips in the big city.</p>
<p>One more thing. A lot of people think that we&#8217;re not that bad. &#8220;Some other country has power problems worse than ours&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8217;ve five free and fair elections in a row&#8221; so we&#8217;re good. But you know what? The day before Sierra Leone had their first civil war people were getting ready for a nationwide celebration. The day before Côte d&#8217;Ivoire had their first civil war people in Ghana were using Côte d&#8217;Ivoire as an example of where Ghana should be. Why, when I see the problems we face, would I pretend that it&#8217;s ok for now or focus on the fact that it could be worse? It&#8217;s not ok, and it could be so much better! To the people who are highlighting the good things about Ghana to a world that doesn&#8217;t  know how much we contribute, please keep keeping on. You keep doing that and I&#8217;ll do this. I&#8217;ve got nothing to prove to anybody. I see the dirt behind the shine out there. I know them and I know us and I choose to live here because this is where I see the potential. In spurts and fits and in slivers between the dross but I do see it. I&#8217;m still tired. Sometimes I just stop. I&#8217;m also hopeful, though. I guess that means that sometimes I get back up and keep going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Yesterday, with the sun warming my face and last night’s ice cream still cool in my belly, I decided to take my running sneakers out of hibernation and hit the streets for my first run of the new year. Although I exercise regularly, I only run outside in fair weather. With the temperature nearing 50 degrees, my brain was itching for the fresh air instead of the stale gym odors that I had been inhaling all winter.</span></p>
<p>So I layered up and set out; one foot in front of the other, trip trapping down my street. It had been while, but it felt good. I missed going on autopilot through my neighborhood, while losing myself in my head. What would I think about today? I wondered and considered my options.</p>
<p>Should I wallow over my father’s declining state? That could get me through miles.</p>
<p>Or, should I think of snappy comebacks to the friend who recently said, “Wow, it’s so great that you can just go out without doing anything to yourself. I could never do that.”</p>
<p>Oh, I got it! How bout….  “You’re right. You totally look better <em>with</em> makeup.”</p>
<p>Wait! No! Better… “Thanks. It’s true. You really need self-confidence to pull it off.”</p>
<p>Hmm.. I’ll get back to that.</p>
<p>There’s always the to-do list. First shower, then supermarket, dry cleaners, stop for Dunkin Donut’s coffee, pick up kid…</p>
<p>Wow, figuring out what I’m going to think about has gotten me through over a mile. Yay. I should probably think about what to wear to tomorrow night’s School Social. Certainly not pants like the lady who just walked past me. Really? Flesh colored leggings? I don’t know anyone who can pull that off. I almost want to follow her and let her know that unless she’s auditioning for ‘What Not To Wear’, they should never be worn again.</p>
<p>In my college sweatshirt, skull cap, striped gloves and yoga pants that make my thighs look too heavy, I have no business criticizing anyone, yet I have to fight the urge to share my feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s genetic. It would be something my grandma would have done. I can still remember her walking over to poor, unsuspecting strangers and saying things like, “Honey, no one’s going to tell you, but that lipstick color looks horrible on you.”</p>
<p>I always died a little, totally mortified, but now, decades later, it doesn’t seem like the worst idea. I mean, yeah, it can be seen as judgmental, but maybe it’s just being helpful. Maybe, sometimes we all need someone like that; a ‘truth teller’ in the form of a well-meaning stranger.</p>
<p>I mean who else would tell you these things? Certainly not your friends. No way will your friends tell you how fat you look in your jeans, or that –</p>
<p>Wow! The lady I just passed must be bathing in perfume.</p>
<p>What was I thinking? I might have blacked out there a moment. Oh, right, friends. They love you and don’t want to hurt your feelings. They can’t be completely honest.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the sweat has seeped into my brain, but I think this is a kick ass idea. I can open a school and train people on proper approach, having good ‘street-side’ manner, and of course, how to diffuse an offended person’s wrath. My people will be like secret agents. Employers will hire us to do an office walk-thru. Friends will hire us to say things they can’t say. It’s a public service. It’s genius!</p>
<p>I can’t believe it. I’m almost home. That was fantastic.</p>
<p>Wait, I just came up with the best comeback to my friend’s comment. Ready?</p>
<p>“You’re right. But you know, saying things like that is the reason a lot of people don’t like you.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Brutal Honesty. My grandma would have loved it. But would people actually appreciate the truth whispered to them by an unknown judge?</p>
<p>I don’t know, but i&#8217;ll have to think about it next time. I’ve just run out of steam.</p>

Image Source: <a href="http://old-chicago.tumblr.com/page/2" target="_blank">Old Chicago</a></p>
<p><em>Jes US, I’m gonna be stuck in this shit all NIGHT!</em> Ace Bennett pounded the steering wheel in frustration and junk-sickness as traffic slowed to nothing and Michigan Ave turned into a parking lot. He was supposed to meet Gumbo’s runner Two-Bit at the corner of Division and Milwaukee to pick up the goods. But right now it looked like he wasn’t going anywhere soon.</p>
<p><em>God DAMNit! It goddamn figures!</em> It was a blistering hot Chicago night, with storm clouds threatening to blow in off the lake. Ace had all the windows rolled down, and a thick fog of heat and humidity, exhaust fumes and static electricity settled into the car like a sopping blanket. Those storms were coming soon, and they would be fierce. He lit a Merit and turned on the radio, which was tuned to WGN 720. Paul Harvey, blathering on with the Rest of the Story.</p>
<p>Something felt off about this entire trip. Sometimes there is an intangible feeling of something being wrong, a vague feeling that the cosmos aren’t quite aligned and bad things will result. Ace had had this feeling before, and it always meant something unpleasant, like the sudden death of a relative or friend. And here it was again.</p>
<p>Two-Bit had a reputation around Division and Milwaukee as a tough enforcer with a hair-trigger temper. He did the grunt work for Gumbo: shaking down Loop bankers who were behind on the vig, breaking up the local tavern if the owner didn’t agree to pay protection, that kind of thing. Two-Bit’s boss Gumbo was known as The King of Division Street, and nothing moved in or out of Cabrini-Green, the most notorious housing project in Chicago, without his say-so. Drugs, guns, sex…Gumbo owned it all. And Ace had just ripped him off.  </p>
<p>Or so they said. After the last time Ace bought, Two-Bit tracked him down and said that he was ten bucks short on the deal. Ace didn’t think that was the case: why would he short-change a crazy street hood like Two-Bit? Besides, Two-Bit counted out the money rather quickly, and he didn’t say anything at the time. But knowing Two-Bit’s reputation, and having bought from him a few times, and having seen Gumbo himself once, he didn’t feel like making a federal case over ten bucks. Ace agreed to bring the missing ten-spot to the buy today. No big deal.</p>
<p>The sky overhead grew black with the coming storm and the tops of the Wrigley Building, Marina City and the Tribune Tower took on a silver glow as the light faded and the lightning picked up. Ace felt crazy paranoid, partly because he was coming down and partly because of the situation. He thought he saw Two-Bit at a phone booth way further up Michigan Ave, but it could have been anybody. He thought he saw Gumbo himself in a coffee shop on the Near North side of the river, but why would Gumbo be this far off his turf? Ace worked like crazy to bring back rational thought to his addled brain. He lit another Merit, rolled up the windows against the first drips of rain and turned up the radio. Paul Harvey gave way to highlights of the Cubs win over Philly that afternoon at Wrigley, with Jack Brickhouse’s call from WGN-TV.</p>
<p><em>Strike from Hooton, and the inning is over!&#8230;Whew, boy!&#8230;A drive by Bill Madlock!&#8230;What a catch by Rick Monday!&#8230;Hey-hey!</em></p>
<p>The first deafening clap of thunder hit. </p>
<p>“Hell of a game today, my man!”</p>
<p>Ace let out a yelp as he saw Gumbo sitting in the passenger seat. He felt something cold and hard under his right ear and realized it was a pistol held by Two-Bit in the back seat.</p>
<p>The rain pelted the roof of the car like thousands of marbles thrown full-blast on a concrete floor. The storm was almost directly overhead: less than a second between blinding bolts of lightning and the deafening claps of thunder.</p>
<p>Ace breathed deep through the greatest terror he had ever known. “H..hu..hi, guys” he said. “Fancy m-meeting you here.”</p>
<p>Gumbo did not look amused.</p>
<p>“My man Two-Bit say you rip him off,” he said. “That true?”</p>
<p>“N-n-no, Gumbo, I wouldn’t do t-th-thaa…”</p>
<p>“White boy lyin’, boss!” Two-Bit said, shoving the barrel harder against Ace’s ear.</p>
<p>“I sw—swe-swear, I didn’t mean to,” Ace said. “Swear! H-h-here, take all m-my money, here’s my wallet.”</p>
<p>Gumbo grabbed his wallet and shoved it in his pocket. Thunder cracked as the deluge continued and time slowed to an agonizing eternity.</p>
<p>“You didn’t <em>mean</em> to?” Gumbo said. “The fuck you mean you didn’t <em>mean</em> to? Two-Bit say you rip him off, you rip the man off! Don’t make a shit bit of diff’rence you didn’t <em>mean</em> to.” </p>
<p>Ace shook his head and started crying, the tears shimmering as the lightning flashed in the cloudburst. “I s-swe-swear, I wouldn’t. It was a mistake…”</p>
<p>“Ain’t no mistake, white motherfucker!” Two-Bit said. His rage was a palpable entity, like a bull waiting for the gate to open to start bucking.</p>
<p>“I s-s-SWEAR TO GOD!”</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Gumbo said, shaking his head sadly. “Sheeeeiiiiitttttt, now look what we have here. Fine, high class honky like yo’self reduced to this? Yo life ain’t nothin’ but Cubs games, spendin’ Daddy’s money at the mall an’ swimmin’ in all that fine Oak Park pussy, an’ you gotta come into the big city an’ rip off my poor oppressed man Two-Bit here? You ain’t got enough in life, you gotta take a hard-workin’ Neeegro like Two-Bit for ten motherfuckin’ dollar? That what you think of us?”</p>
<p>“G-gu-gumbo, I SWEAR I wouldn’t have…”</p>
<p>“Man, you jus’ ain’ got no respect, do you, white boy?” Two-Bit grabbed Ace around the neck and shoved the barrel in even harder against Ace’s ear. “Ought to show you a thing or two ‘bout what it mean when you <em>mean</em> to do something.”</p>
<p>“That it?” Gumbo said. “We need to teach you a thing or two about respect, white boy? We need to teach you what it mean when you <em>mean</em> to do something?”</p>
<p>Ace, paralyzed by fear, just shook his head sideways. Gumbo looked back at Two-Bit.</p>
<p>“Only way he learn, boss.” Two-Bit said.</p>
<p>Gumbo nodded. “Do it.”</p>
<p>Ace let out a blood-curdling scream as Two-Bit aimed the .44 at his lower body. As the last intense clap of thunder rolled, Two-Bit pulled off two shots. Ace slumped forward against the steering wheel as Gumbo and Two-Bit got out of the car, while the rain slacked off, and the deal was over.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is brought to you by the letter X better known as the <a title="List of X" href="http://listofx.wordpress.com">List of X</a>. To read more about guest posts, see step 6.</em></p>
<p>I have been reading WordPress blogs for months now, and I have noticed that certain types of blog posts are more common than others. So I thought I&#8217;d aggregate these most common blog posts into just one short post for your enjoyment. Alternatively, you can use this post as your blogging guide which will save your valuable time by providing you with the pre-written template blog posts that you can simply copy and paste into your blog.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kim_Kardashian_portrait_2009.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured " title="English: Kim Kardashian at the 2009 Tribeca Fi..." alt="English: Kim Kardashian at the 2009 Tribeca Fi..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Kim_Kardashian_portrait_2009.jpg/300px-Kim_Kardashian_portrait_2009.jpg" width="210" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I was planning to write a separate post about 10 most common blog photos, but this woman is in 9 out of 10 of them.</p></div>
<p><strong>1) Hello, World!</strong>  This blog will be a platform for my thoughts about me, myself, my thoughts about myself, and occasionally about _____, _____, what I think about this, and Kim Kardashian. I will write as often as I can, since I usually think daily about different things, I think. See, I’ve just thought again! I better start posting stuff right now!</p>
<p><strong>2) The Day Of Outrage:</strong>  I don&#8217;t normally get outraged about things, but ______ was outrageous! Did you see how outrageous that was! You didn&#8217;t? This is so outrageous that you haven&#8217;t seen it yet! You gotta check out just how outrageous this was! See! Told you! Wasn&#8217;t it outrageous? Please share your outrage in the comments section, because I’ll be outraged if you don&#8217;t!</p>
<p><strong>3) The Away Message:</strong>  I apologize, my dear readers, for leaving you without your daily fix of information about me, and temporarily abandoning my blog for almost three hours. I am really sorry that you had to put your life on hold because you did not know what&#8217;s going on with my life. But I was busy with things. It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have a life, you know? Haha. Honestly, I promise to write three times a day from now on. It&#8217;s not like I really have a life, you know? Haha.</p>
<p><strong>4) Search Terms Of Endearment:  </strong>I have to share the good news with you! I am on Google now! Yes, you can enter something in Google and it will find my blog! Isn&#8217;t it cool? And apparently, people enter completely random things and still find my blog! Check out this hilarious search term: ______. Isn&#8217;t it hilarious? And what about this: _________? Even more hilarious, right? And this: ___________. What&#8217;s up with that?? Hilarious. But you know, seriously, even though all these result are hilarious and all, but the search for &#8220;most totally amazing blog ever&#8221; doesn&#8217;t lead to my blog for some reason. I&#8217;m gonna have to call Google because I think there is a problem with their search.</p>
<p><strong>5) The Freshly Pressed Hangover</strong> (posted the morning after). Thank you everyone for such thoughtful comments! I have never seen so many thoughtful comments saying “Congrats on being Freshly Pressed” ever! It is so great to be Freshly Pressed! It&#8217;s like a total vindication of my life&#8217;s work! My blog got so many page views that my computer totally crashed! Well, I was actually jumping for joy, and my foot tripped over the wire and my computer actually crashed! But now that I am a famous blogger, I have bought a bigger and better computer to write bigger and better posts!</p>
<p><strong>6) The Guest Post:</strong> This amazing post is brought to you by the amazing blogger named ______ . He/she won&#8217;t be writing about me today, which is sad, but I get a day off from my blog, which is good. Please check out his/her work, he/she&#8217;s almost as amazing as me. But please read all my amazing posts first! You don’t actually have to read them if you don’t have time, but please click on them at least! Then come back tomorrow and read them! Or just “like’” them.</p>
<p><strong>7) Gems From The Junk Filter:</strong>  Check this out! I just found out that WordPress is blocking some of the comments on my blog! These people have been leaving the nicest comments like “this is an excellently wrote post”, or “I have learning so much from this site”, or “your qualification is for among the best blogs of the internet”. Why does WordPress block these comments??? Who are they, grammar Nazis or something???</p>
<p><strong>8) The Traffic Report:  </strong>Check out this picture. This is my page views stats. This looks just like Manhattan skyline, doesn&#8217;t it? I removed the numbers so you don&#8217;t get jealous. At least I was hoped you would get jealous but I wasn&#8217;t really sure you would, so I deleted the numbers just in case. And then here is the next month, and it now looks more like New Jersey skyline. And look, here is this month, and it looks just like Nebraska. At least I think it looks like Nebraska, because I flew over it once and from up there Nebraska looked completely flat and sad, just like my recent traffic. Where is my traffic? Why isn&#8217;t anyone reading my blog??? I hate Nebraska!!!</p>
<p><strong>9) My Amazing Cat:</strong>  My cat is totally amazing. It is so warm and fuzzy and smart. I wish my cat could write a post for my blog. I just know this post would have been so warm and fuzzy and smart that it&#8217;s gonna get Freshly Pressed instantly and I would get traffic again. I need traffic! Where is my traffic! Damn you cat! Write the post now!!! And make it warm and fuzzy and smart, damn it!!!</p>
<p><strong>10) The Trends I Am Seeing:</strong>  I have been reading blogs for months now, and I have noticed that some types of blog posts are more common than others, so I thought I would aggregate them for your enjoyment and make fun of all of them at once.  Check out the whole amazing post <a href="http://theofficialhowtoblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/how-to-write-a-blog-10-obligatory-blog-posts/">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As soon as I hopped out of the car I was greeted with the stench of burning pig hair, a smell I m very much accustomed to and it was all the evidence I needed to know that this was a big Custom Wok (traditional ceremony) I was about to witness. This was my first Lakotoromola.</p>
<p>As I followed the crowd I noticed a huge long table which was built about 2-3 meters above the ground, puzzled I looked thru the eye piece of my camera and zoomed in on the table, there neatly scattered on top were many pieces of pork, I lost count after 50, there was a lot of pork up there!</p>
<p>I gently pushed pass the crowd of people protecting my camera as I passed, I walked over to where a group of children gathered playfully shoving each other and squealing <i>“wee la bolo”</i> I recognised the word <em>bolo</em> meaning pig in the Nakanai language and I too became curious to their excitement and quietly approached them, trying to get a glimpse of what was going on. There I discovered the young men and women kneeling down cutting up the pigs. Every now and then the butchers would scold at the young children as one or two of them would try and pinch small pieces of pork for the nearby fire. Something I fondly remember doing once or twice as a child.</p>
<p>In the middle of the yard were 5 huge piles which consisted of mainly garden food such as <i>paragum (wild taro ) vudu ( bananas) nokos ( oil palm broom) </i> sugar cane , Kaukau (Sweet potatoes) and much more produce which were concealed in baskets woven out of coconut fronds. These piles were called <i>la Lolos.</i>  La Lolos were sort of offerings which the families of those being initiated were putting up and were to be claimed either by another family who has a first born who is yet to be initiated or given to a family as pay back of a pile they have claimed in the past as what they call “bekim dinau” to return the gesture.</p>
<p>I walked around scanning the crowd looking for the familiar sign of people grouping, there I knew something interesting was taking place. I watched in admiration as mothers dressed their children for the ceremony, day dreaming of when I too one day will be in their place, proudly presenting my daughter or son to the clan to claim their birth rights. Tears swelled up as I watched a grandmother herself teary eyed, place a bird of paradise headdress on her Bubus( grandchild’s) head.</p>
<p>My attention was soon drawn to the beat of the drums and singing of the <i>lapuns</i> (Elderly). There I found them all circling around 3 of the first born to be initiated. They were singing songs I didn’t understand but I knew that it had strong meaning, as I noticed some of the young men who don’t normally show emotion, because it is seen as a sign of weakness, bow their heads in respect.  The singing got louder and louder as everyone joined in and walked with the first born towards the “tumbuan”. One of the first born named Bobby was not only being initiated into the Lakotoromola but also the Tumbuan. Just about every clan in Papua New Guinea has a tumbuan which is a part of the secret male society. Bobby is now seen as a member of that, he can take part in other tradition ceremony’s involving the tumbuan which in the Nakanai Custom happens during the <i>Galip</i> (Edible Nut native to PNG) Season.</p>
<p>As we approached the tumbuan I could feel the importance of the whole ceremony. An old man grabbed hold of my arm and lead me to a bench made out of bamboo “kalap go antap”  get up he told me “ lukim na kisim piksa blo dispel, u nonap lukim wanpla bigpla custom olsem ken”  witness and take photos of this because you will not see another custom as big as this again. I didn’t hesitate all thoughts about the stability of the bamboo bench which looked like it had seen much better days was erased from my mind, everyone’s so drawn in by the singing, I doubt if I fell they would notice anyway i thought to myself.</p>
<p>Bobby was lead up to the tumbuan and placed inside. The men lifted it of the ground as the crowd cheered and sang even louder. The women hurled clothes, lollies and coins in to the air. I didn’t dare lift my camera for a shot, vividly imagining the coins as pieces of shrapnel flying towards my lense as children scurried down near my feet looking for lollies. I followed behind the crowd as they sang, laughed and cheered.  I was passed a 500ml plastic coke bottle, “<em>diring”</em> Drink, I didn’t hesitate taking 2 gulps before the sensation hit me&#8230;.Woahh that was some strong “<em>matuka”</em> home brew.</p>
<p>The crowd finally made its way towards the La Lolos and the first born’s were placed on their rightful piles. There they stood in the afternoon sun awaiting an elder named Maki to confirm who would claim their Lalolos, while the women threw their endless supplies of shrapnel, lollies and clothes in to the interested crowd. At one stage a bra landed on an old man who all of a sudden must have got a burst of energy and flung it frantically back, as the crowd roared with laughter.</p>
<p>As I stood back and observed the firstborns I wondered if the older ones understood the true meaning of the Lakotoromola.  Which back in the time of the Tumbunas (ancestors) it was only done when a girl came of age and when a boy was considered a man, there was probably a reason for that, maybe they knew that they were old enough to remember and pass on the custom to the next generation.  As of that day those first born’s initiated can cut their hair and bilas (dress up) as they like, they are allowed to travel to distant places and take part in the garamut and traditional singsing groups , if they were to do so before the Lakotoromola a pig would have been killed and a feast put on for the village.</p>
<p>I wondered how much Traditions and customs have changed since the time of the tumbuna and at that moment I realised and feared even more how much it will change in the future. I hope that these young ones remember and continue this Custom, as one day they will have to pass it on to  their children and grand children.</p>

<p><strong>We should all operate outside of our comfort zone every once in a while.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not much of meat eater. And while I <em>do</em> eat meat, I absolutely do not like to think about where it comes from.</p>
<p><strong>At all.</strong></p>
<p>So, a trip to Mercado San Juan, an exotic gastronomic meat market, with my friend was extremely ambitious for me. <a href="http://societeperrier.com/mexico-city/articles/el-mercado-de-san-juan-un-rincon-gourmet-en-el-corazon-de-la-ciudad/#.UUKjn6WjJFc" target="_blank">We had heard about the legendary Mercado San Juan</a>, but neither of us had ever been and we really wanted to go. Countless <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/01/market-tours-mercado-san-juan-in-mexico-city.html" target="_blank">food bloggers rave</a> about the market and foreign foodies visit DF just to view the assortment of hard-to-find, highly coveted items.</p>
<p>Mercado San Juan is more than 120 years old. Built atop the land that the Aztecs used as a market for trading and located very close to the historic district of Mexico City, this market is actually not <em>one</em> but <em>two</em> medium-sized markets. While close in proximity to one another, the markets are roughly four or so city blocks apart, separated by a modest <a href="www.chedraui.com.mx" target="_blank">Chedraui</a>, a large chain grocery store.</p>
<p>We ended up spending almost six hours at the two markets. There was much to discover. Below, I&#8217;ve included some of the highlights. In another visit I promise to cover other vendors with different offerings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>For now, I&#8217;ll share cheese, coffee, fish and vegetable favorites.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong></strong>A day or two before we visited the market, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spmexico?fref=ts" target="_blank">Societe Perrier</a> posted an article on the mercado.  After reading the article, I immediately wrote and asked where we should go when visiting the market for the first time. The answer: <strong>La Jersey</strong>, a cheese shop. A bit more research revealed that La Jersey was extremely popular on the internet with other food bloggers as well. La Jersey specializes in imported cheese, has knowledgable cheese mongers and offers generous samples of cheese <em>with wine</em>.</p>
<p><strong>All cheese lovers like this.</strong></p>
<p>Per Perrier, we sought out the booth and spent two hours sampling cheese and drinking wine. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve eaten so many delicious cheeses or enjoyed such generous samples. The  cheesemonger was very knowledgable and paired cheeses very well. We ate so much wonderful cheese and stayed for so long, that we were unable to eat lunch afterwards. The lack of delicious cheese in DF made our long visit to La Jersey worth it. We were thrilled to discover some of our favorite cheeses and try some new ones too! La Jersey also had delicious prosciutto and sausages as well. Big thank you to Societe Perrier for the recommendation!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Coffee.</strong></span></p>
<p>When we visited Mercado San Juan, it was cold and raining. We took a break from the rain and sat at a bright orange coffee counter located toward the front of the market. Turns out, the counter we visited was a Mexican coffee brand from Veracruz called, &#8220;<strong>Triana&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p>The cafe was decorated with photos of famous chefs from all over the world. These chefs had visited the market and included the coffee shop on their cooking segments. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful.  He poured us two cups of his personal favorites and we enjoyed them both. The counter was clean and cheery&#8211;a welcome departure from the rain. As we sat there, other customers stopped by: chefs from embassies, a pair of Japanese tourists and a few other Americans. For some reason, they did not sell coffee beans at the store, which was a bummer because the coffee was delicious and it would be a nice present for myself or someone else. Still, I highly recommend the coffee counter for a shopping break.</p>
<div id="attachment_5858" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://amovingstory.com/2013/03/16/the-meat-market-mercado-san-juan-societe_mx/img_8714/" rel="attachment wp-att-5858"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5858" alt="His cerviche is incredible" src="http://amovingstory.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_8714.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">His cerviche is incredible</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Fish.</strong></span></p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing about sitting at the coffee counter and chatting with the barista, was quizzing him about his favorite vendors.  While chatting, he introduced us to his favorite fishmonger, who happened to walk past.</p>
<p>We later visited the fishmonger at his stand where he made us ceviche from scratch (had we known there was going to be so much eating, we never would have considered lunch!). <strong>The ceviche was delicious.</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s a favorite of Televisa executives and they often special order it. <strong>Pescaderia Eladio&#8217;s</strong> had beautiful red snapper, shrimp and a very tasty hot sauce. The booth is on the front corner of the market, if you decide to <strong>visit, booth 83.</strong> We&#8217;re having a party next month and all of the fish will be coming from Eladio&#8217;s.</p>
<div id="attachment_5860" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://amovingstory.com/2013/03/16/the-meat-market-mercado-san-juan-societe_mx/img_8705/" rel="attachment wp-att-5860"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5860" alt="She supplies the veggies to the Green Corner" src="http://amovingstory.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_8705.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">She supplies the veggies to the Green Corner</p></div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vegetables</span>.</strong></p>
<p>And, last but not least, I met a wonderful woman named Flor.  I noticed her booth because of the beautiful straw bags hanging from the top.  After selecting a bag, I took a look at her vegetables.</p>
<p>They were nothing short of perfection.</p>
<p>She explained that she has a farm outside of the city and that she grows organic vegetables. Her vegetables are carried at a popular organic grocery store, <a href="www.thegreencorner.org" target="_blank">the Green Corner</a>, and she also manages a small stand at Mercado San Juan.  She insisted that we try everything before we purchased it. Her confidence in her products was incredible. I thought her prices were fair and her products were high quality. I purchased a lot of fruits and vegetables from Flor, and one of her colorful straw bags for Manuela. If you decide to visit Flor, you can find her at <strong>booth 194</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5869" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 234px"><a href="http://amovingstory.com/2013/03/16/the-meat-market-mercado-san-juan-societe_mx/img_8691/" rel="attachment wp-att-5869"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5869" alt="Vendors showcase their products with pride!" src="http://amovingstory.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_8691.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" width="224" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vendors showcase their products with pride!</p></div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Epilogue</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Despite my personal reluctance to touch or eat any of the many meats on display, I was impressed by the quality. Every vendor we met was willing to stop what they were doing and discuss their products. From suggested cooking tips to sharing details about the farms the animals came from, I found every vendor informative and friendly. The people of this market take pride in the products they sell and love what they do. No one cared whether or not we purchased anything from them or not. They were happy to chat, proud to be asked about their products and to happy educate us.  Initially, we had planned to spend two hours at the market, but ended up leaving after <em>six</em>. We spent the bulk of our time sampling small bites and chatting with vendors. Unexpectedly, our visit quickly became a gastronomic adventure worth repeating.</p>
<p><strong>If you go, let me know.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Trigger warning: Proceed with caution.</em></p>
<p>The verdict is in for the two Steubenville teens that CNN seems to feel sorry for. Twitter is a mixture of rape apologists and people angry at said apologists. Facebook is probably still all cat pictures or shamrocks and Pinterest, I&#8217;m sure, is still largely flowers, baking, and projects even Martha Stewart wouldn&#8217;t try. At any rate, here are my two cents:<br />
<a href="http://nelizadrew.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-8084823206.jpg"><img title="8084823206.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" alt="image" src="http://nelizadrew.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-8084823206.jpg" /></a> </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past seven years listening to teen girls tell me or tell each other about being raped, molested, or assaulted. It&#8217;s so often a gateway to their criminal or drug activity. I&#8217;ve also heard too many times about their stripping, hooking, drug use, and older &#8220;boyfriends&#8221; who are sometimes encouraged to &#8220;date&#8221; them by their own mothers. This is not technically part of my job description. It falls into that category of being there for the students and trying to find out what&#8217;s keeping them from learning and just not interrupting them when they feel compelled to spill their guts instead of answering a multiple choice question. It&#8217;s reading their essays and poems. It&#8217;s being told in confidence the reason why they really need to graduate early or get a GED or drop out. Teenagers don&#8217;t always follow the lines we put in place about who to tell and who to talk to. It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all supposed to be on the lookout for signs of abuse. Why teachers have team meetings to discuss at-risk kids. Why we&#8217;re sent to professional development courses on dealing with such things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent about five years listening to teenage boys. Teenage boys rarely tell you what they&#8217;re going through. Not like girls. Sometimes, they&#8217;ll whisper about checking mom for track marks or that dad&#8217;s in jail again. Sometimes they&#8217;ll scoff about divorce or say they&#8217;re bringing home the money for moms (sic) or taking care of siblings. Some of them are rapists. Some of them are victims. Some of them are both. The culture we&#8217;ve created is as confusing for them as it is for the girls.</p>
<p>The girls will tell you about some &#8220;slut&#8221; who had her first kid at eleven or thirteen or fifteen. They&#8217;ll tell you their first kid was their rapist&#8217;s. They won&#8217;t make the connection. They&#8217;ll tell you the &#8220;slut&#8221; had her second kid a few years later with her boyfriend or at least on purpose. They might tell you the same thing about their second kid. They won&#8217;t make the connection. They haven&#8217;t read the stats. They haven&#8217;t seen the literature. They don&#8217;t know about the studies. Even if they&#8217;re following the pattern of sleeping around after their own assault, they still let our culture tell them the other girls who do the same thing are sinful or slutty or stupid. Which means, even if not consciously, it&#8217;s what they&#8217;re telling themselves.</p>
<p>Many of the boys will call any female human they see or interact with a &#8220;bitch&#8221; or a &#8220;ho.&#8221; Doubly so if she has sex with them &#8212; consensual or otherwise. Well-meaning instructors tell us they have poor boundaries and mommy issues and distrusts of males and all manner of excuses. What I see are kids largely raising themselves and each other who get much of their information on right and wrong from media sources like movies, video games, and songs. (They are not listening to Air Supply.) They&#8217;re fighting to be the macho kings their cultural touchstones promise them they can be &#8212; football stars and rappers and drug kingpins. They&#8217;re fighting to prove they aren&#8217;t &#8220;pussy&#8221; because to be soft or feminine is to be wrong.</p>
<p>The girls meanwhile fight for dominance in their own realm. In their world, they must be hard &#8212; able to punch and take one &#8212; and sexy &#8212; dressed to the nines in booty shorts with pounds of weave on their heads &#8212; or sporty and butch in sagging jeans and brand new Nikes with near-shaved heads. They&#8217;re flaunting or hiding the only parts of them the boys see. They don&#8217;t talk about big dreams. They talk about getting by. They talk about stripping or doing hair. They talk about selling drugs, but they don&#8217;t have illusions of making it to the top of the game like the boys. They just want to be able to buy enough Pampers. They watch cartoons and have sex with grown men because to be &#8220;childish&#8221; is to be sexy, but to be &#8220;juvenile&#8221; or soft is still wrong. They are equally confused.</p>
<p>The boys who rape aren&#8217;t all the same. Some, especially the younger ones with younger victims, still look like victims themselves. Most have been and they&#8217;re re-enacting or trying to make sense of what&#8217;s been done to them. They know they did something wrong, but they can&#8217;t always articulate it. Usually, they don&#8217;t &#8212; to their teacher anyway&#8211; but it&#8217;s on their faces. And it&#8217;ll follow them around just like it does the girls.  Some are more vocal, that females only exist to make them happy, to keep them satisfied. They talk of running trains and assaulting drunken girls as though it is their right. These are the ones our culture created (as opposed to the ones our pedophiles created). These are the ones the apologists stand up for. These are the ones we, as a culture, can stop. (And maybe if we stop enough of them, we&#8217;ll decrease the pedophiles while we&#8217;re at it.)</p>
<p>It comes down to this: No.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time our fathers and mothers and coaches and rappers and politicians admitted the word exists and it exists for boys, too.</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay, if she or he is drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay, if you bought dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay, if you&#8217;re famous or think you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay, if she or he is dressed in sexy clothes or dances provocatively.&#8221;</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay, if we&#8217;re on a date.&#8221;</p>
<p>No does not mean &#8220;okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, but it bears repeating, that most of the homophobic men I&#8217;ve met were homophobic because they were afraid gay men would treat them they way they treat women. I mention this because the same idea applies.</p>
<p>If you wouldn&#8217;t want a gay man/woman you find unattractive/monkey-wielding a pipe to penetrate your orifices (with a penis, a finger, or said pipe) because you did one too many tequila shots, don&#8217;t rape a woman who drank too much.</p>
<p>If you wouldn&#8217;t want a gay man/woman you find unattractive/monkey-wielding a pipe to penetrate your orifices (with a penis, a finger, or said pipe) because you agreed to go out (even casually or as friends) with said man/woman/monkey, don&#8217;t rape a woman who goes out with you.</p>
<p>If you wouldn&#8217;t want a gay man/woman you find unattractive/monkey-wielding a pipe to penetrate your orifices (with a penis, a finger, or said pipe) because he/she/it thinks he/she/it is famous, don&#8217;t rape a woman no matter how awesome you think you are.</p>
<p>If you wouldn&#8217;t want a gay man/woman you find unattractive/monkey-wielding a pipe to penetrate your orifices (with a penis, a finger, or said pipe) because wore a pair of shorts or flip flops or your swimsuit at the pool or took off your shirt to play ball or stepped outside in a tank top, don&#8217;t rape a woman no matter what the hell she&#8217;s wearing.</p>
<p>And if you <em>do</em> want gay men, women you find unattractive, or pipe-wielding monkeys to get it on with you, you should tell them as much and let them make their own decisions (well, except for the monkey&#8211;get help for that).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blogs about women were long. Real long.</p>
<p>For the sake of none of these women’s honest, heartfelt words and loving messages from their friends and family going unseen, I’m going to be posting each in a single blog every couple of days or so until I am able to finally get the teen session executed and up to share. So that you can take just five minutes and read one woman’s “story” and maybe find comfort in the way you can relate/understand/empathize/etc.</p>
<p>They will be in no particular order…drawing numbers 1-18.<br />
Tonight’s number: #6.</p>
<p>I give you Jamey.</p>
<p><a href="http://alanatphotography.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jameyblog.jpg"><img src="http://alanatphotography.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jameyblog.jpg?w=560&#038;h=383" alt="jameyblog" width="560" height="383" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-491" /></a><br />
<strong>jamey&#8217;s words ~<br />
</strong><br />
<b>“</b><b>I thought for a long while about this project and what it was asking of me. I felt that sharing my easy to admit insecurities (not pretty enough, not thin enough, not educated enough, boobs, butt, hair, etc.) didn&#8217;t quite live up to what I interpreted as the heart of the project. I decided I was going to be stupid and brave and try and admit my greatest insecurity. So I thought about it&#8230;and then I thought about it some more&#8230;and then I realized what it is. Then I argued with myself about whether or not it was honest enough. Whether or not I was phrasing it correctly. I decided there was little I could do to change the way it sounds so, here goes: I don&#8217;t believe anyone can love me. I believe I am unlovable. I can say that to you now in the letter, that part is easy&#8230;but the hard part comes when you ask me to explain it. If I have to explain it, then I have to consider why, how, I feel that way&#8230;and while I now know why I feel that way, (guh) explaining it just makes me feel bad.”</b></p>
<p>jamey&#8217;s friends and family:</p>
<p>“Jamey is one of the best women I know. She has so many wonderful qualities, it is very hard to name just a few, but here goes… Jamey Voorhees Carter Rivera is one of the most intelligent women I know. She could be anything in the world she wants to be, and, thankfully for her children, she has chosen to be the best mother I know. She is understanding, demanding, loving and nurturing, in her own Jamey way. She knows the pain of a difficult childhood, and has made sure that her three children had someone that loves them unconditionally. This is the greatest gift any parent can give her kids. I turn to her for advice for my own children.  Jamey is one of the most beautiful women, who I don’t believe is truly aware of her beauty. She has a style that I only wish I could pull off. Despite the fact that she has her own unique style, that style never takes over her natural beauty. She has such a beautiful face. I have to put a lot of my beauty on. She is lucky enough to look gorgeous just as she is.  Finally, Jamey is one of the strongest women I know. She has seen a lot in her years, but rather than wallow in self pity, or let it keep her from enjoying life, she learns and grows from life’s experiences. To be able to be philosophical about life’s shitty experiences is so important. I think she knows that the sum total of her life has made her the incredible woman she is today. I admire Jamey and all the wonderful qualities that she has. I am thankful and proud to call her my friend.” &#8211; laura</p>
<p>“Jamey is a fierce and loyal friend. She&#8217;s a lioness – generous, impulsive, and never backs down from a fight. She is tender to those she loves, inquisitive and hard working. Most of all, she is a devoted Mother, who always puts her children first, and whose happiness and well being are her reason to get up in the morning. She is a good wife, and incredibly beautiful. She turns hardship into challenge, and is constantly evolving. She is also a hothead, crazy *ss wacko, and I love her all the more for it, because without this, she would be insufferably perfect. I&#8217;d give her any organ I could spare, and maybe a few I could not. I am very lucky she is in my life.” &#8211; diana</p>
<p>“Ok, let&#8217;s see&#8230; words to describe Jamey&#8230; thorough &#8212; she&#8217;s a friend that, if you got lice from your asshole kids, would help you deal with it (since the boyfriend wouldn&#8217;t). haha.  Kind, an avid recycler, spontaneous, funny&#8211; (as in HAHA but also sarcastic haha), brave, strong&#8211; (she could take a man down and stands up for her family and those she cares about), smart (hell, she homeschools Ethan) a great decorator, (we&#8217;ve all seen her house), animal lover (from her urban farming to cats and dogs and what else resides in the house, haha), good listener (she&#8217;ll let you vent but also gives you pros and cons about irrational crazy thoughts), humble, a great cook (all those years watching Food Network paid off), fun (just typing that makes me laugh&#8230;she&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; hoot) in love (I’m surprised they get out of bed)&#8230;..” &#8211; jooley</p>
<p>“CONFIDENT, BEAUTIFUL, A GREAT MOTHER, AND SHE IS GREAT AT BURYING YOUR DECEASED PETS WHEN YOU JUST CAN&#8217;T FIND THE COURAGE&#8230;.” &#8211; sara</p>
<p>“Lets see&#8230;I have known Jamey since we were 6yrs old. She is right in that I can share a thing or 2 or 50!  Jamey is loyal. Even when years passed between times that we spoke, she has my back.  Jamey might be the smartest chick I know (person, really). And I&#8217;m not just speaking of intelligence, although she has an abundance of that!  Jamey is so funny&#8230;always. She has one of the best senses of humor of anyone I know&#8230;&amp; I know some funny people!  Jamey&#8217;s heart is bigger than her person. She cares deeply about everyone she meets (even those who may not deserve it). She cares deeply about causes too &#8211; environment, children, animals, human rights&#8230; Jamey is strong. She has gone through things that would break most people and she keeps going, almost stronger after each thing. I am amazed everyday by the person she&#8217;s become.  She is an awesome mother. She&#8217;s kind of my &#8220;mom&#8221; idol. When I have a mothering issue, I often find myself thinking, &#8220;what would Jamey do?&#8221; I know this project isn&#8217;t about outer beauty, but she has that in spades as well&#8230; I could go on &amp; on about how amazing she is, but I will probably start crying and then I won&#8217;t be able to type.” &#8211; paige</p>
<p>“Hi Alana,  I could write an essay about my beloved Jamey and never be able to describe her adequately. But here is the mixed bag of qualities that I admire about her. I think what makes them so great is that they are so contrasting. She isn&#8217;t one way&#8230;Majestic, Decisive, Brave, Direct, Unflinching, Commanding, Fierce, Nurturing, Resourceful, Persuasive, Authentic, Tender, Protective, Brilliant.” &#8211; jillian</p>
<p>“Hey Alana&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230;Jamey usually just makes fun of me&#8230;<br />
But seriously,  I think one of the best qualities of Jamey is her confidence. She is funny and sharp-witted. She is also a fantastic mother and very protective of her children.” &#8211; greg</p>
<p>“My wife sees a new world. She lives a new world. She spends every single day, at great personal, emotional risk to herself, living and feeling and loving as if the people she knows and loves are somehow better than we are; somehow kinder, and gentler, and funnier, and more caring, than we are, because that is how she is, and that is what it takes to evolve. Every breath is encouragement, to be better &#8211; to try and transcend. Jamey somehow manages to live in the big picture, seeing the past and considering the future, while living within each moment, and the macrocosmic power contained within each breath, each touch, each sound, each look. She lives and loves without a net, without hesitation, and with no expectation other than to be treated with the same love, the same hope, and the same promise she gives. Our kids, who &#8211; let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; get more from her than anyone else, are the best testimonial, as they are quickly growing to be even better &#8211; their kindness, tolerance, sensitivity and intellect are entirely their mothers fault.<br />
She&#8217;s also fucking hilarious &#8211; seriously, the funniest person I&#8217;ve ever known. Honestly, she&#8217;s so funny, she could be kind of a dick and I&#8217;d still think she was amazing. Bonus she&#8217;s not, right?” &#8211; ash</p>
<p>“Jamey… How would I describe her?  Charming, funny, bright, compassionate, a great mother, a good friend, diligent, hard working, thoughtful.” &#8211; rebecca</p>
<p>“Jamey Voorhees Carter Rivera is the kind of woman that deserves to have a four-name-long name. This chick is one of the absolute strongest women I know.  BUT, one of the things I especially love about her is that, while I rely on that strength of hers, she also lets those close to her see the other things that make her beautiful – her vulnerability and sensitivity.  The woman can cut a chicken’s head off, yell at the asshole down the street, and then come in and cry with me over the latest Parenthood.<br />
She is a friend to the death – incredibly and fiercely loyal – an ally that anyone would want on their side, while also being the secretly emotional woman you need that enveloping hug from that only she can give.  She is the friend that I know I can call on to attend a memorial for innocent children that we never knew, but feel their loss as if they were our own.  She is the one that will hold my hand at those times that I just need to FEEL.<br />
She is selflessly generous.<br />
She is a super devoted, loving, and protective mother (in the most balanced, perfect way).  One that I take many a lesson from in mommying, like how to be nurturing when it goes against your normal grain…<br />
She exudes love for her family and earns that love and respect back.<br />
She is super intelligent and very self-aware and aware of the world around her.  As dumb as the world can often be, she is not fazed.<br />
Have I said that she’s beautiful?  She is STUNNING.  The most fabulous tattoos, always the best hair, the best style (even when it’s a peacoat with yoga pants, she looks amazing), and just the way she carries herself – she exudes confidence.  People can’t help but stare at how gorgeous she is.  I think one of my favorite things to watch her do is to cover her mouth when she laughs, as her nose scrunches up all cute – I see this gorgeous woman transform into an adorable little girl for a minute.<br />
The chick is HILARIOUS.  I could go on for hours about this.  We have enjoyed many a night where we just end up in a heap of tears on her kitchen floor from laughing so hard.  There are probably pictures.  Indeed, there are pictures.  But they will never capture the actual extent of the hilarity.  For that, you must experience Jamey for yourself.  Everyone should be lucky enough to have that privilege.<br />
p.s. she&#8217;ll also watch The Cure dvd trilogy with me for many hours in one sitting&#8230;gotta love that!” &#8211; alana</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A long time ago, when I was very young, Jesus was my closest friend. I went to church every Sunday: first at Christ the King in Commack, New York, and later, after moving to California at the age of 10, Sacred Heart Church in dusty, then-rather-backwoods Turlock in the Central Valley.
