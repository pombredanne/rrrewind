				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">When my husband (Dean) was living, he had two loves:  Boy and his longhorns.  He got his first two bulls from a friend who maintains a herd of them here and one in Tennessee.  He&#8217;s the same eccentric, mountain-man friend of the <a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/muffler-morgue/">Muffler Morgue</a> post.  The two babies, whom Dean christened &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221;, were sickly little critters.  Dean had them delivered to our vet, Tom Moscatelli, who kept them for weeks while he nursed them back to health and turned them into steers.  Longhorns are &#8216;good-fer-nuthin&#8217; cattle who are kept nostalgically to look at, I suppose.  Tom and Jerry were not much to look at.  Dean built a corral and a fence around the back acres of our plant property for his new herd of two stringy little steers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/tom-and-jerry-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-5382"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5382" alt="Tom and Jerry" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tom-and-jerry.jpg?w=855&#038;h=806" width="855" height="806" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">He fed them the best food including <em>Bull Builder </em>that was supposed to transform them into mighty steers.  He sat for hours on his golf cart admiring them.  He kept them in the corral where they would be safe.  They were born in a herd at pasture and never approached by humans so they were a bit skittish.  Never mind.  He adored them and devoted considerable time toward their taming.  At that point in Dean&#8217;s career, Kelli and Jeremy had assumed the lion&#8217;s share of running the business leaving Dean the luxury to do as he pleased, and he did.   The steers were an integral part of that plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/dean-taming-jerry/" rel="attachment wp-att-5386"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5386" alt="Dean taming Jerry" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dean-taming-jerry.jpg?w=855&#038;h=671" width="855" height="671" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Each had his own feed bucket.  Sometimes they agreed to eat together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/tom-and-jerry-at-trough-eating/" rel="attachment wp-att-5403"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5403" alt="Tom and Jerry at trough eating" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tom-and-jerry-at-trough-eating.jpg?w=855&#038;h=584" width="855" height="584" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sometimes they argued about whose food looked better, and ended up squeezing their heads into the same bucket to eat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/food-argument/" rel="attachment wp-att-5388"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5388" alt="Food argument" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/food-argument1.jpg?w=855&#038;h=567" width="855" height="567" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tom was more reserved than Jerry.  When the boys saw Dean drive into the pasture in his golf cart, Jerry always came running to drink iced tea from the big cup that he knew Dean kept in a cup holder on the cart.  Dean said that Jerry would have climbed into the cart with him if he had been small enough to fit.  One day when I drove the cart into the pasture, a young Jerry came to investigate.  When he discovered that I had no iced tea, he lost interest and ambled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/jerry-at-golf-cart/" rel="attachment wp-att-5402"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5402" alt="Jerry at golf cart" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jerry-at-golf-cart.jpg?w=855&#038;h=567" width="855" height="567" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tom and Jerry grew into big, healthy steers.  But, Tom got his horns trapped in a round hay rack and in his struggle to free himself, he slid into the pond and drowned one weekend when nobody was at the plant to help him.  It was a sad time.  Nobody imagined that a commonly used hay rack could be a death trap.  Round bales of hay are a pretty, benign-looking sight in fields all over Texas.  These old bales sit abandoned near the corral.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/hay-bales/" rel="attachment wp-att-5393"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5393" alt="Hay Bales" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hay-bales.jpg?w=855&#038;h=566" width="855" height="566" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">When Tom and Jerry were older, Dean turned them out of the corral to eat grass and live like longhorns.  Two more babies arrived from their old herd.  Prissy Missy (left) and Fat Butt (right).  Fat Butt was not his original name, but when he grew into a gigantic bull with a huge set of horns and big, muscular haunches, Kelli renamed him.  Tom and Jerry were relegated to supervisory roles outside the corral.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/four-babies/" rel="attachment wp-att-5356"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5356" alt="Four Babies" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/four-babies.jpg?w=855&#038;h=592" width="855" height="592" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prissy Missy was calm and sweet from the beginning.  Fat Butt was just full of himself.  Here he is putting on his big-boy act for effect.  If anybody had said &#8220;boo&#8221;,  he would have high-tailed it out of there.  His was a convincing act, however, and won him a reputation as the bad boy of the little herd.  He seemed to know that he would be the sire of many sons if he established his dominance early on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/pawing-longhorn-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5358"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5358" alt="Pawing longhorn 1" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/pawing-longhorn-1.jpg?w=855&#038;h=676" width="855" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Eventually, Dean turned the new babies out to pasture with Tom and Jerry to learn how to be longhorns.  In this photo (taken by <a href="http://texasjcphotography.wordpress.com/">my son-in-law</a>) Tom and Jerry, who were still young steers themselves, were mentoring little Fat Butt.  I don&#8217;t have a photograph of Fat Butt as a full-grown bull.  He was a handsome fellow, and he was protective of the ladies in his own herd.  A rivalry arose between him and a Black Angus bull from the adjoining pasture.  Black Angus bulls are notorious agitators, and Fat Butt was itching for a fight.  Eventually, he&#8217;d had enough of the interloper, and simply broke through the fence and whipped up on the Black Angus something awful.  After three days of persuasion, the guys were able to corral him and load him in the trailer for the livestock sale.  I was sorry to see him leave us.  He was just too big and too rowdy for us to manage, and Dean was no longer there to intervene on his behalf.   I hoped he would have many ladies to court and many handsome sons in his new herd.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/longhorn-mentoring/" rel="attachment wp-att-5395"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5395" alt="Longhorn mentoring" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/longhorn-mentoring.jpg?w=823&#038;h=484" width="823" height="484" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prissy Missy grew into a sweet mama.  To date, she&#8217;s had three or four babies.  This is her latest offspring.  She looks a little tired and a bit thin.  Babies are notoriously greedy little critters for their milk.  One day, she will stop feeding this baby.  For now, he is glued to her side wherever she goes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/missy-prissy-and-baby/" rel="attachment wp-att-5345"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5345" alt="Missy Prissy and Baby" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/missy-prissy-and-baby.jpg?w=950&#038;h=678" width="950" height="678" /></a>Tinkerbell and her young son, Hershey Kisses, and another youngster, whose name I don&#8217;t know, came up from the pasture to see if anybody had brought sweet feed.  They didn&#8217;t join in, but  they stayed at a distance watching.  Tinkerbell is the daughter of Fat Butt and Prissy Missy.  I never knew her, but I remember that her birth was cause for celebration since she was Prissy Missy&#8217;s first baby.  Prissy was very young and there was some concern about her welfare, but she fared just fine and was a good mother from the start.  I suspect that the Interloper sired Hershey Kisses (on Tinkerbell&#8217;s right).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/curious/" rel="attachment wp-att-5363"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5363" alt="Curious" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/curious.jpg?w=855&#038;h=665" width="855" height="665" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dean would be happy to know that Jerry is still here watching over the herd.  He is a steer so none of the babies are his offspring.  I suppose he is the patriarch of the family, however, since he can claim original longhorn status.  On this day, he was happy to accommodate my camera as he chewed on his hay and watched Jeremy and Boy shoot targets beside him.  He&#8217;s accustomed to noise as are all of the longhorns.  A train roared along the track beside the pasture, and the boys were shooting a rifle.  The little herd seemed oblivious to the commotion.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/eating-hay/" rel="attachment wp-att-5398"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5398" alt="Eating Hay" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/eating-hay.jpg?w=855&#038;h=661" width="855" height="661" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I left the pasture, I looked back to find that a somber Jerry had followed me part of the way to my car.  He was staring at me as if to say, &#8220;I remember you, but where is Deano and his golf cart?&#8221;.  Or, more likely, he hoped I&#8217;d return with sweet feed.  Prissy Missy was still standing with the herd watching me as I left.  I don&#8217;t visit the longhorns often, but I have fond memories of these first members of the little family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pathways were lined by legions of slender towering cypress trees, dark green tips meeting the deep blue sky in stark contrast. The hedges, so neatly trimmed, sharp edges lining the gardens. Orange trees, with bright citrus orbs peeping out from so many green leaves. A magnificent view of the city showcasing tiny buildings lining the hillside. Opaque white fluffy clouds floating against a deep blue sky. Beautifully patterned stone paths greeted our feet. We wandered in and out of shaded gardens, relishing spots of direct sunlight, then slowly meandering on. At every turn there was a gentle trickle of water, making me suddenly feel calmer, more serene. We oohed and aahed at courtyards, at arches, at views. We stopped for long moments, staring at the views before us.</p>
<p>Our ticket for the main palace had a time stamped entry for 16:30. We got to the line at 16:15. There was no one in line, no other tourists in sight. We approached the ticket taker. &#8220;No. Not time.&#8221; We shrugged, then sat down on a bench nearby, basking in the sunshine. I was drifting into sleep when the others said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221; and we re-entered the line.</p>
<p>The palace, so unassuming on the outside, was magnificent on the inside. Glazed tile in deep blues, greens, and yellows lined the walls. Faded blue tile peeked up from the floor. Ceilings offered intricate wood carvings. Views of the city appeared through intricately carved windows. Fountains met us at every turn.</p>

<p>Each time we entered a new part of the palace we stopped in our tracks, amazed by the beauty before us. How did they make such incredible architecture? How did they carve such intricate designs? How did they coordinate work teams with no smart phones?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://undeaddad.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snow-shoveling.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-387" alt="snow-shoveling" src="http://undeaddad.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snow-shoveling.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>Some of you may have noticed that parts of the East Coast are getting a bit of snow today, as a blizzard is forecast to hit the Northeast.  As much as 30&#8243; of snow is expected and, unlike my neighbors, I&#8217;ve got my shovels ready.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before that my family inhabits the smallest house on the block, a tiny cape home overshadowed by the McMansions down the street.  It seems as though each of these mini-fortresses is served by an army of service industry people: house cleaners, landscapers, contractors, handy-men. They even have their groceries and dry cleaning delivered.  I have only seen one other person in a couple block radius mowing his or her own lawn in the summer, which I&#8217;m sure will launch another post come June.</p>
<p>The same is true for snow removal.  I always shovel out my own driveway.  I should say WE always do it, because my wife is always there with me, each of us starting at one end and meeting in the middle like a cold, suburban version of <em>Lady and the Tramp</em>.  Our son gets suited up and runs around making snow angels and occasionally pelting us with snowballs.  It&#8217;s hard work.  We sweat and get nasty.  But we also have fun, and finish up with a sense of pride and a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>As I get older, I realize that a lot of my pride is tied up in domestic labor.  Whether it&#8217;s good or bad I can&#8217;t tell, but somehow it speaks to my sense of manhood.  I like being the one outside working on the house to make life better for the family.  I like the idea that my son is watching me work hard, break a sweat, and get a job done.  I remember watching my own dad do it.  He seemed to know how to do everything.  He did all the mundane stuff like lawn mowing, snow shoveling, and landscaping, but he also built swing sets, tree houses, and even two additions to our house!  I remember watching him and being in awe.  I didn&#8217;t understand how he came to know all he did about electrical, plumbing, and carpentry, but I wanted to be that knowledgeable one day.  I wanted to be able to do what he could do.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so fixated on doing things around the house myself.  I want my son to see me out there working.  I want him to see that he can do things for himself one day.  That he can learn to take care of himself and his family.  I make attempts at joining him in that work, like when we built a tree house together with less that optimal results (see my previous <a title="post" href="http://undeaddad.com/2012/11/28/lets-build-a-treehouse-goddammit/" target="_blank">post</a>).  But I try anyways.  It might seem prideful, but there&#8217;s a part of me that wants my son to think I can do anything.</p>
<p>So, when I see other houses calling in the snow plows, I experience an odd mixture of pity and resentment.  Their kids don&#8217;t get to see their parents struggling to contend with the snow.  Don&#8217;t get to join in the fun and toil.  Don&#8217;t get to share in a well-deserved cup of hot chocolate.  There&#8217;s also a self-centered part of me that resents seeing the plows because I believe everyone should think the way that I do.  That they should all want to be outside doing things for their house on their own.  I&#8217;ve read posts by dads who praise hired help because it gives them more time with the kids.  I can respect that approach.  If I had back every hour spent cutting the lawn or shoveling snow, I might have used it to have more fun with my family.  And granted, my neighbors probably have a lot more time freed up to spend with their children.  That&#8217;s probably part of the resentment I feel as the flocks of snow plows or pick-ups head down my street.</p>
<p>But for me, I like doing it myself.  I like the sense of accomplishment, and I like the message it sends to my son. That each of us has a responsibility and a role in keeping the family going, in fixing what is broken, and in cleaning up our own messes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://quitealone.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dskempinski.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-868 alignright" alt="dskempinski" src="http://quitealone.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dskempinski.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" width="225" height="300" /></a>Last weekend I was invited to speak at <a href="http://destinationsshow.com/" target="_blank">Destinations</a>, an annual consumer-facing travel show in London. My subject was &#8220;Reshaping Middle East tourism&#8221; and, gratifyingly, if rather amazingly, something like 100 people came to listen – a vote of confidence in the idea of going on holiday to the Middle East, at a time when doom and gloom is widespread.</p>
<p>I talked about guidebooks, about how tours work and other things – but here is the bit where I tried to explain, for a general audience, what&#8217;s happening in the Middle East at the moment, and how both we, as consumers, and the travel industry as a whole could respond to it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">It&#8217;s mostly as I spoke it, polished up just a little. Note: I chose not to discuss </span>Israel, partly because it has its own tourism context focused on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visits_to_Friends_and_Relatives" target="_blank">VFR</a> and Christian pilgrimage, but mostly because it is generally well insulated from the effects of political upheavals elsewhere.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">&#8230;So how does all this relate to what&#8217;s going on in the Middle East at the moment – what&#8217;s been called the &#8216;Arab Spring&#8217;?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>First of all, the &#8216;Arab Spring&#8217; is a misnomer – implies a single revolutionary event – which, of course, the news media love – in fact the whole region is going through profound social and political change – a transformation, which will take years&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>What is it about? Day by day, in contrast to what news media might say, my sense is it&#8217;s not driven by democracy or human rights or equality, or any of those grand ideals. If I had to sum it up, it&#8217;s about ACCOUNTABILITY. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>People from Morocco to Tunisia to Egypt to Saudi Arabia to Bahrain to Oman have been ruled by leaders – sheikhs, presidents, monarchs – who are effectively unaccountable (not in every case: traditional systems of accountability do exist, but even they are creaking under pressure). </em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Large swathes of those people are increasingly fed up with it.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I was in Kuwait recently, where there have been large demonstrations by the political opposition and others, challenging the status quo – someone there clarified it for me – he said people are asking for CLEAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY. How boring is that? Not democracy, not equality, not all that grand stuff, but simply accountable regulation. People don&#8217;t want to be ruled by whim or decree anymore.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>That&#8217;s a revolution. It&#8217;s also an uprising against authority. But it is not a single, one-off event.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Building the kind of nation to replace the hideously invasive, militarised police state Egypt suffered under Mubarak, or the psychopathic repression inflicted on Syria by the Assad regime, or even the widespread corruption in Jordan, with a balanced constitution where the rule of law is respected, where accountable politicians debate, and where there is transparency in government allied with freedom of expression – that takes years. Generations.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>It is not one news story, after which everything goes back to &#8216;normal&#8217; – despite whatever <em>Egypt&#8217;s tourism minister might <a href="http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2013/02/05/43057/tv-overblows-cairo-unrest-says-egypts-tourism-minister.html" target="_blank">wishfully think</a>.</em></em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Down the tubes</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Here&#8217;s a thought. Tourism does very well under dictatorships. The global travel industry loves stability even more than the White House does. Tourism in Egypt boomed under Mubarak, when developments JUST GOT BUILT and when nobody asked too many questions (because if you did you could end up in the Nile wearing concrete underpants). Ben Ali, Tunisia&#8217;s tinpot dictator who was the first to fall, back in 2011, oversaw his country&#8217;s tourism industry develop from nothing, even while his police forces were pulling out people&#8217;s fingernails in the torture cells under Tunis.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Even Assad in Syria – I remember 2006 and 07, when there seemed to be a genuine window for reform – I wrote several <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/24/damascus.travelfoodanddrink" target="_blank">articles</a> on the tourism opportunities opening up in a freer Syria&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>This is not to condemn anybody in travel for complicity with dictatorship, passive or otherwise. <a href="http://newsfromsyria.com/2012/08/21/syria-the-bad-old-good-old-days/" target="_blank">None of us</a> foresaw the uprisings. Nobody did – not journalists, not analysts, not the people themselves.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>But now, today, instability means Middle East tourism – particularly in Egypt – is <a href="http://skift.com/2012/12/27/egypts-once-thriving-tourism-industry-makes-little-comeback-amidst-political-instability/" target="_blank">down the tubes</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>In Egypt in 2010, 15 million tourists brought in £7 billion in revenue.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>In 2012, tourism numbers dropped by 4 million – and revenue was cut by £2 billion.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>And that mostly happened during what was thought of as a period of recovery. That all ended on 22nd November last year, when the elected president granted himself <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84163.html" target="_blank">unlimited powers</a> to &#8220;protect the nation&#8221;, which brought hundreds of thousands of people back out onto the street in protest. That public anger at the unaccountability of power, and incompetence in government, remains at boiling point.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>As a consequence, in Luxor and Aswan hotel <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/0/63596/Business/0/Egyptian-tourism-sector-ravaged-by-political-unres.aspx" target="_blank">occupancy rates</a> are down at 5% – in Cairo 15% – even Sharm and other Red Sea resorts are only half full. That&#8217;s despite <a href="http://travelpicks.dailymail.co.uk/2013/01/red-sea-in-january-all-inclusive-from-375.html" target="_blank">crazy</a> loss-leading offers. Jordan, too, has got it <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/29/257660.html" target="_blank">in the neck</a>. Lebanon is <a href="http://outescapes.com/gaytripperblog/2013/01/50-days-for-50-off-in-beautiful-lebanon/" target="_blank">desperate</a>. Tunisia is <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/news-305918-arab-spring-aftermath-batters-mideast-tourism.html" target="_blank">struggling</a>. Bahrain is <a href="http://www.mybahrain.net/viewtravelnews.asp?ID=911" target="_blank">finished</a>. Only Dubai is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/us-mideast-tourism-idUSBRE9100UC20130201" target="_blank">booming</a>.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Normal no more</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Here&#8217;s a prediction. If &#8220;normal&#8221; is what the situation was in 2010 before the Arab uprisings began, then Middle East tourism will not be going &#8220;back to normal&#8221;. Ever.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">There&#8217;s a new pattern emerging.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>And new opportunities – which most of the travel industry is missing, because they&#8217;re too worried by the news headlines to notice.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>If you forget about &#8220;normal&#8221;, there&#8217;s a chance presenting itself to rebuild the KIND of tourism the Middle East can offer.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Sustainable.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Responsible.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Tourism with integrity.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Tourism where money and resources are channelled to the people of the host destination, rather than siphoned off by big-business cronies of the ruling elite – which is what was happening cheerfully under Mubarak in Egypt, Ben Ali in Tunisia and is still the case, in marginally different circumstances, in Dubai and the Gulf.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>My sense is – as in food, media and a dozen other areas of life – our taste for industrially produced tourism on a mass scale is fading. These days, we want better. At the moment the travel industry is failing us – it&#8217;s too slow, and too hidebound by fossilised business practices to react nimbly – but the economic clout it carries, especially in the countries of the Middle East, could be a key driver for tangible change in the region. The travel industry, if it could see what&#8217;s happening more clearly, could be prompting root-and-branch innovation in the host countries, driving social integration and helping erase inequalities, and could equally be inspiring new outlooks and new approaches to the Middle East within tourists&#8217; home countries.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>At the moment, it is doing neither, because it&#8217;s focused on the 2010 way of doing things. Meanwhile, the Middle East has irrevocably, fundamentally and permanently changed.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Bucking the trend</em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Funnily enough, Jordan – or, rather, Jordanians, since it&#8217;s almost always the private sector driving change, not the government – are already bucking the trend.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Jordanians in travel have been busy the last couple of years reinventing their country away from the standard model of cultural-historical big bus tourism, led by the big players, and into a more niche outlook of adventure-style responsible tourism, down at the grassroots.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>There are lots of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/travellers-guide-jordan-8298360.html" target="_blank">examples</a>. Up in the north is the region&#8217;s first-ever community-owned, community-run tourism initiative, the <a href="http://www.abrahampath.org/jordan.php" target="_blank">Al Ayoun Trail</a>, where three untouristed hill villages are working together to develop a walking trail, country lodging, homestays and rural enterprises. In the south is <a href="http://feynan.com/" target="_blank">Feynan</a>, a desert eco-hotel far off the road, where everything is sourced locally, from food to guides, and where there&#8217;s a sense that the business is genuinely part of the rural economy – there&#8217;s a cultural to-and-fro at Feynan that&#8217;s very hard to find elsewhere (and is the antithesis of similar experiences in the UAE and Oman). Many others in Jordan in similar vein – food, wine, adventure sports and more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.lebanontrail.org/" target="_blank">Lebanon Mountain Trail</a> <em>Lebanon now has homestays across the country </em>offering homespun <a href="http://rovinggastronome.com/mainblog/2012/09/04/summer-break-0-5-lebanon-mountain-trail/" target="_blank">lodging and food</a> – </em><em>you&#8217;ll also find <a href="http://www.soukeltayeb.com/" target="_blank">farmers&#8217; markets</a> in Beirut, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/video/2011/sep/30/lebanon-vineyards-bekaa-valley-video" target="_blank">vineyard tours</a>. Lebanon does rural tourism very well, but most of the media never cover it – they just do the standard Beirut nightlife stories, fawning over swanky hotels and that absurd high-roller lifestyle&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><a href="http://quitealone.com/2012/03/30/independent-travel-in-palestine/" target="_blank">Palestine</a> is a fabulous holiday destination – almost completely untainted by that big-business tourism ethic – from north to south you can be staying with families, exploring city souks and tiny centuries-old stone villages, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/sep/04/palestine-walking-middle-east" target="_blank">walking</a> in the hills, or visiting world-class cultural sites. Palestine is a cracking place to spend time, safe, charming, endlessly fascinating – but I challenge you to find one company at this show [Destinations] that could sell you a touring holiday to Palestine.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Nobody knows about it.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Even the Gulf is experiencing something of the same turnaround – there are small tourism operators even in the big-glitz UAE – I kayaked off the coast of Abu Dhabi with <a href="http://noukhada.ae/" target="_blank">Noukhada</a> – in Dubai there are now rootsy, locally run <a href="http://www.fryingpanadventures.com/" target="_blank">food tours</a> of the city&#8217;s older, unvisited districts – and so on, including <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/travellers-guide-oman-8476622.html" target="_blank">Oman</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>There&#8217;s even some of this coming through in Egypt, with retreats and voluntourism-style working holidays <a href="http://www.makhad.org/" target="_blank">in Sinai</a>, for example.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>The old tourism will survive, for sure, for many years to come – but the terms of what is &#8216;normal&#8217; are shifting – it&#8217;s up to each country in the Middle East to plot a new and better path, and it&#8217;s up to us to reshape our idea of what the region is all about.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Instability. Opportunity. Speciality.</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>This year, next year, for several years to come, expect INSTABILITY. The Middle East is going through a prolonged revolutionary episode, driven by popular discontent. It will not be over quickly. Even when the killing stops, things won&#8217;t settle for years ahead. Work with – and around – the instability.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>OPPORTUNITY. Tourism matters hugely to this region. In almost every country it&#8217;s at or near the top of the list of contributors to GDP. Buying a package holiday includes protections, of course, but you pay for that with a series of mark-ups – and so do the ordinary people on the ground, who often see little or nothing of the money you spend to visit their country. Once, we didn&#8217;t know any better. But now we don&#8217;t need to rely on middlemen any longer. Use sources of knowledge – guidebooks, internet searches, social media – to connect with local providers where you want to go. The region&#8217;s changes are an opportunity to reshape how we visit these places. Book direct. Take local advice. Don&#8217;t rush. See more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Instead of a bog-standard tour, go for the SPECIALITY option. If you&#8217;ve been to Jordan already to see Petra and the ruins, go back to stay with a family, or learn how to cook stuffed vine-leaves, or do some country cycling – get to know the place on YOUR terms, not how a London-based tour company wants you to see it.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Change is good</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Hospitality is a key aspect of Arab culture – people are fantastically welcoming – but because of the way tourism has developed in all these countries, as a state-directed driver of the national economy, and because of the cultural imperatives dictating the formality of the relationship between guest and host, all these countries have built tourist industries that essentially keep tourists away from locals.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>That, at last, is changing. We need to change with it.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0824-002.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0824-002" alt="IMG_0824-002" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0824-002_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=460" width="640" height="460" border="0" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666666;">The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all but essential travel to Iraq given the security situation. Travel within Iraq remains dangerous. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning dated January 19, 2012, to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns for U.S. citizens in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence. The United States completed its withdrawal of military forces from Iraq as of December 31, 2011. The ability of the Embassy to respond to situations where U.S. citizens face difficulty, including arrests, is extremely limited.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>If you follow the international news you’ll know that Iraq is still being torn apart by sectarian violence more than a year after the US Army and its allies pulled out of the country. The coalition forces have brought some kind of democracy to the place but they failed to put an end to the mass slaughter which is indiscriminately laying waste to the population. The Angel of Death works overtime in this land, visiting pain on household after household. And a spirit of enmity continues to divide religious sects and ethnic groups. Unsurprisingly emotions are strongest in the oil-rich areas.</p>
<p>That being said I can say with hand on heart that the Kurdish-majority northern part of Iraq felt to me as safe as anywhere else I’ve been. Several times I roamed freely on my own without feeling threatened at all. In all honesty I have felt more at risk in parts of New York or London than I did in downtown Sulaymaniyah. When I walked in the bazaar the locals barely paid any attention to me even though I was the only white face in the crowd. And when they did interact with me they were invariably charming and friendly.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am a little reckless. Or just stupid. My friend Ciprian, who has been living there for around three months now, was more nervous about me going out on my own than I was. He advised me not to take taxis on my own, fearing I’d be an easy target for kidnappers. One time I told him I was going outside to take some photos but when he saw me fish my brand new Canon EOS 550D out of my bag an ashen look came over him. ‘I don’t think that’s a good idea,’ he said, ‘it’ll attract too much attention.’ Nonetheless I ventured into the thronging bazaar shooting away with my DSLR and all I got by way of a reaction was a friendly salute from this kid.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0799.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0799" alt="IMG_0799" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0799_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=435" width="640" height="435" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>However, I do not wish to deny the disturbances which do sometimes take place in Sulaymaniyah. In March of last year an American teacher was shot dead in front of his class by one of his students. The reason for his horrific fate may be that he was an outspoken Christian. At an international church which congregates in a rented room of a shopping mall I spoke to several people who knew him. They all agreed that this teacher had been too forward in his attempts to evangelise the Kurdish people, who are predominantly Muslim. The student who shot him had not responded well to having his worldview challenged. Exposure to Christian teaching left him confused – some days he embraced it eagerly, other days he reacted angrily to it.</p>
<p>There was also a consensus in the international church that the American teacher had been an extremely kind-hearted and approachable individual. Even Kak Amanj knew him and claimed that he was a close friend.</p>
<p>Such shootings are relatively rare in Sulaymaniyah. But, as I said in my previous <a href="http://samnorthcote.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/the-other-iraq-part-1">post</a>, political demonstrations are common and sometimes things can get ugly. If you want to read about some of these protests from the perspective of a Kurdish blogger who has been under fire from the government’s riot squads I recommend you check out <a href="http://themovingsilent.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/sulaymaniyah-iraqi-kurdistan-they-killed-the-protesters-they-killed-the-people/">The Moving Silent</a>.</p>
<p>I had arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan at around 5am on Saturday, the 12th of January 2013. And after a bumpy ride from the airport in Kak Amanj’s battered car we arrived at Ciprian’s dorm. His living conditions are Spartan, like a cell in a hermitage or something. A stripped-down type of life. There is no inbuilt heating and Ciprian hates the smell of the bulky kerosene heaters which are normally used to heat interiors in Sulaymaniyah, not to mention the twofold danger of fire and carbon-monoxide poisoning which they pose. So he instead uses a small electric fan-heater. The only problem with that is the power-cuts which happen several times daily. You see, Sulaymaniyah’s power-grid was not built to handle modern-day levels of electricity consumption. As wealth grows in the city more and more people can afford to run air-conditioning and other power-hungry appliances and the electrical system can’t cope. Most businesses have back-up generators, and their insistent humming is part of the sonic background of the city. Some shrewd entrepreneurs have bought large generators and earn a tidy profit from providing back-up power to residential neighbourhoods for a fee.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0769.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0769" alt="IMG_0769" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0769_thumb.jpg?w=639&#038;h=431" width="639" height="431" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Ciprian says he can handle the primitive conditions of the dorm. Having spent his childhood in communist-era Romania when food and other basic necessities were in short supply he is familiar with extreme deprivation. But one thing he can’t stand is the cold. Even with the electric heater on he goes to bed nearly fully clothed and still complains that he’s not warm enough. It doesn’t help that his balcony door doesn’t close properly and is only secured with an elastic band tied to the bunk-bed. One night there was a sandstorm raging outside and this door was constantly being yanked open by the fierce wind. Funnily enough I didn’t feel cold at all in the room. I guess all those bitter winters I spent in Beijing count for something.</p>
<p>Ciprian’s neighbour, a slightly eccentric maths teacher called Kak Salim, was pleased to see his Romanian friend. ‘I thought you were never coming back!’ he exclaimed. (Ciprian had been traveling around Europe for a month or so, visiting his scattered family and doing musical performances). Kak Salim welcomed us with a plateful of dried figs, raisins and assorted nuts which had apparently come from Iran. Then he went back to his room to Skype his fiancée.</p>
<p>We also met the guy who was Ciprian’s roommate when he first arrived in the dorm, before he moved into a room of his own. I don’t recall his name but he was a Catholic from Mosul, a city about four hours drive north of Sulaymaniyah. Mosul is said to be a hub of al-Qaeda activity and is regularly buffeted by violence. The city’s Christians in particular are being forced out by targeted attacks. Just three days before I arrived in the country a Chaldean Christian teacher had her throat cut in Mosul and the following day a car bomb claimed the life of a Christian final-year medical student.</p>
<p>Ciprian’s ex-roommate is doing a PhD in family medicine. The ongoing violence in Mosul made it impossible for him to complete his course there. So, to pursue an uninterrupted education and to escape the brutal attacks on Christians in his hometown, he moved to the comparatively peaceful Sulaymaniyah where, amazingly, schools were only stopped once during the Iraq War. He is now in his final year of study and when he finishes he will apply for refugee status and move to the USA. His sisters are already living over there.</p>
<p>The three of us sat down to a simple breakfast in Ciprian’s room – freshly baked naan, cream cheese, jam, a salty yoghurt drink called <em>ayran</em>, and mandarins.</p>
<p>Then we hit the bazaar – Ciprian and myself – to drink sweet cardamom tea and buy a guitar. I would frequent the bazaar in the coming days after developing a strong attachment to the sweet tea, savouring its delectable comfort on cold mornings. The teashop owners for the most part were exceptionally friendly and sometimes would refuse to accept payment from us for the tea.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0550.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0550" alt="IMG_0550" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0550_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=435" width="640" height="435" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0562.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0562" alt="IMG_0562" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0562_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=434" width="640" height="434" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As I already said I never once felt in danger when walking around the bazaar. Strangely I didn’t even feel out of place there. Although I was the only white person around I was barely conscious of my foreignness. People mostly paid me no attention. I was not overwhelmed by hawkers or dogged by pickpockets. I was not trailed by beggars. And the shopkeepers didn’t try to exploit my lack of local knowledge by charging me over the odds for things.</p>
<p>One time when I was looking for my sweet-tea fix a shop-owner hailed me over and struck up conversation with me. ‘Sprechen sie deutsche?’ he enquired.</p>
<p>I told him I couldn’t speak German.</p>
<p>‘Kurdi?’</p>
<p>I shook my head: ‘Inglise.’</p>
<p>‘Pity, my English is not so good.’</p>
<p>But his English was good enough for basic conversation. He told me he lived in Nuremburg, Germany as a refugee for about a decade. I asked him if he liked it there. He shook his head. ‘Too many racists.’</p>
<p>I experienced many variations of this conversation during my time in Iraqi Kurdistan. Pretty much everyone I met there had lived for some time in Europe or America. It’s only really since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the Baathist government that the Kurds have been able to feel safe in their homeland.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0806.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0806" alt="IMG_0806" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0806_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=433" width="640" height="433" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This caused me to re-examine my own views on the Iraq War. I have always been a pacifist and was staunchly opposed to the deployment of coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have long felt that foreign wars are a counter-productive way to combat terrorism. And yet I cannot deny that the US-led invasion of Iraq was, for the Kurdish people at least, a good thing insofar as it took Saddam out of the picture.</p>
<p>Saddam was a ruthless dictator who sought to impose Arabic culture on the Kurdish region of Iraq. When the Kurds resisted this process of ‘Arabization’ he implemented Operation Anfal, a long, bloody campaign to wipe them and their culture off the map. I will come back to Anfal in a later post but for now suffice to say that Kurdish life was cheap under this reign of terror. Hundreds of thousands were killed and many more displaced. But ever since American troops spearheaded the overthrow of Saddam and the Baathists the fortunes of the Kurdish people have changed dramatically. Their cities are, for the most part, thriving; their markets are buzzing with activity; their children play freely in the streets; their villages have been rebuilt; their culture and language is intact; and hope is alive and well.</p>
<p>Whatever ulterior motives the allied forces may have had for entering Iraq – and I’m still convinced oil was the main motivator rather than empathy for suffering civilians – I’m glad that their actions at least gave the Iraqi Kurds the chance to live at peace in their homeland.</p>

<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0811.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0811" alt="IMG_0811" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0811_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=431" width="640" height="431" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In the evening Ciprian and I went to the Saturday service at the international church. The congregation was small but several nationalities were represented. I spoke to a Swiss man who had come to Kurdistan with his family to do business and a Mexican businessman who had likewise come with his family. Because of the lack of international schools the children of these families were being home-schooled.</p>
<p>There was also a bunch of American girls in their early twenties. They had come to Kurdistan as volunteers with humanitarian organisations to teach English. They too said they feel perfectly safe walking around in Sulaymaniyah. One of them had started out teaching in a village out in the mountains surrounding the city.</p>
<p>There were only two Kurdish guys at the church. One – Kak Saber – gave me his business card and said he worked for the International Bible Society. He was also a freelance journalist for various Kurdish newspapers. The other was a softly-spoken young guy with long hair and a Michael Jackson T-shirt. His name was Kak Shorsh. He couldn’t speak much English but he was pleased to see Ciprian. I learned later that this guy had lost both of his parents. In fact there wasn’t much left of his family at all. I’m not sure what his day-job is but, according to Ciprian, he is a gifted preacher.</p>
<p>After church Kak Shorsh took a taxi with Ciprian and myself because he lives near the dorm. He could barely speak a word of English and Ciprian’s Kurdish is very limited so there wasn’t much verbal communication between us. But this Kak Shorsh radiated some kind of inner peace which baffled me. His family had been wiped out – decimated. But if he harboured any bitterness there was no sign of it.</p>
<p>Back at the dorm Kak Amanj invited me to eat popcorn with him. In no time he had a saucepan rattling on the stove in the communal kitchen. A guy from the Turkish part of Kurdistan came in and I greeted him with the Arabic phrase which is always used in Iraqi Kurdistan: ‘Salaam alaikum’ (peace be upon you). But he laughed and said ‘I&#8217;m not an Arab! Don’t speak Arabic to me, I hate it.’</p>
<p>The following day I would visit an old prison where the Baathists detained and tortured their political opponents. And later in the week I would talk to a class of high-school students and take the bus to the ancient city of Erbil which is crowned with an 8,000-year-old citadel.</p>

<p>More posts on Iraqi Kurdistan coming soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where I come from, lying is a sin only most of the time.</p>
<p>You can never lie to your parents, pastor, teacher or Scoutmaster. You are, however, allowed to stretch the truth when it comes to complimenting someone – especially a woman. In the South, we call those &#8216;white lies.&#8217; &#8216;White lies&#8217; work quite well when complimenting someone&#8217;s hair, clothing or blackberry cobbler – so long as you don&#8217;t get caught up in the web you&#8217;re weaving.</p>
<p>I was first busted in a &#8216;white lie&#8217; by none other than my wife, a Jersey girl who was unacquainted with Southern customs.</p>
<p><strong>The sauerbraten incident</strong><br />
It was some time in 1995, and we newlyweds were getting into the groove of going to Sunday dinner with her family. Though the meal and the company were always comfortable, I was elated to learn that my mother in-law this time would be preparing a legit festgelage — complete with kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes), rotkohl (red cabbage) and sauerbraten, a traditional Deutschland-style beef roast. I&#8217;m a German, through and through. But I&#8217;d never had the main dish prior to that meal.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s something reasonably simple – like eggplant parmesan – or painstakingly time-consuming – like sauerbraten – my wife&#8217;s mother is a cook. Period. Knowing her, she probably learned how to make an authentic sauerbraten from a German neighbor or family member. Instead of trying to make adjustments through the years (like most of us do), her efforts go into buying the best beef shoulder roast, and using exact measurements of allspice, gingerbread crumbs, red wine, and so on. The result is always a thing of beauty. And it&#8217;s absolutely delicious — if you like sauerbraten.</p>
<p>I learned – during the first bite – that sauerbraten is not my taste.</p>
<p>But, like any southern gentleman who is taught that lies told when complimenting someone don&#8217;t count against you, I chewed and swallowed, then took another bite.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Wow,&#8217; I told my mother in-law as she looked my way for a reaction. &#8216;This is really delicious sauerbraten. It&#8217;s really rich.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Thank you,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;I marinated it for three days.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can tell,&#8217; I said. &#8216;I can really taste the allspice. Nice.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>My new wife smiled. I could tell she was proud of her mom. She might have even been considering learning to make the dish, like her mother had done for her father. But, the conversation we had a couple of months later probably streichened those thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;I have a surprise for you,&#8217; my wife said. &#8216;You&#8217;re going to love it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Really? Are we going to Papaya Dog and to a Yankees game?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No, silly,&#8217; she responded. &#8216;My mom is making sauerbraten again, just for you!&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was in trouble. I couldn&#8217;t fake it twice. Besides, I&#8217;d just worked up a hankering for some cheap New York City hot dogs.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Look, Catherine … I don&#8217;t really like sauerbraten. So, please tell your mom I&#8217;m sick, or something.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What? Are you kidding me?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No. It&#8217;s just tha—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t believe you!&#8217; she shouted, cutting me off. &#8216;Mom works on this dish for days? You tell her how great it is? Now, all-of-a-sudden you don&#8217;t like sauerbraten? Do you lie just for the hell of it, Adam?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I wasn&#8217;t lying,&#8217; I said, in a feeble attempt to escape her wrath. &#8216;Your mom&#8217;s sauerbraten is fantastic … for sauerbraten.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the verbal beat-down continued, I learned that &#8216;white lies&#8217; in New Jersey are apparently just lies, and that the proper thing to do is to just flat-out tell someone you don&#8217;t like something. So, we went to Mom&#8217;s for a wonderful German dinner.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Let me tell you, Lillian, this sauerbraten is even better than the last one,&#8217; I said. &#8216;I really want to learn how to make this dish.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as my wife shot me various looks of disgust, I continued to pour it on. And eat more sauerbraten. I think she became an honorary Southern woman soon following that incident. And it&#8217;s not just because her hair became bigger, and lipstick much brighter. Her palate also seems to have dramatically changed.</p>
<p>Just about every dish that I&#8217;ve made and served since then has been her absolute favorite … ever.</p>

<hr />
<p>Mardi Gras in my part of the country is just part of life. Some people take it very seriously, and plan for months ahead their jaunt to New Orleans, while others (like myself) prefer to partake in the food and spirits from the comfort of our homes — or at least at a local themed fundraiser (and there are many). There is no wrong way to make gumbo, in my opinion, unless you omit okra. Though gumbo has roots all over the world, okra is the true namesake for this thickened soup. According to various horticultural historians, okra arrived in North America on slave ships from West Africa, where the pod was known as <em>ki ngombo</em> or <em>quingombo</em>. The other ingredients really depend on whether you are making the Cajun or Creole version, but any purist will also tell you that filé is also necessary to call it &#8216;gumbo.&#8217; My recipe combines the dark roux, seafood and spice of the Cajun version; and the savory tomatoes and other vegetables of the Creole dish.</p>
<div id="attachment_977" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://unorthodoxepicure.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/gumbo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-977" title="gumbo" alt="" src="http://unorthodoxepicure.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/gumbo.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This gumbo has all the traditional vegetables, but they are strained to produce a smoother broth. With this dish, you can fool people who don&#8217;t think they like Louisiana-style cooking. And that&#8217;s no &#8216;white lie.&#8217;</p></div>
<h2>Louisiana Gumbo</h2>
<p>2 – Tablespoons butter<br />
3 cloves – garlic, minced<br />
1 medium – onion, chopped<br />
3 – celery stalks, chopped<br />
1 lb. – okra, chopped<br />
½ cup – butter<br />
½ cup – all-purpose flour<br />
2 quarts – chicken or vegetable stock<br />
1 Tablespoon – sugar<br />
1 – 16 oz. can chopped tomatoes, with liquid<br />
1 Tablespoon – fresh parsley, chopped<br />
1 sprig – fresh thyme<br />
2 bay leaves<br />
½ teaspoon – ground cayenne pepper<br />
1 teaspoon – ground black pepper<br />
½ teaspoon – Louisiana-style hot pepper sauce<br />
⅛ cup – Worcestershire sauce<br />
Juice from ½ lemon<br />
Filé powder*</p>
<p>2 lbs. – Raw seafood (peeled &amp; deveined shrimp; scallops; flaked crab; oysters; clams; lobster chunks; etc.)<br />
1 lb – andouille sausage, cut into ½ inch pieces</p>
<p>Melt (2 TB) butter in large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic, onions, celery and okra until crisp tender, and browning around edges. Set aside.<br />
<strong> The Roux</strong><br />
In a large stock pot over medium-high heat, melt ( ½ cup) butter. Add flour. Stir constantly.<br />
When the roux is a rich, dark brown (milk-to-dark chocolate), add reserved vegetables and stir. Add stock and tomatoes. Stir well. Add dry seasonings: parsley, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, black pepper and thyme. Bring to a boil; reduce heat; and simmer for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.<br />
Through a wire mesh sieve (into a large pan), strain vegetables. Pour stock back into large stock pot. Add andouille sausage, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and lemon juice. Simmer for about an hour, stirring and skimming occasionally. Stock will thicken slightly. (If it thickens too much for your liking, add more stock and turn heat down slightly.) Add seafood. Simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Sprinkle with file powder and serve with rice. Garnish with fresh parsley or scallions, if desired. Allow guests to salt their own gumbo. This recipe makes about 8-10 servings.</p>
<p>*Filé (pronounced fee-lay) powder is the ground leaves of the sassafras tree, and is available in grocery stores across the South. It has a very light tea-like flavor and thickens the soup slightly. It should always be added after cooking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have neglected my duties in responding to so many well-deserved accolades from my fellow bloggers. By my count, I owe you a list of 47,332 things about myself. I had filled five, yellow, legal pads and was up to 41,765 things when I decided that maybe I should just tell you one thing about me that might give you some true insight, comprehensive insight, into what makes Harper Faulkner tick.</p>
<p>I have just painted my study/den/writer’s workroom and have returned pictures, posters and photos to my walls. The first two items I placed back and that hold the most prominent place in the room and in my visual sphere are a portrait of Anne Frank and a framed poster of the attic where she lived and wrote.</p>
<p>I write for Anne Frank.</p>
<p>Anne Frank’s diary has no ending.  We are always on that last page with her, August 1, 1944. We are left with promise unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I hate with a gut-burning, soul-searing never ending hatred, the strong trampling the weak. I hate the arrogance of those who place themselves in god-like positions over others. I hate that insidious nature of mankind that says because I am stronger; I can control you, use you, and even kill you.  And, if possible, I hate even more the people who can, but don’t stand up and say, “I will not let that happen!”</p>
<p>Anne Frank was a teenage girl on the cusp of womanhood and her diary reflects that.  In itself, it is not great literature. But it does reveal that with growth and maturity, wonderful inspiring words of greatness were to come. She was denied that. We were denied that.</p>
<p>I write because Anne Frank cannot. She would have turn 84 this year. What would we have if she would have been allowed to write for 70 more years? Would she lean over her computer keys and each time she tapped out a word, would she think of that precious paper diary and dull pencils and a cold attic and Nazis in the streets?</p>
<p>I write for Anne Frank. I do not have an ounce of the greatness she had inside her. I am a coward compared to her courage. But I can write and she can’t and I will never, ever take that for granted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Google’s new n-gram tool, when researching history, words count.</p>
<p><strong>Literally.</strong></p>
<p>By analyzing over 500 billion words from 5.2 million books in Chinese, English, French, German, Russian, and Spanish, the n-gram tool allows users to track the usage of words from 1500AD onwards.</p>
<div id="attachment_573" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-4-25-55-pm.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-573" alt="Were they talking about the Renaissance in the 1500s? Apparently they were." src="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-4-25-55-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Were they talking about the Renaissance in the 1500s? Apparently they were.</p></div>
<p>The implications of this tool in terms of historical and cultural research are just beginning to come to light. In the article  “<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract">Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books</a>,” Jean-Baptiste Michel and his fellow researchers suggest that Google’s n-gram can be used to track the emergence of diseases, state censorship and the relative “celebrity” of a given person.</p>
<div id="attachment_574" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-4-42-18-pm.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-574" alt="Contrary to popular belief, I am not in fact famous." src="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-4-42-18-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Contrary to popular belief, I am not in fact famous.</p></div>
<p>There is no doubt that the n-gram is, and will continue to be, an extremely useful tool in historical inquiry. However, there are some limitations that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Google n-gram is limited in regards to language. Most of the collected works are written in English. Although this is helpful for me (an Anglophone student from Canada), some of the world’s most spoken languages, like Arabic and Hindi, are not even present in the database.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Jean-Baptiste Michel notes, the Google n-gram tool simply measures the frequency of words within books, and books alone. Therefore, other publications like newspapers, and academic journal articles are marginalized from each search. The impact of this becomes quite clear when you compare n-gram searches on Google, and an n-gram search that browses through local newspaper clippings like the site, <a href="http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/">Mining the Dispatch</a>. On Mining the Dispatch, users are able to see the relative frequency of fugitive slave ads that made it into the local Richmond newspaper during the Civil War. Because of its larger scope, and inability to browse through newspapers, this kind of historical deduction cannot be made through Google’s n-gram.</p>
<p>I think it’s also important to note that language, although an important (and often forgotten) indication of culture is certainly not the only one. As historians know, geography, religion and class, all play a critical role in shaping the thoughts, actions and mindsets of a given people. Language is only one small piece of what makes us who we are.</p>
<p>Indeed, Canada, the United States, and the UK, may all be English speaking nations, but we have very different cultures.</p>
<p>Just to prove this point, I decided to gauge the relative frequencies of three major sports: baseball, hockey, and football. From 1900-2008, the frequency of hockey was dismal compared to football and baseball. However, this was a search that took into account <i>all</i> English books written during the designated period. I imagine if I were to search a corpus containing only Canadian books, hockey would be mentioned far more frequently.</p>
<div id="attachment_575" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-6-09-29-pm.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-575   " alt="" src="http://hist291.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-03-at-6-09-29-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Don Cherry would not be pleased.</p></div>
<p>But more than that, words themselves are limited.</p>
<p>Think about Twitter. Depending on the words we choose to use in our hashtags, our statuses are more searchable. Similarly, if we tweet about a topic that’s trending, what we say is viewed by a larger audience. But what if we don’t use the right words to categorize what we’re saying? What if we type in an extra &#8220;s&#8221; or add an apostrophe where it doesn&#8217;t belong? But more pertinent than that, what if we say one thing, and mean another?</p>
<p>My previous example with sports provides an interesting example. In English, the word “football” can either mean soccer, or American football. In my search, this discrepancy wasn’t accounted for. Therefore, any mention of the word “football,” whether that book was actually talking about soccer or American football, was nonetheless counted. And therein lies another problem with Google’s n-gram: the tool gives us no sense of context.</p>
<p><strong>And for the historian, context is king.</strong></p>
<p>An old Chinese proverb claims that, “If you wish to know the mind of a man, listen to his words.”</p>
<p>After playing around with the Google n-gram, and uncovering its uses, I think this is extremely accurate. However, words are only one investigative tool in the proverbial historical tool-belt that can be used to understand history and culture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This piece was written just prior to my arrival in India on December 24, 2012, but remained incomplete. After a quick edit and polish, I present it here in its original tense, despite just having returned from India.</em></p>
<p>I got the shakes just before leaving Singapore. It was two and a half years since my last visit to India and I had forgotten how hardcore it can be. On the whole, India is a pretty safe place to travel – it’s not exactly a warzone and whilst violence and crime certainly occur, most foreigners get away with being ripped off a few times and suffering some health issues. Yet, travelling in India takes a lot of effort and can be at times quite harrowing. It is not, despite its reputation as a centre for meditation and religious retreat, a very relaxing country.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9935-jodphur-bw.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2897" title="Everybody wants you in their photograph" alt="Jodphur B&amp;W" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9935-jodphur-bw.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I’ve written several stories about my first trip to India and some of the various experiences I had there. Some fictionalised, others as memoir, and it is not an easy place to which to do justice. It can be breathtaking and amazing, restful and beautiful, yet it can also be utterly exhausting and very frustrating. It also has its attendant, inherent difficulties – such as the heat and dust, the discomfort, the chaos, the noise, the touts, the lying and cheating that goes hand in hand with incredible hospitality, and the inconvenience of not being able to drink the tap water in a country that is often unrelentingly hot and humid.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/7984-taj-from-agra-fort.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2893" title="The Taj from Agra Fort" alt="Taj from Agra Fort" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/7984-taj-from-agra-fort.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>In my first few days in India in March 2010 I struggled to make sense of the place and learn to negotiate it. Rather like being thrown in at the deep end, I learned to swim soon enough, yet not before having a number of difficult and challenging experiences and getting sick. The illness in itself wasn&#8217;t so bad &#8211; stomach cramps and diarrhoea &#8211; but after a few days it made me feel very weak. For two days in Pushkar I did almost nothing but lie in my hotel room and read, with occasional ventures outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/1218-bikaner.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2898" title="Woman in muddy street in Bikaner" alt="Bikaner" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/1218-bikaner.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>After four days, travelling further into Rajasthan, I arrived in Udaipur dehydrated and exhausted. The weakness of not eating much for three days made me paranoid and, sitting alone in my hotel room watching the cricket that night I got the crazy idea that I might genuinely die. I force-fed myself a vegetable biriani and fruit salad and the following morning went straight to the chemist to get some antibiotics. Within twelve hours of taking them, the illness vanished and I cursed myself for not having done so sooner. Take my advice – most gastric illness in India is bacterial and over-the-counter antibiotics are readily available at any medical shop.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9031-udaipur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2894" title="Not a bad place to fear death" alt="Udaipur" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9031-udaipur.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>As soon as I got better, that first trip in India really got underway. With my strength returned, I was able to put in the hard yards and see and do the things I wanted to. The more I saw of India, the more I loved it – but this love came with serious reservations about why I felt the way I did. It was all very well to see charm and romance and the exotic, yet alongside that was terrible poverty, failing infrastructure, appalling hygiene in public places, rubbish dumped and burned everywhere on the streets, including plastics and excrement, and such a harrowing welter of noise pollution, overcrowding and almost non-stop inquisitions from people I passed that it was equally depressing and demoralising. It was, of course, a photographers&#8217; paradise, but my joy at the subject matter was tainted by a feeling of intrusion and exploitation and terms like “poverty porn” lingered in my mind. I tried very hard on that trip to remain friendly and positive. For the first few weeks I answered every query, shook hands with a hundred strangers and stopped for the ubiquitous “just one photo, sir”, but after a time India’s constant assault forced me to retreat inside myself. I turned to my headphones and sunglasses and started ignoring people.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5925-onkar.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2902" title="Onkar! a very nice tea man in McLeod Ganj" alt="Onkar!" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5925-onkar.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>A better solution, however, came when I arrived in Darjeeling. Perhaps it was the prevalence of Buddhism, the cool calm of the mountains or just the friendly, peaceful nature of the Ghorka people, but in Darjeeling people left me alone. When people did greet me or make an inquiry, it was not merely preliminary to an attempted transaction.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/3986-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2899" title="Darjeeling, chilled" alt="Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/3986-darjeeling.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>In the rest of India there seems to be an automatic reflex whereupon, seeing a tourist, if staring is insufficient, then belting out the question “which country?” is the next step. This was sometimes done in the nicest possible way, but often it was thrown at me with such urgency that it felt impolite. What really surprised me was how often the inquirers accepted the answer without further ado, at times seeming almost uninterested, which left me wondering why they had needed to ask in the first place. It was like being a display, which, to be fair, was probably not much different from how people felt when I was photographing them – though I do try to shoot as surreptitiously as possible.</p>
<p>The solution, it seemed, to avoiding the hustle of India, was to be in the mountains, which wasn&#8217;t exactly India after all. Once I’d discovered the relative calm of the mountains, I did my best to stay there.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5641-amritsar.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2900" title="The Golden Temple, Amritsar" alt="Amritsar" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5641-amritsar.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>From Darjeeling I flew across to Amritsar where I lasted one day before taking a bus across Punjab into the mountains around Dharamsala.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/6949-vashisht.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2903" title="Mountains around Vashisht" alt="Vashisht" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/6949-vashisht.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I was so reluctant to return to the heat, dust and general hubbub hat I stayed another three weeks in Himachal Pradesh before finally venturing down again via Shimla.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5830-mcleod-ganj.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2901" title="Twin Rainbows, McLeod Ganj" alt="McLeod Ganj" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5830-mcleod-ganj.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>By the end of that journey, just shy of two months, I felt like an old veteran after a long campaign. Yet my energy was also pretty well spent and I had fallen into a state of relative dissipation. Tired and world-weary, I wandered around Varanasi in a daze, wiped out by heat and hash. I made sure I took the photographs I wanted to get, yet the subject that had so fascinated me for the first two months – namely India – had become a little less appealing.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9129-varanasi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2895" title="So many people, Varanasi" alt="Varanasi" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9129-varanasi.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I could no longer stomach the scent of excrement, urine and decomposition. I had no more patience for beggars, priests, touts or even genuinely curious Indians. I literally just wanted to shoot the place and avoid any interactions. When anyone spoke to me I shook my head, pointed to the headphones, raised my hands as though to say, “Sorry, dude, I can’t hear you,” and walked away. It was not how I wanted to be at all, and I hid out in my hotel room at times, simply indulging in privacy and regretting the feelings of displeasure I had with the world at large. I guess introverts should travel in Scandinavia instead.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9412-varanasi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2896" title="Man with tea, Varanasi" alt="Varanasi" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/9412-varanasi.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>It was for these reasons that, just prior to my flight into Thiruvananthapuram for a second visit to India, I started to have reservations about where I was going. I should be looking forward to the challenge, but perhaps I am too effete and western for the grit and grime of it all.  Still, despite the above introduction, my last trip was one of the greatest experiences of my life and I came away from it feeling very inspired. This time is also bound to be different for a number of reasons. Firstly, I&#8217;ll be starting in the south instead of the north and travelling in regions I&#8217;ve not visited before. Secondly, I&#8217;m not travelling alone this time around. V is coming with me, or I with her if you will, and the dynamic will be very different indeed. It will certainly be a lot easier with someone to share the highs and lows, and I hope it will be more enjoyable as a consequence. Hopefully I will come away both appreciating what I have discovered anew and having been reminded of what is important and good in life. I also hope to shoot a hell of a lot of good photographs. Wish me luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time again: Super Bowl week. I know this, not because I follow football in even the slightest way, but because I’ve noticed the potato chip and Coca-Cola displays at the grocery store. Built like shrines to the gods, these stockpiles of snacks will be inhaled by a hundred million people in six hours. This is just enough time to complete the pre-game and post-game shows, four fifteen-minute quarters of actual football competition, a forty-five-minute halftime extravaganza, and a lot of expensive commercials created to get you to eat potato chips and drink Coca-Cola.</p>
<div id="attachment_5346" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 366px"><a href="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/electric.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5346" alt="Electric" src="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/electric.jpg?w=356&#038;h=198" width="356" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="http://www.kshs.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.kshs.org</a></p></div>
<p>I don’t have many positive memories related to the sport. When I was about eleven, my best friend got one of those electric football games that had plastic players and a metal field that would vibrate when you flipped the switch. We’d line up our teams with great care, and then sit there for a long time listening to this thing buzz and staring at our little men as they wandered around in all directions, quivering like mad and eventually getting stuck against a side wall or clustering in bunches in the corner like tiny bumper cars. It was, I imagine, not much different from putting on show tunes and watching termites attempt to perform <i>Guys and Dolls</i>. Every now and then my friend would announce that he’d gotten a first down, a development that always escaped my attention but that he never failed to see. Touchdowns and field goals would follow, along with other assorted scoring opportunities based on obscure rules that I was pretty sure he was making up on the spot.<a href="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/football.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5349" style="margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px;" alt="Football" src="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/football.png?w=416&#038;h=300" width="416" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, when the older boys had a thirst for human blood, we played real football on an empty lot riddled with small rocks and shards of broken glass. We had only the ball, and no other equipment whatsoever. Helmets were for sissies, we decided, and complaining of pain after being slammed to the ground and crushed under a pile of snarling teenagers would just mean you’d be picked last the next time we played. If we didn’t call it the Stupid Bowl, we should have. We were a bunch of morons.</p>
<p>I preferred baseball. For one thing, in other sports the opposing team spent most of its time trying to take something away from you, inflicting physical harm and verbal abuse in the process. It was too much like real life. Football, for example, was nothing more than the offense bulling its way through, while the defense did whatever it could to knock you down and get you to fumble the ball.</p>
<p>Basketball was the same, except you wore shorts and were required to dribble and avoid committing a three-second violation. No one ever explained the three-second rule to me, or how the referees could possibly keep track of where everyone was and for how long. I got called on it a lot in gym class, usually because I had to stop and re-tie my sneakers in the middle of play.</p>
<p><a href="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/soccer.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5351" alt="Soccer" src="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/soccer.png?w=720"   /></a>In both hockey and soccer, there was an infraction referred to as <i>off-sides</i>. Again, I’ve never been able to understand this rule, beyond the simple conclusion that it’s designed to keep you from wanting to score a goal too much. The result, often, was an unbearably long game that ended in a tie. Frequently, a <i>scoreless</i> tie. This was like going to a restaurant, ordering a meal, waiting for your dinner to be served, then leaving without eating anything.</p>
<p>I found myself playing lacrosse once, and like hockey, its bizarre regulations included something called a <i>crease</i>, which I think is an invisible fourth dimension that players either must stay inside of or avoid entering at all costs. I’m still not sure.</p>
<p>These sports seemed to have a common element: they all had commentators and coaches who rattled on and on about intricate strategies and match-ups, deep explanations of what worked and didn’t work, how they needed to go back to the fundamentals, and what they intended to accomplish next game or next season. The only thing I ever saw was a bunch of lunatics chasing after a loose ball or puck, unsure of where it was headed and knocking each other around to relieve their frustration.<a href="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/baseball.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5352" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Baseball" src="http://mostlybrightideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/baseball.png?w=342&#038;h=352" width="342" height="352" /></a></p>
<p>But baseball was different. Baseball involved thinking, rather than reptilian-brain reflex responses. There was time to plan ahead. And there was room for real strategy, because there were just so many things that could happen, and each thing had a correct reaction.</p>
<p>My younger brother and I played baseball every chance we got. We played in the street, using flattened beer cans and manhole covers for bases. We played on concrete playgrounds, and on any available stretch of grass. We pitched to a rectangle we’d drawn with yellow chalk on a brick wall. In the winter, we played in the house, arranging the living room furniture like an infield and using a rolled-up sock for a ball.</p>
<p>We watched professional games on television. And once or twice a year, our father took us to see the Yankees or the Mets play in person. One summer, we went to the Mayor’s Trophy Game, an annual fundraiser in which the Yankees and Mets played <i>against</i> each other. My brain nearly exploded with excitement, but I’d also been backed into the corner of team loyalty, and chose to focus instead on eating as many hot dogs as I could. This was in the early 1960s, when you could sit in a box seat for three dollars, or the bleachers for seventy-five cents. When players had names like Ernie and Vic, Roberto and Duke, Sandy and Moose, and the very best of them made less than a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Of course, I had no idea about players’ salaries when I was a kid. I doubt I’d ever even considered the fact that they were paid at all. Baseball was a game, not a job, and I’d have paid <i>them</i> just for a chance to step onto that field and touch the bases. I dreamed of someday getting a close look at the three monuments in centerfield at Yankee Stadium, vertical granite slabs that looked exactly like the headstones I’d seen when visiting my grandparents’ graves at the cemetery in Queens. I wasn’t certain, but I thought the players might have been buried right there in the outfield.</p>
<p>At one game, Mickey Mantle hit a five-hundred-foot shot over the black screen in dead center. I may have seen it, but more likely I was looking around for a food vendor. Still, I was there. I remember standing and cheering about something; it had to be either the home run or the guy selling Dixie Cups – cardboard containers filled with half vanilla and half chocolate ice cream that you ate with a flat wooden spoon.</p>
<p>World Series games were played in the afternoons back then, in the first week of October, when you could tell the inning by how close the shadows were to the pitcher’s mound. There were two leagues, as there are now, but each had just ten teams. The best record at the end of the season got you into the World Series. No playoffs or division championships. No slipping into a side entrance off Wild Card Alley. You either won the pennant or you didn’t. It was pure, and it was fair. I remember running home from school to catch the last couple of innings. And sometimes, on days when I loved the world more than anything, the nuns would turn on the television and let us watch the game right there in our classroom.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl had not yet been born. The highlights of the year were Easter, summer vacation, the World Series, my birthday, and Christmas. It was the anticipation of each event that helped sustain me from one to the next. People say it was a simpler time, and I guess it was. Potato chips came in two flavors, and there was Coca-Cola and whatever it was other people drank. There was vanilla and chocolate, the Yankees and the Mets, baseball and all those strange, inferior sports.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:30px;">And there was time to think.</p>
