				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 658px"><a href="http://en.aswatmasriya.com/images/News/original/812021ea-bca1-4c91-ba3b-6b2ca35fff8f.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://en.aswatmasriya.com/images/News/original/812021ea-bca1-4c91-ba3b-6b2ca35fff8f.jpg" width="648" height="429" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An Egyptian man walks past anti-sexual harassment graffiti. One of the tags states &#8220;Be a man and protect her.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>“I can no longer walk – or even drive – anywhere without receiving a dirty comment or without feeling scared that I may be attacked at any moment.”  Those were the comments of one female university graduate on life as a woman in Egypt.</p>
<p>“It’s disgusting and makes me feel like I am walking around naked!” said another female who happens to be veiled. “The abuse impacts all women of Cairo. Whether you are wearing the hijab, the niqab, or whether you are not veiled…women are harassed no matter what!”</p>
<p>This is the sexual terrorism that women across Egypt go through each day. Statistics released reveal that more than 90% of Egypt’s women – regardless of the neighborhood they live in &#8211; have encountered sexual harassment: grand-mothers, mothers, daughters – no one is off limits.</p>
<p>While driving in the relatively ‘upscale’ Heliopolis, I noticed a bunch of youth who had stopped their car and started verbally abusing a woman – in her 20s – who simply turned her face away and hurried quickly to a nearby store.</p>
<p>The attitude towards women in society has deteriorated over the past few decades – with sexual harassment getting worse post-revolution. Over the past few weeks, sexual harassment has marred protests at both Tahrir Square an at the Presidential Palace – with reports of women being surrounded by groups of men who then proceed to rip off their clothes and brutally violate their bodies.</p>
<p>An anti-sexual harassment group,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/op-anti-sexual-harassmentassault-%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A/testimony-from-january-25-2013-tgen/207910096019557"> Op Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault</a> that was created to protect females from protest zones, shared the following testimonial of a female who was attacked on the 25<sup>th</sup> of January 2013:</p>
<blockquote><p>All I remember is hands all over my body, grabbing under the layers of pullovers I was wearing, touching my breasts, opening my bra. More hands on my back and legs, my pants being pulled down. I was trying not to lose balance and not to lose my purse with my phone inside. My empty hand tried to pull my pants back up when I felt fingers inside my ass and shortly after in my vagina. I dropped my purse and pulled up my pants again, or I tried at least. Then more penetration with fingers from the front and the back. I tried to see the end of circle of men, but saw rows and rows of men surrounding me, all pushing towards me. I panicked, and was pushed aside. I remembered my purse, reached to the ground, picked it up and fell on the ground. With one hand I was hanging onto the purse; with the other I tried to pull myself up. Men&#8217;s hands were still on my body and somebody penetrated my vagina again with his hands. I had successfully got up. At that point I remember sounds again and I remember me beginning to shout for help. One man, a few meters away recognized the situation and moved towards me in the middle of maybe forty men, maybe more. He shouted and hit some of the men around me in order to reach me. When I could reach his hand, I simply handed him my purse and grabbed his arm. Then I just hugged the stranger and told him to help me. From behind, my pants were still be pulled down, hands everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disgustingly, certain officials, radicals, and sexual predators have blamed women on such attacks. Today, the Interior Minister’s Undersecretary blamed women’s attire and lack of modesty. This is similar to what one man interviewed by the<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19440656"> BBC</a> stated: &#8220;It&#8217;s the way girls dress that makes guys come on to them. The girls came wanting it &#8211; even women in niqab.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, after many years of silence women are finally standing up for their rights – calling for equality and above all, justice.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://www.majalla.com/eng/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PA-13736668web-620x413.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.majalla.com/eng/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PA-13736668web-620x413.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Egyptian women protesting during a recent anti-sexual harassment protest.</p></div>
<p>During the Anti-Morsi protests in December 2012, more women than men converged outside the Presidential Palace to call for the rejection of a constitution that would lead to unequal rights for women. One woman, who held a sign stating “The voice of women IS the revolution” said that women are no longer afraid of expressing their frustrations with the lack of equality in society.</p>
<p>Today, global protests are set to take place outside Egyptian embassies, calling for an end to sexual harassment in Egypt. The protests – which are starting at the same time (5pm local time) as one in Cairo – aim to shed light on the abuse of Egyptian women and to pressure both the government and the international community to do more.</p>
<p>Egyptian women are risking their safety by marching on Egypt’s streets and demanding to be noticed. Despite the risks and potential of being attacked, one female protester told me “I will be protesting because I want to be treated like a human being.  The goal of these harassers is to scare us – but we will not be silenced anymore.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love is in the air as Valentine&#8217;s Day draws ever closer. The empty shelves of post-Christmas and post-sales shopping have been filled with rosy red pleasantries, boxes of indulgent truffles, delicate red roses and cards making declarations of ever lasting love. But there&#8217;s something about the commercialisation of love at Valentine&#8217;s which has always slightly unnerved me. Yes, it&#8217;s a chance to remind your loved one that your cherish them, but isn&#8217;t there something contrived about telling them this only when a card shop tells you to?</p>
<p>For these two Norms however, there is no need for a card, a box of chocolates or a bouquet of flowers to demonstrate their true bond of love and affection &#8211; a simple, heartfelt kiss will do, here shared in front of one of the most iconic buildings of Paris&#8217; 4th arrondissement, the<em> Hotel de Ville</em>. On holiday from London and staying in the Marais (which also hosts Paris&#8217; gay district), these Norms also have something else to celebrate this year asides from their own love &#8211; the British Parliament has just voted by overwhelming majority to give same-sex couples the right to marry.</p>
<div id="attachment_6489" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://normsonline.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/doisneau-norms-hotel-de-ville.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-6489" alt="Doisneau Norms share a valentine's kiss in celebration of equal marriage (2013 © Nicholas de Lacy-Brown)" src="http://normsonline.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/doisneau-norms-hotel-de-ville.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=717" width="1024" height="717" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Doisneau Norms share a valentine&#8217;s kiss in celebration of equal marriage (2013 © Nicholas de Lacy-Brown)</p></div>
<p>In doing so, Parliament have not made a statement about faith or religion, nor attempted to widen the extents of religious marriage beyond the bounds with which the church is comfortable. Rather, they have recognised, quite simply, that for both men and women who love those of their own sex, being gay is not a choice made or a lifestyle favoured, but who they are, and how they were born. Why then should gay men, women (and Norms)  not be afforded the equal opportunity to marry when they, like heterosexual couples, find themselves in a relationship so strong and so loving that they want to devote themselves to that person for the rest of their lives?</p>
<div id="attachment_6495" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://normsonline.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/article-2129634-0038bfa400000258-59_964x868.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6495" alt="The Doisneau original" src="http://normsonline.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/article-2129634-0038bfa400000258-59_964x868.jpg?w=300&#038;h=270" width="300" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Doisneau original</p></div>
<p>So this Valentine&#8217;s day, even if you do not have a loved one with whom to share a Valentine&#8217;s day kiss, take some time to consider the enhanced rights which have been afforded to gay men, women (and Norms) all over the UK. Finally, like their heterosexual counterparts, they have been given the opportunity to validate their love in marriage like everyone else.</p>
<p>And for those eagle-eyed art lovers amongst you, you may recognise the scene which these two Norms now recreate. It is, of course, based on the famous photograph, <em>Le Baiser de l&#8217;Hotel de Ville</em>, by celebrated French photographer Robert Doisneau. Last Valentine&#8217;s I recreated another of his famous kiss photographs from the 1950s on canvas, in Norm-style. Here is that painting, and the Doisneau&#8217;s originals.</p>

<p>Happy Valentine&#8217;s day to all and everyone, especially those celebrating the manifestation of an equal right to love and marry, at last.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us,<br />
</strong><strong>we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions,or cures,<br />
</strong><strong> </strong><strong>have chosen rather <strong>to share our pain<br />
</strong></strong><strong> and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s this insidious thing that won’t seem to go away, and it is the incessant chatter about athletic women’s bodies- is it ok for women to have muscles? Is strong really <i>better</i> than skinny? I don’t know if men are the main perpetrators or if it’s mostly us doing this to each other (let’s blame the men, that’s more fun). Either way, it’s apparent that certain forces are less than enthusiastic about the fairer sex being yoked. Don’t be scared, everything is going to be ok, even if us gals get barbells in our hands. I usually chalk the negativity up to mostly internet trolls- a subsect of the population I find it best to ignore. Frankly, I just don’t like giving life to the subject by discussing it further. I don’t feel the need to defend my choices for my body, or encourage others to choose the same path I have. Some see fit to inundate the inter-webs with <a href="http://crossfitfms.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/the-fear-of-bulkiness-and-crossfit/">articles</a> and memes trying to dispel the myth that weight training makes women bulky, that strong is in fact superior to other ways of being, and working to assuage women’s fears that if they pick up a barbell their feminine curves will combust into a manly, hard body. <i>Fears. </i>Fears? Somehow, with everything going on in the world, development of strength, muscle and physical competency has become something that has risen to the status of being fear-worthy. I mean, what are these crazy girls going to do next, try to grow beards!? (Not likely because beards are vile and germ infested. If you don’t know about this you must read <i>The Twits.</i>)<a href="http://elisabethakinwale.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-772" alt="photo-25" src="http://elisabethakinwale.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-25.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>But I digress. A couple of recent events transpired that sparked my interest in this subject. My opinion on the matter, like anyone elses of course, is shaped by my experiences. I grew up as a gymnast- a sport that produces strong, muscular athletes. I grew up with a strong mother. She was not an athlete, but she was strong as a horse in my child’s eye view. She always worked two, usually three jobs (often physical ones) to support us. My mother consistently encouraged my sister and I in our athletic endeavors and frankly, I felt that I was expected to be an athlete. I don’t remember her ever being sick and I only saw her cry once, when I was ten years old and her grandmother died. The problems explored in <i>The Feminine Mystique </i>did not exist in our house. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, in many ways I feel I was freed from the confines of <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/07/16/power-masculine-weakness-feminine/">stereotypical notions </a>of femininity. I’ve always included strength as a completely normal characteristic for a woman. When I think of the ultimate woman, being able to handle business physically is one of the foremost thoughts in my mind. Bearing and nursing children, physically carrying them, raising children, doing labor to care for and support herself or her family- these are all things that I find utterly feminine and the ability to do them is enhanced and facilitated by a fit, strong body. One of my favorite things is when my son tells me I’m strong and emulates my athletic movements.<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MzOWo7kOLrs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Back to the two events that got me thinking about this subject. One was a woman who contacted me after some of her loved ones reacted negatively to changes in her body after 5 months of CrossFit. Basically, they felt that her new muscle definition looked “manly”. My comment to her was basically, if you have conviction about what you are doing, you <i>must </i>hold onto that as your shield against the naysayers. You are responsible for your body. You are responsible for your own health and happiness. How your body transforms is secondary to the discipline you’re displaying and the sense of accomplishment you earn in your daily workouts and progress towards your goals. People who really care about you should be uplifted by your joy, hard work and accomplishments. In my case, I’m fortunate that overwhelmingly I am affirmed for what I do with regard to fitness and I’m realizing not everyone has that experience.</p>
<p>The other happening was a conversation with one of the top weightlifting coaches in the country. He told me that he’s had multiple adolescent female lifters quit the sport of weightlifting because they (or their mothers!) felt it was making their butt and thighs too big. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I found this fact shocking. We discussed the matter a bit more on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/weightlifting-talk1/2013/02/05/weightlifting-talk--elisabeth-akinwale">&#8220;Weightlifting Talk&#8221;</a>. Maybe I hang around too many people who appreciate a developed butt and quads, but WHAT?! First of all, when you’re an adolescent girl, your body is supposed to grow and develop, weightlifter or not. Second of all, what’s wrong with a butt and thighs?</p>
<p>I came away from these two occurrences shaking my head and more convinced than ever that the best way to deal with this obsession with critiquing women’s bodies is to identify your own beliefs and values about your body and what you choose to do with it, and say FTW. Whether it’s too “manly” because you’re lifting weights, or too curvaceous because you’re lifting weights, or too thin because you likes to run, or too whatever. In Tina Fey’s book <i>Bossypants</i>, she documents the list of attributes that every girl is expected to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caucasian blue eyes</li>
<li>Full Spanish lips</li>
<li>A classic button nose</li>
<li>Hairless Asian skin with a California tan</li>
<li>A Jamaican dance hall ass</li>
<li>Long Swedish legs</li>
<li>Small Japanese feet</li>
<li>The abs of a lesbian gym owner</li>
<li>The hips of a nine year old boy</li>
<li>The arms of Michelle Obama</li>
<li>And doll tits</li>
</ul>
<p>Great list, funny and reflective of the ridiculousness of it all. It’s a shame there’s no tidy conclusion to this matter so we could stop having this conversation over and over. I suspect that won’t happen anytime soon. In the meantime, I leave you with a lyric from a song my mother used to play:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But it&#8217;s all right now, I learned my lesson well, You see, ya can&#8217;t please everyone,  So ya got to please yourself.”- Rick Nelson</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday was a rare treat in our house: one of those nights where the homework was done early, the dinner was cooked by someone else, and snow was in the forecast. The evening stretched out, molasses-lazy. My eldest daughter sauntered into the kitchen where I was spending some meditative time with the pots and a scrub brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she began lightly, &#8220;I wanted to talk to you about your pottymouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hummed. She does not approve of my penchant for cussing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came into your office today, you said the s-word. Cursing is evidence of a lack of creativity.&#8221; It is always a delight to hear your feeble parenting parroted back at you.</p>
<p>&#8220;A guy said something stupid on the radio this morning and then defended it by misquoting the dictionary. I was just frustrated, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She whisked a dishtowel off the shelf and began drying pots. &#8220;Lance Armstrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you talking about Lance Armstrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>She put the pot lid away before answering. &#8220;<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">So,&#8221; she breezed, &#8220;maybe don&#8217;t watch the Lance Armstrong interview until after I&#8217;m in bed, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>That morning, John Mackey, CEO of grocery chain Whole Foods, told NPR that he had been wrong to call Obama&#8217;s new health care plan &#8220;socialist,&#8221; as he had been doing for years. &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/16/169413848/whole-foods-founder-john-mackey-on-fascism-and-conscious-capitalism">It&#8217;s more like fascism</a>,&#8221; he said, conjuring images of jackbooted Brownshirts roughing up old ladies and forcing flu shots on them. Not surprisingly, lookups of &#8220;fascism&#8221; spiked.</p>
<p>So did the outcry from the people who generally shop at Whole Foods&#8211;people my father would call &#8220;crunchy-nuts-and-berries types,&#8221; people who talk about sustainably harvested herring and know how to pronounce &#8220;quinoa.&#8221; John Mackey backpedaled, and twelve hours later was <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/2013/jan/17/whole-foods-ceo-conscious-capitalism/">telling another radio host</a> that he made a boo-boo as regards his choice of words:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I was trying to distinguish it between socialism so I took the dictionary definition of fascism, which is when the means of production are still owned privately but the government controls it &#8212; that’s a type of fascism.</p>
<p>I was finishing up my shift in the syntax mines with one more lookup tweet. Lookups of &#8220;fascism&#8221; were off the charts, and as I read the transcript of Mackey&#8217;s apology, both my mouth and the door to my office flew open. In popped my eldest daughter, and out popped &#8220;Oh, you have <em>got</em> to be shitting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom!&#8221; she scolded. Then, &#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;ll come back when you&#8217;re civilized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, while I washed dishes and waited for snow, Lance Armstrong appeared on everyone&#8217;s TV and <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-spt-0118-lance-armstrong--20130118,0,6448863.column">told Oprah</a> that he didn&#8217;t think that doping was cheating, and guess who absolved him of it?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">He insisted that given the widespread culture of doping in the sport during those years, it was not possible to win the Tour without doping.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&#8220;Did you feel you were cheating?&#8221; Winfrey asked.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&#8220;At the time, no,&#8221; Armstrong said, explaining it with moral relativism. &#8220;I looked up cheat in the dictionary and the definition was to gain an advantage on a rival. I viewed it as a level playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armstrong&#8217;s justification is laughable, of course, as is the reporter&#8217;s modifying clause in the final paragraph. We hear it and holler, &#8220;C&#8217;mon!&#8221; We may even check the dictionary, whereupon we leave a Seen &amp; Heard comment at the entry for &#8220;cheat&#8221; that reads, &#8220;Lance Armstrong! C&#8217;mon!&#8221; <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">But the fact is that appealing to an external authority to justify your position is, like the McRib sandwich and idiocy, an ontological constant: &#8220;the scriptures tell us&#8230;&#8221;; &#8220;the Constitution states&#8230;&#8221;; &#8220;my dad says&#8230;&#8221;. The dictionary is an authority, and so gets dragged into all manner of arguments.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How come,&#8221; countless editorial emails begin, &#8220;you say that &#8216;biannual&#8217; can mean &#8216;once every two years&#8217; or &#8216;twice a year&#8217;? Stupidest, most useless definition ever! C&#8217;mon! Make up your mind! I have a bet riding on this.&#8221; When I write and say no one has won the bet, that &#8220;biannual&#8221; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=merriam-webster%20dictionary%20of%20english%20usage%20bi-%20bimonthly%20biweekly&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=merriam-webster%20dictionary%20of%20english%20usage%20bi-%20bimonthly%20biweekly&amp;f=false">really can&#8211;and does</a>&#8211;mean &#8220;once every two years&#8221; and &#8220;twice a year,&#8221; I often get the reply, &#8220;Whatever, tl;dr. Which meaning is right? I have a bet riding on this.&#8221; You can hear them grouse at their monitors: &#8220;Just pick one, Dictionary, because authorities do not contradict themselves. Once they do, they cease being authoritative, and you&#8217;re not doing so hot right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">Sometimes the stakes are higher. Ten years ago, we added a second subsense to the noun &#8220;marriage&#8221; that covered uses of &#8220;marriage&#8221; that refer to same-sex unions. Someone eventually noticed.</span></p>
<p>Outrage! screamed about 4,000 emails, all flooding my inbox in the space of a week. How dare you tell us that gay marriage is okay now?</p>
<p>I was not surprised, honestly: I drafted a long, thoughtful reply about how words get into the dictionary, noting that this sense of &#8220;marriage&#8221; had been used by both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage since at least 1921, and finishing with the caution that the dictionary merely serves to record our language as it is used. I spent the next two weeks doing nothing but sending this reply out to everyone and their mother.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">The problem&#8211;because when it comes to correspondence on this scale, there&#8217;s always a problem&#8211;was that I was making assumptions about what sort of authority people took the dictionary for. I realize that I&#8217;m sort of biased since I&#8217;m on the inside, but I assume we all know the dictionary is only an authority on the meanings and uses of words. These particular correspondents, however, believe that the dictionary is the publishing arm of the New World Order as run by a liberal, elitist cabal who is out to destroy everything a rational person and the annals of history hold dear. To them, the dictionary is a political tool and therefore a back-door authority on life itself, and this entry in particular was evidence of a conspiracy to force us all into SCOTUS-mandated gay marriages with Ellen DeGeneres or Anderson Cooper. They responded accordingly: Noah Webster is turning in his grave knowing that his dictionary, our moral barometer, can no longer tell the difference between right and wrong. Some people were not so sentimental: &#8220;Drink a cup of battery acid and eat broken glass, whore of Babylon,&#8221; answered one correspondent.</span></p>
<p>I closed my eyes and pressed my fingertips into my orbital sockets until I saw explosions, then forwarded the email to our President. &#8220;Do I qualify for hazard pay now? And the battery acid comment reminds me that we&#8217;re out of coffee upstairs.&#8221;<i><br />
</i></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">What proof do people have that the dictionary is not merely a record of language? Plenty, my </span>correspondents<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;"> sputter: everywhere you look, people are citing dictionary definitions as justifications for all sorts of wrong things. &#8220;T</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">he Supreme Court uses the dictionary in making their decisions!&#8221; one of my correspondents warned. &#8220;The dictionary is an authority on how we live life, and our morals, and it&#8217;s a pretty piss-poor one in my opinion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">This is true: courts will sometimes use dictionary definitions in their deliberations. But though I am not a lawyer, something tells me they are not basing their judgments solely on the dictionary. As for the dictionary being a moral guide, it never was and it never should be. We enter the words &#8220;murder&#8221; and &#8220;headcheese&#8221; into the dictionary, but that shouldn&#8217;t be read as advocacy for trying either one of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">One of Merriam-Webster&#8217;s marketing taglines used to be &#8220;The Voice of Authority.&#8221; In truth, it&#8217;s a tagline that makes me uneasy: it makes the dictionary sound like the fatuously beaming spokesperson for capital-A Authority, and all that a sneaky or powerful person needs to do to validate whatever shenanigans they are up to is align </span>themselves<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;"> with that mouthpiece, possibly appropriate it and use to their advantage. I&#8217;m not pointing fingers at John Mackey or Lance Armstrong: I, too, have gone to the dictionary in the past to defend my own personal and totally non-lexical beefs with someone (pray for us now and in the hour of our peeving)</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">. But the people who tend to point to a dictionary definition and defend their moral high-ground based on it remind me of the kids I knew growing up who would close their eyes, open their Bibles, and declare that whatever verse their finger touched was going to be God speaking directly to them. Sometimes they landed on &#8220;Be not afraid, for I am with you,&#8221; and they&#8217;d trot to the playground and tell Angela to &#8220;<em>shut up</em>, God told me he was with <em>me</em> and <i>I </i>am going to ask him to make you <em>barf all over your dress </em>because you are <em>stuck-up and dumb</em>.&#8221; Other days, those kids were quiet and refused to play double-dutch or Chinese jumprope; that morning, their finger landed on &#8220;Now Esau was a hairy man.&#8221; For them, the Bible&#8217;s primary use was for sticking it to that <em>big idiotface</em> Angela.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">So it is with the dictionary: if some people treat the Bible like a holy slot machine that occasionally pays out big, then others treat the dictionary like the defense&#8217;s case-clinching surprise witness. People escort the dictionary to the stand and use it to destroy the prosecution: &#8220;The Voice of Authority says that government oversight of health care is fascism&#8221;; &#8220;The Voice of Authority gives/does not give gay marriage validity&#8221;; &#8220;The Voice of Authority says I didn&#8217;t cheat.&#8221; We go with this line of reasoning, but only up to a certain point: no one ever says, &#8220;The Voice of Authority compels you to eat headcheese.&#8221; In that case, we recognize that the dictionary is just a book that tells you what people mean when they use the word &#8220;headcheese.&#8221; No one in their right mind would think that the dictionary is in bed with Big Deli.</span></p>
<p>I lampoon &#8220;The Voice of Authority&#8221; at home&#8211; &#8220;Hey, the Epiglottis of Authority is telling you to quit farting around and do your homework <strong>now</strong>.&#8221;&#8211;but I cringe when I see intelligent people imbue The Voice of Authority with moral weight. In the preface to his very first dictionary, the 1806 <em>Compendious Dictionary of the English Language</em>, Noah Webster spends time highlighting the wrongs of lexicographers before him. In the midst of his genteel rant, he notes:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This fact is a remarkable proof of the indolence of authors, of their confidence in the opinions of a great man, and their willingness to live upon the labors of others. It shows us also the extensive mischiefs resulting from the mistakes of an eminent author, and the danger of taking his opinions upon trust.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a passage I reflect on frequently when trying to explain that the dictionary really isn&#8217;t an unchanging and infallible dispensary of moral wisdom, nor is it a prop for your personal convictions. It&#8217;s a book that tells you how people use words. Noah Webster treated it that way; the Supreme Court treats it that way; we should all treat it that way. The Epiglottis of Authority means it.</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Via this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dictionary-a-way-to-define-an-argument/2013/02/03/7bc28cb6-6ca1-11e2-ada0-5ca5fa7ebe79_story.html">Washington Post article</a>, I find that James Brudley (Fordham U) and Lawrence Baum (Ohio State) recently published a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2195644">study on how SCOTUS has used the dictionary</a>. The whole paper is available for free download, but the last few sentences of their abstract tell you everything you need to know:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="font-size:small;">Yet our findings demonstrate that the image of dictionary usage as heuristic and authoritative is a mirage. This contrast between the exalted status ascribed to dictionary definitions and the highly subjective way the Court uses them in practice reflects insufficient attention to the inherent limitations of dictionaries, limitations that have been identified by other scholars and by some appellate judges. Further, the justices’ subjective dictionary culture is likely to mislead lawyers faced with the responsibility to construct arguments for the justices to review. The Article concludes by offering a three-step plan for the Court to develop a healthier approach to its dictionary habit.</span></p>
<p>Both the article and the paper are worth the read, if only to find that in 2008, one member of the Court decided to cite the definition of &#8220;promote&#8221; from <em>Webster&#8217;s Second New International Dictionary </em>in writing a majority opinion. <em>Webster&#8217;s Second</em>, I hasten to remind you, has been arguably out of date since 1935 and inarguably out of print since 1961.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I miss about childhood is knowing that no matter what happened, my mom would take care of me.  If I needed money for something she would always find it.  I never really knew how bad or how tight finances were because Mom spoke mostly in vague and generic terms.  Now I&#8217;m the adult.  I have two grown kids and a wife.  The daughter is 19, but while technically grown-up, has never had to deal with the grown-up world on a true one on one basis.  She has had her own problems that she has had to deal with (after deciding that she was all grown up at 18), but Mom and Dad have always been there to catch her when she faltered.</p>
<p>When my daughter moved out (okay, ran off) in mid September of 2011 to go live with her then boyfriend and his parents, she learned that things weren&#8217;t as bad at home as she thought they were.  Apparently we were horrible monsters because we did things like make her do her homework, go to school, clean her room, wash the dishes, and take care of the pets.  Six months later she was 5 months pregnant and pretty much begging to come home.  We took her back with open arms, but at the same time the wife and I had finally found the perfect comfort level.  We had all the bills under control.  We enjoyed each other&#8217;s company.  Now we had another mouth to feed and another person to add back into our personal dynamic.  It was hard, but we managed.</p>
<p>A month after this happened I found out that I was losing my job.  I was given two years to find another spot to land in the company or be unemployed.  At 47 I did not need to be unemployed, so I took a much more physical job than the one I had.  The other option was to try and get a job with more stress or one that would likely be abolished in a future round of budget cuts.  My schedule changed, but I assured everyone that we would be okay.  I would actually end up making more money per paycheck.  </p>
<p>In July my granddaughter was born.  I love her dearly, but I was also faced with another human being that ultimately I would end up being responsible for taking care of.  My daughter would look after her and my wife would make sure she was fed and clothed and clean (tasks my daughter still has difficulty with performing for herself), but I would have to work to pay for her food and her clothes.  My daughter originally planned to breast feed exclusively.  That soon changed to occasionally and was eventually supplanted entirely by bottles of formula.  Formula is not cheap.</p>
<p>Her husband (they were married in March, but he is still only 17) moved in around October and we also started moving around that time.  They lived in the old house while we lived in the new house, and I paid for the utilities on both houses.  In December my son and his wife moved into the old house and my daughter and her family moved in to our new house.  It&#8217;s a long complicated game of musical houses, don&#8217;t ask.</p>
<p>So around this time we&#8217;re trying to move, trying to get set up for Christmas and Thanksgiving, and keep everything going when my paycheck gets screwed up.  In my old position I was responsible for making sure all the employees in my unit got paid.  In the new position I have to hope that the supervisors remember to put in things like paid leave.  Needless to say, one of them didn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>My health also decided to start really giving me problems.  My blood sugar would spike or would bottom out and my asthma became more debilitating than it had been in years because I was getting into so much dust, and dirt, and pet odors during the move all while exerting myself physically and then headed to work where I would perform even more physical lifting and loading.  </p>
<p>Here we are now in February and I am still trying to recover financially from two screwed up checks, holiday expenses, and feeding a family of five.  Today my blood sugar spiked high.  I was shaking.  I couldn&#8217;t function and had to call off from work.  I ended up sitting in a recliner and sleeping most of the day.  When I was awake, I was silently fighting the urge to break down and cry.  I know my life isn&#8217;t nearly as bad as so many other people&#8217;s.  I know we will eventually get things straightened out.  I know we will eventually get moved, get the kids into their own place, and get a quiet and restful home life, but right now all I can think about is why do I have to be the strong one?  Why do I have to put on the brave face and not let anyone know how bad I&#8217;m hurting?  How did Mom handle things like this and make it look so easy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I want to begin this post with a disclaimer and an admission. Some days, when I’m not overhearing other people’s conversations or writing inane lists, I have serious thoughts about serious things. Mostly I just add those thoughts to an inane list and ramble in person about it to anyone who foolishly gives me an opportunity to do so. Today is a little different, because today people were asking for my thoughts before I’d thought about them. As per, I’ve been out flouncing around art galleries all day, so (and here’s the first part of that disclaimer) I am writing this on my phone, on the tube, with only a cursory glance at the headlines and half an hour of BBC news videos as evidence. Next the admission: people wanted my thoughts today because as well as being a young woman, I am also a Catholic and a theologian by trade. I think that’s probably given away the news in question, but let me add the second part of my disclaimer before I begin: this is incredibly reactionary. I realise that what I have to say will cause some people to tell me I’m a bad feminist and/or a bad Catholic, but I don’t profess to be very good at either. I do try my best to be a decent human in general though, so hopefully you can cut me a little slack. I don’t have all the answers &#8211; I don’t even have all the questions &#8211; and if you ask me again tomorrow I might have changed my mind. If you are still reading at this point, I salute you. If you don’t want to hear my thoughts about the resignation of the Pope, now is your cue to leave &#8211; I’ll write you a silly list soon. For the rest of you, excuse the seriousness and let’s cue the titles</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://whattheblackbirdsaid.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/3840078676_467141359e_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-95 aligncenter" alt="Papal Audience, 2009" src="http://whattheblackbirdsaid.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/3840078676_467141359e_z.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This morning news broke that at 8pm on 28th February, Pope Benedict XVI will resign from his office at the head of the Roman Catholic Church. This is the first time this has happened for 600 years and, understandably, the ripple of reaction has spread around the world. This particular drop in the ocean of response is inherently personal but carries with it whatever insight is afforded by being a young catholic, a feminist and (in education at least) a theologian. It will almost certainly be at odds with the views of some Catholics, some feminists and some young people, but it is an honest attempt to provide an initial response from a personal point of view, and to answer the five questions that have been put to me repeatedly today.</p>
<p><strong>On the practical implications:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>After 8pm on 28th February, the current Pope will no longer be referred to as His Holiness and will be known again as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. It is expected that he will take some time away at the summer residence while his successor is appointed. Though as a cardinal he ought to attend conclave, his age precludes him from voting. After this, he will live elsewhere in the Vatican. The implications of the current Pope living in close proximity to the newly elected Pope seem widely assumed to be negative. This is not necessarily the case. Cormac Murphy O’Connor commented today “<i>Who would want to be Pope?”</i> -  I wonder whether the answer might be ‘someone who has the voice of experience close at hand’ (This might be particularly relevant for one of his potential successors, as we will see).</p>
<p>There has been some debate regarding the resignation in general &#8211; given John Paul II’s stoic sense of the papacy as a life-long duty in particular, but also simply in terms of whether the office is ‘just a job’. I think the Pope has more than addressed this in his speech, which you can read <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2013/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20130211_declaratio_en.html">here</a>. ‘Resignation’ is our language, but put simply, the Pope has been entitled to renounce his office for the best part of 800 years. Our sensationalist tendencies will no doubt draw out countless dramatic comparisons with the last Pope to do so, Gregory XII, who stood down in 1415 at an incredibly difficult time in the Church’s history. I would suggest a better comparison might be with Celestine V, the Pope who passed the decree which made it possible in 1294. A Benedictine, he too was considered old at his succession, and stepped down after five months in office citing his waning physical strength amongst his reasons for doing so. At the top of Celestine V’s list, however, was the desire for humility, and I think that same humility is characteristic of  Benedict XVI’s decision too.</p>
<p>Today’s news left me sad, but also deeply encouraged &#8211; I cannot even begin to imagine the pressure that he must have felt and the personal anguish that coming to this decision must have caused. Yet it was a decision taken entirely in private, away from the external pressures that (until now) have characterised his papacy, and with a focus solely upon the best way to lead the Church in accordance with God’s will. I struggle to call to mind a better example in modern times of the courage and humility required to set aside self-interest for the sake of the Church. In purely practical terms, it is an action that is, literally, crucially Christian.</p>
<p><strong>On the timing of the decision:</strong></p>
<p>Again, the timing of this announcement reflects a degree of humility in its Kantian disinterest (that is to say its setting aside of self-interest). The Pope understands first hand the pressure of succeeding a Pope who has died &#8211; the demands of leading the Church through their mourning, the potential for the suddenness of the transition and the uncharacteristic urgency that all of this adds to the office. The Pope is far from rude health and, to be practical rather than morbid, his increasing ailment and advancing years mean that, were he to continue in office, there would be the very real potential of that issue arising again. Though there have been many criticisms levelled at him, it is perhaps a product of my respect for him as a theologian that I would defy anyone who argued that he does not have an acute awareness of the needs of the Church. Hans Kung might be appalled to hear me describe Joseph Ratzinger as one of the greatest living theologians, but I truly believe that he is, and this insight has informed his papacy. He fully understands that this is, in many ways, a time of great vulnerability for the Church; he fully understands the need for the Church to play the game and not just watch from the touchlines. By affecting the transition of the papacy in this way, he is allowing his successor to keep a firm grip of the wheel, affording him as few complications as possible.</p>
<p>Some will argue that the Pope’s resignation heightens the urgency of this ‘crucial moment’. Perhaps so, but perhaps equally there is little point in postponing the inevitable. To labour the earlier analogy, there is no time out in this game. It seems particularly relevant that the announcement comes in the wake of the publication of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust"><i>The Pope’s Jews</i></a>. Critics love to play on Benedict XVI’s experiences in the Hitler youth, almost as much as they enjoyed criticising the apparent inertia of the Vatican at that time of crisis. The publication of this book challenges that perception, but has a wider message that is relevant: firstly, to quote the author, Gordon Thomas, <i>&#8220;The church thinks across centuries. If there&#8217;s a dispute for 50 years, so what?&#8221;</i> &#8211; the priority is upon action not upon the perception of that action; secondly, public perception of the inner workings of the Vatican is not always right. My point is this &#8211; I believe it would be incredibly naive to argue that the Pope’s decision is a reaction to scandal or contemporary issues that face the Church. This is not a cowardly man running away from the moment but an astute leader ensuring that the moment does not run away from his Church.</p>
<p>It is also no coincidence that his resignation will take effect at the heart of Lent &#8211; what better spiritual narrative to accompany a time of testing and assert the triumph of faithfulness? The appointment of his successor should take place before Easter &#8211; what better time to begin a new chapter?</p>
<p><strong>On the theological implications:</strong></p>
<p>I doubt that there is enough ink in the world to satisfy the amount that could potentially be spilled debating the theological implications of this decision. Certainly the Pope appears to be setting a precedent for departure from expectation, but we must be careful to hold this in tension with a theology and a papacy that has been markedly conservative in nature. We might more accurately argue that this decision is a further expression of that which has underpinned his conservative stance, namely that acute awareness of the vulnerability of the Church. Once again, I think it helpful to bear in mind the idea that the Church thinks across centuries. It has not existed for thousands of years by being bowing to the pressures of modernity. That is not to say that it should be an institution immune to criticism or progression of thought, but to say that there is sound political and theological underpinning to cautious conservatism. Under the weight of that responsibility Cormac Murphy O’Connor’s words today once again loom large.</p>
<p>The Guardian today published a list of pressing issues that it believes await the new Pope when he is elected. You can read that list <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/11/next-pope-five-key-issues">here</a>. Are all of these issues immediately thrown wide open with the succession of a new Pope? In short, I think the answer is no &#8211; as we have seen, the Church’s conservative stance is the product of more than papal opinion. In theological terms, I see most scope for potential flexibility in terms of the Church’s position on contraception and homosexuality, when addressed in terms of the dignity of the person, but the repercussions of that line of reasoning leave little room for a change of perspective regarding abortion and the role of women in the clergy. I am perhaps in a minority of feminists who would not see this as a bad thing &#8211; I do not see abortion as the absolute right of a liberated woman and I do not see a male priesthood solely as an arbitrary reinforcement of the history of patriarchy. I am less clear of the extent to which I am in a minority of Catholics by seeing room for a revisitation of the former two issues. Perhaps conversely with this line of theological reasoning, I do not expect to see much engagement with the issue of equal marriage &#8211; that cautious conservatism that has preserved the Church’s longevity will presumably encourage the new Pope to watch as that issue unfolds in the Church of England first.</p>
<p><strong>On succession:</strong></p>
<p>On the subject of the new Pope, I am entirely in agreement with Patrick Kelly, who told a BBC reporter today that there was no point in playing a guessing game. Understandably, this will not discourage the world from speculating, presumably by the same logic that encourages people to take gambling odds from Paddy Power on Bono or Father Dougal Maguire as the next in line of apostolic succession.</p>
<p>The media will probably be excited by four or five main candidates. Peter Turkson of Ghana, Fracis Arinze of Nigeria and Leonardo Sandri of Argentina will doubtless appear at the top of many lists with good reason. As well as their individual merits, there is a real unifying value in electing a Pope who has a direct engagement with theologies of liberation, as all of these men have -  that said, we might argue that the young Joseph Ratzinger’s experiences in Germany went some way towards that. I think however, there is a particular challenge to be addressed by the Church in Africa and South America at present, which needs strong leadership in an immediate capacity. There is much ground to be covered in establishing a truly universal church and a sense in which the leadership of a ‘liberation Pope’ in Rome might still be too countercultural to be productive. Slow progress perhaps, but there is a theological argument for it yet. Similarly, timing might go against another media favourite, Timothy Dolan from New York. The presence of America in the current socio-political climate might be of detriment to the effectiveness of the papacy; as much could be said for any potential ‘super-power Pope.’</p>
<p>At present, there are three potential candidates who seem most likely. Canadian Marc Oullet has all of the cosmopolitan appeal of Timothy Dolan whilst remaining theologically close to the current Pope. On the surface he seems to fit with the potential theological trajectory outlined above, but it is difficult to tell how deeply his conservatism runs &#8211; he is best know for his strong stance on abortion, but that is hardly indicative. Age is also on his side &#8211; he is not yet 70. Another strong candidate is Angelo Bagnasco, the current Archbishop of Genoa. He is intellectually well respected, multi-lingual and has spoken prominently (and critically) of Italian culture and the negative role models provided by Silvio Berlusconi and other key figures. He is regarded as the Pope’s lieutenant in Italy, and seems to have a good sense of the interplay between secular issues and theology.</p>
<p>The most obvious candidate to me, however, is Gianfranco Ravasi who heads the Pontifical Council for Culture. As such he is acutely aware of all of the theological issues that are currently prominent, as well as of the importance of dialogue and interplay between the Church and other cultures. He is a renowned Biblical scholar based in Rome, and combines a natural charisma with a keen intellect and media awareness. His main weakness is the fact that he has never been bishop of a large archdiocese, so his pastoral credentials are somewhat unproven. However, given his strengths in all other areas, and with the unprecedented presence of a former Pope living in the Vatican, he seems the ideal candidate. As mentioned previously, this circumnavigates the potential difficulties of the presence of a ‘dowager-Pope’, who instead becomes an invaluable source of support without undermining papal authority. It is a scenario that is unprecedented, but by no means impossible.</p>
<p><strong>On conspiracy theories:</strong></p>
<p>The internet will undoubtedly explode with a wealth of conspiracy theories, including plenty which will compensate for the underwhelming Mayan Apocalypse we experienced in December. Dan Brown is unlikely to be seen for weeks. Nevertheless, there is probably enough intellectual stimulation in the facts alone to keep the rest of us from concerning ourselves with wild speculation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, today’s news will, I hope, become this Pope’s legacy for the right reasons. His approach to the gravity of the decision is a testament to his character as a man and as a Christian, and a brilliant example of his theological insight. It shows a reverence for the authority of the see prioritised above the holder, and so rightly orientated towards God, but also shows an awareness of the contemporary world and the importance of stability in transition. It is a heartbreaking decision that is incredibly brave and demonstrates both wisdom and humility. It is an example to all, and inspirationally encouraging in faith.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Mike and I spent the morning driving around the property checking the water and the stock.  We do this every second day, due to the fact that sheep are in fact very fussy water drinkers and we need to keep an eye on the feed.</p>
<p>A lot of sheep will avoid drinking water if there is dust settled on top.  It&#8217;s been very dry, and sadly not much of the feed is left, so the sandy ground has become exposed and is blowing all over the place.</p>
<p>We also spent time laying down a line of oats for the merinos who are in desperate need of energy.  You&#8217;ll see a trail of yellow in the photo below, which is scary how obvious it is when there isn&#8217;t much else around.  Our pets are free to roam around our house, driveway and shearing shed yards.  It&#8217;s safe to say they are the fattest of the 12,000 here.  They have plenty of green grass.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot about what types of grass can endure a summer here in Western Australia (cooch is one, it&#8217;s an import, and perennials are also summer hardy).  Unfortunately both are very expensive.  And while we&#8217;ve got green feed to get us through the worst of summer, it&#8217;s been a bad season for the sheep prices and we&#8217;re feeding many mouths that should have already been sold to market.</p>
<p>Farming is a lot of gambling.  Brian once said to me, he doesn&#8217;t gamble at casinos.  I asked him &#8220;Why not?&#8221; and his answer was quite simple:  &#8221;I spend every day on the farm gambling, and taking risks!&#8221;  Fair enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I&#8217;d be up all night worrying if I had such monetary and life responsibilities on my shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On that note, I&#8217;ve recently finished reading &#8220;The Grapes of Wrath&#8221; by John Stienbeck.  If you&#8217;ve not read the American classic, I recommend picking up a copy.  The novel was written over 70 years ago, and details the plight of displaced farmers travelling to California, trying to get by.  Times were hard.  The story offers a lesson to stand as one voice and be heard when there is injustice.  It&#8217;s a scary thought to realise that nothing has changed since the story was written.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Lately there has been a movement toward sustainability, small farms, locally sourced food, free range, and ethical produce.  I hope this trend continues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve just knocked down my summer garden, and am getting it ready for our winter garden.  This morning I&#8217;ve been shovelling sheep manure and transporting it to my plot.  It&#8217;s now 2x larger and I&#8217;m bursting with ideas to improve my crop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The sun is a killer here.  Nearly everything kicked the bucket early.  I&#8217;ve got to sort it out.</p>
