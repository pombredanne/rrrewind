			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mceTemp" style="text-align:left;"><em>This article first appeared in <a href="http://paloalto.patch.com/topics/Lisen+Stromberg">Palo Alto Patch.</a></em></div>
<div class="mceTemp" style="text-align:left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:15px;line-height:20px;"><a href="http://lisenstromberg.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/steve_jobs3.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-275" title="steve_jobs" src="http://lisenstromberg.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/steve_jobs3.jpeg?w=150&#038;h=112" alt="He's More Than Just An Icon" width="150" height="112" /></a>My neighbor, Steve Jobs, has been in the news lately. The talk of the town is the recent announcement he will be stepping aside to let other seeds grow at Apple. The business press, the general press, the blogosphere, and just about everybody else has waxed poetic about the “greatest CEO of all time” saying that this “boy wonder” has shaped the very nature of our lives with his genius. </span></div>
<p><span id="more-273"></span></p>
<p>It’s all true, but here in Palo Alto, Steve Jobs isn’t just an icon, he’s also the guy who lives down the street.</p>
<p>I first met Steve (does anyone call him Mr. Jobs anymore?) years ago at a backyard pool party. I was so flummoxed by the off chance I was breathing in his DNA, I could barely say a word. I am sure I made a winning first impression as I stumbled over my own name when we were introduced.</p>
<p>I watched as he swam in the pool with his son. He seemed like a regular guy, a good dad having fun with his kids.</p>
<p>The next time I met him was when our children attended school together. He sat in on back-to-school night listening to the teacher drone on about the value of education (wait, isn’t he one of those high-tech gods who didn’t even graduate from college?) while the rest of us sat around pretending having Steve Jobs in the room was totally normal.</p>
<p>Not long after, I saw Steve as I was running in our neighborhood. He was deep in conversation with a younger version of himself &#8212; his very own mini-me in jeans, black tee-shirt, and wire-rimmed glasses. I must have looked like an idiot as I tripped over a crack in the pavement trying to give them wide berth.</p>
<p>It was at Halloween not long after when I realized he actually knew my name (yes, my name!). He and his wife put on a darn scary haunted house (to be specific, a haunted garden). He was sitting on the walkway, dressed like Frankenstein. As I walked by with my son, Steve smiled and said, “Hi Lisen.” My son thought I was the coolest mom in town when he realized <em>The</em> Steve Jobs knew me.</p>
<p>Thanks for the coolness points, Steve.</p>
<p>From then on, when I saw him holding his executive meetings in our neighborhood, I didn’t hesitate to smile and say hi. Steve always returned the favor, proving he may be a genius, but he is also a good neighbor.</p>
<p>In time, things changed. The walks were less frequent, the gait slower, the smile not so ready. Earlier this year when I saw Steve and his wife walking down our street holding hands, I knew something was different. Now, so does the rest of the world.</p>
<p>While <em>Newsweek</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and CNET continue to drone on about the impact of the Steve Jobs era,  I won’t be pondering the MacBook Air I write on or the iPhone I talk on. I will think of the day I saw him at his son’s high school graduation. There Steve stood, tears streaming down his cheeks, his smile wide and proud, as his son received his diploma and walked on into his own bright future leaving behind a good man and a good father who can be sure of the rightness of this, perhaps his most important legacy of all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We arrived to <a href="http://www.lmguayabillas.blogspot.com/">El centro de rescate de vida silvestre en Guayabilla</a> thanks to a coincidence. But as it goes in life, nothing happens for no reason and we happened to have the most amazing two days in our lives (even though the journey of Hecha y Derecha competes with this status every day and it seems like things cannot get better and more interesting and they always do!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We arrived to Ibarra straight from the Colombian border and after a walk around this beautiful colonial town and tasting its amazing ice cream we headed out to the sanctuary. It was already dark when we arrived so the only animal we saw was a dog, Peluca, who recently gave birth to 7 puppies, the cutest creatures you can imagine.</p>

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">one of the 7 puppies of proud mother Peluca</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The center takes care of injured and abandoned wild animals. After the necessary health care all the animals capable of living in their natural environment are returned back to nature. Unluckily many animals are not able to survive without human help and so they stay in the center as a reminder to its visitants rising awareness about abuse of wild animals. Many of them were kidnapped from their natural environment as babies and sold on a black market. After their owners got fed up with their exotic pets they were abandoned and turned into the center in very bad condition.</p>
<p>In the morning we got brooms, rakes and buckets of food for animals and we start cleaning and feeding.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m 48 so it&#8217;s safe to say I might be half way though my time on this planet and I&#8217;ve been wondering something since I was about eight or ten.<br />
<em>When am I going to become sophisticated?</em><br />
<div id="attachment_2364" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://lizybee.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/grace-kelly.jpeg"><img src="http://lizybee.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/grace-kelly.jpeg?w=400&#038;h=500" alt="" title="Ms. Sophistication" width="400" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-2364" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Still waiting to see her smiling back at me when I look in the mirror each morning</p></div><br />
Grace, maturity, elegance, refinement have all eluded me my entire life. I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to possess athleticism, good humor and some brains but that air of culture and urbane sophistication has completely eclipsed my personal development. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a buffoon, tripping from one mishap to another ala Mr. Magoo. It&#8217;s more of subtle lack of charm punctuated by a few epic moments of utter cringeworthy uncouthness. </p>
<p>My first year of ballet lessons (I was about six) ended with a pageant. Each class danced. My class did a re-enactment of dancing poodles. We had an odd number in our group so I danced alone in the center amid dancing poodles pairs. At some point during our 2 minute routine, I decided as the <em>solo</em> dancing poodle, I must be the Star Poodle. When it came time to take our bow, I decided the Star Poodle should be in front of the rest of the poodles and I stepped over the floor light at the front of the stage&#8211;and found myself trying to balance on a 2-inch ledge. My Prima Ballerina attitude disappeared when my teacher hauled me off my perch for a good scolding while the other poodles made graceful little plies and bows.</p>
<p>I started high school in eighth grade (we had a very small high school). The layout of the building was unofficially designated by areas of cool and uncool. The front hall was where all the seniors sat after lunch. As an eighth grader, there was no way I should have even been in the front hallway&#8211;we were relegated to the back hall but there I was, trying to be suave and casual, leaning on the brick wall watching the cool seniors. I&#8217;m sure I was thinking I could get away with it because my oldest sister was a senior and she wouldn&#8217;t send me away. I decided to emphasize my suave and casual look by crossing my ankles as I leaned, hoping I would be seen as so sophisticated that all would forget I was a nerdy 8th grader. Alas, it was not to be. I started to slip down the wall after I crossed my ankles. Instead of uncrossing, I tried to maintain the pose by scootching back on my heels and somehow ended up doing a really bad combo of the Can-Can/Russian cossack dance that ended quite badly only after I got each senior&#8217;s attention. My sister still laughs at that one.<br />
<div id="attachment_2381" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 221px"><a href="http://lizybee.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/imgres.jpeg"><img src="http://lizybee.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/imgres.jpeg?w=211&#038;h=230" alt="" title="Half Can-Can, Half Russian Cossack" width="211" height="230" class="size-full wp-image-2381" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how I looked about halfway through my routine</p></div><br />
And then there was the time I tried to pull off a certain ease of refinement that failed so obviously that I can barely relate it but here goes: I was a papergirl in high school&#8211;people got their papers but I was dismal about turning in my collection&#8211;so bad that my route money had to be picked-up by the boss. It didn&#8217;t make him happy to to drive up my driveway to collect the paper money, especially in the winter when the driveway was coated in ice so I ran out to meet him. Just as I handed him the envelope, I slipped on the ice and ended up lying on my back on the side of the driveway. I thought the best way to handle that was to casually continue my conversation as though I always slid to a lying position while being yelled at for not turning in paper route money. He just stared at me in shocked disgust as I breezily chatted away. Then he backed down the driveway. It still makes me cringe.</p>
<p>Sadly,I haven&#8217;t grown out of my inelegance. I have discovered more times than I care to admit that my fly is undone or I&#8217;ve been riding with my bike helmet on backwards (can you believe it?) I do see that much of it is little things that most people do and laugh at themselves. Still, occasionally I really ding the bell of the Uncharmed-For-Life.</p>
<p>My latest? Well it&#8217;s uncomfortable, that&#8217;s for sure. It was a Friday night, I was all dressed up and driving to my youngest son&#8217;s school fundraiser. My husband was driving from work&#8211;not a problem, I didn&#8217;t mind arriving solo but I did miss my dearest for a very important reason. I couldn&#8217;t zip up my dress all the way. It was one of those fitted dresses that gapped in the middle of the back when I tried to zip it. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have a maid or super flexible arm sockets so I decided to wear a little cardigan over my half-zipped dress and have my husband discreetly zip me up when I got there.<br />
Of course none of that happened. This is what happened: the dress started unzipping as I walked across the parking lot. My husband hadn&#8217;t yet arrived so my temporary solution was to stretch my short little cardigan beyond it&#8217;s breaking point until I could get into the ladies room. Of course I was stopped at the reception table. By the headmaster&#8217;s wife who is pleasant and friendly but we&#8217;ve just never had any exchange deeper than, &#8220;Hi! How are you?&#8221;<br />
I was in a panic about how much I was gaping in back so I had <em>no idea</em> what she was saying to me but it definitely appeared she was leaning in for a hug. What could I do? I couldn&#8217;t snub her! I had to get it over as quickly as possible so I pushed my chin onto her shoulder and gave her this incredibly awkward, lower-arm-with-elbows-tucked, handicapped embrace with my hands still clutching the sweater. Thankfully she went with it but gave me such a look after the painfully long moment and said, &#8220;I just wanted to know if you wanted the steak or fish?&#8221; I really don&#8217;t remember what I answered. How&#8217;s that for elegance?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. Because I really want to waste 30 minutes to an hour of my time just so people can poke me, prod me and otherwise get on my nerves.</p>
<p>2. All the dentist speak. All doctors do it, so you know what I&#8217;m talking about. For instance, &#8220;She&#8217;s got a problem with her lower T-12. We&#8217;re going to have to ostracize it and cross-counter the white-balance so as to prevent problems in the future on that bicucpid.&#8221; Okay&#8230;what?!?! Speak English. I&#8217;m RIGHT HERE IN THE CHAIR. Also, what am I? A computer or a piece of hardware?!</p>
<p>3. The scraping tools. I should know what they&#8217;re called, seeing as my mother works there(although only as a receptionist), but I don&#8217;t. I just hate that feeling of hard metal, grinding against my teeth. Who doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>4. When the dental hygenist asks you a question and you clearly can&#8217;t answer because their hands are in your mouth. Really, trust me, I&#8217;d love to talk about my brother&#8217;s love of duck(which is somewhat strange, if you ask me, considering his former loves were Big Macs and turkey sandwiches) or the fact that I&#8217;m taking a semester off from college, which you probably think is extremely lazy of me, but I can&#8217;t. You inserted your gloved hand down my mouth cavity and I can&#8217;t speak around it.</p>
<p>5. Whenever they insert those aforementioned tools in your mouth, scrape, and come up with some previously consumed snack food residue. They wince, you wince, and it&#8217;s just altogether an awkward experience and, I feel, an invasion of my privacy. You needn&#8217;t know all that I had to eat yesterday..or days prior.</p>
<p>6. And now that we&#8217;ve gotten to that&#8230;attacks on your dental hygiene. &#8220;Do you floss 5 times a day?&#8221;, &#8220;Does your toothbrush get more action than you?&#8221;, &#8220;Do you consider using fluoride a must?&#8221; NOOOOO!!!! I will be the first to admit that I don&#8217;t floss, unless it&#8217;s on special occassions such as Hanukkah, which I don&#8217;t even celebrate because I&#8217;m not Jewish. Touching wet, saliva-covered pieces of string and pulling them in between my gums is not my idea of fun. I don&#8217;t even wear my retainer. How do you like me now?</p>
<p>7. When they tell me how small my mouth is because they a-l-w-a-y-s do this. Well, if my mouth is so small, then it should be completely understandable that I cannot reach those back two teeth with a rotating, gargantuan toothbrush. (That same toothbrush was my Easter present. Hallelujiah! Now I can brush and brush and brush my problems away!!! Because isn&#8217;t that what the season is all about?!) I would also like to say that those two teeth? They weren&#8217;t there until about, oh, circa 2008. I am not entirely used to the fact that they are there, seeing as the oral surgeon had to uncover them because of the previously mentioned &#8220;small mouth&#8221; problem. They literally were unable to come in.</p>
<p>8. I don&#8217;t like my dentist. He&#8217;s an okay man, I guess, but I still hold a grudge against him. He&#8217;s not the most tactful man ever to roam the earth. One time, during Shark Week, I was getting my teeth cleaned and he compared my molars to that of a lemon shark. Thank..you?</p>
<p>9. My mom works there. Which makes it..weird. Convenient, how she can just schedule me and I can walk right in, but..still weird. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you about what happeed in there. The only way it could be more awkward is if she was a receptionist at the gynecologist.</p>
<p>10. They always tell you, &#8220;This won&#8217;t hurt.&#8221; Sometimes they&#8217;re telling the truth, sometimes they&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s usually a 50/50 gamble between searing pain and a mild jerking feeling. But just in general, I don&#8217;t like pain or inconvenience. When that sucking thing ejects your spit back onto you, when they try to x-ray your teeth and you nearly choke on the thing that&#8217;s supposed to keep your mouth open, when they give you those gift bags with free toothbrushes. I don&#8217;t need them. Give them to children in Somalia!</p>
<p>And those are, in summary, the reasons I do not like the dentist.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_834" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><img class="size-full wp-image-834" title="" src="http://alainamabaso.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mcdains-kid.jpg?w=450&#038;h=278" alt="" width="450" height="278" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Eat At McDains.</p></div>
<p>Waiting at a sandwich joint for a magazine interview, I was looking over my notes as a young mother with little blond twins – probably two years or less – took up residence at an adjacent table. Their two-seated stroller, piled high with jackets, provisions and blankets, only lacked a team of huskies to be ready for the Iditarod.</p>
<p>Ensconced in two high-chairs, the girls got to work. A small plush Elmo hit the floor under the table, along with a tiny pink plaid pillow, a Sesame Street board book, and a minute plastic toy bottle. A baby doll in its own pink plaid bed and miniature pacifier presided on the tabletop.</p>
<p>Mom left the table to pick up a salad, a bag of chips, and a piping-hot bowl of macaroni. She divided the chips and macaroni between the girls on two plates, and left again to grab a wad of napkins. My feature notes forgotten, I wondered what responsibility I bore as an adult bystander as one of the girls plunged a utensil into the macaroni and slowly maneuvered a massive, steaming spoonful toward her mouth.</p>
<p>The little girl spat out the scalding macaroni with remarkable calm, a soft splutter sending the creamy pasta rolling down her shirt and onto the restaurant carpet, where they splatted to rest beside Elmo. As Mom seated herself and dug into her salad, the girls scattered potato chips into a table-top archipelago. Soon, Mom produced a huge, candy-studded cookie and broke it in half. Instead of taking bites of the cookies, the girls pressed them vertically into their faces, the better to gnaw the embedded M&amp;Ms off the tops. Crumbs peppered the table-top, the carpet, and the long-suffering Elmo.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835" title="" src="http://alainamabaso.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cookie-eating.jpg?w=450&#038;h=444" alt="" width="450" height="444" /></p>
<p>It was all over surprisingly fast. Mom lifted the girls, who began to wail at the injustice, back into the stroller. As she strapped them in despite the protest and gathered their toys, a small, heretofore unseen black-and-white plush monkey hit the floor. I picked it up and handed it to her as she passed. She took it wordlessly, pushed the stroller through the door, and was gone.</p>
<p>I assume parents are still human, despite their responsibility for little beings who, while not noisome, are certainly noisy. I’m sure parents like to go out and have a tasty salad for lunch like anyone else. No doubt their children gain valuable socialization as well as sub-par nutrition through visiting restaurants.</p>
<p>We could have gone on indefinitely, quietly tolerating the noisy presence of youngsters almost everywhere, but for a stalwart restaurant owner near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Fed up with parents who will not remove their screaming kids, owner Mike Vuick of McDains restaurant and golf club banned all children under six. There are some who appreciated it: one article reports that his business has risen 20% since he instituted the rule. But he’s also raised a veritable firestorm in the world of parents, children and consumers who want to enjoy what they’ve purchased in peace.</p>
<p>I participated in a recent debate over the public presence of children when my former employer, Philadelphia&#8217;s Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site, considered reversing its policy banning all children under seven from the premises. The original policy was in place because the city apparently declared that the site would be hazardous to anyone under five, and museum staffers assumed many parents would disregard this warning and dissemble about their five and six-year-olds&#8217; age. (The staffers were right: if they had set the policy at five years old, there would undoubtedly have been an epidemic of unusually small five-year-olds, instead of suspiciously young-looking seven-year-olds.)</p>
<p>I thought the original policy was nothing short of brilliant. As a tour guide, not only was I relatively free from questions on murder, incarceration, abuse or the death penalty from the under-five set, I also experienced remarkable peace of mind knowing that absent-minded parents’ toddlers did not have access to the broken windows, crumbling walls, rusty metal protrusions and flaking lead paint of the dilapidated 19<sup>th</sup>-century prison.</p>
<p>But then, possibly motivated by a desire to educate the world’s preschoolers on American penal history, or a growing sensitivity to the potential loss of revenue and visitor traffic occasioned by families who went elsewhere upon learning of the child ban,  or parents&#8217; general convenience, Eastern State Penitentiary reversed the policy to welcome all ages, even offering free admission to the littlest ones.</p>
<p>Some employees thought we were on the brink of an unprecedented form of workplace hell, with strollers, diaper bins and wailing babies added to the tours we gave in the dusty, un-climate-controlled, centipede-ridden prison, which was already crammed with avid fans of TV shows like “Ghost Adventures.”</p>
<p>Sure, I had the frequent joy of delivering midsummer tours about architecture over a chorus of sweaty three-year-olds’ miserable howls. And once young children were admitted to the site, I witnessed more explosive vomiting in a few months than I had in my entire previous life. But in truth, life went on with far fewer child-related crises than some of us had anticipated. I often skipped the death row segment on my elementary school tours, and we all seemed to adapt pretty well.</p>
<p>So I feel qualified to discuss the effects of barring or admitting children. I’ve recently spent time on a few progressive mommies’ blogs which denounce what they deem “child-hate” or “child-bigotry”. These writers claim that many traditional manners required of children, as well as complaints against the public presence of children, are the last bastion of a socially acceptable apartheid: innocent children, to whom we should strive to be friends as well as parents, suffer from adults&#8217; intolerance.</p>
<p>I’m not on board with the children’s civil rights movement. Children are the only marginalized group I know of whose suffering is invariably solved simply by letting a few years go by (sometimes even less time than that, with good behavior).</p>
<p>A public service message I recently watched while waiting at an Amtrak station also comes to mind. In the film, spunky, authoritative canines sniffed suitcases, and upright citizens phoned security to report abandoned bags.</p>
<p>“Remember,” counseled the voice-over, “there are NO suspicious<em> people</em>. Only suspicious<em> behavior</em>s.” No racial profiling, I think Amtrak means to say: for someone to be considered a security risk, one must observe specific troublesome actions, not the rider’s apparent race, age, sex, nationality or religion.</p>
<p>Same goes for children. They’re not barred from certain establishments because of who they are, the way African Americans were barred from many businesses for decades. Children are barred because of how they often behave.</p>
<p>Child-free areas remind me of local efforts to control destructive non-native species. Do we bemoan the proliferation of stink bugs, European starlings or pine beetles because we bear natural hatred against these species? No.  It’s because these and other imported species, having gotten in where they don’t belong, cause expensive crop damage, crowd out ecologically crucial native species, and can even destroy the landscape. I know, it’s probably a poor analogy, since the poor bugs, birds and beetles can’t improve their behavior, while growing children can, with time. And no squalling child ever felled the pine forests of the Rockies. But the fact still stands that some creatures aren&#8217;t welcome in some places, because of what they habitually do. Reporter Jim Durkin, for wxpi.com, quotes Vuick: there’s “nothing wrong with babies, but the fact is you can’t control their volume.”</p>
<p>I don’t resent children for their lack of ability to modulate their voices or stand still for thirty seconds at a time, or their penchant for wailing loudly without warning or apparent provocation (I was a child once, and so were you). I just want to be able to spend occasional leisure time out of earshot of children, if I so choose. I think that establishments &#8211; especially those with a bar, like McDains &#8211; have the right to delay the welcome for a few years, in order to cater to adults, their targeted customers. In the meantime, there are plenty of places which cater happily to young families. Parents who think their bundle of joy should be entitled to go anywhere, at any time, despite the amount of noise the kid is making, are being as childish as their poor screaming toddler.</p>
<p>Of course children should be able to act like children, and be loved prodigiously. But I think a few calm and quiet child-free spaces should be a privilege of adulthood, especially when customers pay a lot of money to enjoy a movie, a play or concert, or a nice dinner. Honestly, in some cases, a ban on young children is a favor to the child as much as the adults. Eastern State Penitentiary was well within its rights to exclude the youngsters &#8211; both for safety reasons and for the reason of catering to the customers who are most interested in architecture, penal history, and &#8220;hauntings&#8221;: adults. Are there really any Pennsylvania four-year-olds who are stricken by their inability to eat at McDain’s for two more years, when Chuck E. Cheese’s is open for business?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post first appeared on August 1 on the <a href="http://ip.sc.edu/index.php?option=com_easyblog&amp;view=entry&amp;id=194&amp;Itemid=1017" target="_blank">University of South Carolina&#8217;s study abroad blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>If you had told me a year ago that this past Wednesday I would have started my day before the sun rose by climbing into a pick-up truck with two Argentine men and one American to drive two hours into the Andes while rocking to ACDC’s <em>You Shook Me All Night Long</em>, I would have told you that you were insane.  But, that’s exactly how my most recent Wednesday began.</p>
<p>After the completion of our month-long intensive Spanish course, we had a week break to do some traveling.  My friend Campbell and I decided to head up to Salta, in Northern Argentina, to escape the city and get some fresh air.  The Friday evening after our last class, we climbed into a bus and 22 hours later, arrived in Salta. We spent our first couple of days exploring the city and it’s main squares (reminded me a lot of Savannah, Georgia) and visiting the various art museums.</p>
<p><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_040.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-379" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_040" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_040.jpg?w=418&#038;h=277" alt="" width="418" height="277" /></a><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_086.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-383" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_086" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_086.jpg?w=418&#038;h=277" alt="" width="418" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>Monday afternoon, we popped into a bike rental place to see if we could rent some mountain bikes for the day.  Francisco informed us that we could rent the bikes overnight and ride up to a little mountain town called La Caldera.  It sounded like an adventure to us so we loaded up the bikes with our backpacks and headed up Route 9 North – a road no wider than 12 feet.  It took about 2 hours to ride the nearly 20 miles to the town, since it was mostly uphill the whole way.  We arrived to La Caldera, a tiny town that consists of about 5 blocks and whose main tourist attraction is a giant statue of Jesus on top of a mountain, and began looking for a place the stay that night.  We found a beautiful hostel on the edge of town that was well worth the less than $20 each we spent to stay there.  After checking in, we rode the two and a half miles to the Dam north of town.  We relaxed and read our books for while on the edge of the lake.  In other words, it was heaven.</p>
<p><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_049.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-381" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_049" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_049.jpg?w=418&#038;h=277" alt="" width="418" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>The next day we rode up the mountain to see the “famous” Cristo statue.  It was interesting and slightly creepy but a feat of engineering nonetheless.  I was surprised that the number of mini-vans full of tourists that arrived there on a Tuesday morning.  While the statue didn’t enamor me, I did fall in love with the town. If I’m ever forced to go on the run, I’m moving to La Caldera.</p>
<p><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_077.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-382" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_077" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_077.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_070.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-380" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_070" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_070.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We said goodbye to the quaint little town and rode back down to Salta, which only took about 45 minutes since it was a downhill coast most of the way.  We checked into a hostel, took a nap, ate a wonderful dinner at a cute little <em>parilla</em>, chatted with the French and Swiss travelers at our hostel and went to bed.  We had an early morning the next day.</p>
<p>At 6:45 am the next day, my alarm went off and we quickly packed our backpacks, shoveled some cornflakes and coffee into our mouths and met two Argentine men, Facundo and Santiago, outside our hostel next to their new pick-up truck.  Facundo, “Facu,” was the guide we had hired for a two-day trek through the Andes.  Santiago, “Santi,” was driving us to the start of the trail.  Two hours later, after listening to a strange mix of Lady Gaga, ACDC and Simple Plan, we arrived to the trailhead.  We spent the next two days trekking our way through the Andes, meeting the local mountain people along the way.  The next evening, we arrived back in Salta, filthy and sore but happy and relaxed.  I can honestly say that our four days of biking and hiking were some of the happiest of my life.  It was so nice to be away from smog and Internet and people and just sit and look at the mountains.</p>
<p><a href="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_192.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384" title="110726_SaltaHikeBike_langdon_192" src="http://sarahmlangdon.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110726_saltahikebike_langdon_192.jpg?w=418&#038;h=277" alt="" width="418" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>Well, since this post is getting rather lengthy and I doubt many readers have made it this far, I’ll end here and post later this week with some more details of my Northern Argentina Adventure.</p>
<p>Chau!</p>

<p><strong>By Bruce Stambaugh</strong></p>
<p>Baseball and I go way back.</p>
<p>I can’t remember exactly when I saw my first major league baseball game. But I do recall attending several as a youngster, often with my family.</p>
<p>I also recollect one of my first Little League games as a player. I was 7 years old, the youngest and smallest kid on the team. The coach put me at second base, possibly thinking that was the safest spot on the field for me. It didn’t work out that way.<br />
<div id="attachment_1370" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dscn1749.jpg"><img src="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dscn1749.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Grandsons by Bruce Stambaugh" title="grandsonsbybrucestambaugh" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1370" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our grandsons share my enthusiasm for baseball.</p></div><br />
Those were the days when real baseball rules were followed no matter how young you were. The pitcher pitched, not the coach. The batters batted. T-ball was unheard of.</p>
<p>One hallmark of baseball is its pithy clichés. One axiom says put an inexperienced player on the field and “the ball will find him.” Well, it did me that day.</p>
<p>A batter lashed a one hopper right at me. The hardball jumped off the compacted all dirt infield and smashed right into my mouth. I walked to the bench with loose front teeth, bleeding gums, a fat lip and a bruised adolescent ego.</p>
<p>That should have been an omen. As much as I loved the game, I really wasn’t a very good player. Maybe that’s why I focused so much on my favorite team, the Cleveland Indians. I got my baseball fix by dreaming of playing third base for the Tribe.</p>
<p>In those days, before our home had a television, I listened to the games on the radio. I loved the cadence and opinionated passion that Jimmy Dudley, the Indians play-by-play announcer, put into calling the games. Each play came alive in my mind.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the Indians were consistently good with great, inspiring players. Some made the Baseball Hall of Fame. Paige, Doby, Lemon, Wynn, Feller, Minoso, Score, and Colavito were just some of my idols.</p>
<p>Because we lived 60 miles south of Cleveland, we could only go to a couple of games each year. It was just too far and too expensive.<br />
<div id="attachment_1372" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0190.jpg"><img src="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0190.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="Grady at bat by Bruce Stambaugh" title="gradyatbatbybrucestambaugh" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-1372" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Excellent players like Grady Sizemore continue to be the exception rather than the rule for the Cleveland Indians.</p></div><br />
But because he loved baseball, too, Dad made every effort to take us to a game or two when time and cash allowed. To get his money’s worth, we often went to doubleheader games. Dad reveled at seeing two games for one price. Those were the days when doubleheaders were played 20 minutes apart, not as two separately ticketed games like they are today.</p>
<p>You could take coolers and thermoses into the ballpark then, too. We must have been quite the sight with five children in tow carrying a big, red, metal cooler into the stadium. Dad wasn’t about to pay for food and drink when you could take your own.</p>
<p>Just as I was entering my formative years, a life-changing event occurred for the Indians and me. They traded my favorite player, Rocky Colavito, the previous year’s homerun champ, for Harvey Kuenn, the previous year’s batting champ.</p>
<p>The team’s fortunes soured after that. The players’ names changed, too. Tasby, Latman, Mahoney, Phillips, Klimchock and Kirkland were the regulars to root for, although there really wasn’t much to cheer about. The teams often started out well, but usually faded by late summer.<br />
<div id="attachment_1371" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0555.jpg"><img src="http://brucestambaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc_0555.jpg?w=300&#038;h=220" alt="Baseball friends by Bruce Stambaugh" title="baseballfriendsbybrucestambaugh" width="300" height="220" class="size-medium wp-image-1371" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoying a baseball game with friends is always a treat.</p></div><br />
I still love our national pastime and attend as many games as I think I can afford. Despite my nostalgic affection for baseball and the cost of ballpark food, I am glad for one 21st century policy. Big red coolers are prohibited.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1414" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://titabuds.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dreamstime_xs_17003416.jpg?w=480&#038;h=302" alt="" width="480" height="302" />An Irish proverb goes: <em>Three things cannot be taught: Generosity, poetry and a singing voice</em>. I agree &#8212; starlets who&#8217;ve taken voice lessons for years demonstrate the truth in that last one everyday &#8212; but if I were asked about the things that it seems cannot be taught <em>to me</em>, these essential skills would top the list:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Cook without a recipe</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How I envy those who can cook from memory or by invention. Cooking does not come naturally to me. My interest in it started only four years ago and even now, I cook irregularly. So even with the simplest recipes, when I cook it&#8217;s always a major &#8216;production number&#8217; that I need to prepare for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I want to try a recipe, I write it in shorthand with my own highly-detailed &#8216;Instructions to Self&#8217;.  I list <em>everything</em> I need: from special ingredients (written in red ink) to the most common utensils. These notes are as essential to my cooking as my knife &#8212; I can&#8217;t start unless they&#8217;re on the kitchen counter ready for me to refer to after each step. This is true even when I&#8217;ve prepared a dish several times.    <span id="more-1156"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2.  Drive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mr. is tired of picking me up from work everyday so he keeps hounding me to learn how to drive. When we bought another car last Christmas, he said it was mainly for my use. I realized I had to get serious about driving lessons and vowed (half-heartedly) that by June, I&#8217;d be driving to the neighborhood bakery. <em>Oh, the glamour!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It&#8217;s already August and I still don&#8217;t know where the clutch is. This means I&#8217;m already off my timetable: one year to get to the bank near the main road, 2 years to the supermarket at the end of that main road, and 5 years to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epifanio_de_los_Santos_Avenue" target="_blank">EDSA</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why can&#8217;t I learn? The mere thought of city driving paralyzes me. The streets of Metro Manila are filled with bumper cars masquerading as jeepneys &amp; buses and avoiding road bullies is the only way to get to your destination in one piece. I can&#8217;t handle the <del>truth</del> stress!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I once tried driving my brother&#8217;s SUV in an otherwise empty backroad in our hometown.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>In less than 10 minutes, I went beyond the speed limit, almost hit some chicken at the <em>side</em> of the road and executed a left turn that crushed under<em>wheel</em> some palay (unmilled rice) being dried out on a <em>banig</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The look on the farmer&#8217;s face as I apologized made me swear off the steering wheel forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3. Use chopsticks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I can eat prawns neatly with a fork and spoon, munch on bird&#8217;s eye chili with just a hint of moisture in my eyes, and eat a whole <em>balut</em> without queasiness. But those slender pieces of wood always stop me in my tracks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dad tried to teach us how to wield chopsticks but all I ever got from those lessons is how to <em>elegantly</em> poke the marrow out of bones in <em>pork nilaga</em> and<em> beef bulalo.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There&#8217;s a standing offer from the Mr., who can use chopsticks to eat fluffy <em>rice</em> (I am in awe) to teach me how to do the same. I should take him up on it, now that my hands are maybe only 10 years away from being arthritic and my inability has become a source of embarrassment when I am <a href="http://titabuds.wordpress.com/travel/shanghai-china-2010/" target="_blank">out with friends at a nice Asian restaurant</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think I&#8217;ll start tomorrow. <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What&#8217;s on your need-to-learn list?</p>
