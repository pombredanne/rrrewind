			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently read an interesting blog through <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/06/13/if-we-remember-more-can-we-read-deeper-and-create-better-part-ii/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a> by the writer <a href="http://www.mariakonnikova.com/" target="_blank">Maria Konnikova</a>. In it, she writes about how memorization may help us be more creative. This is a counterintuitive idea in some ways because memorizing information or learning something by rote seems the antithesis of creativity.  In explanation, she quotes the writer Joshua Foer, the winner of the U.S. memory championship, from his new <a href="http://joshuafoer.com/moonwalking-with-einstein/" target="_blank">book</a>: “I think the notion is, more generally, that there is a relationship between having a furnished mind (which is obviously not the same thing as memorizing loads of trivia), and being able to generate new ideas. Creativity is, at some level, about linking disparate facts and ideas and drawing connections between notions that previously didn’t go together. For that to happen, a human mind has to have raw material to work with.”</p>
<p>This makes perfect sense. How can we create something new, put things together that have never before been put together, if we don’t really know things “by heart”? This makes me think of the great classical musicians. Great musicians know the music so well, so deeply that you both play it perfectly in terms of the intention of the composer AND you are able to add that ineffable creative flair. It’s only when you’ve totally mastered and memorized the music that you can put your own stamp on it and it becomes something special. Otherwise, it’s robotic.</p>
<p>These issues are incredibly relevant to how human memory is adapting to new information technologies. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/health/15memory.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Research</a> has recently shown that when we think we can look up information on the internet, we make less effort and are less likely to remember it. This idea is referred to as “transactive memory” – relying on other people or things to store information for us. I think of it as the External Second Brain phenomenon – using the internet and devices as our second brain so that we don’t have to hold all the things we need to know in our own brain. As a result, how much do we actually memorize anymore? I used to know phone numbers by heart – now, because they are all in my phone’s address book, I remember maybe five numbers and that’s it. How about little questions I’m wondering about, like: When was the first Alien movie released (okay, I saw Prometheus last week)? The process of getting the information is – 1. Look it up; 2. Say, “ah, right, interesting”; 3. Then with a 75% probability in my case forget it within a week. Information is like the things we buy at a dollar store – easily and cheaply obtained, and quickly disposed of.</p>
<p>A colleague in academia once told me about an exercise his department made their graduate students go through in which they presented their thesis projects – the information they should know the best, be masters of really – using an old-school flip board with paper and sharpies. Without the help of their PowerPoint slides and notes, they could barely describe their projects. They had not internalized it or memorized it because they didn’t need to. It was already in the slides. If they didn’t know something about their topic, they could just look it up with lightening speed.  Only superficial memorization required.</p>
<p>In addition, the process of relating to and transcribing information has changed.  Today, if students need to learn something, they can just cut and paste information from the internet or from documents on their computers. They often don’t need to type it in their own words, or even type it at all. They miss a key opportunity to review and understand what they are learning. We know that things are remembered better when they are effortfully entered into memory – through repetition, and using multiple modalities like writing it out and reading it. If you quickly and superficially read something, like we do all the time when we are on the internet or zooming from email to website to app, then you cannot put that information into memory as efficiently. For most of us, it just won’t stick.</p>
<p>On the other hand, shouldn’t the vast amounts of information we have at our fingertips aid us in our creative endeavors? Haven’t our world and the vision we have of what is possible expanded? Couldn’t this make us more creative? Perhaps, by delegating some information to our external second brains, we are simply freed up to focus our minds on what is important, or on what we want to create (credit to my student Lee Dunn for that point).</p>
<p>Also, I think many of us, me included, know that we NEED help negotiating the information glut that is our lives. We CAN’T keep everything we need to know memorized in our brains, so we need second brains like devices and the internet to help us. I don’t think we can or should always relate deeply to and memorize all the information we have to sift through. It is a critical skill to know what to focus on, what to skim, and what to let go of. This is perhaps the key ability of the digital age.</p>
<p>I also appreciate all the possibilities I have now that I would NEVER have had before were it not for the incredible breadth and speed of access to information. As a scientist, this has transformed my professional life for the good and the bad – along with opportunities comes the frequently discussed pressure to always work.  But give up my devices? I’d rather give you my left arm (75% joking).</p>
<p>As a child developmentalist and psychologist, I feel that we have to acknowledge that these shifts in how we learn, remember, and create might start affecting us and our children – for good and bad &#8211; sooner than we think. This isn’t just the current generation saying “bah, these new fangled devices will ruin us (while shaking wrinkly fist)!!!” I think these changes are evolutionarily new, all-pervasive, and truly different. We as a society have to contend with these changes, our brains have to contend with these changes, and our children are growing up in a time in which memory as we think of it may be a think of the past.</p>

<p>A few years before becoming a balls to the wall plant eater, a friend asked me why I wasn&#8217;t completely vegan, and all I remember is this momentary horror movie playing in my mind: Cartoon mozzarella sticks skipping joyfully down a sidewalk in the rain before getting shoved into a scary van, kidnapped forever. A giant wheel of aged cheddar rolling away for me before plummeting off a cliff into an abyss. Orange cream frosting on <a title="Sugarplum Cupcakes" href="http://sugarplumcupcakes.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sugarplum cupcakes </a>locked behind bulletproof, impenetrable glass as I kick and scream to get through for just a taste. No way I could be vegan, and give up all the things that make me happy? Screw that. Tell me that you&#8217;re vegan, I would have said all of these:</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://eatplantslive.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/the-vegan-guide-to-bar-food/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Vi0OwgGjDtM/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;you, my friends, can have it all. Seriously. You can treat your body, the earth, and the animals with respect without compromising one iota of your happiness. And we feel we are totally credible in the &#8216;if we can do it anyone can&#8217; department considering I would receive cheese and meat as birthday gifts for much of my life and I have seen Evan&#8217;s morning be ruined over a poorly cooked egg.</p>
<p>The true test and proof that vegans can eat out really is navigating a menu at a bar. It can seen counterintuitive that a vegan can order anything since a bar menu will  typically read like a list of the leading causes of heart disease, but vegans are just like everyone else &#8211; some of us like to drink until we make poor eating/life decisions.</p>
<p>Our Portland friends were down for the weekend and gave us a perfect excuse to drink at the local brewery, <a title="Standing Stone" href="http://standingstonebrewing.com/" target="_blank">Standing Stone</a>, in Ashland, OR. The beauty of bar eating in a college town is the menu almost always has special options that are at least vegetarian to start and only take a few requests to veganize. A few tips for ordering vegan at a bar:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK FOR FRENCH FRIES OR TOTS . It&#8217;s still good to at least ask the staff how the fries are made as the rare restaurant will use beef tallow or lard in processing fries (and always ask if there is an allergy), but 99% of the time the fries are good to go and you can request them to be made with special flavas, such as these fries with curry powder. Just avoid all creamy sauces and stick with ketchup, mustards (we heart dijon), and vinegars for dipping sauces.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_328" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000306.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-328" title="Curry fries" src="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000306.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ask for additional spices like curry powder, garlic, or for additional dipping sauces available.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_331" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_2574.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-331" title="TOTS " src="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_2574.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">McMenimans spicy tot basket of glory.</p></div>
<ul>
<li>LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE MEATS AND DON&#8217;T ASSUME. If a veggie burger is available, many bars will allow you to substitute the veggie burger for hamburger on any menu options. Just be sure to check that the veggie burger isn&#8217;t made with eggs, a common binder. Really progressive bars will also offer <a title="tempeh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempeh" target="_blank">tempeh</a>, <a title="Seitan" href="http://vegetarian.about.com/od/glossary/g/Seitan.htm" target="_blank">seitan</a>, or <a title="Tofu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu" target="_blank">tofu</a> to be added into a dish.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>STIR-FRY AND SALADS: If you have to order quick or are too drunk to study a menu, look for these two words. Don&#8217;t just stick with the salad listed and pull out the meat and dairy; instead, shop the ingredients available from other salads or entrees and request those items be added to your salad. The same concept goes with stir-fry&#8230;do you see they have brussel sprouts to order? Add it to the stir fry. It may cost a little more, but will add some gusto to a mix that may be short on fill once the meat is removed.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_330" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000309.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-330" title="Tempeh Stir Fry" src="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000309.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="348" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tempeh stir fry &#8220;bar food&#8217;</p></div>
<ul>
<li>FRIED VEGGIES. Okay, fried food may not be the best for you, but I really doubt you give a shit if you&#8217;re choosing to eat at a bar in the first place. Even my most carnivorous of friends find fried zucchini, fried pickles, or fried, well, anything delicious and just as easily irresistible as the meat options. This brewery just had &#8216;seasonal vegetables&#8217; listed and when we asked, they said they were frying brussel sprouts..for reals, these puppies were amazing! My prego friend Sarah probably housed the whole plate guilt free&#8230;and I couldn&#8217;t have been more proud.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div id="attachment_334" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000307.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-334" title="Fried Brussel Sprouts " src="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1000307.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These babies will make any unwilling adult eat their vegetables.</p></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>HOPE FOR A CREATIVE COOK. Some of the best meals that I ever had came after I noticed a menu didn&#8217;t have any vegan options that were appealing, so I asked to talk to the chef and he was totally stoked for the challenge! He had fun trying something new and I reaped the benefits. It never hurts to play on the ego on a chef by making it seem like a fun challenge. They know their kitchen and are probably sick of making the same shit all the time. Throw in a big tip, write a great review, and enjoy your meal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DESSERT &#8211; THINK FRUITY. I don&#8217;t consider a meal complete until I&#8217;ve eaten dessert, but at a bar this can be next to impossible. While I have had crazy luck asking questions and getting some great food (like the German Chocolate Cake from <a title="The Bye and Bye " href="http://www.thebyeandbye.com/" target="_blank">The Bye and Bye</a>), usually if you can find a sorbet you are good to go. Or just order a <a title="Pyramid Apricot Ale " href="http://www.pyramidbrew.com/our-brews/apricot" target="_blank">Pyramid Apricot Ale</a>, and call it good!</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_333" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/byeandbye_cake.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-333" title="byeandbye_cake" src="http://eatplantslive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/byeandbye_cake.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">German Chocolate Cake and Oatmeal Stout. It always sounds good at the time.</p></div>
<p>Happy eating my friends! As always, we love to hear your thoughts, stories, and pictures of good food, especially great food you found in bars. Happy drinking!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always known that an English major was not directly associated with a promising career path, usually conjuring the image of the unsuccessful-yet-still-pretentious writer or, on the other end of the spectrum, the assumption of grad school to further the English major to make it more, well, useful. Almost every single time when someone asked me about my major, it would go something like this:</p>
<p>Random Person approaches me and attempts to make small talk about life, which inevitably leads to the question, &#8220;So, what&#8217;s your major&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an English major,&#8221; I declare confidently, as I&#8217;m sure the connotation of my major must entail the long hours of research and detailed literature analysis which have made me so vastly intelligent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Random Person replies with a slight raise of the eyebrows, &#8220;So you&#8217;re going to teach?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the point where I either want to slam my face into my hand in frustration, or slam my hand into the other person&#8217;s face for being so presumptuous. After a while I got used to this response, so I say with as much enthusiasm as possible, &#8220;No, I actually like to write.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aah,&#8221;Random Person says with an unmistakeable look of concern. &#8220;So you&#8217;re gonna, like, write books or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Feigning as much confidence as possible, I respond, &#8220;Well, maybe one day, but I&#8217;m realistic enough to know I need a paycheck. I actually want to do editing and publishing in Atlanta or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is usually where the topic of my major ends, and the only response Random Person can usually muster is a repeated nod of the head and an, &#8220;Oooh, OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>As much as I try to convey the interesting qualities of pouring over documents and correcting their errors, Random Person has already mentally condemned me to failure in the writing world, assuming that my only option is to teach. One nurse who I told about my major skipped the formality of questioning my career altogether, saying, &#8220;Oh, an English major? What grade are you going to teach?&#8221; Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with being a teacher, as my entire family is full of them, but aside from something I&#8217;d want to do abroad or a way I&#8217;d share my experience when I&#8217;m older, I&#8217;ve never really been drawn to it. So, having graduated from college with a big fancy BACHELOR&#8217;S DEGREE, I assumed that it was now time to find a stable editing or writing job in Atlanta with opportunities to interact with important authors and publishers and eventually move my way up to success as an independent young writer in the city.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Wrong&#8221;</strong> might be something of an understatement. First of all, there is no such thing as an entry-level writing job. They are a complete myth, ranked with fairies, Bigfoot, and Diet Dr. Pepper, and anyone who says otherwise has either never looked for a job or is playing a cruel joke on you to get your hopes up so you&#8217;ll finish school. It doesn&#8217;t help that I get my hopes up like a small child on Christmas Eve, and when I&#8217;m let down it&#8217;s like reality is slapping me in the face&#8230;with my degree. I felt accomplished enough just by having completed my resume, and felt even more encouraged as I continued to apply for jobs online. Cover letter after cover letter of my &#8220;qualifications&#8221; and &#8220;experience&#8221; really just translated into &#8220;I&#8217;m desperate and I can write, please hire me,&#8221; but since most of the jobs I applied for required at least 2 years of experience, I&#8217;ve had little luck so far. Several times I&#8217;ve checked my email and my face has lit up with excitement at the words, &#8220;Job Opportunity&#8221; or &#8220;We Reviewed Your Resume,&#8221; but upon closer inspection, all of them have been offering me various sales positions. Nothing wrong with sales, but I did not go to college for four years and sign the next several years of my life away to paying back student loans so I could sit behind a desk and sell insurance all day.</p>
<p>SO, until then I will be writing as much online as possible when I have time. Articles, blogs, whatever it takes to build a portfolio, get my writing out there, and gain as much experience as possible. I may be a starving writer for a while, but at least that means I&#8217;m writing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My last entry showed just a few moments of two days, where I had the opportunity to take photographs of two power stations. Both of them are combined-cycle power stations. They basically use the hot exhausts of a gas turbine, feed it into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), which produces steam. That steam then can either be used to produce electricity, or you can use the steam for something else &#8211; like paper production, long distance heating or other technical processes that use or need steam. The gas turbine itself can also be used, alongside producing hot exhausts, to produce electricity. Well, I hope I got that technical bit right, if anyone would like to read more &#8211; here&#8217;s a link to Wikipedia: <a title="HRSG" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_steam_generator" target="_blank">HRSG</a>. It was really, really interesting to learn about how these power stations work and to be able to go inside and have a look at stuff you don&#8217;t usually get to see.</p>
<p>This is how the first one looks from the outside &#8211; actually really nice looking, not what I expected when I thought of power stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0695blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2246"><img class="size-full wp-image-2246 aligncenter" title="IMG_0695BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0695blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>We started off right at the top, high up the chimney (well, almost at the top). The <a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/a-kind-of-making-of/img_0524blog/" target="_blank">view</a> was amazing, which was a good thing, as I am a bit afraid of heights, and concentrating on the magnificent view and on taking photos distracted me from thoughts about falling down&#8230;</p>
<p>Quite comfortable ascent &#8211; stairs!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0480blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2233"><img class="size-full wp-image-2233 aligncenter" title="IMG_0480BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0480blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>The platform and the chimney seen from the roof.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0484blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2234"><img class="size-full wp-image-2234 aligncenter" title="IMG_0484BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0484blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>Luckily I didn&#8217;t need to go up the last part to the real top of the chimney, I would have had to use the ladder, no stairs up there&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0503blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2235"><img class="size-full wp-image-2235 aligncenter" title="IMG_0503BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0503blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The inside had a few surprises for me, one of them being that it gets very warm inside (well, kind of obvious). On the highest floor the temperature is around 60°C. Stay for while, and you can cancel your next sauna session! Talking of floors &#8211; you won&#8217;t find first or second or third floor, have a look at this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0789blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2254"><img class="size-full wp-image-2254 aligncenter" title="IMG_0789BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0789blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The height is marked in meters rather than floor numbers. So the ninth floor would be 34,75m, like you can see here:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0531blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2236"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2236" title="IMG_0531BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0531blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Another thing that surprised me at 34,75m &#8211; this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0726blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2248"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2248" title="IMG_0726BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0726blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s a water level indicator &#8211; beautiful light!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0744blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2249"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2249" title="IMG_0744BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0744blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0755blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2250"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2250" title="IMG_0755BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0755blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0762blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2251"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2251" title="IMG_0762BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0762blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0771blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2252"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2252" title="IMG_0771BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0771blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0778blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2253"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2253" title="IMG_0778BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0778blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here a few impressions how the whole thing looked inside:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0544blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2237"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2237" title="IMG_0544BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0544blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0559blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2238"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2238" title="IMG_0559BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0559blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0590blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2240"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2240" title="IMG_0590BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0590blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0686blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2245"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2245" title="IMG_0686BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0686blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That was a tricky one, and it didn&#8217;t really work out, but you can still see the fire inside the boiler:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0646blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2242"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2242" title="IMG_0646BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0646blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A few details I really liked:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0655blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2243"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2243" title="IMG_0655BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0655blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0597blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2241"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2241" title="IMG_0597BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0597blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">RGB</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0683blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2244"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2244" title="IMG_0683BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0683blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0579blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2239"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2239" title="IMG_0579BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0579blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0699blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2247"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2247" title="IMG_0699BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0699blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> And this was the second power station:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0952blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2261"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2261" title="IMG_0952BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0952blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0928blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2260"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2260" title="IMG_0928BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0928blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This power station was larger than the first one, here is a view on the two gas turbines that produce the heat.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0870blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2257"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2257" title="IMG_0870BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0870blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here how it looks from the ground, the cars give some reference size-wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0965blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2262"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2262" title="IMG_0965BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0965blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On the roof:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0827blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2255"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2255" title="IMG_0827BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0827blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Another one with one of the chimneys:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0856blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2256"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2256" title="IMG_0856BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0856blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Pipes, pipes, pipes&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://anjalampert.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/power/img_0892blogsmall/" rel="attachment wp-att-2258"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258" title="IMG_0892BlogSmall" src="http://anjalampert.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0892blogsmall.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Couldn&#8217;t resist taking a few photos of this chimney (not part of that power station, but very close by):</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">And finally &#8211; the control room (well, the two pictures I liked the most of the control room). Of course there&#8217;s a modern, computer controlled room, but a few bits and pieces were still the old ones, and I liked those far more than the large screens.</p>

<td>As a birthday present from my family I got some money to use for anything I wanted. The only condition was that I had to use it for something fun, not for paying bills or to put into savings (which they know I tend to do). My first thought was to maybe use it towards making my vegetable garden a little bigger, but since we are well into summer and it is not the best time for planting I figured that wasn&#8217;t the best way to spend the money. But in the same backyard-improvement train of thought, summer means relaxing &#8211; relaxing means laying out &#8211; I don’t like to lay out but I like to spend time in the yard &#8211; how can I do both? BUY HAMMOCKS!!!</td>
<td><em>Como regalo de cumpleanos mi familia me dio una plata para usar en lo que quisiera. La unica condicion fue que tenia que usarla para algo entretenido, no para pagar cuentas o poner en la cuenta de ahorro (algo que tiendo a hacer). Mi primera idea fue usarla para agrandar la huerta, pero como estamos en verano ya y no es la mejor epoca para plantar, me di cuenta que no era la mejor manera de usar esa plata. Pero con la misma idea de mejorar el patio trasero, verano significa relajo, relajo significa hecharse, no me gusta hecharme pero me gusta pasar tiempo en el patio &#8211; como puedo hacer las 2? PONER HAMACAS!!!</em></td>

<td>We actually have been thinking about getting hammocks for awhile but we never went for it, so this was the perfect time to go ahead and get them. We have a couple of trees in the backyard but they are not close to each other so I quickly figured out that I needed to set up some posts in order to have the right place to hang the hammocks, so here is what I did.</td>
<td><em>Hemos tenido la idea de poner hamacas por un buen tiempo ya, pero nunca nos animamos a hacerlo, asi que ahora era el momento perfecto para ponerlas. Tenemos un par de arboles en el patio pero no estan cerca el uno del otro asi que rapidamente me di cuenta que tenia que poner postes para colgar las hamacas, asi que esto es lo que hice.</em></td>

<td>First I ordered the hammocks online. We got 2 blue brazilian-style hammocks. They are the kind that wraps around you &#8211; very simple and comfy. To set them up, I used one of our trees as the main support so we could have shade. I bought 4 eyebolts, 4 S-hooks, some bags of cement and two 4x4x8 posts. I screwed two eye bolts to the tree and, using the hammocks, I measured the right location for the post before I started digging (measure twice, DIG once). Once I figured out the post location, I dug holes about 2 feet deep. That was hard work! Digging post holes is not easy!</td>
<td><em>Primero compre las hamacas por internet. Compramos 2 hamacas azules estilo brasileno. Son del tipo que te abrazan &#8211; muy simples y comodas. Para instalarlas use uno de los arboles como soporte principal asi podemos usar su sombra. Compre 4 tornillos con ojo, 4 ganchos en S, unas cuantas bolsas de cemento, y dos postes de 4x4x8. Puse 2 tornillos en el arbol, usando las hamacas medi el lugar exacto donde debian ir los postes (siempre hay que medir 2 veces antes de empezar a escabar). Ya con el lugar de los postes marcado, hice hoyos de mas o menos 2 pies de profundidad. Fue mucho trabajo! Escabar tanto a mano no es facil!</em></td>

<td>With the holes done I put the poles in position and threw the cement in. Quikrete is super easy to use; you just add the dry cement, soak it up with water and after a couple of hours it&#8217;s dry and set. After the posts were set I screwed in the other two eye bolts, one for each post, and just like that….HAMMOCKS!!</td>
<td><em>Con los hoyos hechos, puse los postes y el cemento. Quikrete es facil de usar, se pone el cemento seco en el hoyo y luego se le agrega agua ahi mismo y en un par de horas esta listo. Con los postes instalados, puse los otros 2 tornillos, uno para cada poste, y despues&#8230;..HAMACAS!!</em></td>

<td>The S-hooks are the link for the hammocks and the eye bolts. They help to make the hammocks easy to take out in case it rains or if we simply do want to leave them outside. We love using the hammocks already, it is so relaxing to just rock like a baby looking at our tree and the sky. It&#8217;s very relaxing and like a vacation in our backyard. I encourage everybody to get a hammock and set it up in the yard if you can! It&#8217;s an easy project, it&#8217;s relaxing, and you wont regret having a little oasis at home!</td>
<td><em>Los ganchos en S son la conexion entre las hamacas y los tornillos con ojo. Ayudan a que las hamacas sean facil de sacar en caso que llueva o si simplemente no queremos dejarlas afuera. No escanta usar las hamacas, es muy ralajante poder mecerse como un bebe mirando el follaje de los arboles y el cielo. Es como estar de vacaciones en tu patio. Les recomiendo a todos que compren una hamaca y la instalen en el patio si pueden! es un proyecto facil, relajante, y no se arrepentiran de tener un pequeno oasis en casa!</em></td>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a grey and cold day when our good friends Cindy and Stanley visited us a couple of weekends ago.  Cindy&#8217;s parents were in town for a visit and came along (there were two new donkey converts in the world before they left). As always, Bernard and Ellsworth were excellent donkey ambassadors:</p>

<p>Good friends are such a blessing, aren&#8217;t they? As always, they left us with beautiful images of the critters that we love:</p>
