			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am terrible at long-distance relationships. Of any kind. Many can attest to this.</p>
<p>But I really want to get better at staying in touch. Sure, everybody says that. But seriously, I do. Why? Because it can open new and amazing opportunities like nobody&#8217;s business. Because it builds and strengthens the network of people you can count on. Because it&#8217;s a great testament to the wonders of humanity. Because it makes you look like a good person. Because it makes you feel like a good person. Whatever the reason&#8230; simply put, because it is a valuable experience.</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, my parents hosted the first of many exchange students in our house. This was my first experience with the idea that you might make a friend who will later live far away from you, even if you still want to be close. Some stayed for only a week; another stole my favorite sweatshirt. So maybe you don&#8217;t keep in touch with everyone you ever meet. That&#8217;s fine. <strong>But another stayed with us for nearly a year when I was seven. Fourteen years later, I just spent a week at her house.</strong></p>
<p>Something about this strange fact really moves me. Johanna, a Rotary exchange student, was just 18 when she left to return home to Sweden after living my family. But even then she had the sense to stay in touch. Almost every year she sent a Christmas card, and as technology advanced she sent e-mail and photo updates on her life, work and relationships. Some years she even remembered me and my sister&#8217;s birthdays with silly little e-cards. When I was 10, she invited my family to come and stay with hers—my first trip abroad, first experience with new languages and cultures, first real experience with travel. The next 10 years after that, I was pretty awful at keeping in touch. Occasionally she&#8217;d write, asking about high school, then college, and most recently my study abroad plans.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-935" title="Johanna and me" src="http://sararasmussen.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/johanna-me.jpg?w=320" alt="" width="320" />In that last e-mail, she invited me to come stay with her. No longer the high schooler I remembered, she is working, married, with a young son and another on the way. Likewise I barely resemble my seven-year-old self. In many ways, it was like I was being invited into the home of a complete stranger. Yet at the airport she greeted me as an old friend. There was so much we did not know about each other: How long have you been married? What&#8217;s your major? You lived in Canada? You&#8217;ve never eaten beets?</p>
<p>But somehow that didn&#8217;t matter. Simply because Johanna put in that small effort over the years, I was able to make a connection—a renewed one with Johanna and her brother, a new one with her husband and son—and experience the Swedish life for one week. I was given an intimate portrait of their opinions, habits, interests and social mores, not to mention some excellent food. I love this idea of being able to embrace such an opportunity, or offer it to a friend passing through my own part of the world. </p>
<p>Johanna is a really lovely woman. But I reckon that in this respect she&#8217;s not entirely unique. In fact, there&#8217;s a long list of people I&#8217;ve met who&#8217;ve charmed, fascinated, challenged and surprised me&#8230; and with whom I wish I was in better contact. But now what? Is it ever too late to reach out to those people? I think that really comes down to a case-by-case basis, but my optimistic answer would be, for most, they&#8217;d be glad to hear from you. Johanna bashfully commented during my visit that she felt awful for the years she forgot to send an e-mail for Christmas or my birthday. In retrospect, however, I don&#8217;t remember that. I just remember the years she did.</p>
<p>For that reason, I&#8217;m grateful. For that reason, I hope to do the same. No, I&#8217;m probably not going to go e-mail all the people in my first-grade class. But I look around at my constantly changing environment and realize I already do—and am about to—have ample opportunity to be better about staying in touch, i.e. with my current flatmates or with Whitman grads. Johanna proved to me that it doesn&#8217;t have to be a lot. But it can still be a valuable exchange of ideas, culture, or (dare I say?) love.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, I heard one question every place that I went (out with friends, to the grocery store, dentist and doctor&#8217;s office): <strong><em>So, did you watch?  </em></strong>The Royal Wedding of course!</p>
<p><strong>Did I watch?  </strong>I rolled in every single bit of the Royal Wedding coverage that I could! Like with Diana and Charles wedding in 1981, I got up extra early and raced around the house, hours ahead of when I had to leave for work. Our youngest later told me, &#8220;Mom I heard you scurrying around; you sounded like a little kid on Christmas morning!&#8221; and indeed I was&#8230; I scuttled to the basement with a magnum of coffee and cranked up the volume as old dog and I snuggled in to watch it.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to but when I spotted those two handsome and poised young men&#8230; I cried. I recalled their poise and heartache when we last saw them in the Abbey&#8230; at Princess Diana&#8217;s funeral. I cried because it felt wonderful to see the joy and genuine nervousness on their faces.  And, as a mother to two boys, I cried that <em>their mother</em> was not there to witness this milestone.</p>
<p>I cried when I spotted a smiling little lady dressed in canary yellow &#8211; the 85-year-old Monarch;  &#8221;Granny&#8221; to said boys.</p>
<p>I cried when I saw Kate&#8217;s face peeking out from behind her veil and when her father gently took her hand in his.  How daunting that moment must have been for them both.</p>
<p>I cried when I saw HRH William whisper &#8220;you look beautiful&#8221; to his beaming bride.   I cried again when his words took effect and her face lit up with joy.</p>
<p>Call me a sap and you&#8217;d be right.</p>
<p>Call me romantic and you&#8217;d hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Call me all of those things but know, that in the midst of a birth certificate kerfuffle, Bin Laden&#8217;s death, tornadic destruction and soaring gas prices etching worry lines on many a-face, I for one, enjoyed the brief respite that the Royal Wedding brought us.  It was fun to comment on her dress<em>, </em>the uniforms, the horse-drawn carriages, the crazy hats, the darling bridesmaids, the second kiss, and the sun parting as they rolled into Buckingham palace.  In an electronic world where we&#8217;re bombarded by breaking news all the time and not much of it good, I loved watching two people steal moments of tenderness for themselves; a shared smile <em>as though two billion people were not watching their every move. </em>Of course the pomp &amp; circumstance was spectacular&#8230; but it was those little moments of tender human emotion that made the Royal Wedding resonate with me.</p>
<p><strong>So, did you watch? </strong></p>

<p>Once in Jaisalmer we immediately checked our bags at the hotel and booked a camel trek for that night. This one of the major events that we&#8217;ve been looking forward to since we started dreaming about our trip to India way back when.</p>
<p>There were a couple of trip options to chose from. One included a few sites closer to the city and the other involved riding in a jeep further out in the desert, stopping at dunes and getting picked up by a jeep at the end of the trek. We chose the latter, not for any specific reason, it mostly just sounded better to us. We could go out for anywhere from one night to a week or probably more if we&#8217;d wanted to. We&#8217;d heard from multiple travelers that one night in the desert is plenty and decided to follow their advice.</p>
<p>In not much time at all we were in a car driving out to the desert to meet our camels and guides. Unfortunately, my camera battery died on the way out to the desert. Horribly timing! So all photos here are courtesy of PZ.</p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2926" title="camel" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-leader.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" title="camel leader" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-leader.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>First impression: camels are cute! So, so cute, with their fluffy, flirty eyelashes and their tendency to nuzzle each other. I fell hard for these fury animals.</p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-and-me.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2928" title="camel and me" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-and-me.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-and-bekah.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2927" title="camel and bekah" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-and-bekah.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>At some point in the day we found it hilarious to sing &#8220;My Humps&#8221; to the camels and did so for quite some time. As a result of this we named our camels with Black Eyed Peas themed names. PZ&#8217;s was Fergie and mine was Mutter (the Hindi word for peas).</p>
<p>When we weren&#8217;t singing &#8220;My Humps&#8221; to the camels we rode through the desert in silence, taking in the beauty of the scenery. Something about the resiliency of the beings that flourish in an environment as unforgiving as the desert (did I mention it was 111 degrees F?) made me pause for thought.</p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2931" title="camel desert" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert-and-me.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2932" title="camel desert and me" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert-and-me.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert-bekah.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2936" title="camel desert bekah" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-desert-bekah.jpg?w=409&#038;h=545" alt="" width="409" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>At sunset we were dropped off at the dunes to watch the sun dissapear and then picked up and taken to our camp for dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-bed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2930" title="camel bed" src="http://somesojourns.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/camel-bed.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>At night we laid on our cots under the stars, breathing in fresh desert air, watching for shooting stars and making up constelations (like an enormous 3-D shark).</p>
<p>Morning came and we were back on the camels. As much as I loved this whole experience, riding a camel is one of the most painful things I&#8217;ve ever done. Every obscure muscle I never use in my legs screamed out in pain. I stayed on the camel as long as I could before getting down to walk. Luckily, the Jeep wasn&#8217;t far enough away and was able to come pick us up where I got off.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> Dr. James M. Lindsay is a Senior Vice President at the Council on Foreign Relations (where he <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/lindsay/">blogs</a>), co-author of &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/America-Unbound-Revolution-Foreign-Policy/dp/0815716885">America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy</a>&#8221; and a former director for global issues and multilateral affairs at the National Security Council.</i></p>
<p><em></em>By<strong> James M. Lindsay</strong> &#8211; Special to CNN</p>
<p>Americans are cheering the surprising news that U.S. Special Forces have <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/obama-to-make-statment-tonight-subject-unknown/">killed Osama bin Laden</a>. The successful military operation is a tribute to the skill of U.S. Special Forces, the perseverance of intelligence professionals who have hunted bin Laden for more than a decade and the nerve of a president to order a military strike that could have failed spectacularly.</p>
<p>The strike on bin Laden’s compound also raises lots of questions.  Here are seven:</p>
<p><strong>1. Does Bin Laden’s death cripple al Qaeda and jihadist terrorism more broadly?</strong> Probably not. Al Qaeda long ago ceased to be a centralized operation. For the last decade bin Laden has been a figurehead than a mastermind. Terrorist attacks, like the bomb plot that German authorities broke up last week, have been planned and carried out by largely independent al Qaeda “affiliates.” Nonetheless, U.S. Special Forces might have picked up valuable intelligence as they scoured bin Laden’s command post that could help uncover terrorist cells and plots.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Can you kill a symbol?</strong>  In announcing bin Laden’s death late last night, President Obama noted that “For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda’s leader and symbol.” Men die, symbols don’t. In death, bin Laden will continue to inspire jihadists as much as he did in life. The biggest threat to bin Ladenism comes not from American bullets but from the prospect that the Arab spring will remake the political order in the Middle East.<span id="more-4496"></span><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.  Where is Ayman al-Zawahiri?</strong> With bin Laden dead, his chief lieutenant and the man frequently described as al Qaeda’s “brains” goes to the top of the most wanted listed. Zawahiri reportedly was gravely injured in a missile strike in Pakistan in 2008. Given his deep operational experience and cunning, the Egyptian-born Zawahiri is more than capable of plotting major terrorist attacks on his own.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Is Pakistan a reliable partner for the United States?</strong> President Obama said last night that “our cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden.” But the White House didn’t notify the Pakistani government in advance and Pakistani troops did not participate in the attack. Bin Laden’s compound was located just forty miles north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad &#8212; or about the distance from Washington to Baltimore &#8212; in a city that hosts a Pakistani military base and military academy. Expect to hear more doubts inside the Washington Beltway about the value and viability of the U.S.-Pakistani partnership.</p>
<p><strong>5. Can we leave Afghanistan now?</strong> Sometime in the next several months, President Obama will decide whether and how fast to draw down U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan. Last week the Pentagon reported mildly optimistic news about progress in the Afghan War. Bin Laden’s death gives the president the political opening to order the sizable draw-down that public opinion polls show that most Americans want. He has always justified the war in Afghanistan in terms of defeating and dismantling al Qaeda, and he can say that with bin Laden’s death that goal has been achieved.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Will Obama benefit politically from bin Laden’s death?</strong> The president’s public approval ratings have slipped recently after enjoying a modest bump earlier in the year. Expect another bump in the coming weeks as the public gives the White House credit for a job well done. But if past “rally-‘round-the-flag” dynamics hold true, the boost that Obama gets from bin Laden’s death will be short-lived.</p>
<p><strong>7. Will our current bipartisan moment last?</strong> John Boehner, Dick Cheney, and Rudy Giuliani are just a few of the Republican luminaries who have congratulated Obama. As John Kennedy once noted, victory has a thousand fathers. But don’t expect this moment of unity to last. The issues dividing Democrats and Republicans are too deep to be bridged by the death of the world’s foremost terrorist.</p>
<p>Asking these questions does not diminish the significance of what the Obama administration accomplished yesterday. Killing bin Laden brings closure to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. It shows that terrorists will pay for their crimes. Justice was done.</p>

<p>No one wants to be alone on one of the greatest nights of the school year. Juniors and seniors have planned their prom night weeks in advance, but the initial step of asking a date to prom can be the most daunting part of the process. This year, some Clark Chargers decided to go the extra mile and come up with incredibly unique ways to ask out their date.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/a-slideshow-surpirse.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1152" title="A slideshow surpirse" src="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/a-slideshow-surpirse.png?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>A slideshow surprise</strong></p>
<p>Having to present a slideshow project to the class seems like an ordinary task, but senior Barada Moncravie took this task and added a unique twist.</p>
<p>Barada was in his first period AP Lit and Comp class and he and his group were presenting their slideshow. At the end of the slide show came a surprising slide.</p>
<p>The slide consisted of a picture of Barada’s back: shirtless and written on. The message read, “Nikki, go to prom with this guy”.</p>
<p>Nikki, or Nicole Arevalo, was seated during the slideshow and at the sight of the picture, was surprised.</p>
<p>“She said yes, we hugged, and that was that,” Moncravie said.</p>
<p><strong>The to-do list worth completing</strong></p>
<p>With summer coming around, seniors have a limited time to do what they’ve always wanted to do before they graduate.</p>
<p>For senior Luke Tanaka, that meant asking his girlfriend, Miwako Schlageter, to prom.</p>
<p>“[Miwako] said she wanted to get asked with a sign,” Tanaka said.</p>
<p>However, Luke didn’t just make a sign simply asking Miwako to prom, he added the personalization of making a to-do list sign for Miwako on her birthday.</p>
<p>“I wrote her a fairly long letter which had a few inside jokes and at the end I included directions to go to Dr. Wong&#8217;s room at the end of the period. I had a friend give her the letter, and after school, I waited by Dr. Wong’s room.”</p>
<p>Luke gave Miwako her birthday gift before she could see the sign, and when Miwako did see the sign, she said yes and the two hugged.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/the-american-dream.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1151" title="The American Dream" src="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/the-american-dream.png?w=300&#038;h=223" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a>The American dream</strong></p>
<p>For a lot of people, settling down in a nice house with a white picket fence is the American dream.</p>
<p>For Prom Princess Emily Strickler, that has been fulfilled… sort of.</p>
<p>Her prom date, senior John Diaz, utilized his crafty skills and created a little house with an interesting design. The roof read, “You have the house and the white picket fence, now all you need is a prom date…” and the fence read, “Emily, will you go to prom”.</p>
<p>John left the house on Emily’s desk in the student council room and hid in the closet.</p>
<p>“I was rather nervous. She took a REALLY long time to walk into the room after I had got there, which made it worse,” said Diaz.</p>
<p>When Emily did finally come to the room, she read the house, and as she was finishing reading the fence, John Diaz walked out with the last picket that said, “with me?!”</p>
<p>According to John, “She was excited and happy!” (and she accepted his offer).</p>
<p><strong>The purrrrfect ask</strong></p>
<p>When Nevin Endy decided to ask Cici Zhang to prom, he included some of the small things he knew about her to make his request more personal.</p>
<p>The first step in Nevin’s plan was to buy balloons in Cici’s favorite colors, pink and teal. The store didn’t have teal, so light blue was substituted.</p>
<p>Next, he went to Build-A-Bear and bought a stuffed cat, which is her favorite animal.</p>
<p>“The cool thing about Build-A-Bear is that you can buy a ‘record your own message’ type button that goes into your stuffed animal,” said Endy.</p>
<p>He hid the balloons and cat in a box equipped with a “guide” on how to open it. Nevin then left the box at the entrance of the orchestra room.</p>
<p>When Cici came, opened the box, and pressed for the cat’s message, Nevin came out of the orchestra room with flowers for her.</p>
<p>“She seemed to be very happy and I’m glad to call her my prom date,” Endy said.</p>
<p><strong>Pleas work too</strong></p>
<p>Although it’s conventional that a guy asks a girl to prom, Student Body President Mariah Eppes took matters into her own hands and asked junior Brent Mayfield to be her date.</p>
<p>According to Mariah, she actually BEGGED Brent to go to prom with her.</p>
<p>“I pretended to cry. It was great,” said Eppes.</p>
<p>After the show Mariah put up, Brent found it impossible to decline Mariah’s offer.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/a-prom-fiesta.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1150" title="A prom fiesta" src="http://chargerchant.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/a-prom-fiesta.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A prom fiesta</strong></p>
<p>Continuing with ways girls have asked guys to prom, I was asked in a pretty interesting way also.</p>
<p>During my student council period, we were busy making signs for the assembly when I was told that I, along with Shawnell Riggins, were selected to win a Student Council prize.</p>
<p>I was blind-folded and guided into a Student Council closet.</p>
<p>When given the go, I removed the blindfold and saw Dani Gonzalez, Maricruz Soto-Valdez, and a piñata.</p>
<p>On the floor were eight or so party favors and I was told the right one had a message written on it. One by one, I blew on them, and when I got to the last one, the message said, “It would be a fiesta if you went to prom with us!”</p>
<p>I undoubtedly said yes, and took pictures with Mari and Dani.</p>
<p>These were just some of the ways Clark Chargers have asked their dates to prom this year. Asking someone to prom may be nerve wracking, but the more creative you get, the better your chances are.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Cinco de Mayo this week, I&#8217;m mixing it up from the popular taco-enchilada cycle with Huevos Rancheros.  You&#8217;ll see a variety of ways out there to make huevos rancheros but mine was inspired by a tasty brunch that I had at Milwaukee&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theeateryonfarwell.com/">The Eatery on Farwell</a> several months ago. After eating their version I kept craving it and had to recreate it. It won over the hubs and is now on regular rotation both as a quick weeknight dinner and a Sunday breakfast at our house.</p>
<p>Since you assemble each plate separately, it makes it easy to adjust egg preferences based on individual needs/tastes and allow each person to top the dish with the condiments of their choice. Usually I prefer poached eggs since the oozing centers mix with the cheese sauce into creamy awesomeness but since I&#8217;ve been pregnant I&#8217;ve been scrambling my portion instead. The recipe is for two but can be easily increased to serve more.</p>
<p><a href="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6163 aligncenter" title="huevos1" src="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos1.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6165 aligncenter" title="huevos3" src="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos3.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Huevos Rancheros for Two</strong><br />
4 tostada shells<br />
4 eggs (<em>poached, over-easy or scrambled</em>)<br />
1/2 lb ground chorizo<br />
homemade or store bought pico de gallo<br />
1 avocado, sliced<br />
cheese sauce<br />
hot sauce</p>
<p><em>Cheese Sauce</em><br />
2 Tbsp butter<br />
2 Tbsp flour<br />
1 C shredded cheddar or mexican cheese blend<br />
1/3+ C milk<br />
2 Tbsp half &amp; half<br />
pinch of salt<br />
<em>* note: Cheese and liquid measures are approximate. Simply add more in little bits to reach desired consistency. </em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You&#8217;ll be using multiple burners on your stove at once and as with most egg dishes, this moves fast so getting your ingredients prepped first is key.</p>
<p>Place two tostadas (or hard taco shells broken in two) on each plate and set aside. Slice avocado and prepare pico de gallo and set aside. In a saute pan, begin cooking chorizo over medium heat. Continue cooking chorizo while you work on other components, about 7-8 minutes.</p>
<p>In a small sauce pan, melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour to create a roux. Gradually whisk in half and half and half of the milk, whisking out any chunks of flour. Stir in cheese and let melt, stirring occasionally for 3-5 minutes. Whisk in additional milk of mixture is too thick to get a smooth, semi-thick and creamy sauce or whisk in more cheese if mixture is runny. Dust lightly with salt and whisk well. Keep on low heat, stirring occasionally, until eggs are cooked.</p>
<p><em>For scrambled eggs:</em> As your chorizo and cheese begins to cook, crack eggs into a small bowl and add a splash of milk. Whisk well. Add 1/2 Tbsp butter to a non-stick pan over medium heat. Once melted and pan is hot, pour in egg mixture. Stir occasionally, scraping pan to fluff and scramble eggs until eggs are cooked and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.<br />
<em>For poached eggs: </em>We use this odd Depression-era egg pan of my husband&#8217;s but here is an easy <a href="http://localfoods.about.com/od/preparationtips/ss/PoachEggs.htm">picture tutorial</a> to get it right without a special pan.</p>
<p><a href="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6164 aligncenter" title="huevos2" src="http://hauteapplepie.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/huevos2.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Top tostadas with chorizo and eggs. Layer on avocado and pico. Drizzle with cheese sauce and hot sauce. Serve immediately.</p>

On one adventure, we visited the &#8220;sideways library&#8221; coffee shop, <a href="http://www.despresso.com/">D&#8217;Espresso</a>, with a ton of anticipation to see all the books lining the walls, floors and ceilings.  Unbeknownst to me, the <a href="http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/a_look_inside_sideways_coffeeshop_d.php#photo-1">original picture</a> we saw was just actually just full of trickery, as the &#8220;books&#8221; on the interiors were actually just wallpaper&#8230;. a disappointment indeed.  (I should have looked at all the pictures, not just the first, and actually read the article. nuts!)  Needless to say, along with Balie, we enjoyed each other&#8217;s company and the fine thrill of a good book.</p>
