				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you enjoy snow in Paris? You go out in search of hills, of course!</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0480a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416221" alt="IMG_0480a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0480a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>And there&#8217;s probably no better place to find them than what used to be a sparse, windmill-dotted countryside outside the city limits: Montmartre.</p>
<p>There was a sense of event in the city this weekend as Paris got hit with the most snow it&#8217;s seen in 24 years, and not wanting to miss out on the spectacle I abandoned the promise of a cozy peaceful Sunday at home and schlepped a camera and many layers of clothing into the great white tundra. I expected the picturesque streets; what I didn&#8217;t expect was to see so many Parisians, who are normally reserved and measured, giving into pure unadulterated playfulness.</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0488a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416226" alt="IMG_0488a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0488a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0506a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416227" alt="IMG_0506a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0506a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0508a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416228" alt="IMG_0508a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0508a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0527a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416229" alt="IMG_0527a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0527a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0556a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1726416224" alt="IMG_0556a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0556a.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0555a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416223" alt="IMG_0555a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0555a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>And where there&#8217;s no hill, you make do:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0536a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416237" alt="IMG_0536a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0536a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>The area buzzed with a sense of village community and camaraderie, and the weather only strengthened the feeling of rural and rustic that Montmartre does so well.Â  It made you forget you were in a city at all, and with snow like this being so rare here, around every corner was a reminder that you were witness to a fleeting version of Paris, one to be revered and locked into the memory banks.</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0499a1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416244" alt="IMG_0499a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0499a1.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0599a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416241" alt="IMG_0599a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0599a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0549a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416239" alt="IMG_0549a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0549a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0582a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416240" alt="IMG_0582a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0582a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>And for every charming landscape there were an equal number of quiet details to complete the wintry scene:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0493a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416249" alt="IMG_0493a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0493a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0496a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416250" alt="IMG_0496a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0496a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0563a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416252" alt="IMG_0563a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0563a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0637a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416247" alt="IMG_0637a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0637a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0501a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416251" alt="IMG_0501a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0501a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0598a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416254" alt="IMG_0598a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0598a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0609a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416255" alt="IMG_0609a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0609a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0620a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416246" alt="IMG_0620a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0620a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0584a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416253" alt="IMG_0584a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0584a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>One detail I was happy to have at hand were the metal pylons along most streets, which had always seemed to serve a dual purpose &#8212; to prevent sidewalk parking and to protect pedestrians on narrow streets &#8212; but which now assumed an indispensable third function as an aide to hoist myself up some of the more slippery slants:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0580a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416259" alt="IMG_0580a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0580a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>The usually bustling <em>Place du Tertre</em> was subdued and still, with only the most dedicated (or broke?) of outdoor painters braving the elements for the occasional commissioned portrait:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0615a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416260" alt="IMG_0615a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0615a.jpg?w=720"   /></a><br />
And of course you can&#8217;t leave the area without acknowledging the big white elephant in the room, which had received an extra shade of white to its already milky exterior:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0643a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416242" alt="IMG_0643a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0643a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0650a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416262" alt="IMG_0650a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0650a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>As its gargoyles displayed just how freaking cold it was, regardless of how much hellfire you happen to have been born out of:</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0662a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416266" alt="IMG_0662a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0662a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0656a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416264" alt="IMG_0656a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0656a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0658a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416265" alt="IMG_0658a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0658a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>And then the winter&#8217;s afternoon slipped away from Montmartre, the sun and temperature coasting down the snowy hills into night, and locals and visitors alike admired an elevated view of the city akin to that of a tray of warmÂ <i>pÃ¢tisseries</i> lined up in a bakery window, freshly dusted with a coat of powdered sugar for the pleasure and delight of all who pass by.</p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0668a1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416275" alt="IMG_0668a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0668a1.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0722a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726416256" alt="IMG_0722a" src="http://afrenchfryeinparis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_0722a.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>

<p>By Stephen Bryen</p>
<p>News reports from Algeria tell us that the hostage siege at the Ain Amenas Gas Plant in the Sahara is now over, but the final list of casualties remains uncertain. So far we know that the operation resulted in the escape or release of some 685 Algerian workers and 107 foreigners. Â Current information says that 23 hostages are confirmed dead; another 25 bodies, presumed to be hostages, have so far been found in buildings. Â There are probably more deaths as a number of vehicles were struck by Algerian Air Force helicopters and destroyed, and these vehicles are said to have been carrying both hostages and terrorists. The Algerians report that âallâ 32 terrorists were killed.</p>
<p>There has been serious criticism of the Algerian Army and Special Forces raid and claims they did a poor job resulting in an excess of civilian deaths. From information so far that is available, about 6% (six percent) of the hostages died during the operation.Â  Possibly the number will rise, but it is unlikely to exceed 10%.</p>
<p>Is this a bad result or a good result?</p>
<p>In October, 2002, Chechen terrorists took over the Dubrovka theater in Moscow. There were some 850 hostages trapped in the theater and around 40 to 50 Chechen terrorists. The Russians tried to negotiate, over the course of a number of days, with the Chechens but no solution was found. Â Meanwhile the Chechens had executed a few of the hostages for various reasons.</p>
<p>On October 26 Russian Special Forces flooded the theater with a chemical agent, pumping it in through the ventilation system. Â Following this the Russian forces poured into the building and killed all the terrorists. Â Of the hostages 117 died as a result of the gas.</p>
<p>The incapacitating agent has never been officially identified but it is something called by the Russians <b>Kolokol-1</b>.Â  Kolokol-1 is likely a morphine derivative that is aerosolized and based on fentanyl. Â The actual compound is 3-methylfentanyl.</p>
<p>In evaluating the Russian operation it can be seen that the number of civilian casualties was particularly high âroughly 15%. Â Many of the hostages, when freed, required urgent medical treatment. Â There is an antidote for Kolokol-1, but it must be administered quickly to work.</p>
<p>Poison gases intended to maim or kill are regarded as chemical agents and are banned under the Geneva Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Kolokol-1 straddles the fence of legality, because while it is not intended to kill, it is a potent substance (1,000 times stronger than morphine) and, as the Moscow theater case shows, can be quite lethal.</p>
<p>Physically, the Moscow theater episode occurred in a closed building that was barricaded and filled with 40 or 50 heavily armed killers equipped with explosives, automatic weapons, grenades and RPGâs. If the Russian Special Forces had operated in the same way as the Algerian forces, and attacked with conventional arms, it is likely that the death count may have been higher than it was because of the lack of space to pick out targets. Perhaps other weapons, such as stun grenades, may have helped; but it is unlikely to have been effective given the mass of people and the determination of the Chechens.</p>
<p>If comparisons are used, the Algerians did âbetterâ(6% to 10% versus 15%) than the Russians. Â Â Of course, the physical space of operations was markedly different.</p>
<p>Just last month the U.S. Consul in Turkey reported in a âsecretâ cable (which was leaked) that the Syrians used chemical weapons in Homs on December 23<sup>rd</sup>. Â Â Â The chemical weapon identified is called by the Syrians <b>Agent 15 </b>and, in fact, it is a CX-level incapacitating agent that causes some temporary sickness and disorientation. The agent is probably 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate, which is a compound related to atropine (which itself is an antidote for nerve gas).Â  This compound is âcontrolledâ under the Chemical Weapons Convention although Syria is not a signatory to the convention.Â  Â States who signed the convention should have destroyed chemical weapons and weapons manufacturing by last year, but Level 2 materials are not actually required to be destroyed. Â (Level 2 or Schedule 2Â chemicals supposedly have legitimate small-scale applications. Manufacture must be declared and there are restrictions on export to countries which are not CWC signatories.)</p>
<p>The issue of incapacitating agents is not resolved under the Convention and most countries have them, including the U.S.Â  Probably for this reason the State Department was encouraged to not denounce the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons in Homs.</p>
<p>Would a more effective incapacitating agent have been better than the military assault carried out by the Algerians?Â Â  It is far from clear, but it may be that more research into less lethal, but more effective, incapacitating agents that can work in open areas rapidly and effectively would make sense (especially if the lethal characteristics of such materials can be mitigated). Of course this means that chemically based incapacitating agents can be an important element in future counter terror operations. Â While there is no public discussion as yet, research in this area seems warranted and urgent.</p>
<p>No one should fault either the Russians or the Algerians for standing up to a terrorist attack and doing their best under extremely difficult circumstances. Â  Perhaps in future they will have even better tools and such incidents will result in fewer casualties.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PART UMPTEEN OF AN OCCASIONAL, HYSTERICAL SERIES</strong></p>
<p>We have had torrents of rain for the last week. As a result, driving my son to school has been permanently upgraded from a Level 2 to a Level 1Â risk activity. This is because of the new holes that have formed in the road.</p>
<p><a href="http://siciliangodmother.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/road_hole.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562" alt="road_hole" src="http://siciliangodmother.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/road_hole.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I do have a money-making plan to take advantage of this, though. I am going to open one of the giant holes in the road as a municipal open-air swimming pool and sell admission tickets to locals. I shall open the other networked hole-complex as the &#8220;Bagheria caves and grotto&#8221; and charge an exorbitant admission fee to tourists, which will include aÂ guided tour and a souvenir lump of dislodged asphalt.</p>
<p>Well, this local event reminded me to publish another installment in my occasional series on <em>Driving in Sicily</em>.</p>
<p>Road holes are a major hazard in Sicily. They are literally everywhere. You will never find twenty feet of road free of a significant hole. Like my new local ones, they can often be as much as two feet deep. Look out for puddles! They may contain far more water than you estimated!</p>
<p>When driving along in a particularly holey area, you can adopt one of two tactics. One is to look for a hump before the hole, accelerate towards it and thus lift your vehicle up into the air enabling it to fly over the hole and land gently the other side. This is clearly a technique for advanced drivers. The other is simply to swerve around all holes slalom-style to avoid thumping down into them.</p>
<p>Fiats have fairly &#8220;rigid&#8221; suspension,Â so some form of hole avoidance is to be recommended. Extreme hole avoidance can become addictive, however, and as cars overtaking you may not have got round to hooting at you yet, it would clearly be dangerous if you were to take a huge and sudden swerve in front of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://siciliangodmother.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/car_hole.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-563" alt="car_hole" src="http://siciliangodmother.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/car_hole.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Hole avoidance on motorways is particularly important, and complex.</p>
<p>Motorway driving in Sicily is completely different from motorway driving in the rest of Europe. The motorways only have two lanes. I am aware they are like this in Germany too, and that Germans solve the problem by driving along one behind the other at 120 miler per hour, leaving a safe stopping distance of three quarters of an inch. Most Sicilians solve the problem by driving along the hard shoulder instead.</p>
<p>In Sicily there is also the problem of finding cars travelling up the slip road in the wrong direction. There is the fact that the &#8216;I&#8217;m pulling out if you don&#8217;t hoot&#8217; rule means Sicilian drivers always pull out of slip roads in front of you, because they have already built up so much speed that no matter how much you hoot, the Doppler effect means they think it was a rare bird cooing to its love in a distant nest.</p>
<p>Above all, there is the fact that there are never any warning notices or road cones set up to close a lane when there are road works going on. You just find yourself screaming at seventy miles an hour towards a vast hole, forming a dead-end, demarcated by a sign embellished with diagonal red stripes and a row of bum cleavages, getting sunburnt and sweaty while their owners mess about with tarmac (yes, some things are just like home). The hard shoulder on your right is occupied by a Fiat Uno on the verge of breaking the land speed record, and there is a ten ton lorry overtaking you in the lane to your left. Here is where you test the emergency braking powers of your silver Fiat Punto, and hope that the driver of the white Fiat Cinquecento behind you has got fast enough reactions to go from seventy to nought in five seconds while talking on his mobile phone which, since he&#8217;s Sicilian, makes him look as if he is conducting the Emperor Waltz with both arms and one leg.</p>
<p>Pedestrians are the final road hazard to be aware of in Sicily. They are often sensible enough to realise that they should keep well out of your way, yet you will find that there is a steady but reliable supply of fools just waiting to leap in front of you as you rocket towards them.</p>
<p>They will often be daredevil young lads who like to feel they can outrun any Fiat Uno that may dare to defy them as they cross the road. They may be lardy little kids in tracksuits drawn towards the cake shop. Most often of all, however, they will be a little, old, round-shouldered granddad, about three feet tall, carrying a colossal crate of oranges or bread or artichokes from his delivery van to his shop. He is seventy-five years old, he has been doing this backbreaking work full-time since he was nine, and frankly he does not care if somebody takes him off now.</p>
<p>Or does he? Perhaps he feels his time on this earth is running out and he simply cannot afford to waste precious minutes of his remaining life waiting for all the Fiats to get out of his way. Perhaps it is because he has a picture of Padre Pio and another of the Baby Jesus of Naples pinned up in his shop and he knows they are looking out for him. Or else perhaps he knows that his six foot tall son TotÃ² is in the Fiat behind you and, if you touch a whisker on his body, you will find yourself going swimming with concrete boots on.</p>
<p>This brings me to the single most important rule for road safety, not only in Sicily but throughout Italy. That is, always have a religious icon dangling from your rear view mirror. You can touch it and say a little prayer before crossing a particularly ropey-looking road bridge which has not been restored since Ancient Roman times. (Readers in America may think that is part of my trademark exaggeration, but it isn&#8217;t). You can also look at it for inspiration and safe guidance throughout performing any particularly tricky manoeuvre, such as a three-point turn on a motorway.</p>
<p>Sicilians will often go on a pilgrimage somewhere and bring a dangly icon or at least a rear window sticker back for their car. My Mother-in-law, The Godmother, always takes two suitcases when she travels on pilgrimages, one for luggage and a second, empty, one to fill with sacred relics to distribute among her loved ones upon her return. Sicilians also usually have the local priest come and bless their new car or motorbike before they drive it, dousing it with holy water and saying potent prayers over it. At the very least, furnish yourself with some rosary beads. They will help you defy all the odds and survive driving the streets of Palermo and the motorways of Sicily. Do not expect divine protection without them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://ipledgeafallegiance.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/we-the-people.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1744 aligncenter" alt="h" src="http://ipledgeafallegiance.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/we-the-people.jpg?w=482&#038;h=199" width="482" height="199" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Filibuster: </strong>The English term &#8220;filibuster&#8221; derives from the Spanish <i>filibustero</i>, itself deriving originally from the Dutch <i>vrijbuiter</i>, meaning &#8220;privateer, pirate, or robber&#8221;. It is also the root of the English word Freebooter.</p>
<p>The use of the filibuster in the American Senate was a tactic used to delay or prevent the passage of legislation, usually opposed by a minority of members. In years past, real filibusters rarely happened since they required opposition senators to go to the effort of standing on their feet and speaking continuously for hours on end. Only the most intense and dedicated opposition would mount filibusters.</p>
<p>However, the &#8220;traditional&#8221; filibuster custom was significantly changed only a few years ago to allow senators to &#8220;filibuster&#8221; <strong>without actually speaking and consuming their own time. </strong>That would be equivalent to you not having to go to work and do your job but still being able to say that you worked so you can collect your paycheck. And imagine if you, the workers, were able to decide on creating this rule yourselves without having to consult your bosses?!</p>
<p>Of course as one would expect this new &#8220;silent filibuster&#8221; is just way too convenient. Why should anyone go to work then if only ten Senators (workers) can sign a piece of paper and then the object of their wrath (the job) requires a 60% supermajority to pass. So, since all 100 senators now know that there are not enough senators (workers) to pass the legislation (do the job) then no one really needs to show up for work!</p>
<p>By eliminating the cost of filibustering, this new and ingenious rule has effectively undermined majority rule, a cornerstone of our constitutional republic and the definition of a &#8220;working Senate&#8221; itself&#8230; Now all the minority needs to do (in many cases just 1 disgruntled Senator (worker) to prevent a bill from even reaching the floor is simply to threaten to filibuster. Debate never begins. Real filibusters almost never take place. And this of course is cleverly and ironically called a &#8220;silent&#8221; filibuster, an oxymoron if there ever was one, kind of like &#8220;no-show job&#8221; or &#8220;unemployment pay&#8221; or &#8220;Welfare queen&#8221; Â wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>
<p>If a worker&#8217;s union came up with this ingenious tactic to help its workers avoid work and still demand their pay no doubt the government and the taxpayers would move to either disband the union or call out the national guard to have them arrested and thrown in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry boss but we all can&#8217;t work today because Joey here doesn&#8217;t like what you&#8217;ve asked us to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>How appropriate! The American Senate once one of the most august legislative bodies in the world Â has managed to transform itself into a non-functioning band of lazy, do-nothing <strong>pirates of panache</strong>! <strong>privateers of personality</strong>! <strong>robber barons of democracy</strong>! and by the very definition of the word that describes their most favorite and new and improved way to get their jobs done&#8230; <b>freebooters!</b></p>
<p>If only &#8220;We the People&#8221; could really give them the boot!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://afeatheradrift.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/funny-sports-12.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7626" alt="funny-sports-12" src="http://afeatheradrift.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/funny-sports-12.jpg?w=300&#038;h=229" width="300" height="229" /></a>Are we getting it yet?</p>
<p>Are you still enthralled with your favorite hero? Is it Clay Matthews or LeBron James? Is it Wayne Gretzky or Miguel Cabrera? You do realize they are humans and they are flawed don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Lance Armstrong is so flawed he deserves to be in his own hall of fame of worst possible human being in the entire 20th and 21st century. I mean, he stands back and admits to all the things he&#8217;s been accused of for years, without batting an eye, oblivious EMOTIONALLY to all the pain he has caused others. He&#8217;s a sociopath, and in another life would be a mass murderer. Instead he&#8217;s just a mass cheater, liar, and life wrecker.</p>
<p>Manti Ta&#8217;o? The kid from Notre Dame with the strange story about the girlfriend he had never met and may never have existed? Oh, I have no clue if Manti was in on the hoax or a victim of it. Having spend more hours than I wish to admit to on the old IRC back in the day, I know so many stories like this that I&#8217;m inclined to give the kid the benefit of the doubt. I knew people who feel deeply in love with personas that were not even close to truth. I knew men who fell in love with men who thought they were women. Truly it happens. Or it did.Â  .Â  .Â  . back in the day at least.</p>
<p>Never happened to me. Back before the Contrarian, I met a lot of men via the Internet, and physically met close to a half dozen. They were all who they purported to be. I was lucky I guess. I met the Contrarian via the Internet, and in a display of utter dumbness, or incredibly acute intuition, gave up my apartment and hired a moving company before I had laid eyes on the man. But we are now into thirteen years of marriage, and a happy one at that. Don&#8217;t use me as measure however of the safety of this medium of communication. I am quite sure if you x-ray my skull, you will find the alien implant that suggests I&#8217;m just on loan from Planet Glix for an earthly experiment. I think my real occupation, when not being a test subject (think 2 years government service equivalency), is as an online psychic charlatan on the run from three known law suits, and three hybrid brides who were left at the altar.</p>
<p>See, that stuff floats through my head, and just must be when the old implant goes into a defib mode for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Anyway, either Manti or Lance serve once again to remind us that we should never place our adoration at the foot of most any human, for they are just always going to disappoint you in the end by being ALL TOO HUMAN. Or maybe less human in the case of Lance.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, where does one lay one&#8217;s adoration? Some find elegance in the medium of mathematics, and indeed I can appreciate the elegance of that. Or the universe itself which has a majesty that is enough for 3,000 lifetimes. One can find enough to adore in the soft breathing of a newborn, a new-born of any species actually. Awe is part of adoration after all, and life awes.</p>
<p>I find a single dandelion growing through the crack in an old sidewalk worthy of adoration. After all, talk about tenacity. Tenacity seems worthy of adoration.</p>
<p>So symmetry,Â  the miracle of life, and tenacity are in the mix. How about longevity?</p>
<p><a href="http://afeatheradrift.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/old-man.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7627" alt="Old-Man" src="http://afeatheradrift.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/old-man.jpg?w=300&#038;h=205" width="300" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>There is much to be admired in a face like this. A worn face, a face that has worked, loved, cried, laughed, and somehow continued on.</p>
<p>Eyes that hold a library full of stories.</p>
<p>Hands that have caressed a woman&#8217;s cheek and then tightened around a wrench and heaved loose a nut.</p>
<p>Shall we trip the light fantastic and delve into the realm of mystery? Shall we glimpse the ineffable, the transcendent? Are we not in the place of adoration?</p>
<p>Shall we imagine the temperatures and pressures that brought into being the pebble that you walk upon? That came from the rock, that came from the mountain, long broken and sunk back into the landscape? Adore it?</p>
<p>Did all this start in a giggle of a thought about Mitt Romney and his reference to liking &#8220;sport&#8221; instead of &#8220;sports?&#8221;</p>
<p>Can we adore the mind that can move across such distance of space and subject,Â  and still remain stable enough to shop for groceries and watch 30Rock?</p>
<p>You tell me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today Michelle Obama announced a new organization, Organizing for Action, that will take hold of the much vaunted list of names built by the Organizing for America Obama presidential campaign, and press the president&#8217;s agenda (which pieces and how strongly remains to be seen).</p>
<p>It is, as Joe Biden would say, a Big *#:D*C@ Deal.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/01/18/michelle-obamas-new-style-bangs/" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal is comparing her to Kim Kardashian because she just got a &#8212; breaking news &#8212; haircut</a>, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57564673/michelle-obama-debuts-new-bangs-on-her-birthday/" target="_blank">CBS News is all over the birthday bangs</a>, andÂ <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/01/18/michelle-obama-gets-bangs-ahead-inauguration-what-do-think-her-new-look/" target="_blank">FOX News is running a poll about her new bangs: Do you guys like them</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/feminists-split-by-michelle-obamas-work-as-first-lady/2013/01/18/be3d636e-5e5e-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html" target="_blank">Meanwhile the Washington Post took the opportunity to headline the Style section with a big story: Four years later, feminists split by Michelle Obama&#8217;s &#8216;work&#8217; as first lady</a>.</p>
<p>Does it need to be spelled out that Michelle Obama isn&#8217;t taken seriously by the media, to say nothing of the government that doesn&#8217;t pay her for her work as an official representative of the state, and that&#8217;s a national crime?</p>
<p>But I would like to return to the Post article about some white feminists&#8217; less than enthusiastic appraisal of Michelle Obama. I am familiar with what the article refers to, and it extends beyond outcry when she proclaimed herself &#8220;Mom in Chief.&#8221; I have seen some criticism of her within white feminist quarters because she is into gardening.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the media is breathlessly covering her bangs and her arms and her clothes.</p>
<p>As I see it, this is not what feminism was supposed to do: Judging women for how they self-define, rather than judging the mainstream culture for devaluing women.</p>
<p>Any woman, any person, any human being, should be respected to self-define. This belief is at the core of my feminism. Michelle Obama wants to call herself &#8220;Mom in Chief&#8221; &#8211; great. Marissa Mayer wants to go right back to work after she has a baby &#8211; she alone knows best how to navigate her own work and family life. Oprah Winfrey wants to give Lance Armstrong another opportunity to be a total jerk in front of everyone for two nights in a rowÂ - okay, here we can draw the line (public actions are different than private life choices).</p>
<p>Michelle Obama is not respected because she is First Lady. The First Lady position has never been respected, and it has always been constrained. That&#8217;s a national crime. But, Michelle Obama is also not respected because she is a black woman, and that is equally a national crime.</p>
<p>Feminism is a social justice movement that is inextricably entwined with the racial justice movement, but the road has not been without hiccups, and there is still a long way to go. One of the spaces where I most see fellow white feminists tripping up is assuming that things frequently rejected along some (but certainly not all!) white feminists&#8217; path to empowerment &#8212; motherhood, religion, sexy clothing &#8212; must be rejected by every woman, or empowerment is impossible for that woman and all women.</p>
<p>This is one of those areas where I think feminism is changing. The pressure to say an experience must be universal to be valid doesn&#8217;t hold as much water in an Internet-enabled era. In fact it is the sea of heterogenous particulars that makes us strong. The concept of feminisms, versus a feminism, is nothing new, and yet now more than ever before we are able to hear from different people, and realize that it&#8217;s okay &#8212; preferable &#8212; to be diverse in our emotions and interests and thoughts just as in our ethnicity and gender expression and sexuality (historically prized by feminists, however imperfectly).</p>
<p>Listening, and not telling, is at the core of where modern feminism is headed. Offering support, rather than requiring approval, is at the core of where modern feminism is headed.</p>
<p>The sub-par way that Michelle Obama is treated, both by the mainstream culture, as well as within some pockets of feminism, presents a major growth opportunity. Let&#8217;s take it.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Are you into the broader &#8216;feminism is changing&#8217; discussion? Mark your calendars to join me, Andrea Plaid, Gloria Feldt, Shelby Knox, Stacey Burns, Steph Herold, Veronica Arreola and tons of other activists and advocates for an #InterGenFem TweetChat on Thursday, Jan. 31 from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. EST. <a href="http://intergenfem.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Save the date and tell your friends</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday on Rachel Maddow&#8217;s blog, there was a question to all &#8220;blue dots.&#8221; Why do you stay in red states and do you ever want to leave?Â The question struck right at the issue most on my mind since the reelection of the President. It seems that writers (particularly from the Northeast) publish article after article along the lines of &#8220;What is wrong with the South?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Go Ahead And Secede Already.&#8221; They have been popping up like Honey Boo Boo references. Most of them are almost gleeful at the thought of dumping the South. (Because this is what Lincoln wanted ?!?)</p>
<p>Each time I see these articles, I get a little more angry. It would be dishonest to say that this isn&#8217;t a longstanding peeve for me. Bill Maher is a perpetual offender. The Simpsons, the media (old &amp; new) and even my beloved Jon Stewart all take shots at the South regularly.</p>
<p>Now, let me be crystal clear. I get angry at all the hatred, bigotry and racism in the South every day of my life. But the jabs from other progressives are particularly hurtful. It would seem that with many red states trending purple (Virginia, North Carolina and Texas and Georgia soon enough) that this might beÂ counter intuitiveÂ to winning elections, but the South is a dependable punchline nonetheless.</p>
<p>As I read through the comments of the Maddow blog post, a few themes began to emerge. There are two main groups of &#8220;blue dots.&#8221; There are those, like myself who stay because we feel an obligation, a connection and/or are immersed in activism. However, there were many more who expressed a desire to leave and be done with the whole struggle. I sympathize with those so isolated in their own communities. It must also be said without reservation, that I stay as a white, married woman with children. Even though I am not religious and a vocal advocate for equality, my circumstance is much more comfortable than for many in the lgbtqai community and for people of color. My friends in these communities have sometimes left because their safety was at risk and because no one deserves to be surrounded by people who hate them. I get this. I support these friends because I know what it means to stand out in any way in communities of cultural lag.</p>
<p>I left the Southeast for the first time for Grad School at Drew University in the early 1990&#8242;s. Previously, I had grown up all over the region because my father was a Baptist preacher. I was given a scholarship to Drew (one of two a year) due to my &#8220;minority status,&#8221; as Appalachian. I never once thought of myself this way, although my heritage and culture were and are very dear to me. It was a bizarre experience. By the end of my first semester, I went to my mentor determined to withdraw and head South. She was from Texas and told me she experienced a similar dislocation when first up North. She suggested I find a place to eat food I liked (had to go to Harlem for that), make friends with other immigrants and buy cowboy boots. In essence, she told me if people were making assumptions about my intelligence, then I should at least make them feel uncomfortable about it. I took her advice and finished the degree. Without a doubt, it was the loneliest time of my life.</p>
<p>Since my return, the South has changed in many ways, particularly in the cities. And like everywhere else in the world, the cities are where the growth is occurring. People are less religious, more open with regard to sexuality, gender and race and less tolerant of intolerance. Anyone who read demographic information from the election knows this is happening all over the country. The Millennials are different. Teaching in colleges the last decade, it has been no surprise to me the ways in which this generation differs from previous ones. In my Diversity class, I survey students the first day about many aspects of their socialization. Less than a third in any class I&#8217;ve taught in six years still attend the religious services they grew up with&#8211;and I live under the buckle of the Bible Belt. They are consistently more liberal about social issues. I didn&#8217;t need Pew to know this, although it is always good to have statistical evidence to backÂ anecdotal information.Â There is also a rapidly growing Hispanic population.</p>
<p>This trend is bigger than one region, no doubt. But I believe it is also because there are many of us who have refused to abandon our own culture; the good (you are welcome for almost all modern music) and the bad (the racism, homophobia, etc.). If we all left, there would be no counter to ever pervasive right-wing yammer&#8211;on the radio, in the office and in the State Legislature. Young people raised here need to know that you can embrace where you come from and redefine it. Not so young people need to know it is okay to buck tradition, disobey the Church, distance themselves from the darker opinions of the past. Bottom line: We progressives are desperately needed.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t think this is a martyr move. I love living below the Mason-Dixon for many reasons. Here is a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="line-height:14px;">My family (99%) of them are still here. I see them several times a year&#8230;cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents and other relatives. </span><del style="line-height:14px;">Family is still a high priority here.</del><span style="line-height:14px;">Â  (It was rightly pointed out to me that this sentence is both bone-headed andÂ inaccurate. Of course people the world over value their families.)Â Â We don&#8217;t scatter as much as other Americans.</span></span></li>
<li>Way of life. One reason I hated living up North so vehemently was because it is all about work. We value leisure here. That is why we sit on porches.</li>
<li>Friendliness. I know this freaks people out at times and others think it is all a show. For me, banter with strangers makes society less hostile. Southern people aren&#8217;t known for their hospitality for nothing.</li>
<li>The land. Whether it is the beach, the mountains or the foothills&#8211;many of ourÂ ancestors came here for fertile land and freedom. My people are from Oconee County, South Carolina, which borders North Carolina and Georgia. When I see the Smokies, I breathe deeper and feel the power of the landscape each and every time.</li>
<li>Culture. Encompassing music, food and all else this wordÂ conjures. If I want to hear a banjo, I only have to drive a few miles. And if I want good biscuits and tea that is sweet, there is a meat and three down the road.</li>
<li>Faith. I sincerely believe that things are and will continue to change in the region. It is my hope that we can hold on to some of the aspects that distinguish us and still continue to evolve on social and religious issues. It may take longer than I want it to. It will surely take longer if me and all my fellow liberals flee and join the sneering ranks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;d be a quicker evolution if our progressive peers would dial back the haughtiness. Each time people from the South are portrayed as dumb, inbred, more racist than all other Americans, fat, lazy, and backward, it makes it that much harder to change opinions. These stereotypes have long lives and only nurse resentments from another time in history. Recognize that both historically and presently, the United States is not all it can be without the South. Lincoln did.</p>
<p>Yes, we use more resources from the Federal government and also like to complain about it. Yes, we have a persistent strain of racism in our history and in 2013. Yes, we speak a different dialect. Yes, our students&#8217; test scores are lower. Yes, we have more poverty. Yes, we are more overweight because we REALLY like butter. But, we did give you rock n&#8217; roll, blues and country music. We are teaching some of you how to relax (because you keep coming here to retire). We can claim The Highlander Center, Molly Ivins and former President Carter. And as poor Notre Dame found out, we give you kick ass football.</p>
<p>The South contributes a lot to the country. We are not a lost cause. And to Stewart et al: feel free to mock our politicians mercilessly. Most of them deserve it. Just leave the rest of us out of it&#8230;we need to keep our anger focused on injustice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book you didnât finish writing would have changed the lives of many people.</p>
<p>The band you gave up on would have radically changed the world of music even more so than The Beatles. </p>
<p>The family vacation you didnât take would have been the last time your whole family would be together and happy. Your dad would die two weeks later. </p>
<p>The dog you didnât save from being euthanized at the local shelter would have saved your son from drowning that cold day in November. </p>
<p>The orphan who sits on her bed praying for a family to come take her home and love her will never get adopted. She will become homeless and die of a drug overdose. If she had been adopted, she would have become the next Mother Theresa. </p>
<p>The man who never proposed to his girlfriend out of fear of ending up like his parents died, sad and alone. </p>
<p>The vacation to Hawaii you wanted to take twenty years ago, but never did, would have changed your whole life. You would have met your soul mate and eloped on the beach.  You would still be happily married today. </p>
<p>The girl you see on your bus every day that sits in the same seat with the same black fingernail polish and the loneliest look in her eyes wants to kill herself. If you had sat next to her that last day, you would have made a new friend. She would have been a bridesmaid at your wedding. Her parents were the only ones that went to her funeral. </p>
<p>If you had quit the corporate job that makes you miserable, you would still have a good relationship with your children. </p>
<p>The homeless man on the street corner that you drive by without a second glance would have used that dollar you gave him to buy a lottery ticket. He would have won millions and used the money to help find a cure for aids. </p>
<p>The old lady sitting in her rocking chair talking to her grandchildren about life has terminal cancer. She tells her grandchildren stories of love and adventure from her younger days. Her grandson will ask, âSo did you do everything in life you always wanted to, Grandma?â </p>
<p>âAlmost,â she says. </p>
