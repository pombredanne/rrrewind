<p>Several weeks ago I was asked if I would appear on a local cable TV show and demonstrate how to make &#8220;<em>low-fat</em> &#8221; latkes. This disturbed me greatly and I quickly responded that unfortunately I do not believe in low fat latkes. I think latkes are meant to be eaten only once a year, the real way. (fried in oil!) A once a year indulgence really celebrates and honours Chanukah the way it was intended. She responded &#8220;OK – You’ve convinced me!  You make a good point.  I was thinking of the healthy diets people are seeking.  But you’re right that maybe the normal latkes represent what Chanukah is about.  So let’s go ahead.&#8221; Unfortunately, the timing of the taping coincided with when I was going to be out-of-town, so we shelved the idea for next year.</p>
<p>This Saturday (December 8) marks the first night of Chanukah. In the second Century, the Holy Land was ruled by Syrian Greeks. King Antiochus IV was in control of the region. Under his rule, Jews were severely oppressed and not allowed to practice their religion openly. Against all odds, a small band of faithful Jews defeated one of the mightiest armies on earth, drove the Greeks from the land, reclaimed the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and rededicated it. When they sought to light the Temple&#8217;s menorah they found only a single vial of olive oil that had escaped contamination by the Greeks. Miraculously<b>,</b> the one-day supply burned for eight days. And hence, the reason for the tradition of eating foods fried in oil during Chanukah.</p>
<p>Every year I see recipes for all kinds of variations on the traditional latke. Several years ago  Bon Appetit magazine promised a “Gorgeous Chanukah Feast” featuring both cumin scented beet latkes and gingered carrot latkes.   While at first glance they seem intriguing, I could not actually see myself preparing either of these or any of the other interesting variations I have read about.  In the first place my family would revolt.  In the second place, I only make latkes once a year and I crave the traditional potato variety from my childhood.  I suspect that many of your families are similar to mine and sweet potato-parsnip latkes would not be met with cheers of joy.</p>
<p>My mother has an incredible sense of smell.  In our family, we joke that she can smell foul odours a day before they actually occur.  My childhood memories are filled with her going from room to room, sniffing and muttering, “What’s that smell?”  One of her least favorite smells was that of food cooked in oil.  She claimed that she could smell the oil for weeks afterwards.  Now I must be honest here and admit that I inherited my father’s sense of smell – that is to say that his lack of sense of smell.  He had sinus problems and his nose malfunctioned often.</p>
<p>That being said, once a year, on Chanukah, we had latkes. My mom’s latkes are fantastic.  They are lacy shreds of potatoes, fried until crisp.  The lingering smell of frying oil was quickly chased away by my mother’s secret blend of cleaning agents, a potent, lethal combination of Joy and Ajax.  Do not try this at home unless you are wearing a gas mask.</p>
<p>The first time my husband took me home to meet his family (we were not married yet, we had only been dating for about 3 months) was during Chanukah. His mom made latkes.  They were thick and creamy, not the thin lacy crispy shredded latkes that I grew up with.  After we were married we had our families over for a Chanukah party.  Of course, we could not agree on which kind of latkes to make, so we ended up making both.  The guests were starving by the time the latkes actually appeared at the table so both kinds were gobbled up very quickly.  Not being able to resolve which type were superior, I created a compromise recipe.  These latkes are thin and crispy around the edges, but still creamy in the centre.</p>
<p>Russet potatoes are my choice for the best latkes.</p>

<p>A Cuisinart makes fast work of the shredding.</p>
<p><a href="http://saltandserenity.com/2012/12/06/latkes-and-compromise-the-secret-to-a-happy-marriage/cuisinart-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-7611"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7611" alt="cuisinart" src="http://saltandserenity.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/cuisinart.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Half the shredded potatoes are set aside and the other half go back in the Cuisinart with an onion to be coarsely chopped with the steel blade.</p>

<p>The shredded and grated potatoes and onions get wrapped in cheesecloth and then you squeeze the heck out of them. Let the liquid sit for a few minutes. Drain off the liquid but keep the potato starch. This is the secret to latkes that do not fall apart while cooking.</p>

<p>Add a beaten egg, some kosher salt and about 2 tablespoons of matzoh meal or panko bread crumbs.</p>
<p><a href="http://saltandserenity.com/2012/12/06/latkes-and-compromise-the-secret-to-a-happy-marriage/egg-and-matzoh-meal/" rel="attachment wp-att-7612"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7612" alt="egg and matzoh meal" src="http://saltandserenity.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/egg-and-matzoh-meal.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>I like to fry my latkes in vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet. A heavy-duty non-stick pan will work if you do not have cast iron. A slotted serving spoon makes it easy to get the latke mixture into the pan.</p>

<p>I made some applesauce to go with the latkes. No recipe here. I used a combination of Granny Smith, Honey Crisp and Golden delicious apples. I quartered the apples. No need to peel or seed if you have a food mill. I added about 1/2 a cup of   water to the pot, covered it with a lid and cooked it on medium heat for about 10 minutes until soft. Then I put the whole mess through the food mill, which does a great job of filtering out the peel and seeds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Everyone knows what this diagram shows, correct? It shows the five-point diagram of plot, as specified by <a title="Gustav Freytag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Freytag">Gustav Freytag</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 342px"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Freytags_pyramid.svg" height="221" width="332" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)">Source</a>.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">But does anyone really know how to use it?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I understand the exposition, or introduction.  I understand the denouement, or conclusion.  It&#8217;s the stuff in the middle that gives me trouble, most notably the climax.<span id="more-2426"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I thought the climax was the characters&#8217; low point, where they go from reaction to action.  The conflict has been piled on them until they can hardly take it anymore all through the rising action, but they start to fight back at the climax.  Their fight takes up the falling action.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At least, that&#8217;s what I thought, based on my knowledge of the common form for stories.  Usually the story begins by throwing the main character into dire circumstances, which soon become worse and worse.  This goes on until the hero starts fighting back with some success, at which point there&#8217;s a long slog to the conclusion, where everything is hunky-dory again.  This is usually true regardless of the definition of climax.  But today I was told that the climax is usually the point at which the main character succeeds.  Frodo throws the Ring into Orodruin.  Aslan defeats the White Witch.  Valentine isn&#8217;t dead after all and the Count of Monte Cristo can rest, having defeated his many enemies.  (I&#8217;m just realizing&#8230;  That ending to <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> is really Dumas saying how he wished <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> had really ended.  I am glad Maximilian didn&#8217;t commit suicide, though.)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If the climax is where the hero succeeds, then the falling action has to be extremely short.  Almost nothing happens there.  Frodo destroys the Ring and the falling action is that Sauron dies, the orcs are routed, Aragorn is crowned and the hobbits go back to the shire.  Tolkien drew his out a little with the Shire conflicts at the end, but there still isn&#8217;t much.  Aslan defeats the White Witch and the falling action is the Pevensies&#8217; coronation and their eventual return home.  The Count completes his revenge and the falling action is Maximilian and Valentine getting back together and Cristo sailing off into nowhere.  <em>&#8220;</em><em>Wait and hope.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">See, I thought all these falling action examples were the conclusions.  They sound an awful lot like conclusions.  I thought the final battle sequence was the falling action, not the climax.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Climax is defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)">Wikipedia</a> as being &#8220;[a narrative work's] point of highest tension or drama&#8221;.  Would I say the point of highest tension or drama in <em>The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe </em>is when Aslan returns from the dead?  No.  Once I see Aslan, I know he can fix everything&#8211; that&#8217;s the assumption we make when we see a lion that can be killed and not be dead.  Perhaps I would say that the part just before that is the climax, when Peter is leading the army against the much larger army of the White Witch, knowing full well that she just killed Aslan.  That&#8217;s what I would call the characters&#8217; low point, and that&#8217;s what I would label as the climax.  When it seems that the hero couldn&#8217;t possibly succeed against these odds, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d label the climax.  It&#8217;s the height of tension.  The hero doesn&#8217;t seem to have anything working for him and is in the depths of despair.  The Fellowship is gone, Frodo was seemingly just killed by Shelob and taken by orcs, Gollum has betrayed them, and Sam has to take the Ring on or let Middle Earth perish&#8211; that&#8217;s the low point of <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>.  That&#8217;s when Sam starts fighting back.  He journeys on with the Ring, rescues Frodo and together they destroy the Ring.  That is the falling action, at least from my view of things.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a few different ways of diagramming plots that I&#8217;ve seen.  There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/10/07/writing-excuses-7-41-seven-point-story-structure/">Seven-Point Story Structure</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/10/02/writing-excuses-6-18-hollywood-formula/">Hollywood Formula</a>.  Both have points at which the characters are at the depths of despair, each at approximately 3/4 of the way through the story.  That would be what I call the climax.  According to the idea I heard this morning, however, the climax is the point at which the hero succeeds.  According to both of these structures, that would place the climax extremely near to the end.  Is that how everyone understands it?  I agree that just before the final battle finishes there&#8217;s a lot of tension, but is it really the climax?  In my opinion, the point just after the low point is where things start moving extremely quickly&#8211; thus, it stands to reason that that would be the falling action, doesn&#8217;t it?  Things start evening out immediately after the hero succeeds&#8211; so that should be the end of the falling action, shouldn&#8217;t it?  If you can answer, please do.</p>

Women do ask for more. They just aren&#8217;t rewarded for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;ambition gap&#8221; has always irritated me because it presumes something that&#8217;s not really about ambition. It&#8217;s about the fact that women often wind up doing things other than/in addition to dedicating themselves to their careers, and the assumption is that a) this is a choice &amp; b) as a result, women don&#8217;t get to advance as men might &#8212; that&#8217;s not an &#8220;ambition&#8221; problem, that&#8217;s a &#8220;society-wide, institutionalized sexism&#8221; problem.</p>
<p>As it turns out, personally, I was happy to plan my professional life in a way that means I work part-time and am my children&#8217;s primary care-giver, but a) that&#8217;s me and b) that&#8217;s a luxury.</p>
<p>The fact is that my personal choice happens to dove-tail with American society&#8217;s expectations of women: If you&#8217;re a woman, no matter your circumstances, it&#8217;s your job to care for other people. If those people are your babies, your elderly parents, or your (presumably) adult and fully functional husband (who, presumably, you deeply want to acquire), it matters not &#8212; their well-being, good behavior, and pleasant appearance is on your shoulders; you, of course, are on your own. There&#8217;s a reason the phrase &#8220;mommy track&#8221; exists, but &#8220;daddy track&#8221; not so much.</p>
<p>At the same time (surprise!), we don&#8217;t actually value that role. We don&#8217;t help stay-at-home parents with, say, tax breaks and government-subsidized childcare training. We don&#8217;t provide government-subsidized support for care-givers of folks on home hospice care. We don&#8217;t, generally, say &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry about that project, your family is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve always assumed that cultural and institutionalized sexism stand behind the &#8220;ambition&#8221; gap, but that said gap, and any impact it has on the pay gap, is real.</p>
<p>But no! It turns out that even when you account for all that, women get shafted at work:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[Research group] Catalyst has spent extensive time evaluating this issue. Its first report followed recent MBA graduates&#8230; to see how men and women fared.</em></p>
<p><em>Women&#8217;s first jobs out of school were at a lower level than men, and men had higher starting salaries, even when the number of years of experience, time since the MBA, industry, and geography were taken into account. Maybe men just start off more ambitious?</em></p>
<p><em>But they don&#8217;t. The findings held true even among men and women who aspired to the CEO or senior executive level. It also held true for men and women who didn&#8217;t have children. It&#8217;s not the mommy track. It&#8217;s something else.</em></p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s that something else? Is it choice of major? Choice of occupation? Early-life family requirements? It seems not. A recent study from AAUW looked at men and women one year out of college and found a 7% gender earnings gap, even when school selectivity, grades, choice of major, choice of occupation, and hours-worked were taken into account.</em></p>
<p><em>Even among extraordinarily ambitious and successful workers of both genders, Catalyst research found a gap. They followed full-time workers who didn&#8217;t take breaks for education or family reasons or self employment. The mommy-trackers were left out. But the gap didn&#8217;t go away: Twice as many of the most proactive men advanced to a senior executive level as similar women. The report concludes, &#8220;[W]hen women used the same career advancement strategies as men, they advanced less.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s one finding that particularly cleared my sinuses:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One study told 184 managers that they would have a limited pot of money to hand out in raises to employees with identical skills and responsibilities. The managers that were told they&#8217;d have to negotiate gave men two-and-a-half times the amount in raises that they gave to women before anyone sat down. This meant that the men didn&#8217;t even need to negotiate for higher pay, while women were already at a disadvantage when they tried to bargain up&#8230;.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here, where &#8220;here&#8221; = all of American society, a collective that encompasses 312 million people. I can&#8217;t help but feel that in a country in which the Bureau of Labor Statistics can categorize &#8220;child-care problems&#8221; as a <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat20.pdf">&#8220;non-economic&#8221; reason</a> for part-time work, the approach to resolving the pay gap will have to be decidedly multi-pronged.</p>
<p>But no matter how many prongs we bring to bear, this is the bottom-line: &#8220;Assuming that women have themselves to blame for the wage gap is an easy conclusion, because it doesn&#8217;t ask us to think [about] the treatment of women in the workplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only when we&#8217;re honest about the bias actually faced by 50% of humanity will we begin to be able to address it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://callmeshebear.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/staying-ahead-of-seasonal-depression/">blogged here before</a> about my struggles with Seasonal Affective Disorder. I know there are some people who think S.A.D is bullshit, but guaranteed, those people have never felt depression like I do. Whatever. Anyways, before I get side tracked on a rant about that, I should get to my point.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot more than the weather that has been dragging me down. In no particular order, my worries include how to balance being a working mom with being a good mom, grade 5 math homework, keeping track of bank accounts, bills, spreadsheets, accounting, an ongoing health problem, stress at work, stress at home, sibling rivalry, not enough time in the day, global warming, war, famine, violence against women, and on and on…</p>
<p>Oh and there’s the seven years of bad luck I might be getting from accidentally breaking a mirror in the bathroom the other week. Not that I am superstitious, but with the way my life has been going, you never know.</p>
<div id="attachment_1332" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 635px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1332" alt="On the right path? I'm not so sure about that. " src="http://callmeshebear.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/20121206-142353.jpg?w=590"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">On the right path? I&#8217;m not so sure about that. (an Inukshuk at Cherry Beach)</p></div>
<p>Life sure hasn’t gone the way I planned. That’s an understatement. I thought things would be different. As a kid, I used to think that life got easier as you got older. Now here I am pushing 40 and boy was I wrong about that. The older I get, things seem to get more complicated and every decision I have to make feels like the weight of the world.</p>
<p>Being a grown up is hard.</p>
<div id="attachment_1337" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 635px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1337" alt="Sometimes it's good to look back on your past to understand where you are in the present" src="http://callmeshebear.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/photo-1.jpg?w=590"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Perspective. Sometimes it&#8217;s good to look back on your past to understand where you are in the present</p></div>
<p>I’m sick and tired of complaining. I do have many good things going on in my life that I am happy about, planned or not. We just booked a two week winter vacation to a tropical destination in January. I can’t wait for that and I’m very excited about the photo opportunities this trip presents. I have two fabulous children who are funny, healthy and light up my day when I pick them up after work. I have a husband who works hard to provide a good life for our family. I have a good job and friends who assure me that I am not crazy for feeling the way I do, and that their lives also have not gone exactly as planned and they survived! That does make me feel better and not like a complete f#$% up.</p>
<p>I figure that instead of fighting this, and holding tight to my plans, the only thing I can do is let go and come up with something different.</p>
<p>So what’s my new plan?</p>
<p>“My Life, Plan B” is not a plan at all. It’s more of an intention. It&#8217;s an intention to let go of the tight grip on my big expectations, take things one day at a time, do what’s in front of me to the best of my ability, and trust that the blur coming up for me on the horizon will become clear to me and worthwhile when I get there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sport is a man&#8217;s world. At least that&#8217;s the impression I get when I watch any. Reporters are (mostly) men, reporting on (mostly) men, except where beach volleyball is concerned, and then it&#8217;s still seemingly just for men to look at. Not surprising then, the Olympics were a breath of fresh air this summer. Everyone cheered when Jess Ennis finally won that gold medal, when Lizzie Armitstead was the first Brit to step onto the victory stage, and when the aquatics centre exploded after Ellie Simmonds made it to the finish first. After all those Olympic success stories, you might expect women to get a bit more attention on the BBC&#8217;s sports pages*.  However, as <a href="https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism/status/275220361904271361">this tweet</a> in @EverydaySexism&#8217;s timeline made clear, it doesn&#8217;t seem to have happened. Out of three months of sport&#8217;s coverage highlighted on the BBC&#8217;s Facebook page, only 5.4% of posts covered women&#8217;s sports. Abysmal seems an appropriate description here.</p>
<p>So how does the sports coverage measure up? The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCSport">BBC Sport&#8217;s Facebook page</a> highlights only some of its sports coverage, so there is a chance that women are covered, but they just don&#8217;t make it onto the Facebook page. Unfortunately, the Beeb isn&#8217;t very good at archiving their sports material, so apart from collecting data from Facebook, there doesn&#8217;t seem to an easy way to retrospectively see how often they covered women in sport**. Luckily, the Dutch public broadcaster – the NOS – does archive all their sports coverage by date <a href="http://nos.nl/sport/archief/">on their website.</a> And to make this international comparison complete, I also added a bit of Belgian (or rather: Flemish – my French isn&#8217;t what it used to be) sports coverage by adding their public broadcaster&#8217;s sport Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sporza">Sporza</a>). For all three broadcasters, I gathered all their (highlights of) sport coverage for the whole of November.</p>
<p>So how do these three countries&#8217; public broadcasters compare on reporting on men and in sport? Well, not very good. The BBC had no posts relating to women&#8217;s sport at all, while the Belgians only specifically covered women in sport once: a story on professional female cyclists appearing in a &#8216;sensual&#8217; calendar. The Dutch, who contributed all stories not just highlights, score ever so slightly better. Though with only 11% of articles covering women, it&#8217;s hardly an improvement.</p>
<div id="attachment_197" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 514px"><a href="http://epidemiologista.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/its-a-mans-world-gender-imbalance-in-sports-reporting/sports-reporting-overall/" rel="attachment wp-att-197"><img class=" wp-image-197 " alt="Public broadcasters' articles on sports" src="http://epidemiologista.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/sports-reporting-overall.jpg?w=504&#038;h=298" height="298" width="504" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Public broadcasters&#8217; articles on sports</p></div>
<p>But hey, what about confounders, things that might mess this quick analysis up? Maybe there&#8217;s one particular sport (let&#8217;s call it football) that&#8217;s skewing these results. Women&#8217;s football is famous for its lack of coverage, so maybe these nations&#8217; football obsession is partly to blame for the lack of coverage of women in sports? Well, football does make up the majority of posts and articles, especially when looking at Facebook highlights.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://epidemiologista.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/its-a-mans-world-gender-imbalance-in-sports-reporting/sports-reporting-sports-by-country/" rel="attachment wp-att-198"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-198" alt="Sports reporting - sports by country" src="http://epidemiologista.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/sports-reporting-sports-by-country.jpg?w=504&#038;h=290" height="290" width="504" /></a></p>
<p>So what happens if we just ignore football (something we ought to do more often)? Well, nothing much really. Women are still massively underrepresented on the sports pages, with 1 in 5 articles focussing on them at best, and even fewer articles mentioning both men and women.</p>
<div id="attachment_199" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 514px"><a href="http://epidemiologista.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/its-a-mans-world-gender-imbalance-in-sports-reporting/sports-reporting-without-football/" rel="attachment wp-att-199"><img class=" wp-image-199 " alt="Ignoring football, there is still massive gender bias" src="http://epidemiologista.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/sports-reporting-without-football.jpg?w=504&#038;h=300" height="300" width="504" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ignoring football, there is still massive gender bias</p></div>
<p>What about those other sports? The UK and Belgian Facebook highlights didn&#8217;t include too many sports besides football or other male-dominated sports such as Formula 1. The Dutch broadcaster did include a lot of other sports though, so surely there must be some sports where reporting is more equal?</p>
<p>And yes: there seems to be some good news: for skiing, swimming and long-track ice speed skating*** gender balance looks a lot more promising with generally equal coverage. There are also some more disappointments though with cycling and tennis, which I expected to be more balanced.</p>
<div id="attachment_196" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 640px"><a href="http://epidemiologista.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/its-a-mans-world-gender-imbalance-in-sports-reporting/gender_balance_by_sport/" rel="attachment wp-att-196"><img class="size-full wp-image-196" alt="Coverage of men and women by sport (all the more reason to like long track ice speed skating!)" src="http://epidemiologista.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/gender_balance_by_sport.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coverage of men and women by sport (all the more reason to like long track ice speed skating!)</p></div>
<p>Especially for cycling I personally expected better. Mostly because coverage tends to be biased towards people or teams who win, and the current women&#8217;s world and Olympic road cycling champion happens to be Dutch. The men in Dutch cycling on the other hand, have hardly anything to boast about this year, apart from being mentioned in relation to Lance Armstrong just a bit too often. Still, only one single story covered women&#8217;s cycling.</p>
<p>Broadcasters aren&#8217;t the only ones to blame though. Especially in the case of road cycling, there just isn&#8217;t that much to broadcast. While the men will be plastered over the television every weekend from March till September, there are just two women&#8217;s races that tend to be covered live on Dutch television: the world championships and the Olympics. For almost all other classic road cycling races such as the Tour de France, Paris-Roubaix or Milan-San Remo, <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/vos-calls-for-womens-versions-of-the-major-classics">there are no races for women</a>. The men race, amateurs often get a chance to go on the course, and there might even be a special race for under-23s, but not for women.</p>
<p>This seems to lead to a vicious circle: there are fewer events for female athletes, leading to less media coverage, which in turn makes women&#8217;s sport less interesting for sponsors who&#8217;d like some air time by plastering their logo onto some sporty people, resulting in less money to actually put on those events.</p>
<p>It has to change. Sports like skiing seem to make it work. Lindsey Vonn is so far ahead of the rest of the field that she has asked to compete with the men. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/interactive/skiing/lindseyvonn/">She&#8217;d stand a fair chance</a>. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/sports/global/german-mixed-gender-relay-swim-team-wins-at-world-cup.html?_r=0">mixed gender relay</a> was introduced in swimming so men and women can compete together rather than having separate events. We loved seeing our women competing in the Olympics as much as we did the men. Now let&#8217;s get them back on their screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*And after the amazing Paralympics you might also expect some more attention for those athletes. However, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/">BBC Disability Sport page</a> still seems to be stuck in September.</p>
<p>**Do let me know if I missed something obvious – the overwhelming onslaught of male pheromones and yellow banners screaming off the page may have messed up my brain.</p>
<p>***i.e. the greatest sport on earth: athletes reach speeds of up to 70km/h (43mph) while basically wearing nothing but razor sharp knives under their feet and a tight fitting body suit – no helmets or any other type of protection is used. Its popularity is sadly restricted to Holland and Holland alone – though we like it that way as we can scoop up lots of Olympic medals without anyone else noticing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting up before dawn, and with hot cups of tea barely able to hold the fantastically cold morning at bay, we were treated to a ringside seat of the sunrise over the Siloli Desert. As the colours of the mountains sprang back to life and some of the sun&#8217;s warmth finally penetrated the four layers of clothing I was wearing, we clambered back into the car and headed towards the Reserva de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa and the border with Chile.</p>
<p>First stop in this bewildering landscape was the wind sculpted Arbol de Piedra, the Stone Tree, a huge lump of rock that over millennia has been carved by wind and sand into its current tree-like shape. That would be reason enough to stop and marvel at it, but it also stands in a vast desert plain surrounded by mountains streaked with colour making it one of the most surreal sights of our trip. Our early start was rewarded with having the whole desert to ourselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_1735" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4714.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1735" title="Heading towards the Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4714.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Heading towards the Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1736" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4721.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1736" title="Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4721.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>
<p>Even with the sun rising in the sky, at this time of day and at this altitude the temperatures were freezing and it was impossible to stand still for long without the cold piercing through clothing and footwear. It truly is an inhospitable place, but one an estimated 50,000+ tourists travel through every year.</p>
<p>A short journey to the south of the Arbol de Piedra lies one of the wonders of the whole region, Laguna Colorada, whose striking red waters contrasted against the deep blue sky are an extraordinary sight to behold. Although it looks like the scene of a toxic spill, the red colour is the result of algae in the water &#8211; the main source of food for the flamingos that thrive in the region, including the rare James flamingo which breeds in Laguna Colorada.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little like &#8220;Ten Amazing Things to Do Before Breakfast&#8221;, but climbing in altitude to a whopping 5000m we drove on towards the hellish looking and smelling Sol de Manana geyser. As you approach these boiling pools of mud and steaming fumaroles the nauseating stench of sulphur is overwhelming, but even that can&#8217;t take away from the wonder of the volcanic activity that is all around.</p>
<p>The first thing you see when you arrive is a jet of highly pressurised steam shooting out of the brown earth and making a screaming noise not dissimilar to the sound of a steam train whistle. The jet is probably about 15 metres high and the steam is hot!</p>
<div id="attachment_1742" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4766.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1742" title="Steam jet at Sol de Manana geyser, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4766.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steam jet at Sol de Manana geyser, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>
<p>Walking around the site is a bit like doing a day-trip to Hell and you have to be careful, the cracked earth can give way and collapse into bubbling mud underneath &#8211; as the sign says it&#8217;s <em>Peligro</em>. And did I mention the smell? Awful.</p>

<p>Leaving the fire and brimstone behind we set off for the furthest reaches of Bolivia to where the Laguna Verde and Volcan Licancabur nestle on the border with Chile. The drive passes a stretch of barren landscape that suddenly takes on the look of a sculpture park combined with a Japanese garden. Known as the Rocas de Dali, it is a peculiar sight.</p>
<div id="attachment_1748" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4796.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1748" title="Rocas de dali, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4796.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rocas de dali, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>

<p>I must confess that the one thing I&#8217;d really been looking forward to seeing was the last thing we&#8217;d see on the Bolivian side of the border &#8211; Laguna Verde. I&#8217;d seen photos of the stunning green water &#8211; created by chemical reaction &#8211; with the backdrop of the towering Volcan Licancabur and was excited to be finally able to see it in person.</p>
<p>As with much of life, it was something of a disappointment. There was little water and the green colour was, at best, subdued. Still you can&#8217;t hold that against the Bolivian Southwest, it is a privilege to spend time there. Next stop Chile.</p>

<p>Our earliest recollections from childhood often involve a vivid sensation that pains, excites or shocks us into self-awareness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, what occurs is brutal.<br />
This is the story of my first memory.</p>
<p>She was bleeding from both brows and pumping her legs against the slick vinyl floor when I entered. With her back pressed to the kitchen cabinets, this woman kicked like she was trying to save herself from dropping off a cliff. Elegant fingers, with bitten-down nails and knobby knuckles, clawed at the countertop above. Tangled at her breast was her hair, grown long since college with hanging, breezing bangs. They were plastered to her temples now, blood-soaked to the color black. Her eyes were mouths to the mascara rivers running down her cheeks. This woman&#8217;s small frame froze when the man standing near came closer.</p>
<p>He grabbed something from the oak table in the center of the kitchen. His cowboy boots clicked as he approached the woman on the ground. He squatted down and turned his head to inspect her, as he would to see if a shot animal was dead.</p>
<p>He scratched at the nape of his Texas neck, truck keys still in hand from the drive home. Forearms dangled densely from elbows planted on his knees. The keys tinked against the 22 oz. glass jar in his other hand, the Yankee-brand candle from the table that caused the afternoon&#8217;s argument. The man leaned in toward the proud head of the woman&#8217;s body. He did not speak loudly to her, but made sure she heard his words.</p>
<p>I did not hear what my father said to my mother before he swung. The mass just crashed into her jawline, crowding her teeth to the harsh left. The impact drew blood. He swung again. More dripped to her chest.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">My parents met in the stormy winter of &#8217;83 at Angel Fire Resort in New Mexico. Dad was working on ski patrol and recently had an encounter with one of my mother&#8217;s friends. The meeting between the men ended badly, with Dad breaking the other guy&#8217;s nose on one of the mountain&#8217;s runs. The day after the bloodshed, Mom charged through the patrol booth while eight months pregnant to bring my dad to justice. He was fiddling with the channels on his radio when she blew in with winter&#8217;s wind.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It&#8217;s important to mention here that she was not only visibly carrying my older brother Sepp at the time, but also married to her first husband Joe. My father knew this about her, but he wanted her anyway, even while she screamed, &#8220;I want this man arrested!&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">My mother didn&#8217;t know his charm before busting down the door that day. His smile is what quickly lured her in, as in the past when it attracted all the beauty queens that loved him then. Those never lasted, though, and marriage was not an option until he met my mother, causing him to pursue her from that day on, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Dried, dripping wax ran down the side of the glass in my father&#8217;s hand that day.  They were melted by the flame my mother set that morning to make the kitchen smell like Eucalyptus. My father was furious because she left it beneath a cabinet unattended. &#8220;You could&#8217;ve burned the house down,&#8221; his red face yelled after a swing.</p>
<p>My mother&#8217;s cry stirred me to action even at three years old. I leapt from my spectating stance and into her chest to save her, to keep my father from hitting her again. He repeatedly swore at me for interfering, but he did not make me his victim too. Instead he collapsed the kitchen around us, cracking the pantry door and tipping the spice and cookbook shelf. I hid close to my mother and listened to her heartbeat and its heavy strange heave. I felt her arms fall across my legs and back. Her breathing slowed as her bleeding teeth did. It eased even more as the door slammed and the shrinking growl of my father&#8217;s Harley told us he was gone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9516" title="facebook privacy hoax" alt="" src="http://scitascienda.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/facebook-privacy-hoax.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>So you posted <a href="http://www.snopes.com/computer/facebook/privacy.asp" target="_blank">the useless, pompous-sounding Facebook Privacy Policy Notice</a>, and now you feel silly? Okay. Let me tell you a story.</p>
<h2>How You Got to This Place</h2>
<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a man bought a printing press. But because he was busy running the printing press, or perhaps because he was more interested in the wonders of the rising mechanical age than the whimsy of making things up, he did not write books to print with his press.</p>
<p>He bought it because it was readily apparent that he could <em>sell</em> books, if he printed them. So he offered others money on a profit-sharing basis if they would send their writing to him.</p>
<p>He then talked to the general stores in many towns around him, and wrote letters to others, giving them lists of the books he had to offer their clientele. He became a publisher (packager) and distributor of other people&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="RCA Victrola phonograph" alt="" src="http://scitascienda.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rca-victrola-phonograph.jpg?w=150&#038;h=107" height="107" width="150" /></p>
<p>A long time ago, in the next galaxy over, the phonograph was invented. Something similar happened between those who realized they could make and sell recordings, but couldn&#8217;t sing worth a bent penny, and those who could sing like larks, but couldn&#8217;t tell a phonograph needle from a bent penny.</p>
<p>The idea of &#8220;media&#8221; is that it&#8217;s something that mediates between the creator and the consumer. These are the key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creative expression</li>
<li>The physical package which carries the content, in single or multiple copies</li>
<li>The system which delivers the package from creator to consumer</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s the basic need-to-know for all media and the weird stuff that happens with them. Including the medium of the internet.</p>
<p class="mceWPmore" title="More..."><span id="more-9511"></span></p>
<h2 class="mceWPmore" title="More...">Copyright Versus Licensed Rights</h2>
<p class="mceWPmore" title="More...">Since neither publishers nor creators could do for themselves what the other could, or at least, very much not as effectively, laws and contracts developed to govern this situation.</p>
<p>1) <em>The content belongs to its creator automatically. There is nothing the creator needs to do to assert this right. It is inherent. The creator has the right to determine who may make copies of the content to sell to others. The duration of the copyright expires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" target="_blank">when Mickey Mouse dies, and not a moment before.</a></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s copyright.</p>
<p>2) <em>In order to use the works of a creator, the publisher will pay the creator for license to make copies and sell them. The publisher may also buy the right to sub-license the content: to have someone else use or reproduce it. Or the right to have someone make a story into those newfangled things called a moving picture.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the license of rights.</p>
<p>As people interacted over these matters, some chaos and the occasional lynching ensued from time to time over who could do what with whose contributions to the various partnerships.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the middle of it all, the contract lawyers quietly smoked a cigar.</p>
<h2>Creation, Packaging, Distribution</h2>
<p>There was no other way. Printing presses were too expensive for individual writers to own one, and record producers never did learn how to sing.</p>
<p>Besides, there was that sticky bottleneck called &#8220;distribution.&#8221; Writers and musicians could, of course, spend a lot of money to get someone to turn their creations into physical products using expensive machinery. But they would only ever sell a few copies to their own distribution network, which mostly consisted of Mom and Aunt Joan. Cousin Fred tried to hide whenever the topic of &#8220;the new book&#8221; came up. He was no help at all.</p>
<p>Distribution &#8212; the art of putting the desired content, pre-poured into the desired packaging, in the hands of multiple recipients who wanted it &#8212; was a power held by those who had spent the time building connections. A hundred years and more of letters sent to general stores, then bookstores, then big-box stores, letting them know what was available for their clientele to listen to and read today.</p>
<h2>The Imbalance of Experience and Knowledge Base</h2>
<p>The publishers also had a hundred years&#8217; practice designing and tweaking contracts to allow them to repackage the content in every way possible, for as little profit-sharing as possible. (That is business.)</p>
<p>It is fair to say that, as creators weren&#8217;t the ones dealing directly with sales and competition and cost risks, their community members didn&#8217;t necessarily make themselves as educated about the ins and outs of rights, licensing and contracts as the community of publishers.</p>
<h2>Intergalactic Revolution</h2>
<p>Eventually, intergalactic communications were invented. They called it &#8220;the internet,&#8221; and quite naturally it destroyed everything for the galaxy of printing press owners and the galaxy of phonograph recording.</p>
<p>Except, not really.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the internet is not like the telephone or the post-box. Those delivery systems involve transmission without reproduction of or monetary gain from the content itself.</p>
<p>On the internet, you&#8217;re not merely paying a fee to have someone else carry your message. (Well, you do, to your internet service provider. But.) You also communicate by signing over the right for another party to replicate and transmit the data you type on your computer screen. Replication is copying the content you create. And that requires a license of rights.</p>
<p>That license is called the Terms of Service, or TOS, and its adjunct is the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Change, Opportunity, and Intergalactic Space Trucks</h2>
<p>Non-sequitur time!</p>
<p>There is a third galaxy out there, and it&#8217;s called long-haul trucking. Imagine that a truck is full of books. It takes them one way only: from the publisher to the store. There, people who are not content creators consume the books.</p>
<p>But what if every person who bought a book also created something and loaded it onto the truck, and sent it on its way? What if the truck was made of electrons, and it could go anywhere, to as few or as many of their contacts as they wished? Wouldn&#8217;t people look eagerly for the truck? It would bring them something of value to them, and send something of theirs back.</p>
<p>All they would have to do is sign a contract licensing the shipping depot to reproduce and distribute their content.</p>
<p>That sounds like a postal service, but it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s acquiring the right to reproduce content and distribute it to <em>many </em>endpoints. The internet has intergalactic space trucks with onboard replicators and multi-port teleporters for your content.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. There are also the invisible gnomes.</p>
<h2>The Truck-and-Delivery-Depot Shell Game</h2>
<p>The intergalactic space truck is also a shell game. Remember, you can use the depot and the trucks as long as you sign the content rights deal. While you&#8217;re focused on the free content delivery truck &#8212; waiting for it, sending it, making happy driving noises &#8212; the content packaging and delivery gnomes (otherwise known as tech developers) are invisibly rearranging the shipping depot around you, terraforming your internet environment to their advantage.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re waiting at the depot (let&#8217;s call it, say, Facebook) and constantly checking for a delivery or sending one out, the invisible gnomes can measure your unselfconscious, peer-generated consumer behaviour. This is like a producer/consumer petri dish, giving unprecedented insight into how to sell us what we already want.</p>
<p>Because we trust our friends. We&#8217;ll tell them what we wouldn&#8217;t tell a company. We tell them using the free trucks.</p>
<p>But no matter how many vroom noises we make, the trucks belong to the depot. They are in league with the invisible gnomes.</p>
<p>Social media &#8212; Facebook, Twitter, et al &#8212; is publishing and distribution, on steroids, with intergalatic space trucks and gnomes, hooking you in with free postage that isn&#8217;t free and pulling a bait and switch on what the real goods are.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t feel stupid. It really is that confusing.</p>
<p>And yet, if you remember the three components of all media, and the difference between copyright and licensing, it gets simple. Because it&#8217;s always been the same.</p>
<h2>Some Things Don&#8217;t Change</h2>
<p>&#8211; There are still plenty of clauses in rights contracts today which are not favourable to content creators.</p>
<p>&#8211; Packaging (publishing) has become immensely simplified. What used to be canvas and paint, or paper and ink, or vinyl and grooves, or 35 mm film, is now all one thing: electrons.</p>
<p>&#8211; Distribution is still a power held by those who control the networks. In prehistoric times, it was the roads and city gates. Then it became the telephone lines and radio frequencies. Now it&#8217;s the servers, satellites, cables and cellular towers.</p>
<p>&#8211; And, most content creators still don&#8217;t have a clue about intellectual property laws.</p>
<h2>&#8230;And Some Things Do Change</h2>
<p>The content creator is no longer just artists, writers, filmmakers and musicians who make a living from being semi-educated about this stuff; it&#8217;s not the kind of people who may use agents and lawyers and have a team to help them navigate the question of rights and licensing.</p>
<p>The content creator is now you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now your thirteen-year-old child with a camera phone and no concept of what Terms of Service means.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now your grandma, who thinks the internet is a very fast post-box for free.</p>
<p>Online privacy isn&#8217;t about copyright. It&#8217;s about who holds the permission to exploit that copyright, and to what extent. The best kind of licensing contract, from the licensee&#8217;s point of view, is the one that gets signed by content creators who don&#8217;t read it and/or don&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p>Enter the convenient and tiny Terms of Service checkbox. Click here to play.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how the internet works. Now everyone&#8217;s both consumer and creator. Their creative product is little bits of their existence in words, photos and videos. In the intergalactic milieu, the private citizen is no more. The rights to the details of his life &#8212; your life, your child&#8217;s life &#8212; have been licensed out <em><strong>by the user</strong></em> for corporate reproduction and distribution.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what you really need to know about copyright and privacy. End of story.</p>
