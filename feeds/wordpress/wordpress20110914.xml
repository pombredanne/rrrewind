			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember two things about my first day of kindergarten.</p>
<p>1) I saw two girls, one brown headed and one yellow headed, talking to each other in the snack line. I remember thinking, &#8220;Those are the two weirdest looking things I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life.&#8221; (Both later became good friends of mine, but not until they stopped looking so creepy).</p>
<p>2) I experienced love at first sight with a boy with a killer cowlick and flapping fish lips.</p>
<p>Other than that, my first day consisted of meeting Ms. Pinkham, rocking fresh white kicks, and wearing a tag all day. It was a traditional first day of school.</p>
<div id="attachment_614" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 419px"><a href="http://classygallie.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/first-day.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-614" title="first day" src="http://classygallie.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/first-day.jpg?w=409&#038;h=548" alt="" width="409" height="548" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I don&#039;t have a scanner, but I do have a multi-colored briefcase</p></div>
<p>To me, the second day of school is more important than the first; it&#8217;s more telling of the way things will be. Everyone knows the first day of anything doesn&#8217;t count, especially school. Teachers let you out of class early and your only assignment is to go to Staples and have the best time of your life buying page projectors and white out with your parents&#8217; money. It&#8217;s not until the second day when ish gets real.</p>
<p>On my second day of kindergarten, for example, my mom asked me what I wanted for lunch (kindergarten is still half a day I hope?).</p>
<p><strong>Mom:</strong> You hungry, Al? Want some lunch you little chubster you?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Mmm yes! Me hungwy, me so hungwy.</p>
<p><strong>Mom:</strong> I don&#8217;t understand anything that comes out of that idiot mouth of yours, but what would you like?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Wa wa and bwead, pwease mommy.</p>
<p><strong>Mom: </strong>Sounds like a prison meal. What&#8217;s wrong with you?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was wrong with me, but when my mom told me my lunch of bread and water sounded like a convict&#8217;s lunch, it made me like it even more. It made me want to be a criminal.</p>
<p>And maybe that&#8217;s why, before running out of the house to catch the bus, I threw on the jacket that I did. The  hardcore, black, leather motorcycle jacket from my dad&#8217;s shop <a href="http://northatlanticleather.com/">(North Atlantic Leather &amp; Repair &#8212; peep dat).</a></p>
<div id="attachment_615" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 344px"><a href="http://classygallie.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bamf.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-615" title="BAMF" src="http://classygallie.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bamf.jpg?w=334&#038;h=448" alt="" width="334" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I ride dirty</p></div>
<p>That jacket was an authentic mini motorcycle jacket. It had more tassels and zippers and snaps than a Hells Angel. It was bomb diggity. And, paired with a stank face and a belly full of prison fare, it made me feel as bad as the baddest mammer jammer around.</p>
<p>At least until I got to school. I&#8217;ve never been that into speaking up, and that was especially true in kindergarten. I was really shy and hadn&#8217;t started speech therapy yet, so when Ms. Pinkham asked if I wanted to hang my coat on the rack, I shook my head and thought<em> hell nah I don&#8217;t want your damn coat rack </em>(politely, though).</p>
<p>The beginning of September is a pretty warm time of year, especially when you&#8217;re swagged out in a thick leather jacket. So, as you can imagine, I was sweating mah ballz off. But, not wanting to inconvenience Ms. Pinkham, and especially not wanting to talk, I kept it on all day. As I walked around like a robot in my motorcycle coat, I was sweaty, constricted, uncomfortable, and moodier than a biz.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why the second day of school showed me how things would be: trying to look cool, while actually looking like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Penguin">jackass penguin</a>/pit stain farmer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.freddesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/revolver.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently read an article in the <em>New York Times</em> that discussed the shrinking of album artwork. The piece argued that elaborate cover art seems to be out of fashion, and its in place artists are opting for simple designs that can be fully seen on computers and iPods. The close-up of Lady Gaga&#8217;s face for <em>Born This Way</em>, and the Red Hot Chili Pepper&#8217;s fly on a pill for <em>I&#8217;m With You</em> were cited as examples.</p>
<p>While cover-art certainly isn&#8217;t indicative of what the music is like, it does seem to be a lost art form. Has there been an album cover released in the past few years that has already become iconic? Pearl Jam&#8217;s cover for 2009&#8242;s <em>Backspacer</em> was pretty nifty with 9 different images from cartoonist Tom Tomorrow, but it didn&#8217;t seem to represent the music that was on the actual disc. The childhood portrait of Lil Wayne on the cover <em>Tha Carter III</em> is visually intriguing and tells an interesting story, but I always felt the typography seemed a bit off.  The Foo Fighters&#8217; <em>Wasting Light</em> seems too much like a throwback with its collage of portraits highlighted in different colors.</p>
<p>Perhaps the music industry and musicians themselves think that no one really cares, and they will only view it on their iPod (or perhaps not at all.) I&#8217;m not certain about anyone else, but I find it hard to listen to songs either on my computer (or iPod) if there is accompanying artwork to go with it. I recently started downloading the cover-art of albums whose covers I don&#8217;t have and then trying to import them into iTunes. It&#8217;s a long, laborious project and so far I&#8217;m only up to letter K.  I feel much better listening to The Beatles on my computer if I can actually see the cover for <em>Revolver</em>.</p>
<p>Still, graphic designers might set some of the blame on simpler cover-art. As a former student in Graphic Design, clean and simple design with lots of white space tend to gain more favor by professors and those in the actual field. While the cover of Sgt. Pepper is certainly iconic, I&#8217;m not entirely sure it would be looked on as the artistic achievement it is, if it were released now. I can also most hear somebody suggest that, &#8220;there is too much going on, your eye doesn&#8217;t know where to focus!&#8221;</p>
<p>As a kid, I was totally transfixed by the cover-art of certain albums. It could sometimes defined the way I listened to particular albums. I bought The Clash&#8217;s &#8220;London Calling&#8221; after reading how great it was in a British Magazine in high school. The image of Paul Simonon smashing his bass and the Elvis Presley reference in the typography was one of the coolest things I ever seen. When it came time to listen to the disc I was slightly disappointed that the music didn&#8217;t match Simonon&#8217;s anger and frustration. What was this reggae shit? It&#8217;s supposed to be punk!  (For the record, <em>London Calling</em> is one of my favorite albums of all time).</p>
<p>If album cover-art keeps &#8220;shrinking&#8221; as the Times referred to it, a valuable part of music will be lost. It&#8217;s just another casualty of the presence of digital music and furthers confirms my theory that music is becoming more and more of something to listen to in the background rather than actively listening to it for its own merits.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are certain places on this great planet of ours that does something wonderful for for my soul, my heart and my mind. You may also know when you&#8217;ve arrived to such a place too because every cell in your body is aware and you have such a full feeling in your chest and your face is parted by a huge, wide smile.</p>
<p>I had read about Salt Point State Park and Gerstle Cove Campground in a camping book last year and after doing a little of my own research I thought, &#8220;We Neeeeeed to go there!&#8221; So after camping with friends at Dillon Beach we took the opportunity to continue North, up the Coastal Highway, passing by Jenner and Fort Ross till we arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>When we arrived the kids cheered, I hopped out of the truck and took a big whiff of the salt air laced with the fresh scent of wild flowers and Douglas Furs. Rich took a long look out West, past the bluff we now called home for the next couple of days, and said that he couldn&#8217;t believe that a place like this even existed. Over the years Rich and I have travelled and explored most of the US, including Alaska, Hawaii, have been to a few other countries, but the beauty of California&#8217;s diverse and breathtaking landscapes always keeps us close to home and our short list of places that never cease to amaze has now grown by one.</p>
<p>So if you decide to check out Gerstle Cove Campground or her equally beautiful sister campground, Woodside Campground, tell Jacque, the very enthusiastic, and sweet, campground ranger,  hello for us and that we will be back soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://lorakrenzlerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0588.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-435" title="DSC_0588" src="http://lorakrenzlerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0588.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=685" alt="" width="1024" height="685" /></a>Space #19 has a great view of the ocean and is only a any easy .3 mile hike to the visitors center and Gerstle cove.</p>
<p><a href="http://lorakrenzlerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/gerstle_cove_pan11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-436" title="Gerstle_Cove_Pan1" src="http://lorakrenzlerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/gerstle_cove_pan11.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=375" alt="" width="1024" height="375" /></a>Gerstle Cove (click the photo above for an enhanced view) is an awesome tide pool area, state run underwater park for skin divers and scuba divers, and the visitors center has free adventure packs you can check out with a drivers license and contains games and learning materials focusing on the local flora and fauna and is appropriate for school age children. There&#8217;s also historical significants associated with Gerstle Cove that adults might find interesting too!</p>
<p>Some of the fun things to discover at the tide pools:</p>

Monday through Thursday is pretty quiet and only gets about half full so you can actually just show up and you will be fine &#8211; This is what Ranger Jacque has told me. Same goes for the Woodside Campground on the East side of Highway 1. We were extremely happy camper during our visit!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who could forget the<a title="number one rule" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WELvpeYo5m0" target="_blank"> number one rule</a> of Fight Club? The quotation is burned into my brain as well as the haunting images and psychotic hijinks Chuck Palahniuk includes in his movie. But after reading some of his other books, the realization struck me that the movie “Fight Club” is tame.</p>
<p>I haven’t read the book <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Fight Club" href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fight-club-chuck-palahniuk/1100290786?ean=9780393327342&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=fight%2bclub#Overview" target="_blank">Fight Club</a></span>, because I already knew what happens in the end, but I have read Palahniuk’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Invisible Monsters" href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/invisible-monsters-chuck-palahniuk/1100880062?ean=9780393319293&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=invisible%2bmonsters#Overview" target="_blank">Invisible Monsters</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Choke" href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/choke-chuck-palahniuk/1100320213?ean=9780385720922&amp;itm=2&amp;usri=choke#Overview" target="_blank">Choke</a></span> and part of <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Snuff" href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/snuff-chuck-palahniuk/1008801964?ean=9780307275844&amp;itm=2&amp;usri=snuff#Overview" target="_blank">Snuff</a></span>. The content of Palahniuk’s books is nowhere near conventional and is sometimes even uncomfortable, but I found myself undeniably fascinated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 357px"><img class="  " title="Chuck Palahniuk" src="https://files.pbworks.com/download/QpxmcXCMsW/bashapedia/22862734/ChuckI.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="165" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After seeing &quot;Fight Club&quot; the movie, I was curious to sample Palahniuk&#039;s other works. I was not disappointed; in fact, I found his books to be even more intriguing. Photo by Bashapedia</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Invisible Monsters</span>, though far-fetched, was my favorite of the three. The plot reveals an analysis of human behavior beneath its odd, grotesque surface plot. Through storytelling and characterization, Palahniuk shows the paradox of human emotion: our need to receive attention and our disdain for it. The storyline is also twisted in a fashion similar to that of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fight Club</span> in which the reader must actively piece the details of the story together throughout the book.</p>
<p>The other two books were interesting, but they didn’t have as much mystery as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Invisible Monsters</span> did. They still included Palahniuk’s graceful prose, which added to the wonder of his off-color books. Sentences like, “I am the combined effort of everyone I’ve ever known,” from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Invisible Monsters</span> surprised me with their<a title="unique truth" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2546.Chuck_Palahniuk" target="_blank"> unique truth</a>.</p>
<p>I was enthralled by Palahniuk’s ability to look deeper into human situations and extract widespread human idiosyncrasies that make no sense. It takes some work to get past the disturbing story surfaces, but once a little thought and interpretation are put into the stories, readers will find that his books unveil captivating insights about human behavior.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very rewarding to have a garden.  Although, one of my grandfather&#8217;s was a vegetable farmer and the other a strawberry farmer so I have some pressure to keep everything alive.</p>
<p>P.S. While I realize it would make more sense to have the tall orange tree on the other side of the bench instead of blocking the window, we have Jasmine growing in the other pot which we hope will grow on the fence.  However, we&#8217;re thinking of moving it and adding one more citrus tree for symmetry.  TBD</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello world,</p>
<p>While London Fashion Week is edging closer and closer, and I still haven&#8217;t planned everything out, New York Fashion Week has been trundelling on and making quite some headway.</p>
<p>Here are my favourite shows from the last two days. As always, please let me know what you think of them as I love all your thoughts and opinions! <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Day 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Donna Karan</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1578" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/donna-karan-style-com-01.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1578 " title="Donna Karan style.com 01" src="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/donna-karan-style-com-01.png?w=300&#038;h=449" alt="" width="300" height="449" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Images courtesy of style.com</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong></strong>Donna Karan has gone back into the Safari. Only this season, she is less gamer than African tribal; heavily influenced by the colours of the African savannah. Karan herself has spoken of her frequent trips to Haiti in the past year and this is also very evident in her strong print dresses.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">While I&#8217;m not a fan of ever piece in her collection, her wooden and plastic necklaces are delightful and the body-con dresses in rustic orange or safari tan are delightful.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jenny Packham</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1593" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/jenny-packham-style-com-09.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1593 " title="Jenny Packham style.com 09" src="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/jenny-packham-style-com-09.png?w=300&#038;h=451" alt="" width="300" height="451" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Images courtesy of style.com</p></div>
<p>Jenny Packham is known for elegant dresses, that are light, floaty and usually come with some form of embellishments. In this sense, her spring/summer 2012 collection is no different than her previous ones. In fact Packham doesn&#8217;t ever change from her formula. It has made her successful and continues to sell; so why change?</p>
<p>That is exactly the problem with this collection. While I love all the dresses and they are undoubtedly beautifully made, I feel there&#8217;s nothing really new here. That is not to say this collection isn&#8217;t successful. I still want to buy every item in her collection, but until the formula changes just a little, I will always be hoping for more.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Day 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Rodarte</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1555" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rodarte-style-com-01.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1555" title="Rodarte style.com 01" src="http://franzistylenomad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rodarte-style-com-01.png?w=300&#038;h=450" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Images courtesy of style.com</p></div>
<p>For their collection the Muleavey sisters turned to Disney&#8217;s <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> and asked themselves who else used those startling greens and purples. Their answer was Vincent Van Gogh and what a combination that makes. The fact that this collection isn&#8217;t too terribly kitsch and &#8216;Hallmark-esque&#8217; is a testament to their talent. It feels fresh and vibrant, and for those people who find the Van Gogh graphic prints too daring, there are plenty of sturdy knits in candy colours and structured trousers.</p>

<p>Diesel Black Gold in a sense does exactly what it says on th tin. It is a brand for young urbans with a decidedly more relaxed attitude to fashion and this is epitomised perfectly in their new spring/summer collection. Added to that we have a collection focusing around metallics and the shimmer of fabrics and it truly is a collection of black gold.</p>
<p>While the metallic pants might be a bit much, the shimmering knits and metallic leather jacket in a rich jade is perfect for those winter months.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My experience of the Basque Country was a great journey. I had a great host who didn&#8217;t mind taking me to many beautiful sites.</p>
<p>My host is caring and knows how to make you happy and satisfied about the Basque Country.</p>
<p>I had another friend who took me around Bilbao and showed me many historical monuments, point of reference to iconic buildings and great bars.</p>
<p>I find Bilbao an interesting city but it&#8217;s the people that I met have made my experience awesome.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, it seems I keep showing you guys the ugliest corners of my apartment (I swear there are cute parts, too), but our place is cheap, in an awesome neighborhood, and we have great <a href="http://wordythirties.com/2011/07/27/why-i-was-late-to-work-today-and-also-probably-tomorrow/" target="_blank">neighbors</a>.  So, I try to take what I have and <a href="http://wordythirties.com/2011/08/14/make-it-work/" target="_blank">make it work</a>!  Like this hideous cat tree.</p>
<div id="attachment_1215" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc033381.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1215" title="DSC03338" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc033381.jpg?w=529&#038;h=705" alt="" width="529" height="705" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our pantry/music studio/Ella&#039;s playroom. Also, where half-finished projects and a basketball go to die.</p></div>
<p>Well, Ella loves the darn thing.  When she needs to go a little crazy and let off steam, she&#8217;ll dart up it, hang off it, kick it&#8217;s post, and generally abuse it.  When she needs a little Ella time, she likes to hang out on the top platform, far above any silly human.  It&#8217;s also perfectly positioned between two windows, which allows for maximum bird watching.  So, even though it&#8217;s about my last choice in design, I couldn&#8217;t bear to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Enter Tim Gunn and his Make It Work mantra.  Last weekend, I <em>finally</em> completed a project I&#8217;ve had in mind for months.  I recovered it with a mix of carpet and soft fleece, trying to blend it in with the rest of the apartment as much as possible.  Not an easy task when you&#8217;re talking about a seven foot carpeted monstrosity.  </p>
<p>I picked up some batting and a soft, pretty gray fleece from Hancock Fabric several weeks ago (on sale!), but had some trouble finding a good solution for the carpet.  I tried a few carpet stores, hoping to score remnants for free, but they either didn&#8217;t do that or didn&#8217;t have anything that would work for this.  I needed the carpet to be cut pile, not looped, so she wouldn&#8217;t pull it apart with her claws.  It also couldn&#8217;t be too thick to roll around the post and staple, and I wanted a neutral color.  I found one that would work at a local carpet store, but it would be over $50!  Um, no.  This is a cat tree, people.  Be serious.</p>
<p>Finally, two weeks ago, I decided to try Walmart.  Score!  I found a perfect, light beige, cut pile, 3&#215;5 rug for only $12!  (Are you as excited as I was?  I thought so!)</p>
<div id="attachment_1216" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03342.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1216" title="DSC03342" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03342.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grand total: $23.96</p></div>
<p>Okay, down to business.  First, I took the post apart and rolled the carpet around one piece to measure where to cut.  I marked the back with a Sharpie, and started cutting!  No need for a fancy carpet cutter; scissors took care of the job just fine. Four pieces, for the four sections of post.</p>
<div id="attachment_1218" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03362.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1218" title="DSC03362" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03362.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Don&#039;t be jealous of my Casio.</p></div>
<p>Sidenote: that was the only picture out of three that I don&#8217;t look deformed thanks to my double joint-ness.  See?</p>
<div id="attachment_1219" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03363.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1219" title="DSC03363" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03363.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Don&#039;t worry about me. I&#039;ll just pop that sucker back into place.</p></div>
<p>Anyhoo, where was I?  Oh, yes, regaling you with tales of cat-tree madness.  So, after cutting four equal pieces, time to staple!</p>
<div id="attachment_1221" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03365.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1221" title="DSC03365" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03365.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Contain yourselves, people. It&#039;s getting crazy up in here.</p></div>
<p>Oops.</p>
<div id="attachment_1222" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03367.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1222" title="DSC03367" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03367.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Something&#039;s not right</p></div>
<p>No worries!</p>
<div id="attachment_1223" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03369.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1223" title="DSC03369" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03369.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#039;m like MacGyver, except less exciting</p></div>
<p>I also wanted to carpet the base, but after cutting out four pieces for the posts, I was left with a weirdly shaped remnant.  I ended up covering it in two sections, which worked out well because I needed to be sure there would be an adequate opening to attach the first post section.  I cut the corners off and folded it over in three parts, then stapled underneath and around the corners.  I cut a small semi-circle for the screw to fit through where the post attaches, and repeated with the other side.</p>
<div id="attachment_1235" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03428.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1235 " title="DSC03428" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03428.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="sh" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Then just screw it in (that&#039;s what she said)</p></div>
<p>Now, onto the platforms!  Are you still with me?  Good.</p>
<p>This phase was much, MUCH faster.  I cut the batting so that it would cover the top platform (where she usually sleeps) with 8 layers, and the other two platforms with 6 layers. Then I just stapled away, using the same method I used for the base.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03375.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1238" title="DSC03375" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03375.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a>I poked a hole through the batting where the posts attached and cut out a small circle.</p>
<div id="attachment_1239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03380.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1239" title="DSC03380" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03380.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Staple, cut, repeat</p></div>
<p>Honestly, I totally guessed how much cloth I would need when I bought it, but it worked out.  I covered the top platform all around (since you can see underneath it), but only covered the tops and sides of the other platforms.  This time, I wrapped it like a present, rather than cutting out the corners.</p>
<div id="attachment_1240" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03386.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1240" title="DSC03386" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03386.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Almost done!</p></div>
<p>I cut holes into the fabric for the posts to attach, and it was time to put it back together!  <em>Whatdoyouthink?</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1241" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03400.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1241" title="DSC03400" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03400.jpg?w=529&#038;h=705" alt="" width="529" height="705" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">*Pats herself on the back*</p></div>
<p>Up close.  Check out that softness!</p>
<div id="attachment_1242" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03391.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1242" title="DSC03391" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03391.jpg?w=529&#038;h=705" alt="" width="529" height="705" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#039;s pretty much awesome</p></div>
<p>So, what did Ella do when she first saw it?</p>
<p>Well, she yawned in amazement.</p>
<div id="attachment_1244" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03406.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1244" title="DSC03406" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03406.jpg?w=529&#038;h=705" alt="" width="529" height="705" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh my GOD this is AMAAAAAAZZZZZZING</p></div>
<p>The she played for a while.</p>
<div id="attachment_1245" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03409.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1245" title="DSC03409" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03409.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Imma gonna kick the sh*t outta this post</p></div>
<p>And, finally, she slept.  (awwwwwwww)</p>
<div id="attachment_1246" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03425.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1246" title="DSC03425" src="http://wordythirties.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc03425.jpg?w=529&#038;h=396" alt="" width="529" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Seriously, can you even stand it?</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">All in all, I think it turned out pretty well, considering I had absolutely no idea what I was doing!</p>
<p><em><strong>What projects have you done lately?  Anybody take something ugly and make it work?  Anybody surprised I wrote an entire post about a cat tree?  Yeah, me neither.  </strong></em></p>
