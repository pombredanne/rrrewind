				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe I said that, but I mean it.</p>
<p>I had today&#8217;s post all kind of figured out in my head.  You guys were going to learn all about the joys of Banoffee, one of my favorite desserts ever.</p>
<p>Then I came home (half day today) and watched <em>Life in a Day </em>on Netflix.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Have you ever seen a movie that really got to you?  Because this one totally got to me.  It&#8217;s basically a bunch of clips sent in from all over the world, of people filming their life on July 24, 2010.  Ok, I thought&#8230;big deal, right?  A look into people&#8217;s lives.  But you guys &#8211; it&#8217;s so nuts.</p>
<p>The movie itself was good.  It asked three questions: What do you love, what do you fear, and what is in your pocket.  Then everyone on the planet answers them.  We&#8217;re all <strong>so different</strong>.  I mean, we&#8217;re all exactly the same &#8211; we love our family, we&#8217;re scared of spiders, blah blah blah.  But SO MUCH STUFF is happening every day.  No matter where you are on the planet, someone else is doing exactly what you&#8217;re doing, and someone else is doing something you&#8217;ll never do in your life.  Someone is kissing their baby, and someone else is slitting a goat&#8217;s throat.  Someone is falling asleep, and someone is waking up to gunfire.  Someone is grumbling about having to go to work, and someone can&#8217;t get a job because who would look after his motherless children?</p>
<p>This was all very eye-opening and all, but at the end of the day, we&#8217;re human and what we think is how am <strong><em>I</em></strong><em> </em>involved in all of this?</p>
<p>For me it was an easy, but terrifying answer.</p>
<p>What I love and what I fear are exactly the same thing.</p>
<div id="attachment_370" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 648px"><a href="http://mylifeisthebestlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/family.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-370" title="Family" src="http://mylifeisthebestlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/family.jpg" alt="family" width="638" height="960" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is everything, you guys. Everything.</p></div>
<p>There is nothing on the planet that I love more than my family.  Nothing.  No $5000 boots, no winning lottery tickets, no fulfilling career, it&#8217;s THEM.  And there is <strong>nothing</strong> that scares me more than losing them.  I think part of what kept me carefree and single for so long was the avoidance of these exact bonds.  It&#8217;s easy to be fearless when you&#8217;re solo.  But now I know fear &#8211; TRUE fear.  Because I couldn&#8217;t wake up if it wasn&#8217;t for them.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t give a shit about what&#8217;s in my pocket, because I know what&#8217;s in my heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>mmmmm Autumn&#8230; crisp air, crunchy orange leaves, big knit sweaters, and most importantly, comfort foods!</p>
<p>Here in CA it&#8217;s finally beginning to feel like Fall, and how can that not be inspiring in one way or another?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve baked and the recent season change needed welcoming, so an apple tart made it&#8217;s way onto my list of things to do!</p>
<p>This tart is so easy to make, so do it. Seriously, everyone will love you and be impressed. Also, if you have a man you&#8217;re trying to get married to, give him this, he will immediately inquire on where the nearest jeweler is (I say this from experience).</p>
<p>I found the recipe at <a title="Saveur" href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Saveur-100-2011-French-Apple-Tart" target="_blank">Saveur</a>, but as usual, I can&#8217;t follow any recipe without adding or taking away something (one time I tried to get fancy with microwavable top Ramen&#8230; let&#8217;s just say some recipes should be left alone).</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1703.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-261" title="tart1" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1703.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let me start out by stating the obvious so I don&#8217;t confuse all you hard core foodie types out there.</p>
<p>1. I know, I know, I know, this is a pie dish. But give a girl a break, I live in Bakersfield for crying out loud, I looked for a tart pan everywhere. Apparently the art of tart making has been lost here. Time for a revival? Sure thing.</p>
<p>11. It&#8217;s not the prettiest thing in the world, I know. I used an apricot jam to glaze this guy up and usually this would require straining, but I wanted those chunks of sugary apricots cuddling up with my apples. Get over it Bobby Flay, it&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>Anyways, let&#8217;s continue so you can make this thing already!</p>
<p>First things first, ingredients!</p>
<p><em>1 1/4 cups flour, plus more for dusting</em><br />
<em>12 tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed and chilled</em><br />
<em>1/4 tsp. kosher salt </em><br />
<em>7 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored, and halved (I used less because of the whole pie dish thing&#8230;)</em><br />
<em>1/4 cup sugar</em><br />
<em>1/2 cup apricot jam</em><br />
<em>Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for serving</em></p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-265" title="_MG_1661" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1661.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need a chef&#8217;s knife and a melon baller (if you don&#8217;t have an apple corer handy).</p>
<p>Step 1. Combine flour, 8 tbsp. butter, and salt in a food processor and pulse until pea-size crumbles form, about 10 pulses <em>(If you live in Bakersfield like me where both a tart pan and a food processor are hard to come by, you can always work the butter into the flour with a fork)</em>. Drizzle in 3 tbsp. ice-cold water and pulse until dough is moistened, about 3—4 pulses <em>(Another tip! Seriously cool, I just found this <a title="recipe" href="http://www.littlebcooks.blogspot.com/2012/08/perfect-pie-dough.html" target="_blank">recipe</a> where you add vodka to the dough and it makes it super amazing because it adds extra moisture without creating gluten. Haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I will be doing it next time!)</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1665.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-266" title="_MG_1665" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1665.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=639" alt="" width="1024" height="639" /></a></p>
<p>Transfer dough to a work surface and form into a flat disk; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Unwrap dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, flatten dough into a 13″ circle and then transfer to a 11″ tart pan (<em>ha.) </em>with a removable bottom; trim edges; chill for 1 hour.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1668.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-267" title="_MG_1668" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1668.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=639" alt="" width="1024" height="639" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 11. Heat oven to 375º. Wash, peel, and core all apples. Snack on apple peels or Al Gore will come after you for being wasteful.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1672.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-268" title="_MG_1672" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1672.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Then working with one apple half at a time, thinly slice into sections, keeping slices together. Be very careful to keep slices consistent. Press sliced apple half gently to fan it out; repeat with remaining apple halves. Using your knife to slide under and pick up <em>(see photo)</em>, place 1 fanned apple half on outer edge of the tart dough, pointing inward; repeat with 7 more apple halves <em>(again, if you have a tart pan you will fit all those apples, I could not)</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-269" title="_MG_1681" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1681.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1682.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-270" title="_MG_1682" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1682.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Separate remaining apple slices. Starting where the apple halves touch and working your way in, layer apples to create a tight rose pattern. Fill in any gaps with remaining apple.</p>
<p>For a complete picture tutorial on creating the apple rosette, go <a title="here" href="http://www.saveur.com/gallery/The-Art-of-the-Tart/1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1685.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-271" title="_MG_1685" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1685.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Sprinkle with sugar and then dot with remaining butter. Bake until golden brown, 60—70 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1687.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-272" title="_MG_1687" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1687.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heat apricot jam in a small saucepan until warmed and loose; pour through a fine strainer into a small bowl and set aside. Transfer tart to a wire rack; using a pastry brush, brush top of tart with jam. <em>(I also spooned some of the apricot jam onto the bottom of the crust before placing the apples inside, just to add some extra flavor). </em>Let cool completely before slicing and serving with whipped cream.</p>
<p>And violá! A French apple tart/pie! This is super good and I&#8217;m sure way better served à la mode! It&#8217;s a nice take on the classic apple pie and a great way to bring all the boys to your yard&#8230; I mean, to welcome the Fall season! Enjoy!</p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1699.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-273" title="_MG_1699" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1699.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1701.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-274" title="_MG_1701" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1701.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1706.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-275" title="_MG_1706" src="http://laurenelisephotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mg_1706.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=639" alt="" width="1024" height="639" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I had extra apple slices left so I tossed them in cinnamon and made apple chips! So yummy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beautifulsimplemeaningful.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imga00333.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-65" title="" src="http://beautifulsimplemeaningful.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imga00333.jpg?w=107&#038;h=150" alt="" width="107" height="150" /></a>Swimming is something we like to do as a family, and individually.</p>
<p>Beardy has happy memories of paddling in the chill waters of the Channel on Winchelsea beach, building castles and flying kites.</p>
<p>I have a constant nostalgia for the crystal-clear, turquoise waters of the Mediterranean. Spending four years in Greece as a child spoiled me for anywhere else, and I vividly recall the picturesque bays fringed with pine trees, the smooth pebbles hot underfoot in the midday sun, the chirp of the cicadas, the warm sea breeze and delicious cool water.</p>
<p>Swimming is more prosaic these days. For the past two years, I have swum twice a week for fitness. Beardy used to do the same, but hasn&#8217;t been able to fit it in for years. As for Serious and Smiley, we took them to the pool before the age of 12 weeks and we have tried to make regular visits since. Come to think of it, Serious was born in a pool, and so would Smiley have been, if she hadn&#8217;t been in such a hurry! So one of our priorities when we moved to Belgium was to find a good local pool, and in many ways we have struck lucky. The pool is vast, not too crowded at weekends, and has a water slide to amuse Serious and Smiley.</p>
<p>Of course, it also affords an opportunity to observe and comment on cultural differences. For a start, swimming caps are compulsory. The children look very cute in their rather swish caps &#8211; we caved in and bought them because the rented latex ones pull their hair so. Another difference with Blighty: &#8216;swimming shorts and bermudas&#8217; are forbidden. Apparently this is for reasons of a) hygiene (because men might have been wearing their bermudas all day before coming to the pool) and b) safety (because swimming shorts can conceal weapons (!) such as knives). I don&#8217;t know what class of customer they get at our local pool&#8230; Anyway, bring on the Speedos, gents!</p>
<p>I suppose I should be grateful. If we had moved to Austria, there would be nude swimming sessions.</p>
<p>I wonder what swimming culture is like in other countries?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poetjohndavisjr.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/flowers-arthur.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-232" title="flowers-arthur" src="http://poetjohndavisjr.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/flowers-arthur.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="286" /></a>Before my cohort and my other fellow MFA candidates left from our last residency in June, we were given a final warning by the inimitable Arthur Flowers (see photo, left): &#8220;So, what are you going to do? You&#8217;re about to go back out into real life, where there&#8217;s bills to pay and mouths to feed. &#8230; People are going to tell you that you&#8217;re chasing a fantasy. People are going to say to you, &#8216;Just do like the rest of us.&#8217; Don&#8217;t you do it. Follow that dream you&#8217;ve begun here. Never let anybody tell you that you&#8217;re not a writer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is, I&#8217;ve had to replay this little lecture to myself on more than one occasion. As my teaching gigs and the mundane suburban duties of yardwork and such pile up, I sometimes tend to forget that I am also a poet. After all, the labels of father, husband, and professor seem to hold so many more responsibilities. What&#8217;s more, the immediacy of providing for my family tends to obscure the more long-term goal of poetic success.</p>
<p>It is indeed a dog-eat-dog world out there, and poets, like everyone else, are scrambling in a fight to the top: networking, assuming new titles, taking on the challenges of work-home balance, and ensuring that all the parts of life are functioning smoothly. In the midst of all this, it becomes pretty easy to allow writing and those related goals to take a back seat. I even found myself telling my wife recently, &#8220;Writing&#8217;s not as important as (insert bigger priority here).&#8221; And while that may be true, I must remind myself not to throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Just because life demands greater attention to things of necessity doesn&#8217;t mean that I should completely cast aside any and all writing endeavors. And neither should you, reader.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do what we have to do so we can do what we want to do,&#8221; the old saying goes. But occasionally there&#8217;s a blurry line between those two ideas. Where the needs meet the wants, in that blurry gray space, is poetry. Yes, I could live without writing. But it would definitely be a sad and colorless existence, devoid of any creative sparks or intrinsic cognitive satisfaction. It is unimaginable and unimaginative. I have no plans to cut out my essence, just as I have no plans to desert my family or my career. Join me, readers, in this persistent striving toward the bigger, toward the better, toward tomorrow. Let us be pilgrims on this journey together. May our walk be filled with abundance, and may our pens never run dry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">San Diego is about to construct a major desalination plant that will cost $900M to build, and will produce 50-million gallons of potable water a day from sea water. That’s enough to supply 7% of the population of San Diego, costing each resident $678.</p>
<p>That’s great, except for two things.</p>
<p>One, there are environmental concerns. These are serious enough, but probably can be addressed.</p>
<p>Two, in a better world, a readily achievable world, 50-million gallons of water could supply at least 35% of the San Diego population, not a paltry 7%. In an arid city heavily dependent on water from elsewhere, a city whose water supply will probably soon be compromised by global warming, this is a vital consideration.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>In a better world, 50-million gallons of water<br />
could supply at least 35% of the San Diego population,<br />
not a paltry 7%.</em></span></h4>
<p>How might it be possible to get so much more from this plant? Let me digress briefly to discuss the poor way we manage human waste, an important and germane topic generally avoided in polite society.</p>
<p>The first Victorian flush toilet was a huge improvement over outdoors privies, 130 years ago, and an even greater improvement over dumping the chamber pot out the second story window onto the sidewalk. It was a significant step forward not only for our dainty sensibilities, but, more importantly, for public health. But the water-flush toilet is becoming increasingly untenable in a world where the population is moving rapidly toward ten billion people, because it relies on vast quantities of water, which may end up being our most valuable and expensive resource. Our antique system wastes drinkable water on an epic scale.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Our antique system wastes drinkable water<br />
on an epic scale.</em></span></h4>
<p>Consider this: Urine is virtually sterile, and poses no danger of bacterial infection under any circumstance. Most fertilizer value of human and other animal waste comes from this sterile substance, not from feces. Thousands of years ago the Chinese collected urine from public facilities and distilled it into dozens of useful products, which included a number of significant medical products as well as fertilizer. For our purposes, however, fertilizer will probably be the only use.</p>
<p>Feces, by contrast, contain a multitude of bacterial dangers that make their direct management more problematic. Not untenable, just more difficult. It’s worth noting that the Chinese commonly used human feces as fertilizer for food production for thousands of years, and still do in some places. This was safely done because Chinese food does not include uncooked vegetables, which might otherwise increase the danger of bacterial contamination from incomplete composting. Cooking removes this possibility.</p>
<p>Enter Lowell Wood and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Wood&#8217;s design for an inexpensive system to manage human waste is focussed on the third world, but his system could also have major effects on San Diego. And Wood is not the only one working on such a device.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Imagine clean and odorless waste systems in the home,<br />
with no plumbing or sewage systems.<br />
The costly public treatment facilities<br />
could eventually be removed entirely.</em></span></h4>
<p>Imagine Wood&#8217;s clean and odorless waste systems in the home, using fecal fuel to evaporate urine and generate electricity. The excess electricity would be fed into the grid, the dried urea used as fertilizer. No plumbing, sewage, or septic systems would be necessary—at all—reducing both domestic and public infrastructure construction costs considerably. Most importantly, the millions of gallons of potable water presently used only for flushing away waste would be saved. The vast, complex, and costly public sewerage and treatment facilities would become unnecessary except for storm water, and even that should be drained into swales, where it would be absorbed to replenish groundwater.</p>
<p>Other water in the home is used for laundry, cooking, and bathing. The used water is called “gray” water, with contaminants from detergents and food waste. This water is easily purified in the home using current technology, including such things as ponds with living plants, and can be directly recycled within the home as water so pure it could conceivably even be used for medical injections. Home water consumption would be radically reduced. Systems like these have been used with excellent results in a number of commercial and domestic buildings. Wood&#8217;s device and others will also do these things, and utilize food waste as well.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Water for laundry, cooking, and bathing<br />
is easily purified using current technology.</em></span></h4>
<p>Now consider again the costs and benefits of San Diego’s very expensive new desalination plant. Wood&#8217;s toilet/water treatment device uses presently available technology, and could be put in place in many new and old homes in San Diego by the time their desalination plant is operational. Just looking at the changes outlined above, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to imagine that a typical home could require some 80% less water than we currently use, probably even less. If that were the case, the plant could serve not a mere 7% of the population in San Diego, but at least 35%, maybe even half. In addition, a significant chunk of municipal infrastructure could be simplified.</p>
<p>I am not a believer that technology will be our savior in all things. We are far too stupid politically and socially for that to happen. But we will soon be compelled by population growth and global climate change to make major changes in the way we do things. We are wasting far too much of what we have by failing to make integrated use of the technologies that are already here, let alone technologies that will be ready to use virtually within months. Projects like the San Diego desalination plant are a golden opportunity to do better thinking than we have exercised in the past.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s title is from a post game quote by Ryan Pickett, and it&#8217;s hard to disagree with him. Former NFL head coach Herm Edwards always sums up the state of a particular team by saying &#8220;you are what your record says you are.&#8221; Right now, the Packers&#8217; record says they&#8217;re a below average NFL team with some serious questions that need answering.</p>
<p>There are no excuses that really carry water this week. Week One&#8217;s loss to San Francisco was excusable; the 49ers are a formidable team and they should be among the favorites to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl this year. I don&#8217;t need to tell you what happened in Seattle in Week Three. This week, though? The Packers just got flat-out beat.</p>
<p>Sure, there&#8217;s a lot of football to be played, but let&#8217;s not act like there aren&#8217;t some major issues here. The Packers can&#8217;t stop anybody, they can&#8217;t keep Aaron Rodgers on his feet, they can&#8217;t force turnovers, and they can&#8217;t run the ball when Cedric Benson is not in the game. That sounds like a bad football team to me.</p>
<p>And speaking of bad football, I&#8217;m tired of hearing about how Dom Capers deserves another head coaching job. By no means am I starting the &#8220;Fire Dom Capers&#8221; parade, but for a guy who is supposedly a defensive genius, he sure has presided over some remarkably awful defenses both this season and last. As a quick recap, the Packers have Pro Bowlers at linebacker (Clay Matthews, A.J. Hawk), defensive line (B.J. Raji), and at two defensive back positions (Tramon Williams at corner, Charles Woodson at safety), but you wouldn&#8217;t know it from their execution. How does a unit with that kind of talent play poorly so consistently? You&#8217;d think Capers would figure something out, but the adjustments just haven&#8217;t happened. But I digress. Let&#8217;s talk about something else.</p>
<p><strong>Three Packers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cedric Benson - </strong>7 carries, 20 yards, 2 rec. 20 yards &#8211; Turns out Cedric Benson is a little bit more important to the Packers than I thought. He brings credibility to the run game that absolutely disappears when he&#8217;s not in the game. This would have been the perfect opportunity to bludgeon an opponent into submission with a soul-crushing drive or two&#8230;except Benson rode off into the locker room on an injury cart with a foot injury, and apparently took the entire running game with him. It may be time to reassess my expectations for Alex Green, because he looked terribly unimpressive yesterday, aside from his 41 yard run that should have been the game changing play.</p>
<p><strong>B.J. Raji &#8211; </strong>Raji didn&#8217;t show up on the stat sheet yesterday, at least not in a conventional way, but from an outsider&#8217;s perspective it seemed like the defensive effort turned for the worse as soon as Raji went to the locker room. The big defensive tackle is truly the anchor of the defense, and without him there, the unit looks even more inept. Hopefully Ted Thompson is already working the phones for another XXXL-sized human being to hold the point of attack if Raji has to miss extended time.</p>
<p><strong>Randall Cobb - </strong>4 catches, 82 yards, 1 TD &#8211; Cobb is officially the most dangerous man on the Packer offense.  He never seems to make little plays. Every time he gets the ball, he seems half a step away from ending up in the end zone. I thought they&#8217;d try to get him a few more looks as a runner when Benson went out, but I guess the coaching staff felt comfortable with Alex Green.</p>
<p><span id="more-645"></span></p>
<p><strong>Three Numbers</strong></p>
<p><strong>27</strong> &#8211; Points given up in the second half by the Packer defense. I don&#8217;t have to tell you why this is a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - Sacks given up by the Packer offensive line, all in the second half. If I had one question for Mike McCarthy in the post game press conference, it would be about why the Packers have such a hard time protecting Aaron Rodgers. He&#8217;s only the most important player on the team, and for whatever reason, it doesn&#8217;t seem like keeping him protected is that big of a deal.</p>
<p>That said, Rodgers seems to have a penchant for taking sacks. Although he was admittedly much more of a risk taker than Rodgers, Brett Favre was always masterful at avoiding sacks. In his last seven years as the Packers&#8217; starting quarterback, he never took more than 26 sacks in a season, despite such luminaries as Will Whitticker and Matt O&#8217;Dwyer manning the guard spots.</p>
<p><strong>0</strong> - Percentage of kicks made by Mason Crosby on Sunday. This may be piling on, but I don&#8217;t care. TV play-by-play man Thom Brenneman pointed out that Crosby typically hits about 50% of his kicks from beyond 50 yards, but neither of his attempts yesterday were even close, especially not the 51-yarder that would have tied the game. Had Crosby even been <em>average</em> yesterday, he&#8217;d have at least sent the game to overtime. And for the record, late game miscues by the defense and special teams have now cost Aaron Rodgers two game winning drives this season. Not that I&#8217;m keeping track.</p>
<p><strong>Three Good</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong Start &#8211; </strong>This one rings a bit hollow, but the Packers looked like a competent team in the early going. So that&#8217;s nice.</p>
<p><strong>Cedric Rollin&#8217; &#8211; </strong>Benson looks more and more important with each passing week, and that&#8217;s all the more reason to keep our collective fingers crossed that his injury is nothing serious. Let&#8217;s hope he can recover soon, because a run threat seems to change the entire complexion of the offense.</p>
<p><strong>Chuckstrong &#8211; </strong>It was nice to see Packer players joining in on the support for Chuck Pagano, the Indianapolis head coach diagnosed with Leukemia this week. I don&#8217;t know how much the &#8220;win one for Chuck&#8221; mentality was a factor for the Colts, but regardless it was a nice gesture from Packer players to don the &#8220;Chuckstrong&#8221; t-shirts in pregame warmups.</p>
<p><strong>Three Bad</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bad Finish &#8211; </strong>Each of the three Packer losses featured poor efforts from the Packer defense down the stretch. The 49ers pounded the Pack into submission in the 4th quarter with a punishing run game. In Seattle, the Packers ceded field position quite willingly before that fateful Fail Mary found its way int0 <del>M.D. Jennings&#8217;</del> Golden Tate&#8217;s arms. And it seems the Packers didn&#8217;t read my Week Five preview, because otherwise they&#8217;d have known that Reggie Wayne likes to catch footballs. Good teams finish strong. Right now the Packers are not a good team. They&#8217;re not even average.</p>
<p><strong>Busy Doctors &#8211; </strong>Already facing life without Greg Jennings, the Packers might have to do without Cedric Benson, Jermichael Finley, and B.J. Raji for a while. So that&#8217;s just terrific.</p>
<p><strong>Pink Scourge &#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s that time of the year again, when the NFL devotes a full quarter of its schedule to promoting breast cancer awareness. I&#8217;m all for supporting cancer victims, but I hate our national obsession with raising &#8220;awareness&#8221; for things. Is there anyone who really isn&#8217;t aware of breast cancer, or any other kind of cancer? What&#8217;s more, are we trivializing an issue by dressing up in pink costumes in the name of &#8220;supporting&#8221; something? I have a lot more to say on this, but I don&#8217;t think this is the place. Ask me about it some other time.</p>
<p><strong>Up Next &#8211; </strong>A suddenly even more scary visit to undefeated Houston at Reliant Stadium this weekend. Who&#8217;d have thought 2-4 was a realistic possibility? Yeesh.</p>
