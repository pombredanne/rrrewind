				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, <a title="Happy Birthday,Â Cupcake!" href="http://smallworldsupperclub.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/happy-birthday-cupcake/">you may recall</a> that I am honing my sugar cookie baking and decorating. Well, this week, I did a trial run on some chemistry-inspired cookies for a very special occasion. Our friends Caroline and Jonathan are getting married in just a few weeks. Jonathan&#8217;s family is from Pittsburgh, an area of the country that celebrates weddings with&#8230;wait for it&#8230;a cookie table! This time-honored tradition involves massive amounts of homemade cookies. I&#8217;m all in!</p>
<p>Being that this adorable couple shares a love for chemistry, I thought I&#8217;d give these <a href="http://www.sciencecookiecutters.com">Science Lab cookie cutters</a> a go. Good thing I did a practice run, because it looks like I&#8217;ve got a bit of a learning curve on these! I did, however, manage to solve much of my previous icing problem. Hooray! More on that after the photo tour.</p>

<p>So, there is clearly some perfecting to do &#8211; mostly in the outlining process. I really need to pick up a smaller icing tip and to work on keeping a steady hand. The problem with these cutters are that they are VERY large (about 6inches), so that&#8217;s a lot of surface area to outline and flood at an even pressure, with a steady hand. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to keep practicing!</p>
<p>As for the royal icing recipe, I think I finally found the right ratios. Here&#8217;s what I went with, which is basically <a href="http://www.sweetsugarbelle.com/blog/2011/04/royal-icing-101-or-all-roads-lead-to-rome/">Sweet Sugarbelle&#8217;s</a> recipe divided by four (thank you to the wonderful Heather, a.k.a. my calculator):</p>
<p><strong>Royal Icing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb of confectioner&#8217;s sugar</li>
<li>3 tbsp meringue powder</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla</li>
<li>6 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Sift together dry ingredients in your mixer</li>
<li>Add vanilla and water together and then slowly add to dry ingredients while mixing</li>
<li>Mix at medium-high speed until fluffy (bald eagle) peaks form, about 7-10 minutes total</li>
<li>Adjust consistency for piping or flood icing</li>
</ol>
<p>This time around, I had fewer air bubbles, but they still bothered me. Overall, though, I was quite pleased with the consistency of the icing.</p>
<p>I also played around with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Leaves-Acorns-9-Piece-Aluminum/dp/B00004WHQJ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348353807&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wilton+acorn+cookie+cutter">these new cutters</a>, which I bought with the hopes of making them for my family&#8217;s Thanksgiving table. I was QUITE pleased with how these turned out.</p>
<p><a href="http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327" title="Leaves" src="http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331" title="Leaves and acorns" src="http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you&#8217;ll notice that these did not get outlined and filled. Instead, I used Sweet Sugarbelle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sweetsugarbelle.com/blog/2012/03/consistency-is-key-twenty-second-icing-and-more/">20 second icing</a> consistency, which is somewhere in between piping and flood. This allows you to skip the outline without having your icing slide off the cookie. I&#8217;m thinking that it might make more sense to try that method with the science lab cookies next time around.</p>
<p>Off to go brush my teeth after all those cookies&#8230; ; )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just come to the end of a sketchbook that I&#8217;ve kept for the last 18 months, so thought I&#8217;d post a few pages here. Ironically, when I was in the thick of being a <a href="http://www.paulaknight.co.uk/">children&#8217;s illustrator</a>, I didn&#8217;t keep sketchbooks &#8211; the last thing I needed in my spare time was to be drawing. I had to rest my overstretched tendons and tunnels (I had recurring RSI). In recent years I&#8217;ve started to carry one around with me again. I&#8217;ve also included some pages from other sketchbooks &#8211; I have them of varying sizes from a tiny one that fits in my purse to an A4 book at home in which I do comics workings-out.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t often attempt to do finished drawings in them &#8211; they&#8217;re more for practising looking, and planning (comics). I like to draw in cafes, on journeys, on beaches, and in waiting rooms etc. In these situations, people are in varying degrees of motion, which means fast drawing is required to get any sense of form. I like that challenge, and the results are very gestural lines &#8211; mere essence of movement or character.</p>
<p>My reasons for sketching are varied, and include: taking the opportunity to practise drawing when I&#8217;m not doing anything else; an attempt to be &#8216;in the moment&#8217; and record it for posterity; on occasion, to escape from the moment or thoughts, or from boredom; note-taking at talks; and I also sketch in the wee hours when I can&#8217;t sleep &#8211; this tends to be when comics idea emerge. They can seem very urgent and important in a dozy half-slumber but often appear pretty rubbish later in the day. Like dreams!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT">The first time I went to Paris, in late August of 1988, I was nineteen years old. I had never expected that I would travel so far. None of it felt real. I visited the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and the Louvre. Then I visited the place I most wanted to see: Jim Morrison&#8217;s grave in PÃ¨re LaChaise cemetery. His music and poetry had helped me through my turbulent high school years. His image had hung on my bedroom wall. I had worn a button with his photo on my black leather jacket. On the vacant building across from my high school, I had spray painted the same words that I had doodled all over my school notebooks: <em>Jim Morrison Lives</em>. I had self-medicated with whatever I could find (which, thankfully, wasn&#8217;t much in those days) and wrote stream of consciousness poetry while listening to <em>An American Prayer</em>. Scarcely two years had passed since then, and yet a lot had changed in my life. Much of my rage had dissipated, but scars remained.</p>
<p><a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198" title="JM8801" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>A handful of people were gathered around the grave. Someone had scrawled a poem and left a rose in an empty wine bottle on the battered slab that passed for his tombstone. A young man slouched on the next grave over. He clutched a dog-eared paperback and his face was contorted with angst. I stood for a few moments, my head bowed. Disappointed in myself for feeling numb, for forgetting to bring a flower, at least. I snapped a couple of photos and left, feeling like a thief.</p>
<p><a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8802.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199" title="JM8802" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8802.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>In January of 2000, my husband brought me along on his business trip to Paris. I had recently begun to write with the intent of being published. I wanted to visit Jim Morrison&#8217;s grave again, even though I&#8217;d long since realized that a lot of his poetry was nothing more than random, incoherent scrawlings from his notebooks that his estate had published in order to milk as much money as possible out of his legacy. It had been years since I&#8217;d listened to a Doors album. Even so, he was the first person who sparked in me the urge to write. Because of him, I had learned that it was possible to push the boundaries of creativity and revel in strangeness.</p>
<p>The battered old tombstone had been replaced, and there was an epitaph written in Greek âÎÎÎ¤Î Î¤ÎÎ ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ ÎÎÎ¥Î¤ÎÎ¥â, which means âtrue to his selfâ. Despite the bitterly cold day, there were about a dozen people gathered around. I placed my wilted rose on the frozen earth, touched the tombstone, and whispered, âThank you.â When I looked up, I saw wistful smiles.</p>
<p>(this photo was taken with a disposable camera)<a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-200" title="JM00" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="836" /></a></p>
<p>In March of 2010, I visited PÃ¨re LaChaise once more. This time it was in search of the Countess de Castiglione, who is the subject of a novel that I&#8217;ve been writing off and on for years. After I had found her, I meandered the immense labyrinth until I spotted a small crowd gathered around a metal fence. They all seemed so young, but then I realized that I was their age when I made my first pilgrimage. The tombstone was unchanged, but it could now only be viewed from afar.</p>
<p><a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-202" title="JM1003" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="383" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-201" title="JM1001" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>I reflected on my previous visits and how I had changed since then. I had recently rediscovered the music that had been the soundtrack to my teenage rebellion. I was finally mature enough to understand. The adulation I felt as a teenager, and the cynicism of my thirties had morphed into simple empathy. He was a human being who had dared to confront his demons while the world looked on, and had ended up being consumed by them.</p>
<p><a href="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-203" title="JM1002" src="http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1002.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="571" /></a></p>
<p>I did not linger.</p>

No disrespect to the artistry involved (or to the very talented professional mosaicists), but mosaic art &#8211; especially naÃ¯ve mosaic art &#8211; more often than not lacks elegance.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedreading.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" title="speedreading" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedreading.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>So intoned the billboards on the NYC subways for years. The School of Speedwriting wanted to make sure people knew that Gregg shorthand was not the only way to go, and while I never had the opportunity to learn either, it seems to make perfect sense to me. My ex was a whiz at shorthand, and she could take dictation like a court reporter &#8211; but all those squiggles! Worse than Arabic, if you ask me.</p>
<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedwriting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1900" title="Speedwriting" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedwriting.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="1379" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s based on being able to recognize words without the vowels. Since 2003,Â  this has been going around the internet in various forms, the latest one with the header &#8220;Only Smart People Can Read This&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/power.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1902" title="power" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/power.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>It is doubtful that any real research has been done on this phenomenon at Cambridge, but the underlying principle makes sense &#8211; experienced readers don&#8217;t decode, but rather they read words as entire units. This is useful to understand as I teach Japanese students the mysteries of English spelling. They get so wrapped up in &#8220;i before e&#8221; that they forget to learn new words in the same way that they learn their own <em>kanji -</em> as units.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye, each of these Japanese characters looks very much the same, äºº, å¤§, å¤©, ç«, ç±³, ç¬, æ°´, æ°·, å¥, yet a Japanese person recognizes each without even thinking of it &#8211; a single jot can make the difference between <em>big</em> and <em>dog,</em> or between <em>person</em> and <em>enter</em>.</p>
<p>We do the same thing ourselves &#8211; and when presented with a block of text with mixed up letters (or missing vowels), our minds do what they do best &#8211; they look for things that look close to something recognizable, and usually come up with an accurate match almost instantly, unless of course you booted up a Unix system running &#8220;Fortune&#8221; and got &#8220;f u cn rd ths, itn tyg h myxbl cd&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; the Semitic peoples (Jews and Arabs) have been doing this for thousands of years &#8211; like anything, you just get used to it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, young people use this to their advantage when sending txt msgs (text messages): R u there? K. ttyl. (Are you there? OK. Talk to you later.) If things keep going the way they are, we may all be doing speedwriting whether we like it or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went out this afternoon to try to get a trumpet I have fixed up. The valves don&#8217;t compress, basically (I found this in the trash a while back). He told me it probably just needed a cleaning, but that it would cost 65 bucks plus tax, and that&#8217;s not really in my budget right now.</p>
<p>Maybe I can clean it myself. This guy online says all it really needs is valve oil and some grease, so maybe I&#8217;ll try that.</p>
<p>Regardless, on the way back I saw a few things, some of which bothered me.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1021.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1021.jpg" alt="" title="Old Dell laptop" width="580" height="773" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378" /></a></p>
<p>First off was this old laptop. Not old enough to not have XP, but old enough to have a floppy drive. I just tried it out and it still turns on, but it seems like the screen is busted. I may just give it to the computer place on St Laurent. As least they might know how to dispose or recycle the parts properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1031.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1031.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_1031" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1377" /></a></p>
<p>This rack for your bike seems to be in fine condition. I&#8217;ll probably put it on the craigslist free section.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1030.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1030.jpg" alt="" title="Acreage / Property Map, St Therese de Blainville Parish" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1385" /></a></p>
<p>This map is from the Ste-Therese area, which lies northwest of Laval. I&#8217;m not sure when it&#8217;s from or how exactly it works (or is meant to represent), but I do know some urban planning people so maybe they can help me out in that regard.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1022.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1022-e1348255881852.jpg" alt="" title="Marketing stuff - Sauzo tequila" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1379" /></a></p>
<p>I found a bunch of marketing stuff on the curb on Cartier by the railroad tracks. This box was full mostly of these plastic things. I don&#8217;t really know what they are for &#8211; maybe to put shot glasses in, but that seems kind of pointless.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1027.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1027.jpg" alt="" title="Plastic posters" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1384" /></a></p>
<p>Another box was mostly full of these plastic posters you see at bars. They look unused. I think these might actually be useful for sealing/insulation, as the stuff is pretty strong and thick. </p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1026.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1026.jpg" alt="" title="Drink trays - Sauzo, Hornitos" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1383" /></a></p>
<p>Also in a box were these drink trays, also unused. The cork ones are pretty nice. I took these with me, as I&#8217;m sure these can come in handy for someone.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1024.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1024.jpg" alt="" title="Metal shot glasses" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1381" /></a></p>
<p>A good load of metal shot glasses, with the company name on them. I took these as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1025.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1025.jpg" alt="" title="Cinnamon sugar - Sauzo" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1382" /></a></p>
<p>Some cinnamon sugar, to be used as part of some drink. They were open but perfectly fine (and mostly full) so I took them.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1023.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1023.jpg" alt="" title="Molson M Posters" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, some Molson M posters, probably never used. </p>
<p>Seeing this kind of stuff on the curb bothers me because of how it&#8217;s a total waste of resources. We extracted the base resources (in this case, the various stuff needed to make plastic, and trees for paper), created the product (and used a bunch of oil), and shipped it over a great distance, only to be used once or never used and then put out on the street to be stored underground in landfills. Not to mention the land that goes to waste when you need to build a bigger landfill. All of this in the name of possibly making a few extra bucks.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be as bad if the companies involved made a concerted effort to ensure the final product wasn&#8217;t a complete waste. For example, if they just gave the trays / glasses to local bars or to second-hand stores, or maybe avoided creating mostly-useless and distinctly disposable plastic products in the first place, or made a concerted effort to recycle, repurpose, or create compostable products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all too symbolic of the times we live in, but there are things we can do. I recently read about a website called <a href="http://www.change.org/en-CA">Change.org</a> which has had some success getting different restaurants to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/changeorg-petitions-restaurants_n_1871256.html">adopt more environmentally friendly practices</a>. Perhaps some petitions are in order?</p>
<p>What other ways can we encourage less wasteful practices? Beyond me finding it before it gets trashed, of course <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Erika Batista</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thenewtechnologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-face-recognition.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-97" title="a-face-recognition" src="http://thenewtechnologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-face-recognition.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="434" /></a>So today the news broke out that FacebookÂ <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/29340-facebook-turns-off-tag/">turned off</a>Â their ill-famed facial recognition feature, otherwise known as âtag suggestâ, in Europe. Almost simultaneously, other news revealed the social networking giant is rolling outÂ <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-search-history/">new features</a>Â that allow users to view and delete their search history. My husband and I had a brief discussion on the topic of privacy and data protection, and unlike most times, we found ourselves surprised to have very opposite points of view. So I decided to write about it, mostly to illustrate my opinion and hopefully start an interesting discussion.</p>
<p>As a lawyer and a lover of liberty, my first reaction is to reject the idea of a facial recognition system altogether. Just imagine all the implications for the right to privacy of having a giant database out there with enough information to locate you, even in a crowd, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a promising tool for the prevention of terrorism and tracking down of criminals, results actually show otherwise. Indeed, it was reported that the Tampa Police Department stopped its use after the technology generated hundreds of false positives, but not a single arrest. That just means the technology isnât goodÂ <em>enoughÂ </em>yet, though.</p>
<p>In my opinion, facial recognition can be downright creepy. The other day while uploading an album from a recent museum visit, I was asked to identify the âpeopleâ in a photo, which were actually deteriorated statues from the 12<sup>th</sup>Â century. Another time, Facebook suggested a tag of my brother on a picture of me.Â <em>Ew.</em></p>
<p>A bit more seriously, the relevant question here is what are the actual risks that users face? What exactly are we protecting here?</p>
<p>Before addressing this question, a little history:</p>
<p>In 1980, the OECD promoted guidelines for the protection of personal data. Accordingly, there are several principles that should be respected if handling personal data. They basically say that you should know when your data is being collected, what for, and that it should not be used for anything other than the stated purpose. Other principles cover security, disclosure, access and accountability.</p>
<p>That sounds like poetry to my lawyer ears, but they were merely suggestions. So, how many states did actually implement these guidelines? Yes, you guessed right.Â <em>Zero</em>.</p>
<p>Recently weâve had more honest efforts, and as of 1998 every European country has its own data protection legislation in accordance with a European directive that was issued on the topic. As for the United States, itâs been more of a trial and error process. Despite the existence of some regulation there is an overall tendency to promote self-regulation among the incumbent entities, leaving behind a lot of loopholes. But how well does this self-regulation work?</p>
<p>So far, in the case of social media, not bad. Besides the protection that the law grants, you can count on the services themselves for fine-tuning. Googleâs social networking service G+ had its momentum when it announced that it would feature new privacy and sharing controls, which Facebook lacked and swiftly adopted in order to keep users from fleeing. Despite allegations of social networkÂ <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherbarger/2011/12/20/the-top-ten-social-media-lessons-of-2011-part-i/">fatigue</a>, the market has proven itself capable of adapting to (some) user needs.</p>
<p>So, going back to our question, what exactly are we protecting?</p>
<p>Without going completely âconspiracy theoristâ on you, one of the arguments most often used against facial recognition is the fear that it could lead to a âmass surveillance societyâ. Yoann argued at this point, validly, that it is not the government we are dealing with. Itâs just Facebook. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The thought of a mass surveillance state might seem like a far-fetched idea to you, but itâs actuallyÂ <em><a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Listening_to_you_at_last:_EU_plans_to_tap_cell_phones">not</a>.Â </em>Indeed, we hear everywhere about scandals regarding different types of privacy-invasive acts such as tapped conversations,Â <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/americans-may-have-to-wait-for-europe-for-better-data-protection-a-849372.html">misrepresentations</a>Â about the use of tracking cookies (even when users expressly disabled them, Google still kept using them and gladly paid the fine that followed), the government officials using twitter toÂ <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/31/destroy-america-on-twitter-get-deported/">track down supposed threats</a>, the police being allowed access to social media accountsÂ <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/no-warrant-required-judge-rules-police-can-subpoena-tweets-even-deleted-ones/">without a warrant</a>, and access being granted to these accounts without evenÂ <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/zuckers-facebook-has-secretly-been-giving-user-info-to-cops/">notifying the user</a>, just to mention a few.</p>
<p>Again, my husband (acceptably) argues: if you donât want something to be known, just donât share it. But asking myself each and every time before hitting that âpostâ button âCould this content seem in any way incriminating?â is borderline psychopathic behavior.</p>
<p>The ramifications donât limit themselves to police activity, of course. Information obtained through social media can and has been used during the processing of insurance claims, the assessment of a candidate for a job (there are companies created exclusively for this purpose), not to mention the intrusive commercial applications of facial recognition systems, among many others.</p>
<p>With recent Facebook updates it is easier to control how your data is shared with the public. However, there is still certain information that isÂ <em>always</em>Â public (name, profile and cover pictures, network, gender, username and ID). The alternative Facebook offers you? To delete your account.</p>
<p>Then another question arises: Who are FacebookâsÂ <em>realÂ </em>customers? Sure, they want to create a good product so that we can keep using it, the same way a farmer keeps feeding his cows so that they will stay alive and produce milk. This has been discussed before, many, many, times. Facebook wants you to keep providing information so that they can keep monetizing it and getting better at it. For the moment, most of their profit comes from advertisers, but who is to say it will be that way forever? Users certainly donât have a say in whom Facebook can or canât do business with.</p>
<p>Yet the use of social media remains safe âenoughâ that most of us donât even consider these issues. After all, Irelandâs Data Protection Commissioner concluded their report on Facebook with a positive note.Â However, that still means that your information could be revealed (according to Facebook&#8217;s ownÂ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/">guidelines</a>) to public authorities in accordance with the law, which in certain cases does not grant much protection.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be a brighter side to the story. There are some software that include this feature such as Googleâs Picasa and Appleâs iPhoto, for example, which allow users to organize their photo library by tagging recognized people on photos. This represents a practical advantage for the consumer, and in the future there will probably be many exciting and non-intrusive developments to this technology. Facebook themselves expressed that they would revisit facial recognition when they figure out how to keep the legislators happy (after all, they did invest millions acquiring a face recognition tech company this year).</p>
<p>So, ultimately, by providing Facebook with a vast amount of information we are trusting that they will not use it for any purpose other than those annoying and increasingly accurate ads. Until a breach of that trust occurs, this matter and the minor incidents will continue to be overlooked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_729" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pedestrian-man1.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-729" title="pedestrian man" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pedestrian-man1.jpeg?w=295&h=295" alt="" width="295" height="295" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Go. Go. Go.</p></div>
<p>Tick, tick, tick.</p>
<p>The bright little green man started buzzing, permitting pedestrians to cross the street legally.</p>
<p>Like a flock of faceless chickens,Â a procession of suits, glassy eyes, school kids, brief cases, cake faces and iPhones came shooting at me, beside me and away from me, in a flurry of manic haste.</p>
<p>Tick â¦ tick â¦ tick.</p>
<p>The little red man shoved the little green man to the side as he beeped at less frequent intervals than his Christmassy counterpart; permitting only for people to finish crossing, but not for newcomers to start.Â  I wouldnât count on it though, little red man.Â  These people have places to be.Â  People to see.Â  Things to be.</p>
<p>As I sat there with Sylvia Plathâs Bell Jar in my right hand, leaning on a thick, grey pole observing this tempestuous flux of strangers passing by, I felt like I had been dropped into the middle of a set of a zombie movie.Â  Itâs a big intersection and it was 6pm on a Friday, so you can only imagine how many bodies passed me by.Â  And within that dense mass of strangers, life was nowhere to be seen.Â  Vacant, expressionless stares made up the barrage of bodies hustling and bustling, zigzagging in every direction down the streets of Elizabeth and Collins.</p>
<p>Zombies!</p>
<p>Trying to make eye contact with just one person, you know, to shoot them a smile and make their day, was nearly impossible.Â  Approximately, out of the 400-500 pairs of eyes dancing by me, I only managed to engage 6 of them.Â  And they were mere side glimpses that would quickly hone back in on their one set path upon noticing that someone was paying their self attention.</p>
<div id="attachment_730" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zombie.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-730" title="zombie" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zombie.jpeg?w=300&h=180" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Must. Check. Email. Gahh-bajahhh</p></div>
<p>All I saw was people yapping away at mobile phones.Â  Or, rigid gazes fixated on the path directly ahead of them.Â  Or, faces trying hard to avoid anyone and everyone at all costs, beading drops of sweat across their foreheads because of the peripheral awareness detecting the presence of judgemental strangers.</p>
<p>Not one person did I see â and Iâm not at all exaggerating â rolling their heads around the milieu, soaking in the beautiful art sprayed on the surrounding Melbourne walls, or the long, arching trees whose green feathers were fluttering in the caressing breeze, or the birds singing timeless hymns up in those trees, or the ones meandering the footpath in pursuit of spare breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Not a single person.</p>
<p>People always talk about how youâve got to pay attention to the little things.Â  To the moment-to-moment happenings that will strike you in awe if you just open your eyes.Â  But often, people talk about this like itâs something you need to factor into your busy schedule; like going to the gym, or having sex with a partner youâve been married to for five years.Â  Like itâs necessary to allocate ten minutes of your day for opening the door to your senses and allowing the light of life to gush into your personal abode.</p>
<p>What.Â  The.Â  Shit?</p>
<p>Itâs not like that.Â  Itâs not like that at all.</p>
<p>Life is happening.Â  Always.Â  And most of us trudge through our hapless existence without paying it any attention.Â  We live our days within the abstracted realities that are defined by either the cyber-sphere or purely our imagination, and we forget about life as it is out there and all around. Â It is the future that societies masses occupy and identify with, and often, the future, our future, only.</p>
<p>Itâs scary.</p>
<p>It is nice to see bloggers and general awareness screaming out from the rooftops that the little things matter.Â  Itâs real nice.Â  But hereâs the thing.Â  The little things are all things.Â  All our individual paths require tiny steps.Â  And it is the minutia in life that constantly demands our immediate attention, not mere sporadic intervals where we assign small parts of the day for appreciating the birds or the trees or the leaves. Â Or being present with our loved ones.</p>
<div id="attachment_731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pyramids.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-731" title="pyramids" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pyramids.jpeg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not built in a day, folks</p></div>
<p>Rome wasnât built in a day, after all.</p>
<p>As clichÃ© as this may sound, which it does, I know: Life is about the journey, not the destination.Â  Itâs not about the journey only sometimes.Â  Every single step is a destination within itself.Â  And itâs best to live in that way always.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it, the only destination weâre all eventually arriving at is death.Â  Where the grim reapers bony hand taps our shoulder and sends us to eternal rest.</p>
<p>I, for one, want to ensure that, when my time does come and I feel Mr Reaper&#8217;s cold breath tickling the hairs on my neck, heâs not tapping at an already corpse.</p>
<p>Humans-are-overly-concerned-with-the-future.Â  And not enough with now.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot. Â Here&#8217;s a link to a video about Joshua Bell &#8211; a famous violinist &#8211; who was part of an experiment conducted by the Washington Post to test who would &#8216;stop and hear the music,&#8217; as he busked for 45 minutes at a subway in Washington DC during peak hour. Â He sold out an entire concert the night before and only a handful of people bothered to pay him any attention.</p>
<p>It is truly eye opening and kind of devastating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A story about Facebook went around twitter last night that provoked quite a reaction in privacy advocates like me: Facebook, it seems, is experimenting with getting people to &#8216;snitch&#8217; on any of their friends who don&#8217;t use their real names. Take a look at this:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/snitching1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-409" title="Snitching" src="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/snitching1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>Facebook has had a &#8216;real names&#8217; policy for a while: this is what their &#8216;Help Center&#8217; says on the subject:</p>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-21-at-10-36-27.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-411" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-21 at 10.36.27" src="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-21-at-10-36-27.png" alt="" width="499" height="308" /></a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=167904716602259#Why-doesn%E2%80%99t-Facebook-allow-fake-names?"><br />
</a></div>
<div></div>
<p>People in my field have known about this for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s been the cause of a few &#8216;high profile&#8217; events such as when Salman Rushdie had his account suspended because they didn&#8217;t believe that he was who he said he was &#8211; but few people had taken it very seriously for anyone other than the famous. Everyone knows &#8216;fake&#8217; names and &#8216;fake&#8217; accounts &#8211; my sister&#8217;s dog has a Facebook account &#8211; so few believed that Facebook was going to bother enforcing it, except for obvious trolls and so forth. Now, however, that appears to be changing.</p>
<p>Initially, I wondered if this was just a fake &#8211; the screenshot could easily have been faked &#8211; but there seems now to have been confirmation. It has been covered in the TMP Idea Lab (<a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/facebook-confirms-its-surveying-users-about-their-friends-fake-usernames.php?" target="_blank">here</a>), where they say that Facebook has confirmed that they are doing it, and the German online magazine Heise Online (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Facebook-macht-Jagd-auf-Pseudonyme-1633979.html" target="_blank">here</a>, in German) where they report that it is a &#8216;limited test&#8217;. Given that this kind of a test fits in with the official strategy, it seems likely that it is indeed true.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s wrong?</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of argument against the whole &#8216;real names&#8217; policy to start with &#8211; it was a trigger for the &#8216;nymwars&#8217;. Many people can only really function online with the ability to remain pseudonymous, from bloggers like Nightjack to whistleblowers, from victims of abuse to people living in oppressive regimes. When their pseudonymity is &#8216;broken&#8217;, the result can be catastrophic &#8211; when Nightjack&#8217;s cover was blown, his blog ceased to exist and a valuable and entertaining source of information was lost. Mexican bloggers have suffered much worse &#8211; a number have lost their lives in the most gruesome way when the drugs cartels have been able to find them. The link between the &#8216;online&#8217; and the &#8216;offline&#8217; personality is one that can often need to be protected. When the &#8216;real names&#8217; policy is enforced, protecting that link becomes much, much harder.</p>
<p>This, of course, is Facebook, which is just one service, rather than the net as a whole &#8211; but it&#8217;s a crucial service, with close to a billion users around the world, pretty close to ubiquitous. And, just as importantly, where Facebook leads, other services can and do follow. If the &#8216;real names&#8217; policy becomes accepted on Facebook, it may become the norm. For some people, that sounds like a good thing &#8211; catching paedophiles and terrorists, making sure children don&#8217;t get access to &#8216;inappropriate material&#8217; and so forth &#8211; but the reality is very different. The real &#8216;bad guys&#8217; will find a way around the system &#8211; as so often, it will almost certainly be the innocent that get caught up in the messes.</p>
<p><strong>Snitching</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, the whole idea of snitching is highly dodgy. There&#8217;s a good reason that &#8216;telling tales&#8217; is looked down on &#8211; and a good reason why it&#8217;s generally only been oppressive regimes (both real and fictional) that have encouraged people to report on their neighbours &#8211; from the worst of the Roman Emperors such as Tiberius and Caligula to the KGB, the Stasi and so forth. It&#8217;s creepy &#8211; and it helps build at atmosphere of distrust, breaking down the very things that make social networks good. The social relationships that are the heart of Facebook are meant to do &#8216;good&#8217; things &#8211; not be a route by which bad things are spread.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, look at the nature of the questionnaire. You&#8217;re being asked to report on a &#8216;friend&#8217;. If you say &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to answer&#8217; that will be recorded &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole nature of Facebook &#8211; and it&#8217;s not hard to see that there could be a list of &#8216;people who don&#8217;t want to answer about their friends&#8217;. Indeed, under the terms of the Snoopers Charter, it wouldn&#8217;t just be Facebook who could access this kind of information: the authorities could potentially set up a filter to gather data on people who don&#8217;t confirm the names of their friends. It could be viewed as suspicious if you don&#8217;t answer &#8211; or even suspicious if you are friends with people who don&#8217;t answer. Again, this is the nature of Facebook&#8217;s social data &#8211; and how it could be misused.</p>
<p>And, as anyone who reads what I write about the Snoopers Charter etc will understand, though this may just be set up to catch paedophiles and terrorists, it can equally be used for all kinds of things. Potential employers who want to see whether their applicants are &#8216;open and honest&#8217;. Insurance companies for the same &#8216;reason&#8217;. Facebook is now in a situation where it needs to generate income &#8211; the failure of its IPO has made this even more crucial than before &#8211; and will be looking for ways to squeeze out as much revenue from their data as possible.</p>
<p>That, ultimately, is what lies behind this kind of thing: Facebook wants to make money. If it knows exactly who you are, it thinks it can make more money from you &#8211; by selling things to you, or by selling your details to others, or by targeting you more accurately in some other way. That&#8217;s perfectly understandable &#8211; indeed, from a business sense pretty much inevitable &#8211; but it does have consequences, particularly when the other uses that their data can be put are understood.</p>
<p>Oppressive regimes understand some of those uses &#8211; which is one of the reasons that the erstwhile Tunisian government, prior to the revolution, hacked into the Facebook login page in order to be able to access possible revolutionaries&#8217; accounts. They knew how that information could be used&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the first thing to do is make it clear that you don&#8217;t like this kind of a system. The whole idea of snitching should not be something that&#8217;s encouraged &#8211; indeed, the whole &#8216;real names&#8217; system should be discouraged, but it seems hard to put that genie back into Facebook&#8217;s bottle. Ultimately, I suspect there&#8217;s only one answer: many people should simply leave Facebook. Find other ways to do the things you want to do, other ways that don&#8217;t require &#8216;real names&#8217; and don&#8217;t use such sneaky and creepy tactics as snitching. Communicate by email, by twitter. Share your photos on other photo sites. Play games directly, not over Facebook. There&#8217;s always another way.</p>
