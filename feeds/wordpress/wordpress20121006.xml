				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most exciting part of this front porch project?  When we actually PAID someone to do work.  It goes against everything Paul stands for… but sanding a floor is the one task he’ll allow someone else to do.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what it’s like?  To pay someone?  It’s unbelievably awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4881.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2863" title="Sanding IPE front porch.  Refinishing Brazilian hardwood deck.  Victorian wrap around porch.  Renovating an old house porch." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4881.jpg?w=550&#038;h=401" alt="" width="550" height="401" /></a></p>
<p>I left to go to the farmer’s market and the library and an estate sale.  Because when you pay someone else to do work, you can leave your house&#8230; and when you come home it’s magically finished!</p>
<p>This was Saturday.  And there was a two-step plan:<br />
Step 1:  Guys show up to sand.<br />
Step 2:  Paul stains.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4887.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2865" title="Sanding IPE front porch.  Refinishing Brazilian hardwood deck.  Victorian wrap around porch.  Renovating an old house porch." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4887.jpg?w=550&#038;h=592" alt="" width="550" height="592" /></a></p>
<p>Step One went fine.  But when I got home I said—Hey!! How’d it go?  And Paul showed me the can of stain.  And? It was NOT remotely the same color we’d ordered.</p>
<p>Why we did not think to OPEN the cans, or look at them, or check that they were the same is beyond me.  But like idiots, we assumed that we would get what we ordered.</p>
<p>At which point, Step Two fell apart.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_6424.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3083" title="Cabot stain.  Australian Timber Oil.  Jarrah Brown.  Honey Teak. Mahogany.  Amberwood.  " src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_6424.jpg?w=550&#038;h=521" alt="" width="550" height="521" /></a></p>
<p>I forgot to take a photo of the sample can for comparison… So you’ll have to take my word for it that it was not ORANGE.</p>
<p>Personally, I think Paul was kind of accusatory when he showed me the stain.  He said things like—THIS IS NOT THE COLOR WE ORDERED.  And I was like, believe me… I see that.</p>
<p>And then he said— So? <em>Can I go ahead?</em><br />
And I was like, excuse me?  What?  Why are you asking me this?  No.  Obviously.  Furthermore, you <em>know</em> this.</p>
<p>Incase you’re thinking I did something stupid?  Like order floor-stain online, based on nothing but a whim and the color blocks they show you?  That is NOT how I operate.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-02-at-8-15-10-am.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3084" title="Cabot stain.  Australian Timber Oil.  Jarrah Brown.  Honey Teak. Mahogany.  Amberwood.  " src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-02-at-8-15-10-am.png?w=550&#038;h=197" alt="" width="550" height="197" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.cabotstain.com/products/product/Australian-Timber-Oil.html">Cabot Australian Timber Oil Shades</a></p>
<p>My advice?  Do not order Cabot sample-cans online and assume they will be the <em>same</em> color as the actual full-size can.  Do not spend a month deliberating over stain.  And ordering stuff on the Internet.  And reading deck chat-boards.  And getting your husband to sand off a good-sized section of porch so that you can test them all.  And then assume that you have made some kind of progress/educated decision/choice you will be happy with.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4652.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2867" title="Cabot stain.  Australian Timber Oil.  Jarrah Brown.  Honey Teak. Mahogany.  Amberwood.  Sample cans." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4652.jpg?w=550&#038;h=450" alt="" width="550" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Because?  If you assume any of those things, you will end up on a Saturday afternoon like me—driving around frantically while your husband morphs into angry-stain-guy.</p>
<p>Paul is like a train. Once it leaves the station?  You DO NOT want to step out in front of it.  Stopping his momentum is likely to end in dismemberment and death.</p>
<p>And that’s where I come in.</p>
<p>My role in this entire house-project is to be the person who leaps out in front of the train.  High-kicking and wearing a marching-band outfit and playing the tuba and tying myself to the tracks.</p>
<p>I’m sure I don&#8217;t need to point out—that it is OBVIOUSLY not my fault that the actual stain was significantly different from the sample.  Right?  This is obvious to you.  To anyone, really.  Except to Paul.  To him I was the wrench in his plan.  And therefore the bane of his entire existence.  And?  When that happens?  I think: oh really?  <em>This</em> is the bane of your existence? You have not seen <em>anything</em> yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4905.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2953" title="IPE, Brazilian hardwood, decking, Victorian porch floor.  Choosing stain color." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4905.jpg?w=550&#038;h=460" alt="" width="550" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>The porch flooring is IPE or Brazilian hardwood… or something I do not really understand.  If you do, good for you, but please do not try to explain it to me because I no longer care.</p>
<p>What I DO care about is that it means your stain options are limited.  So limited that I do not like ANY of them.  It took us a month to find one I liked.  And we had to special order it.  And it ended up being a figment of our imagination.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4902.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3088" title="Sanding IPE front porch.  Refinishing Brazilian hardwood deck.  Victorian wrap around porch.  Renovating an old house porch." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4902.jpg?w=550&#038;h=412" alt="" width="550" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>Of course this was a Saturday afternoon at three o’clock. And of course Home Depot does not carry what we needed.</p>
<p>Like lunatics, we drove over to a small, local paint store.  Thankfully, they were open and they carried a different brand that works for IPE.  We tested all five shades of the <a href="http://www.sikkens.com/Pages/default.aspx">Sikkens</a> stain IN the store on a piece of sample deck we brought from home.  We picked the least hideous one and drove home.</p>
<p>Paul had calmed down…lulled into thinking his train was back on track—the offending blockade had been removed and his stain-path was clear.</p>
<p>Paul has the ability to forget.  Immediately.  How he implied I am the genesis of all his project-problems.  And he forgets that he pointed out how I am impossible to please and will deliberate over degrees and shades and tints.  For eternity.</p>
<p>Until the cows come home.  While the rapture occurs and people are yanked from their cars&#8230;  I will still be staring at my options and rearranging sample cards and thinking.  And I will say to the returning Christ-figure… oh, you know what?  I’m not quite done here.  So, I’m not going to be able to go.  But thanks for the invite.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4896.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3091" title="Sanding IPE front porch.  Refinishing Brazilian hardwood deck.  Victorian wrap around porch.  Renovating an old house porch." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4896.jpg?w=550&#038;h=463" alt="" width="550" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>When we got home we tested it on the actual porch.  Which apparently is totally different than the sample piece.  Even though the sample used to be attached to the porch?  Now that it is not, has undergone alchemical wizardry, becoming something entirely different.  I hated it.</p>
<p>Plus, now we were forced to test in a super-small area under where the bases for the porch-pillars will come down around the columns.  It’s hard to tell whether you will like your entire front porch the shade you are seeing on only one-square-inch of wood.  Also of note is this—the boards are hugely varied.  Which I actually like a lot.  As long as they’re not various shades of orange.</p>
<p>So we drove BACK to the stain store.  Got another stain.  Tested it in the store.  Drove home.  Tested it on the actual deck.  We both hated it.  Went BACK to the store and got a NEW shade… In retrospect, obviously we should have just bought ALL the stain they had the first time, but we were operating in panic mode, which doesn’t stimulate rational decision-making.</p>
<p>By the time we got home with the final stain, it was no surprise that I didn’t like it.  I didn’t like any of them.  And I couldn’t even tell if any of them were an option that I could actually live with.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4899.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3092" title="Cabot stain.  Sikkens shades. Australian Timber Oil.  Jarrah Brown.  Honey Teak. Mahogany.  Amberwood.  " src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4899.jpg?w=550&#038;h=454" alt="" width="550" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, Paul had progressed past irritation into the realm of boiling frustration.  It was Saturday, and Saturday’s program was to <em>finish</em> the porch floor.  With what—<em>he did not care.</em></p>
<p>I suggested we wait until Monday when I could go to another deck store.  And then Paul lost his mind.  He explained to me at top volume how the porch had JUST been sanded, and was therefore READY. And if we WAITED… ANYTHING could happen:  dirt/dust/bird poop/cat prints/random outdoor catastrophes. And if I had wanted to go to MORE deck stores the time to do it was BEFORE the deck was sanded.</p>
<p>And I was like… YES Paul.  That IS what I want—to spend more of my life driving around to deck stores.  How did you know??</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4985.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3095" title="Choosing wood stain.  Sample area. Victorian wrap around porch.  Renovating an old house porch." src="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4985.jpg?w=550&#038;h=412" alt="" width="550" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>There is something about Paul where he thinks that if he goes crazy first, he gets first dibs on it.  And there will be none left for me.  And I will be forced to take Option B—agreeing with him and slinking away quietly to appease his bad mood.</p>
<p>WHY after EIGHT years of marriage he STILL thinks this is BEYOND me.</p>
<p>I will <em>see</em> your bad mood.  And I will <em>raise</em> it.  And then I will steal all your cards and all your chips.  And I will get you kicked out of the casino.  And then I will go to the Chanel boutique and buy a new handbag.  So LOOK OUT.</p>
<p>Instead, I said—do whatever you want.  And walked away.</p>
<p>And I realized this:  I have come so far.  Even a year ago, I would have been ENRAGED at the suggestion of using a subpar color/product/stain/paint shade/sofa/toilet paper holder.  But now?  I don’t care.</p>
<p>This house has killed my aesthetic martyr.</p>
<p><a href="http://victoriaelizabethbarnes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_4972.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3096" title="Restoring a Victorian wrap around porch.

<p>Random information:  Cabot claims drastic shade difference is impossible.  However, the guys at the mom-and-pop paint store told us that Cabot has been purchased by Valspar and that their store has stopped carrying Cabot because right now the product is unreliable.</p>
<p>Oh? INTERESTING&#8230; Cabot-Valspar-ruiners-of-my-Saturday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hands up if you&#8217;d almost totally forgotten that they were remaking <em>The Lone Ranger</em>? Me too. I probably shouldn&#8217;t have because it just meant that I got a nasty surprise when I remembered its existence. I was casually strolling through the internet, doing my morning rounds, when I came across the newly released poster.</p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureboner.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lone-ranger-poster.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-431 aligncenter" title="lone-ranger-poster" src="http://popcultureboner.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lone-ranger-poster.jpg?w=560&#038;h=794" alt="" width="560" height="794" /></a></p>
<p>Admittedly, it&#8217;s a pretty sassy new poster. I really enjoy the design. HOWEVER, I have issues. Many issues. Allow me to go into minute detail about them.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, <em>The Lone Ranger </em>was originally a TV show that ran from 1949 to 1957 about a masked Texas ranger, his horse named Silver and his trusty Native American sidekick, Tonto. It spawned the classic line &#8220;Hi-ho, Silver! Away!&#8221; which was generally followed up by someone asking, &#8220;Who was that masked man?&#8221; as aforementioned masked man rides off into the sunset. These lines were frequently shouted at random intervals in my household while I was growing up by parents who were brought up on a steady diet of Westerns. In other words, it&#8217;s very kitsch and was very much a product of its time and, as much as I like/d it, like most things that rely on particular stereotypes of race or culture to create characters, it does not need a reboot.</p>
<p>When the first promotional images were released back in March, I spent a lot of time going &#8220;Oh my gosh, they can&#8217;t be serious.&#8221; Because I was positive they couldn&#8217;t be serious. Because Johnny Depp was playing Tonto. And he was dressed like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_432" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://popcultureboner.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tumblr_m0krz6zdeh1qzpwi0o1_500.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-432" title="tumblr_m0krz6zdEh1qzpwi0o1_500" src="http://popcultureboner.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tumblr_m0krz6zdeh1qzpwi0o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">They can&#8217;t be serious&#8230;</p></div>
<p>Does that not scream &#8220;terrible fucking idea&#8221;, to you? Because it should. This blog isn&#8217;t really a political blog. I&#8217;m not here to get on my soapbox and preach the ways of the world. Honestly, I think that would be a waste of my time and yours considering that my idea of a productive day is to watch and have thoughts on at least 4 randomly chosen films. But some things are just so blindingly obvious, I don&#8217;t even really feel like I should have to say them. This is one of them.</p>
<p>Resurrecting Tonto is problematic for a lot of reasons. For starters, let&#8217;s talk about the makeup. It&#8217;s inspired by <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/i/2012/04/20/Kirby-Sattler-Art_510.jpg">this</a> painting by Kirby Sattler, titled <em>I Am Crow</em>. Now, Sattler isn&#8217;t a Native American. His artist statement says that he &#8220;purposely does not denote a tribal affiliation to the majority of my subjects, rather, I attempt to give the paintings an authentic appearance, provoke interest, satisfy my audience&#8217;s sensibilities of the subject without the constraints of having to adhere to historical accuracy.&#8221; If that sounds like a load of wank to you, it&#8217;s because it is. Sattler&#8217;s &#8220;innate interest in the world&#8217;s indigenous cultures&#8221; amounts to nothing more than cultural appropriation to create an exotic &#8216;Other&#8217;. To put it in simpler terms: Sattler is grabbing the stuff he likes from different cultures and mooshing them up without thinking about how that might affect the people that he&#8217;s stealing imagery from, so that he can make an interesting painting about something wild and exotic. Which is just a bit shit, really.</p>
<p>Then, on top of that, Tonto&#8217;s character is a identified repeatedly throughout all incarnations of <em>The Lone Ranger</em>, as being a full-blooded member of the Comanche Nation. So, taking inspiration from Sattler&#8217;s painting of someone who is supposed to be a vague reference to the Crow Nation (but not one constrained by historical accuracy, thank God), is just a further blending of cultural innaccuracies, so that we eventually end up with a visual that screams &#8220;Indian&#8221; at the audience, in the most traditional &#8220;Cowboys and Indians&#8221; sense, without them having to examine anything beyond the surface. And that&#8217;s bollocks.</p>
<p>Then, THEN, we have Tonto played by Johnny Depp. JOHNNY DEPP! I love Johnny Depp. I don&#8217;t think I can emphasise that enough. I went and saw <em>Pirates of the Carribean </em>at least 10 times at our local cinema. I even watch and enjoy the more questionable (repetitive) Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations regularly. I just really fucking love Johnny Depp, OK? Which is why, when I looked at my computer this morning I just kind of had to go &#8220;aaaaarrrrgghh&#8221;. Because essentially, you&#8217;re casting a white dude to play a person of colour, which is what ALWAYS FUCKING HAPPENS and it&#8217;s SHIT. If you&#8217;re going to write people of colour, for a start, don&#8217;t make them hollow, two-dimensional caricatures, and then, when you&#8217;ve written something substantial, don&#8217;t cast a rich white dude to play that character. Because it&#8217;s stupid and it makes you look stupid.</p>
<p>Essentially, I said all of that when that initial press photo came out in a much shorter and more swear-y way on my <a href="http://alexmovingbackwards.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> back in March. And now the trailer has happened. It looks like this:</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://popcultureboner.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/oh-johnny-honey-no-just-no/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/kpx9PaDw-Hc/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>The thing that I was holding hope for was the fact that they would at least maybe skip over the fact that Tonto spoke in broken pidgin English. It is apparent from that trailer that they&#8217;re sticking with the pidgin English. Which is&#8230;I don&#8217;t even know. I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t with this film.</p>
<p>So, I should probably end this blog with the following statement. I am a middle class, white girl from Sydney. I am far and away not the most politically correct person you will ever meet. Sometimes, I put my foot in it. I&#8217;m working on that. But I am a big fan of the idea that words are as powerful as the person being victimised by them tells you they are. To me, the fact that several prominent Native American people have come out and <a href="http://nativeappropriations.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/why-tonto-matters.html">said that this portrayal upsets them</a> is enough to make me more than a little uncomfortable. Popular culture is one of those things that seeps into your brain when you least expect it. If you&#8217;re not paying attention and thinking critically then you can let it drastically alter your perceptions without even realising it.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Disney, this is a terrible idea and you should really consider firing whoever was responsible for greenlighting this shit. I leave you with a really great article from 1998, by Sherman Alexie called <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/28/entertainment/ca-64216"><em>I Hated Tonto (Still Do)</em>.</a> This blog will return to regular programming next week.</p>

<p>Particularly vexing is the well-worn trope that Columbus “discovered” the continent.  </p>
<p>Christopher Columbus offers a convenient target for our wrath but I can think of many other individuals who have caused grief among tribal people.<span id="more-1978"></span> </p>
<p>For example, I’ve written about the scientist Samuel Morton who classified people according to skull size, placing American Indians at the lowest rung of intelligence based on brain size.</p>
<p>Such stereotypes about Native intelligence pervaded scientific thought for decades and continues today.</p>
<p>But the most pervasive harm occurs at a more macro level. </p>
<p>Rarely does one individual—even Columbus or Morton—create misery for an entire population.</p>
<p>What is necessary for the harms to be etched in memory and practice are all the folks who continue to mount the stereotypes.</p>
<p>We are all keepers of the flame and it’s up to us to rip apart the myths when they appear.</p>
<p>This Columbus Day I pledge to remind others that a thriving and intelligent indigenous population called North America home for thousands of years prior to the arrival of the conquerors. </p>
<p>And we are still here.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney was the most tweeted-about event in U.S. political history -- but is the kind of real-time commentary and instant analysis that Twitter provides a good thing or a bad thing for the political process or society as a whole?<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=569969&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Twitter, the presidential debate in Colorado on Wednesday night generated a maelstrom of more than 10 million messages in less than two hours, making it <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/10/dispatch-from-denver-debate.html">the most tweeted-about event in U.S. political history</a>, and one of the most tweeted-about events ever &#8212; close to the record set during the Super Bowl. Obviously Twitter is probably happy about that, and you could argue that those kinds of numbers show that large numbers of people were at least paying attention to the debate, for better or worse. But is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/us/politics/on-twitter-and-apps-audience-at-home-scores-the-debate.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">the kind of instantaneous commentary and snap judgement</a> that the social network specializes in a good fit with the political process, or does it just turn it into a sideshow?</p>
<p>In the past, any truly <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/190536/digital-media-offer-greater-conversation-about-debates-but-not-quite-a-revolution-yet/">public analysis of the performance</a> of the candidates had to wait until the event was over, when the usual political operatives and pundits like former Clinton advisor James Carville would be called on by CNN or Fox News to pick a winner, <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/190523/jim-lehrer-target-of-media-criticism-while-moderating-his-12th-presidential-debate/">criticize the moderator</a>, or handicap future debates. We&#8217;ve always had real-time, horse-race-style discussion of these events, but it has almost always taken place in small groups &#8212; in bars, or at local viewing events, etc. Never before has there been a way to <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/twitter-won-presidential-debate/57593/">eavesdrop on a giant conversation about such a thing</a> as it happens.</p>
<h2>Game-time commentary: Good or bad?</h2>
<p>That kind of game-time handicapping is great fun when it&#8217;s the Super Bowl, or the Academy Awards, or some other event with less at stake (although football fans might disagree about that description). But presidential debates &#8212; in theory, at least &#8212; are supposed to be important elements in the political process, which help undecided voters make up their minds and therefore can ultimately affect the course of political history. Does Twitter help or harm that process?</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>Hey Obama -- TRAIN WITH HILLARY.  This is ROCKY III and she&#039;s your Apollo Creed. <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23eyeofthetiger" title="#eyeofthetiger">#eyeofthetiger</a></p>&mdash; <br />Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/pattonoswalt/status/253701026492850176' data-datetime='2012-10-04T03:40:12+00:00'>October 04, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>Some would argue the political process is something of a circus anyway, and that carefully stage-managed events like the debates are already a sideshow with little political value &#8212; and therefore the additional theatrical element added by real-time commentary isn&#8217;t going to have much effect. Many parts of the process are probably also ephemeral, and likely to die out relatively quickly: will there be long-term political repercussions from Mitt Romney&#8217;s mention of shutting down PBS, fueled by all of the <a href="https://twitter.com/FiredBigBird">parody accounts devoted to Big Bird</a> and other characters that Twitter produced? Unlikely.</p>
<p>An optimist would say there is something very real to be gained by having people watch such debates for any reason &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just to follow along with the wisecracks on Twitter &#8212; because then at least there is a chance they might accidentally become more informed about political issues. <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/10/dispatch-from-denver-debate.html">According to Twitter&#8217;s graph of discussions</a> during the debate, some of the biggest peaks in tweets-per-minute came when the two candidates were discussing Medicare. Were most of those jokes or partisan attacks, or did they actually contribute to anyone&#8217;s understanding of the issues? That&#8217;s hard to say.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/twitter-debate-graph.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569971" title="Twitter debate graph" src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/twitter-debate-graph.jpg?w=604&#038;h=339" alt="" width="604" height="339" /></a></p>
<h2>The spin cycle is now measured in minutes</h2>
<p>The rise of Twitter as a political force has definitely <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/08/27/is-twitter-good-or-bad-for-political-journalism/">accelerated the metabolism of a campaign</a> by orders of magnitude, to the point where political analysts now talk about a news cycle that is measured in minutes or hours <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80129.html">instead of days or weeks</a>. Is that ultimately a good thing for politics or democracy? Some have argued that it is beneficial in part because trumped-up stories or blind alleys can be defused much more quickly, or burn themselves out rather than dominating the spin cycle. But a chorus of Twitter responses <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/186727/how-buzzfeed-has-become-the-new-tweeps-on-the-bus-this-election-season/">can also add fuel to something</a> that might not actually be meaningful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can’t watch a debate anymore without having my iPhone in my hand. I don’t feel like I’m having the full experience if I’m not reading the reaction in real time.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/us/politics/on-twitter-and-apps-audience-at-home-scores-the-debate.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">NBC News chief digital officer Vivian Schiller</a></p></blockquote>
<p>On the plus side, some pointed out that Twitter users watching television and following along with the real-time discussion <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/the-press-watches-the-debate-from-the-worst-seats">were clearly better off than the professional journalists</a> who were attending the debate &#8212; and theoretically were supposed to provide some kind of expert analysis later &#8212; since all of those reporters were stuck in a separate room with a balky audio and video feed. And as Alex Howard at O&#8217;Reilly noted, it <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/10/2012-presidential-debate-online-feedback-loop.html">might have changed the debate in some interesting ways</a> if some of the smart commentary and questions from Twitter users had actually made it into the debate itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/debate_obamavromney.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-570010" title="debate_obamavromney" src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/debate_obamavromney.png?w=604&#038;h=330" alt="" width="604" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>During the debate, even some Obama supporters (at least the ones in my stream) seemed to quickly come to the conclusion that the President was off his game, that he was tired or even uninterested, and that Romney gained the upper hand by being more forceful. BuzzFeed&#8217;s Ben Smith actually <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/how-mitt-romney-won-the-first-debate">declared Romney the winner only 42 minutes into the event</a>. Those impressions were then reinforced by the pundits on the post-game talk shows. Within an hour, the story of the debate seemed to be that Obama had &#8220;lost&#8221; and Romney had &#8220;won,&#8221; even though some said the Republican candidate contradicted himself at a number of points.</p>
<p>Is any of that going to have a lasting effect on voters&#8217; decisions, or the way that the campaigns react? Or <a href="http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/debate_advice_turn_off_twitter.php">is it just ephemera that will be gone</a> in a matter of days, as Twitter users become infatuated with some other celebrity event or perceived injustice? It&#8217;s clear that for both voters and politicians, and the political operatives who run their campaigns, the Twitter-sphere&#8217;s instantaneous reaction to events is a reality they have to take into account &#8212; and it could be changing the way we engage with political issues in some important ways. Whether that&#8217;s good or bad remains to be seen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first apartment in Tokyo was a shoebox designed for very tiny shoes. It was one room with a squat toilet and no bath. A streetcar ran past the apartment&#8217;s one window with a riotous clang-clang-clang from a heart-stopping 4:30 in the morning. Anyone who tells you that you can learn to ignore that kind of thing is lying.</p>
<p>Most of Tokyo&#8217;s streets don&#8217;t have names or numbers, so when I gave people directions, it was, &#8220;Take the narrow street between the ramen shop and the tobacco stand, turn left at the condom machine, and right at the black cat. Look for the cemetery on your left. My building is the beached whale in the middle of it.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know why there was an apartment building in a cemetery. Back then I couldn&#8217;t speak Japanese, so I couldn&#8217;t ask. And a little mystery always adds spice to life.</p>
<div id="attachment_528" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/5851530709_2cc65abfda_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" title="5851530709_2cc65abfda_z" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/5851530709_2cc65abfda_z.jpg?w=300&#038;h=222" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Rob Ketcherside</p></div>
<p>Despite the lack of street names, Tokyo is laid out with some reason, if not rhyme. It&#8217;s a spider web with the Emperor&#8217;s palace in the middle. The palace is circled by eight concentric ring roads which are numbered, sanely enough, one through eight. The major roads radiating out from the center are also numbered, but with no logic or detectable pattern. There&#8217;s a route one that eventually becomes two, but nowhere near Tokyo. Nobody seems to know where route three is. The one that goes past my neighborhood is 246. There&#8217;s no 245 or 247.</p>
<p>This neighborhood was at one time farm land, and its streets were once deer paths and rabbit runs. Wandering around the area, one discovers dead ends and switchbacks so it&#8217;s not unusual to be looking for something and discover that you just can&#8217;t get there from here. But along the way, one can also discover traditional houses next to modern monstrosities, temples and shrines&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_143401.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-529" title="111203_1434~01" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_143401.jpg?w=89&#038;h=150" alt="" width="89" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;gates leading nowhere&#8230;<a href="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_142801.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-530" title="111203_1428~01" src="http://mouseintokyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/111203_142801.jpg?w=92&#038;h=149" alt="" width="92" height="149" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;or a tree growing through someone&#8217;s balcony.</p>
<p>I guess in the end it&#8217;s not about getting there. It&#8217;s about what you do along the way.</p>
<p>* For the uninitiated, a mikan is a mandarin orange.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a bit of a creature of habit.  I wear the same running clothes (I do <em>try</em> to wash them twice a week), run the same course with minor variations for distance, and chant the same mantra as I fight my way through the last half mile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Run the hydrants, babe.  Just run the hydrants.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_880" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-880" title="Half Mile Marker" src="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-5.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Half mile left to go</p></div>
<p>It has never changed, albeit I have only been on this running program since May.  As I round the corner at the last half mile mark I start to think about how close I am to finishing.  Previous <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-ab">posts</a> will tell you I am not a big fan of running, so the <strong><em>end </em></strong>of a run is quite possibly the only part I actually like.  Because I am a glutton for punishment (and my condo is located on a hill) the last half mile is two-thirds uphill and one-third slight decline / mostly flat.  This makes for a great start to every run but a horrible way to end when I am sucking wind and battling my inner <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-bB">demons</a>.  So I chant:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run &#8216;em babe.  Run the hydrants.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure why I refer to myself as babe.  Sometime I call myself by my first name with the Y ending my mother uses, sometimes by my last like the drill sergeants used to but usually it is babe&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;  whatever&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_883" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 121px"><a href="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-42.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-883" title="Another Hydrant" src="http://soccerat32.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-42.jpg?w=111&#038;h=150" alt="" width="111" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just before the pancake</p></div>
<p>As I climb the first hill on my last half mile stretch my breath becomes labored and shallow, the hummingbird invariably resumes its residence in my chest cavity.  But as the incline turns to decline the knot holding the concrete bollard tied to my waist loosens and both fall away.</p>
<p>Another hydrant down, three more to go.</p>
<p>I try to lengthen my stride much like a lion would as it closes in on its prey but it ends up looking more like <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-8f">this</a>.  I pass another hydrant, two more to go.  The ground levels out to a pancake and I ready myself for the final push.  I envision myself running beside <a href="http://wp.me/p2vSZn-7G">Abby Wambach</a>, striding down the pitch on my way to a glorious goal.  I pass the second to last hydrant, embark on the last hill and suddenly there are three bollards tied to my waist and these ones are anchored to the cement.</p>

<p>I am dying and these are my final moments.  Instead of spending them in a bed surrounded by my loved ones I will die alone here on the pavement next to this friggin hydrant.  My lungs will surely burst like a balloon released to the heavens.</p>
<p><em>T</em><em>he air is to thin up here!</em></p>
<p>Last hydrant.</p>
<p>I push, I fight, I scream.</p>
<p>I finish.</p>
