				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a resident of downtown Manhattan, my family and I were affected by Hurricane Sandy. But the worst that happened to us was losing power and water, and having to walk up and down 28 flights of stairs to get ourselves and our stuff out of our apartment so we could move to our dear friend’s apartment on the Upper East Side (where we are now totally safe and comfortable). Our kids feel displaced and are missing their routines and friends, and my husband and I are inconvenienced and feel, strangely, like tourists in our own city. But that’s the worst of it. This is obviously NOT a poor me story.</p>
<p>But this experience has opened my eyes to a few things. In addition to teaching me about the enduring kindness of strangers in this supposedly rude and impersonal digital age, this experience had taught me a few new things about the role of technology and social media in my life and in the life of my family. Here are two that have been on my mind:</p>
<p><b>The Importance of Physical versus Digital Neighbors. </b>After the power went out, the kids on our floor were pretty much technology-free. What did they do? We opened the doors of our apartments, and the kids (including our one-year-old) ran out into the hallway like it was a backyard. Our neighbor Patricia said we should put grass down. The kids brought out toys and started playing store, house, battles, throw and catch, gymnastics. They found a collapsed cardboard box, and like all children, found that to be the best toy of all. My one-year-old got rides on the box from her brother, who would pull her around the hallway. Kids went freely from apartment to apartment. They played with each other like never before. I felt like I was living in an idealized American neighborhood (think Leave it to Beaver, I guess, which makes me June Cleaver? Jeez, you can’t control what leaps to mind can you?). Our doors were open and we fed each other’s kids lunch. <img class="alignnone" title="Did Hurricane Sandy bring out the Cleavers in us all?" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Cleaver_family_Leave_it_to_Beaver_1960.JPG" height="666" width="522" />   Essentially, we dealt with the loss of power by reaching out to our immediate social network in concrete ways. This simple neighborliness was immensely helpful and satisfying. All it took was walking across the hall. In my mind, no digital social network could be as satisfying in the circumstances we were facing. Of course, digital social media and mobile technologies are incredible tools for getting things done – communicating, getting information, keeping up-to-date, seeking and offering support. But, Sandy reminded me of how isolated, on a visceral level, we may start to feel when we forget to just be with the people around us.</p>
<p><b>Embodied Technology and Phantom Limbs. </b>My iPhone went kaput (got water in it somehow) on Tuesday. This was horrible timing of course because I couldn’t update anyone about our status. But, as many have observed (e.g.,   <a title="JOMO" href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/07/jomo.html" target="_blank">JOMO</a>) we often experience great relief and happiness when we can disconnect. However, I wasn’t just feeling happy about shedding the burden of being constantly connected.  I was worried and exhausted about my present moment and didn’t have the energy to look outside my current circumstances to communicate with others. I was fairly overwhelmed with getting the kids to safety. Communicating with our digital social network wasn’t going to help at that moment.</p>
<p>At the same time, I observed that this relief was mixed with some panic. How do I get what I need if I don’t have a phone? Luckily, my husband’s phone was working so we definitely had communication, but I, MYSELF, didn’t have a phone, and that was unnerving. Why would that be? I wasn’t disconnected, because I was with my husband and he was connected. Why did I feel disconnected?</p>
<p>To me, this speaks of the psychological aspect of having mobile devices that keep us constantly connected. It’s an embodied experience, having a device in your hand. And you feel it when it&#8217;s gone. Like a phantom limb: once you’ve lost the limb, you can still feel it itching. As humans, we’ve evolved to attach to other beings and to things. We anthropomorphize objects and devices so that we can feel a connection to them. Mobile technologies, because they are so deeply about social access and connection, may be high jacking this fundamental aspect of being human. All I know is that once I got uptown, I ran to the Apple store on 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue (thank you helpful Apple Genius) and got a new phone.</p>
<p>My family and I came out of the storm in great shape and we feel immensely lucky. For me, the biggest take-home message was that when technology is gone, or compromised, my appreciation for the people around me is that much sweeter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I cannot believe that I used to excel in Geometry. I&#8217;m terrible with numbers. But I remember when I was in third year at secondary school and required to take Chemistry, Algebra and Economics, Geometry was the &#8216;line I traced&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t particularly like it; it was just one of those subjects I had to pass. But I, myself,  got surprised every time I can easily solve the lengths, volumes and areas without the hair-pulling frustration I experienced with Algebra (to think that these two are related). It was (what&#8217;s the right word?) natural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In line with this week&#8217;s challenge, I ponder about how human beings are naturally attracted to symmetry&#8211;to perfection. You might have heard that beauty is symmetry and they started measuring women&#8217;s faces to find the most beautiful face. (<a href="http://theperfecthumanface.blogspot.com.au/" target="_blank">Check the perfect human face.</a>) If I had become a geometer, facial symmetry would be my specialization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is natural to think in symmetries, in binaries. They are convenient categorizations and explanations to the unfathomable complexity of human life. It could be axiomatic that everything in nature has order. However, some people believe that this is not the case, that the natural state of life and being is chaos. They believe in subjectivity and find beauty and reason in anarchy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I propose a resolution to this inevitable disagreement. Symmetry is objective; perfection is subjective. Lines are straight, no doubt about that, no further objections. But whether the straightness of the lines fulfills my idea of perfection is a different question with a subjective answer. (Forgive me for such a lengthy musing. I&#8217;m reading too much boring stuff these days.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Back to the photo challenge, above are the different angles of the <a title="Grand Palace" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palace" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Grand Palace</a> in Bangkok, Thailand. The golden columns, the colorful geometrical patterns on the walls and ornate roofs of the Grand Palace are  good examples of symmetry. I admire this place; it was beautiful beyond words. But I am sure that not all visitors are all the time impressed. If symmetry is in the correctness of measurements, we all know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, I made my point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of being just another schlep in the slush pile? Maybe it&#8217;s time to do something drastic that will make your pitch stand out from the other unsolicited Spam. For example (yes, I actually submitted this to several AAR agents):</p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Dear Underpaid Underling Automation Assistant to the Agent (put whatever you want here):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">There are so many rules to query letter writing, so many formulas and clichés that dehumanize us as we fail famously at getting to know each other. The first rule of query letter writing, according to the horde of schleps on the Internet that has never published a word about anything else, is to get straight to the point. After all, literary agents&#8211;those whose sworn mission in life is to voluntarily read—hate receiving queries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">So here goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">I’ve finished a rather marketable novel that will make all our hopes and dreams come true. It provides the general reader with the Sci-Fi Thriller escape he or she craves while it tenuously explores the postmodern experience through its subtext. It’s a monument to vicarious living. A reminder of what it means to be human. A big f&#8212;ing payday for all those involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Okay, let me start over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Lori Perkins says I should compare my work to a combination of previously published works. My story is <i>Fight Club</i> and <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i> thrown into a cast iron skillet with a dash of T.S. Eliot for taste. (Thanks, Lori. Thanks for pigeon-holing me into literary ionization.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Ah, I see your cursor hovering over the next query, the one about the latest low calorie, gluten free cookbook for single moms on the go. Or maybe it’s <i>Chicken Soup for the Pregnant Teenage Soul</i>. Don’t do it. Challenge yourself. I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Peter Rubie says that an effective pitch should compress your novel into a single sentence. If you can’t do this, your plot is a mess, and your message isn’t precise enough to reach your target audience. Sounds to me like a savory three-course meal dumped into a trash compactor, but here goes: When an anonymous college dropout and major competitor on Xbox Live stumbles into the freezer aisle of the local Wal-Mart at 2 AM, he discovers the meaning of existence; or rather, the lack thereof&#8211;we are all just pre-rendered characters on one big video game server, and a myriad of glitches, which he begins recording in a journal (manifesto), enable us to cheat at life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Astonishing, this secret alchemy of trash compactors. But mix 100 pounds of ice cream with 100 pounds of Panda Express, and you’ll just get 200 pounds of s&#8212;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Writer’s Digest says a good query introduces the editor to the writer’s style and tone without being cute. I don’t feel very cute. And if I’m not sitting in your Spam folder by now, contributing to an alchemical swill of dreams and despair, you’ve got the gist of where this is going: MANIFESTO is a no-holds-barred, literary/pop culture smashup that offers a compellingly strange look at the things we consider familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Brief Synopsis: Complete at 100,000 words (pretty sure someone else determines that), MANIFESTO chronicles the discoveries of a writer calling himself Gankutsuou, who works tirelessly to understand the Program that is life. After discovering that our dreams are real but are updated over each sleep cycle, he begins an insomniac&#8217;s crusade to crack the code that holds our world together, all while preserving his memories with a simple tool his generation has forgotten&#8211;the written word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">As he falls into a self-destructive spiral, he explains how the economy really works, why girls date dicks, what makes some people effortlessly thin, and a slew of other oddities that make life so confusing. He gives advice he doesn’t take. He fails at love. He corners the stock market by investing in feces. He travels to New Zealand to save the kiwi. He becomes a cult leader. And when even that doesn’t work out, he discovers a way to package the truth inside something everyone in America wants, no, needs&#8211;ripped, sexy abs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">His extreme fitness video, OmegaX30, is designed to lure the masses into recognizing the truth about the Program by physically exhausting them and brainwashing them to write about their somnambulist experiences in fitness journals. While OmegaX30 will be a landmark success, the numbers are in on the consequences of this revelation: impending Armageddon. In the end, the System Administrators stave off the apocalypse by publishing the narrator’s “manifesto” as a mass-market paperback&#8211;thus fictionalizing the truth and allowing mainstream society to return to normalcy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Capitalist Aspirations: Who&#8217;s the target audience for MANIFESTO? Anyone who&#8217;s taken a second look at a common occurrence and thought, <i>That doesn&#8217;t make sense. </i>Oh, and tack on anyone that grew up in the 80’s or 90’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Author Bio: After studying independently under ________, I graduated Cum Laude from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. I spent a year as a staff writer for Thompson Multimedia, where my work included ghostwriting novels and biographies for publication. I currently hold a Master of Arts in Education and a position teaching AP/IB Literature and Composition at Florence High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">But are these experiences relevant to the proposed project? Of course they are. Ghostwriting makes you crazy. And believe me, being an English teacher in a public education setting has greatly informed my understanding of cult practices and Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">If you snickered at any of these deconstructions, you owe it to yourself to write me back. True, there are plenty of projects sitting in your Inbox. This one is fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Thanks for humoring me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Respectfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Daniel Pike, MA Ed., Would-be Wordsmith</span></p>
<p>Now, one would imagine that this kind of solicitation would garner only negative attention. Far from it. I had six exclusive readings (two partials and four fulls) of Manifesto in a 3-month period&#8211;over the summer, to boot. It garnered rave reviews from a few of these big shots as well. I imagine if one were writing something a little less risky (or some literary agents had a heavier pair!), one would have more success in actually acquiring an agent&#8230; -.-</p>
<p>Abuse them, fledgling writers. Most of them deserve it. Some of them even like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="original-main-image" class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bzd4R5i9L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg" />Women and comedy is still a touchy subject, surprisingly, with the success of funny ladies like Kathy Griffin, Whitney Cummings or Chelsea Handler. Male comics will still like to drudge up that old question of whether women comics are funny. Yael Kohen&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/We-Killed-Women-American-Comedy/dp/0374287236/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351693559&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=we+killed+the+rise+of+women+in+american+comedy"><em>We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy</em></a>, takes a chronological look at the ascent of female comics, particularly standup comics.</p>
<p>Taking her cue from Tom Shales&#8217; and James Andrew Miller&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-New-York-Uncensored-Saturday/dp/0316735655/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351693753&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=saturday+night+live"><em>Live From New York: An Uncensored History of </em>Saturday Night Live<em>, as Told by Its Stars, Writers and Guests</em></a> as well as Mike Thomas&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Second-City-Unscripted-Revolution-World-Famous/dp/B005UVXKB0/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351693854&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=second+city"><em>The Second City Unscripted: Revolution and Revelation at the World-Famous Comedy Theater</em></a>, Kohen eschews a lot of her own voice, and instead presents the testimony of the various comediennes verbatim, grouping them under different themes, which include specific shows (<em>Saturday Night Live</em> or <em>Mary Tyler Moore</em>, for example), comedy institutions (the Groundlings, alternative comedy), even people (Roseanne Barr and Ellen DeGeneres). This style of focusing more on the words instead of writerly prose gives the book a documentary-feel.</p>
<p>When tackling a subject like this, one often notices what&#8217;s missing versus what&#8217;s included &#8211; and Kohen does an admirable job in covering female comics, but does come up short &#8211; specifically, because she focuses primarily on standup comediennes. Because she does give a passing nod at TV sitcoms like <em>Mary Tyler Moore</em> or <em>Maude</em>, her exclusion of other important female-driven shows like <em>Cybill</em>, <em>Murphy Brown</em> or <em>Sex and the City </em>comes off as pretty glaring. Also, any look at female comedy owes a look at Lucille Ball, who is surprisingly absent in this tome. Because Kohen seems more interested in standup comics, she ignores screen comediennes like Carole Lombard, Marilyn Monroe, Judy Holliday, Billie Burke, among others. Even more contemporary funny ladies like Diane Keaton or Bette Midler get shortchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, the bulk of the book centers on the women who carved out iconic careers through <em>Saturday Night Live</em> up to the current crop of female comics. What&#8217;s most interesting are the passages that detail women&#8217;s role in the comic boom of the 1980s to 1990s &#8211; this is when women standups were able to break into the mainstream, and many became household names. Far from being a hagiography, the backstage tales of these women aren&#8217;t always rosy or scrubbed up for consumer consumption &#8211; Elayne Boosler, for example, is singled out for being a pill, at times, which may have kept her from achieving superstardom on the level of Barr or DeGeneres; Kathy Griffin, while praised by her peers, is also described by more than one account as defensive; even DeGeneres talks about the lull in her career with disarming frankness.</p>
<p>Some interesting things pop up when reading <em>We Killed</em> &#8211; most notably is the problem female comics see in the rise of smutty comedy &#8211; specifically when delivered by a bikini-hot comedienne. Comic Sarah Silverman built her career on shocking audiences by delivering some of the most foul, vile material &#8211; littered with jokes about rape, AIDS, the Holocaust, racism, anti-Semitism &#8211; but she delivers the material with an impish smirk, as if she were a child that gets away with cursing; that comic persona, coupled with her beauty, gave her a niche that is now being co-opted by many other female comics, much to the chagrin of established comediennes.</p>
<p>As fascinating as the younger voices are, it&#8217;s the veterans that will hold the reader&#8217;s attention &#8211; specifically Lily Tomlin, whose career ran the gamut fromTV&#8217;s <em>Laugh-In</em>, to working with fellow comic genius Richard Pryor, to TV specials, and to Oscar-nominated film roles. Tomlin&#8217;s insight, her commitment to subversive social critique, and her homosexuality make her passages all the more interesting as she came of age during a time when a mainstream comic like Carol Burnett ruled. Along with Tomlin, passages by Phyllis Diller, Whoopi Goldber, and Joan Rivers also give some serious heft to this book &#8211; these ladies had to do some serious struggling to get their work and points of view across.</p>
<p>A few years ago, British comic Dawn French produced and hosted a series of interviews called <em>Girls Who Do Comedy</em> (a companion series for male comics came later). This show accomplished what <em>We Killed</em> couldn&#8217;t &#8211; capturing the <em>voices</em> of these funny ladies. While reading their words make for entertaining reading, actually hearing it, brings the writing to another level (if you don&#8217;t believe me, try this: first read a transcript of Wanda Sykes&#8217; standup, then actually <em>listen</em> to it &#8211; trust me, there&#8217;s a difference). Also French&#8217;s show not only addressed American comediennes (Silverman, Sandra Bernhard, Rivers, Diller, Goldberg, even Miss Piggy all took part), but she also interviewed some brilliant British comediennes like her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders, or the late Linda Smith. I understand that the subtitle of the book is <em>The Rise of Women in </em>American<em> Comedy</em>, but the impact of British acts like French, Saunders, or Tracey Ullman is definitely felt here, and their contribution would&#8217;ve only enhanced the book. Also a deeper look into how sexuality and race play into the work of a comedienne is given a quick glance, but rarely explored, which is a disappointment.</p>
<p>Despite its shortcomings, <em>We Killed</em> does achieve its goal of presenting an oral history of female comedy. For now, Kohen&#8217;s work will have to suffice, but hopefully another book will come out that will give some historical context to women and humor. Until then, <em>We Killed</em> is still more than adequate, and proves to be a fun, breezy read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have followed with morbid fascination the downfall of Jonah Lehrer. I&#8217;ll admit to really enjoying <em>Proust was a Neuroscientist</em>, as well as <em>How We Decide.</em> I still see value in each of these books, and I will continue to assign the chapter on vision and Paul Cezanne, because it is a wonderful introduction to how the science of perception can interact with the world of visual art. The problem of vision scientists in explaining how the eye works are sometimes remarkably similar to the challenges of artists in depicting a realistic world. But I also had misgivings about some of his neuro-reductionism, well before his more public integrity problems. Here are a few of those criticisms which came out before the scandal: a particularly harsh one from <a title="Chotiner in New Republic" href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/103912/bob-dylan-jonah-lehrer-creativity#">Isaac Chotiner</a>, a dialogue with <a title="Chris Chabris responds to latest Jonah Lehrer on Bad Reviews" href="https://plus.google.com/102708274929263183253/posts/Q1CU52vvJsT">Christopher Chabris</a>, and another harsh one from <a title="Steven Poole review of Lehrer in the Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/apr/19/imagine-creativity-jonah-lehrer-review?CMP=twt_gu">Steven Poole</a>.</p>
<p>I thought that the recent summative <a title="Kachka piece" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/jonah-lehrer-2012-11/">piece in New York Magazine</a>, by Boris Kachka, did a very good job of tying all the strands of this story together. It&#8217;s long, but worth it. But one little throwaway line really stuck with me, and I thought I would share it with you. It is right before Michael Moynihan, a reporter originally sympathetic to Lehrer, <a title="Moynihan at Tablet" href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/107779/jonah-lehrers-deceptions">published his critical expose</a> of Lehrer&#8217;s outright fabrications, further documenting that Lehrer&#8217;s crimes reached well past journalistic misdemeanors.</p>
<blockquote><p>The next morning, a desperate Lehrer finally managed to reach Moynihan. Didn’t he realize, Lehrer pleaded, that if Moynihan went forward, he would never write again—would end up nothing more than a schoolteacher?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;">Boris Kachka &#8211; &#8220;<a title="Proust Wasn't a Neuroscientist, Neither was Jonah Lehrer" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/jonah-lehrer-2012-11/index2.html">Proust Wasn&#8217;t a Neuroscientist, Neither Was Jonah Lehrer</a>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more than a schoolteacher?&#8221; With that, I am sure Lehrer lost the last bit of sympathy he had with many of his former defenders. I too was disappointed with this, but not terribly surprised, because this attitude is not nearly as rare as it should be.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>That&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t have better schools, US. People who pass for intellectuals here can say &#8220;nothing but a schoolteacher&#8221; as if it= failure</p>

<p>Poke the anxiety of many ambitious academics and intellectuals, whether Ph.D.&#8217;s on the job market, or even practicing research scientists, and you find that when they imagine themselves in front of a high school classroom they imagine nothing but shame and failure.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/criener">criener</a> Walter White isn’t exactly helping that stereotype. No greater disgrace for a Chem PhD than to end up teaching high school</p>

<p>To me, this is not just, as science writer extraordinaire Ed Yong put it, awful snobbery, but fundamentally a failure of imagination. Which is ironic, not just because &#8220;Imagine&#8221; is the title of the book that began Lehrer&#8217;s end, but because Lehrer has shown, for both good and bad, that he has a wonderfully active imagination.</p>
<p>This failure of imagination is a failure to see beyond the overwhelmed schoolteacher caricature. The effects of this caricature in this case reflect Lehrer&#8217;s impending sense of shame and disgrace, but also reflect other myths of K-12 education. I am going to pick on Ed here, because I think his response is well-meaning but incomplete. He tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/criener">criener</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/ejwillingham">ejwillingham</a> Horrendous. I can think of few jobs more daunting, difficult, or important than schoolteacher.</p>
<p>— Ed Yong(@edyong209) <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/262911630868897794">October 29, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, education is daunting and difficult, but that is not the problem with Lehrer&#8217;s quote. Cleaning the elephant cage at the zoo is also daunting and difficult. Teaching is important, (and in fairness, so is cleaning the elephant house, at the very least to the elephants) and Lehrer&#8217;s words do diminish teaching as unimportant. But ultimately, I think Ed&#8217;s view leans too far in the other direction, towards a mythology of teachers as noble saints, doing noble yet difficult, daunting drudgery. To me, the tragedy of what Lehrer misses, as well as the tragedy of most popular depictions of teaching, is that they miss the intellectual challenges and rewards of teaching students of any age.</p>
<p>Yes, teaching can be intellectually rewarding to a Rhodes Scholar. Yes, teaching can be rewarding to a bench scientist. Yes, teaching can be rewarding to a Ph.D. in astrophysics. Probing the minds of high school students (and even kindergardeners) can be immensely challenging and rewarding, not just in a &#8220;woohoo! I got these crazy kids to sit down and <a title="Critique of KIPP and No Excuses from PL Thomas" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/30/1125810/--No-Excuses-and-the-Culture-of-Shame-Why-Metrics-Don-t-Matter">look like</a> they are paying attention!&#8221; but in a &#8220;wow, real learning and engagement is difficult with many students, but when it happens it is magical.&#8221;</p>
<p>It can require extensive background knowledge, sophisticated problem-solving and yes, even creativity. One of my high school psychology teacher friends chimed in:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">edyong209</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/criener">criener</a> Agreed. My conversations with high school Psych and Philosophy students &#8220;challenged&#8221; me as much as all my Phd classes!</p>

<p>I could go on and on about this, but for a curious, open mind, teaching at any age can be a fascinating intellectual exercise. This past summer I taught 6 and 7 year old&#8217;s chess in 3 hour sessions (ok, there was lunch, and art breaks, but still, even chess for 1 hour for 17 six-year-olds is kind of a big deal). And it was really interesting to me to consider their process of learning. Why is it so hard to learn how a knight moves? What is going on as they decide to move their rook pawns first? Why are some moves more interesting to them than others? Later on, over a long fascinating dinner conversation with the other instructors, the camp director, International Grandmaster Maurice Ashley was talking about the interesting math of the chess board, for example, that &#8220;distance&#8221; on the chess board, while we may see it, does not really exist in the rules of the game. For example, for a rook, one move may mean moving 1 square or 7 squares. In the rules of the game, these are &#8220;equidistant.&#8221;  Anyways, considering both this advanced math, as well as what are the steps to best convey this advanced, struck me as an immense intellectual challenge. The same could hold of reading, or chemistry.</p>
<p>BUT&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the big caveat to all of the above. Teaching is not just an intellectual challenge, there is also discipline and some other crap. Many of those 6-year-olds didn&#8217;t want to sit still for twenty minutes, much less an hour, to learn the game of chess. I had to hold their attention, recognize when it was beyond holding, separate kids who couldn&#8217;t keep their hands off each other, tell them not to treat the chess pieces as weapons or toothpicks. Schoolteachers do have to control the discipline of the classroom. At any age, you can&#8217;t just interact with a student&#8217;s mind, but you have to convince them you are addressing their hearts too (which are sometimes sitting in a toxic vat of hormones). Some of this is unavoidable, but some of the other crap that teachers have to deal with is not in the nature of teaching, but rather a particular and often arbitrary circumstance of our current system.</p>
<p>Yes, dealing with discipline in their classroom is an unavoidable part of any teacher&#8217;s job. Dealing with discipline in the lunchroom is not. Advising students on how to deal with math-related frustrations is part of the job of every math teacher. Advising students on how to deal with other frustrations need not be. Every time a teacher has to do test prep for a test they don&#8217;t believe helps learning, or endure a BS professional development seminar on dubious neurobabble, it can saps their energy and resolve for the other challenges they want to face.</p>
<p>Which brings us to my (not-so) modest proposal. For those who think we should seek to improve education by improving teacher quality, or teacher talent, by somehow selecting better teachers, I ask them to consider Lehrer&#8217;s quote. Instead of aiming to fire ineffective teachers, I think a great way to recruit and maintain a more intellectually engaged teacher corps would to emphasize and encourage the things that creative nerds like Lehrer (and me) value; intellectual freedom and independence, challenge, creativity. Here is <a title="Substance and the Stress (not the salary)" href="http://allthingsedu.blogspot.com/2011/11/its-substance-stress-not-salary-stupid.html">a great post</a> fleshing out what helps draw and keep great thoughtful teachers in the profession. At its heart, teaching is a set of marvelous, challenging but workable intellectual puzzles. The more we acknowledge this and move towards it, the better for the profession.</p>
<p>Despite the constraints and shortcomings of our current system, I still have many teacher heroes who shared reflected joy in introducing me to the marvelous world of ideas.  And I gather more as my kids continue in their schooling. I bet Lehrer would make a fantastic high school biology teacher. He might even enjoy moving beyond the page and seeing the light in people&#8217;s eyes when his words spark a latent wonder. What&#8217;s standing in his way is his own imagination.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bargaining is somewhat of an innate ability for S, likely inherited from her grandmother who, rumor has it, would even try to bargain with the cashiers at Macy’s. Like her grandmother, S has no qualms about bargaining from a weak position. For example, when we arrived in Zanzibar late in the evening, D went over to the taxi stand to negotiate our fare in Swahili. After the driver agreed to drop his “listed” fare, S coolly informed him that he had not dropped it enough and that he had to lower it further before she would agree to go with him. One could imagine the driver replying just as coolly, “Fine, suit yourself &#8211; spend the night at the airport,” but he did not and we got a better deal.</p>
<p><a href="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bargaining.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2238" title="bargaining" alt="" src="http://towelspacked.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bargaining.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-2237"></span>We&#8217;ve found in our travels, however, that bargaining, much to S’s chagrin, is not a part of every culture. After negotiating prices in just about every Latin American country between Mexico and Argentina, our experience in Nicaragua caught S off-guard. Vendors there quite simply do not bargain. In one instances, when S asked for a discount on an item she saw at a market, the vendor offered to knock off the equivalent of ten cents from what was roughly a twenty-dollar item. And even in Thailand and Laos, where they do negotiate, S noticed that one could easily offend the seller by setting a price point that was too low.</p>
<p>Different travelers have different bargaining strategies. Some say there is a one third rule and that one should try to pay less than one third of the original price, but it often depends where one is, how much of a foreigner one appears to be to the seller, and what the item is. One friend of ours is an ardent advocate of what he calls “re-anchoring.” He says that rather than let the vendor quote a price, which he would then have to negotiate downwards, he tries to start the conversation by naming a price, thereby anchoring the negotiation around his starting price point, which the vendor then has to try to raise. This tactic might work for relatively inexpensive items, especially ones whose approximate value one can estimate. However, for large-ticket items, the trick is to avoid giving a number as long as possible, forcing the vendor to decrease his/hers.</p>
<p>Even veteran hagglers have to accept that if they really want something, they may have to part with more than originally expected. In our case, S had her heart set on a large, carved Swahili frame. Unfortunately, she hadn’t done much research and had no idea what would be a fair price. When she finally found the frame she wanted and tried bargaining with the shop owners, it became clear that we would not get it for anywhere near a third of the asking price. S felt time-pressured because not everyone in the group was interested in shopping all afternoon so after the negotiations reached a stalemate, she shrugged and walked away, which did not elicit calls to come back or a lower price, like she had hoped.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, S was struck by a deep case of buyer’s remorse and could not stop thinking about the frame. She emailed a friend who had bought a similar piece to get a better frame of reference and resolved to return to the store the next day. Thus, while D enjoyed a few more hours at the beach, S caught a ride to Stone Town with our friends, who had an earlier return flight to Nairobi. To hurry things along, S started the conversation by naming the price she was previously offered, saying how it was too expensive. The shop-keepers were happy to see her and immediately dropped the price within bargaining range. Not long after, two men were taking apart the frame, darkening the wood in caustic soda and water, and wrapping the pieces in paper for S to take home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been spending time listening to my records, as I discussed in Tuesday’s post. It’s so nostalgic, hearing the imperfect playback. Not exactly relaxing, however, not when listening to 45’s that only last for about three minutes.</p>
<p>I had a few old 45’s that were my dad’s. That’s how I learned <a title="Les Baxter Unchained Melody" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NVrfgMHXE0" target="_blank">“Unchained Melody”</a> sung by Les Baxter and accompanied by his orchestra, on a purple, “Capitol Records” label. My sister and I would sing it dramatically to each other, her from her loft in the bedroom we shared, and I on the swing that hung from the rafters in the center of our room. I wish I had a picture of that room; it was so cool.  (By the way, this version I&#8217;ve linked is the exact version I have!  If you shut your eyes while you listen to it, you can imagine it&#8217;s on vinyl.  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>
<p>We even had a National Geographic record. Remember those? They’d be inserted in the magazine and you could tear them out – they were floppy – and then you could listen to real <a title="Sounds of the Space Age" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-DEC-1969-APOLLO-11-MOON-LANDING-WITH-RARE-RECORD-INSERT-/130793262451?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_2&amp;hash=item1e73e2cd73" target="_blank">“Sounds of the Space Age”</a>.  Highly educational. I didn’t listen to that one too often.</p>

Had to get it even though we still have the 33 1/3. It&#8217;s a perfect example of those Read Aloud records. And how about that National Geographic record? It&#8217;s slightly bent and I couldn&#8217;t get it to play correctly at all when I tried today!</p></div>
<p>On Tuesday I mentioned that my kids love to listen to The Rescuers and The Hobbit. Those were my first-ever 33 1/3’s. The Hobbit is “The Complete Original Soundtrack including dialogue, music and songs” from the <a title="The Hobbit Rankin/Bass production" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(1977_film)" target="_blank">Rankin/Bass movie production</a> in 1977. And, of course, it has the “special edition book” with it. My husband is phenomenal at knowing lines from movies, but he can’t hold a candle to my ability to quote The Hobbit. (By the way, I have already written <a title="The Hobbit Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0k3kHtyoqc" target="_blank">“Go see The Hobbit”</a> on December 14th on my calendar. Can’t wait.)</p>
<p>As for The Rescuers, it’s also from 1977, and actually was the first movie I saw in a theater. My sister gave me the “Songs and Dialogue” album for Christmas that year and I loved it. My dad, sadly, did not realize how much I loved it and he got rid of it in one of their cross-the-country-or-world-moves and I was so sad, nevermind that I was in college by then. I told my husband that story years ago and he, bless his heart, went onto E-Bay and bought me the exact same album. How great is he? So, even though it’s not my original album, my kids – and I –can still enjoy it.</p>

<p>Occasionally I’d raid Mom and Dad’s 33 1/3 collection of records, but not too often, because all they had was classical. Oh, but he had Herb Alpert’s Tijuana Brass, “Whipped Cream and Other Delights”. <a title="Whipped Cream and other Delights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipped_Cream_%26_Other_Delights" target="_blank">Oy, vey, that album cover!</a></p>
<div id="attachment_2370" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/herb-alpert.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2370" title="Herb Alpert" alt="" src="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/herb-alpert.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I was a wee bit shocked when I found this in my parent&#8217;s record collection, many, many moons ago. Turns out, it was quite the phenomenon!</p></div>
<p>But my favorite records of my parents’ were <a title="The Smothers Brothers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothers_Brothers" target="_blank">The Smothers Brothers</a>. “Curb you tongue, knave!”, “The Two Sides of the Smothers Brothers”, “think ethnic!”, and “…at the Purple Onion” – these are still the stars of my record collection. There weren’t a lot of times I saw my mom wiping her eyes from laughter, but listening to the Smothers Brothers would make her do that. “The Streets of Laredo”, “Chocolate” and “Black is the Colour (of my Love’s True Hair)” – those were probably our favorite cuts from the albums. They were part of our family vocabulary. And – I love this story – it is partly due to The Smothers Brothers that I decided my husband would be a worthy candidate to be my husband. Never, in all my life, had I met anyone who knew who I was talking about if the topic of the Smothers Brothers came up. Then along he came and he knew. It was meant to be.</p>
<div id="attachment_2365" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/004-4.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2365" title="004 (4)" alt="" src="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/004-4.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=818" height="818" width="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These are so awesome!</p></div>
<p>A few years back I found a duplicate album of theirs and bought it because I was into making bowls out of records – you melt them in the oven and have a cute bowl! <a title="Record Bowls" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Bowls-out-of-Vinyl-Records" target="_blank">(Take a look at how to do it! It&#8217;s easy!)</a> I thought it would be extra-fun to have a Smothers Brothers bowl to hold candy AND memories. My husband wouldn’t let me melt it. “It’s the Smothers Brothers! That would be sacrilege!” So we have two of that album. Two, nice and flat records.</p>
<p>I made my bowl from an old Amy Grant album. He didn’t care about that one so much.</p>
<div id="attachment_2368" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/012-2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2368" title="012 (2)" alt="" src="http://afinedayforanepiphany.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/012-2.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=920" height="920" width="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A little piece of my teen years: made more useful, according to The Sailboat King. It would be perfect in a Rumpus Room. If only I had a Rumpus Room&#8230;</p></div>
<p>I heard the other day that someone was releasing their brand new album on compact disc AND on vinyl. I love that. There’s nothing like having a record on in the background to sooth your soul.</p>
<p><a title="The Smothers Brothers on You Tube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIfl2o44zb0&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a sample</a> of The Smothers Brothers from long ago.  Enjoy!</p>
