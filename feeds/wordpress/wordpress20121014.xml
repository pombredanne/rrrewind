				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this with a tequila bottle in one hand and a five dollar cigar in the other. That&#8217;s not totally true, I guess, or even true at all in the technical sense. But I could be writing with booze and smokes in my hands if I wanted, and every writer in literary history would envy me. Today for the first time I&#8217;m attempting to use speech to text software to write a real thing that real people might read.</p>
<p>I’m trying this in anticipation of a neurological rebellion that might hold my hands hostage, like socialist guerillas occupying a power plant, but I’m finding it a problematic exercise. For example, in the prior paragraph the speech to text software thought that the word &#8220;for&#8221; should be &#8220;from.&#8221; When I tried to edit the word, the software obtusely led me on a Maypole dance through four or five incorrect commands. The most entertaining was when I said &#8220;select four words right,” and the software interpreted it as &#8220;Open World of Warcraft.” I am not making that up. I haven’t logged on in years, so it was a surprise. Also, it&#8217;s really hard to get this program to type the phrase “Open World of Warcraft” when it thinks you want to open the program World of Warcraft whenever you say those words.</p>
<p>The preceding paragraphs took me five minutes to write. They took seven months to edit, otherwise known as 30 minutes, but anyone who challenges the seven months interpretation can put on this god damn headset and try it themselves. It also aggravates me that the stupid software doesn&#8217;t understand the word &#8220;obtusely.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick experiment has just shown me that this program understands almost no profanity. That is a F you see Kay I in G shame, and I expect that&#8217;s going to slow down my words per hour considerably.</p>
<p>Holy frijoles! (I just found out it doesn’t understand Spanish, and I had to type “frijoles.”) I don&#8217;t know why, but all on its own this software just tried to take something I said and post it to Twitter. I hope it wasn’t “F you see Kay I in G.” That&#8217;s a little bit scary if you ask me.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I&#8217;m having is that I&#8217;m not verbally oriented. I have a hard time learning things by listening to people, especially if they&#8217;re really boring people like most of my college professors. I learn things by doing them. That&#8217;s handy when you write by typing on a keyboard with your actual fingers. But in order to speak the words I want to write, I have to stop and think about every phrase before I say it, so that it doesn&#8217;t come out sounding like a Neanderthal on Quaaludes. (Holy crap! This program understands what Quaaludes are. I bet that&#8217;s because the people who use this program have to take them a lot.) So, for these few paragraphs that would normally take me about half an hour to write and edit, this program has demanded an hour and a half, a liter of Diet Coke, and a surreptitious pull off the Cuervo bottle. (I see it understands Cuervo too.)</p>
<p>Despite all that, I admit that this would be better than not being able to write at all. So I&#8217;m going to call this test successful, maybe have a party, and definitely have a celebratory bag of peanut butter M&amp;M&#8217;s. Technology is a damn fine thing, but I will say that I never want to have software integrated into my body, no matter what technologists say. It would take me 45 minutes to pee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crisp autumn season settles over the Big Apple, the gorgeous shades of orange, red, and yellow illuminate the entire city, creating the calm before the storm. Coming from LA, it&#8217;s such a delight to be able to witness an actual changing of seasons, and my favorite, hands down, is the beautiful transition from summer to autumn, when the peak of the fall foliage shines through. With a glass of apple cider in hand, walk through the paths of Central Park to observe the best foliage and to fully absorb the city&#8217;s autumnal glory. If you haven&#8217;t experienced fall in New York City, jot it down on your bucket list now.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The solitary drifter is a character that&#8217;s romanticized in American literature and film. Most Westerns trade on this motif. A lone, mysterious stranger rides into town with a job to do. That wasn&#8217;t quite the scene when I went out West. There&#8217;s nothing particularly romantic about the life of an academic migrant worker, although it is solitary. Instead of hardtack, I subsisted on instant ramen noodles, but that&#8217;s where the similarities end. When I went out West, to Saskatchewan, it was to teach philosophy. I was filling in for a professor who was on sabbatical for a year, so I knew that the prospects of long term employment were slim, but I wanted to work and moving out West was an opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>I must confess that I had preconceptions about Western Canada. I should preface this by saying that I was born and raised in Toronto. I&#8217;m used to city life and enjoy the access to culture and entertainment that a large city affords. From my perspective, Regina was in the middle of nowhere &#8212; fly over country. It was a cold, bleak landscape. I assumed that my entertainment options would be limited to Canadian football and rodeos. I imagined that the people there were good ol&#8217; boys and girls. They probably wore plaid and drove pick-up trucks with bumper stickers that said &#8216;my other car is a truck.&#8217; In other words, I thought they&#8217;d be relatively unsophisticated and uneducated. I&#8217;m not sure I ever thought that consciously, but such was my vague and uninformed impression. I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I grew to like it out there. There&#8217;s a certain austere beauty to the wide open spaces on the prairie. The expanse of land and sky makes one feel small and insignificant. It fills one with that feeling of awe that Kant called &#8216;the sublime.&#8217; I miss the space, the elbow room. I can drive for hours, in any direction from where I live in Toronto, and never leave the urban sprawl. Twenty minutes from Regina on the Trans Canada Highway, and there&#8217;s nothing but open country. It&#8217;s a liberating feeling. Again, it&#8217;s the romantic notion of not being hemmed in, of being free to roam.</p>
<div id="attachment_559" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://theunemployedphilosophersblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sask_bw.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-559" title="sask_bw" alt="" src="http://theunemployedphilosophersblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sask_bw.jpg" height="493" width="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by flavian http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/North_America/Canada/Prairies/Saskatchewan/moosejaw/photo578349.htm</p></div>
<p>The people were also not what I expected. I didn&#8217;t know a soul when I arrived and, being an introverted person by disposition, I&#8217;m not great at making friends. However, the people I met more than compensated for that with their friendliness and hospitality. They were the least pretentious people I&#8217;ve ever met. This was a humbling experience since I realized that my preconceived notions of prairie folk, even if they were naive rather than mean-spirited, could aptly be described as &#8216;pretentious.&#8217; They also introduced me to the game of curling. It&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks, but learning to curl was great fun. It&#8217;s a very Zen-like game. I tend to obsess about decisions and mistakes that I&#8217;ve made, but in curling &#8212; like other sports &#8212; if you make a bad shot, you have to put it out of your mind and concentrate on the next time. It helped me &#8216;get outside of my head&#8217; and was therapeutic in that respect. Of course, an important aspect of the culture of the game is socializing afterwards. I met great people over post-game drinks and was impressed again with their lack of pretension. It was a university league and people with different roles &#8212; faculty, administration, IT, maintenance &#8212; all socialized together. There were no class distinctions or social hierarchies of any kind; just people enjoying a game and each others&#8217; company.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my time teaching there as well. I had some very bright students and did, in my humble opinion, some of my best work. I taught courses I&#8217;ve always wanted to teach and, for the first time in my career, taught a full three-course semester. I would have been happy to continue teaching there but all good things &#8212; and contracts &#8212; must come to an end. So, like the loner at the end of many a John Ford film, I had to ride off into the sunset. But life on the prairie was a good experience for me. It challenged my preconceptions about the people who live in that region and their way of life. It broadened my horizons, both literally and figuratively. Maybe one day, I&#8217;ll make my way westward again. In the meantime, in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the big city, I fondly remember the wide open spaces.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In which I am outdated, and outraged</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been ill these past few days, and today is my first day back at work. I&#8217;ve missed a couple of runs due to almost dying (it was a SERIOUS cold) and so when I popped into the shop on my way in, I bought a running magazine for inspiration.</p>
<div id="attachment_223" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image-2.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-223" title="image (2)" alt="" src="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image-2.jpeg" height="600" width="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;</p></div>
<p>So far, so good. Infact, I was so pleased with myself for being on my way to a healthier life (buying a running mag is almost as good as going for a run) that I decided to take a picture of said magazine, instagram the crap out of it, and upload to Twitter and Facebook to show how healthy I am.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I received this tweet:</p>
<div id="attachment_224" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-224" title="image" alt="" src="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image.png" height="900" width="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tweet Tweet</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Not got that copy.&#8221; That was (should have been) my first clue.</p>
<p>New out! I thought. I&#8217;m going to be on the cutting edge of all the new information, and I&#8217;ll be running better than everyone! I should&#8217;ve brought my running gear to work so I could start straight away, a few laps of the shop, perhaps?</p>
<p>I started looking through the magazine and read: &#8220;This month is a big one for marathons, and they don&#8217;t come bigger than London.&#8221;</p>
<p>London? That&#8217;s ages away! (Clue #2). Uber-Cutting Edge! They talk about things 6 months in the future as though they&#8217;re this month! I&#8217;ll be getting all sorts of questions about why I&#8217;m so good and where I got my info! I&#8217;ll be rich!</p>
<p>Sadly, no.</p>
<p>I looked at the front of the magazine, at the date.</p>
<p>May.</p>
<p>Incase you&#8217;ve forgotten, or don&#8217;t have a calendar handy, it&#8217;s October.</p>
<p>BUT WAIT! It get&#8217;s worse.</p>
<div id="attachment_225" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image-3.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-225" title="image (3)" alt="" src="http://hemingwayrun.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image-3.jpeg" height="600" width="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217; (Just the same as Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;, but zoomed in a bit)</p></div>
<p>MAY 2011!</p>
<p>17 months ago! It hasn&#8217;t been 2011 for at least nine months! You could have a baby in that time!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no longer cutting edge, I&#8217;m off the edge! I don&#8217;t even know where the edge is! (Touring with U2, probably. Boom boom!)</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m worried that my running technique will be outdated! People will laugh at my running style and say things like &#8220;Look at him, he&#8217;s SO May 2011&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even remember what I was doing in May 2011 so I can&#8217;t pretend I time travelled or anything!</p>
<p>The cover of the magazine promises &#8220;369 Unmissable Races To Enter Now&#8221; but I&#8217;ve missed all 369. It should&#8217;ve said &#8220;369 Unmissable Races To Enter Now Unless You&#8217;ve Been Sold This Magazine By Someone Who Ignores Dates And By Dates We Mean Dates As In Days And Months And Not Dates As In Fruit Or Going For A Nice Meal With A Loved One Or Someone You Fancy A Bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I go in that shop quite often, so next time I&#8217;m in I&#8217;ll mention this (for want of a better word) balls-up, and tell him that if anyone laughs at my out-dated running, I&#8217;ll make sure they don&#8217;t come into his shop. Or I&#8217;ll ask for a free Twix.</p>
<p>I daren&#8217;t even look at the milk I bought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear son,</p>
<p><strong>I love you</strong>. I want you to know that first of all. There are times you may not feel it. There are time you may doubt if you are really loved. There are times I am angry at you. But please don&#8217;t forget: I love you.</p>
<p>From the first time I heard you cry, up to this moment you are walking with me to school, the joy I have is still overflowing. Such a creation like you could only bring ecstasy like this. No pets, books, films, or food can even equate the happiness I feel when I&#8217;m with you. Please know that. Even if I don&#8217;t show it that much.</p>
<p>When you want something, be willing to wait. Know the value of patience and perseverance. I cannot give you all you want. But I will make sure you have everything you&#8217;ll need.</p>
<p>I may not be at home all the time to watch you sleep, have dinner with you, or play with you in the yard. Please do understand that what I am doing is for us to live. I may be taking care of other patients, but I am taking care of them as if they&#8217;re my own blood. All these I do, I do it in the name of love.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give your mother a headache. She is your superwoman in the house. An all around servant/cook/gardener/mother/wife/friend/and endless things she can do for you. Do help her. Be a good boy. Just that, and all her burdens are gone. She&#8217;ll be recharged. If you want a little more, a kiss in the cheek and a tight hug is way better. Don&#8217;t be shy.</p>
<p>Whenever you think we love your younger sister more than we love you, count the things we did for you. Open your eyes to what we have given you that your sister did not have. You will always be loved equally. Though in different ways of treatment, but equal still.</p>
<p>When you asked for a PSP and I declined your plead, please understand that I want you to play in the streets. It&#8217;s more fun. I want you to enjoy the little things that matter. A neighbor&#8217;s company, a friend&#8217;s support, the thrill of mischief, of running free, the exhaustion of the body with the lightness of the soul.</p>
<p>Please do study well. It&#8217;s okay if you are not an outstanding student but please do your best. Love school. Don&#8217;t go there because you want good grades, or you have a crush on someone [though that is also good], but more than that, go to school because you want to learn. Don&#8217;t mind how many crayons you got on your pack, or how many pencils, erasers or paper you got, just learn to love learning.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m making sense here. By the time you can read this, I suppose I have already found your mother. My journey is still unfinished though, so whoever your mother will turn out to be, she will be right for you. And for me.</p>
<p>Till the day we&#8217;ll meet!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Your father</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While many outdoor recreation friendly Vermonters were taking to the woods for the opening day of archery deer season, we were loading up the row boat to go catch some crappie on the Connecticut River.</p>
<p>The fish we were chasing roam a deep river channel. The school of fish is large and we have found that the largest fish present lead the way for all. To locate the school, we usually begin by cruising around making long, fast casts with or without a bobber. The active fish usually are suspending 5-10 below the surface in 20+ feet of water. Once we start catching large crappie, we know we have hit it. To track the fish as they move around we have to determine if they are moving up or down the channel.      To stay on the school, it is only a matter of staying ahead of their movements. It would be possible if we were to keeping fish to catch a limit in one pass but we have been releasing all fish in order to maintain a healthy population.</p>
<p>The fish seemed much more spread out today than the previous week.  We actually found the largest concentration of fish in an unusual place for the Glory Hole.  Instead of being suspended over the deep water feeding on minnows they moved up on a  flat and seemed to be feeding on a hatch emerging from the soft bottom.  We boated at least a hundred fish in a matter of hours and decided that it was time to get home and get camo-ed up for the afternoon hunt.  Good day of fishing once again using the <a href="http://www.lftlures.com/categories/soft-plastics-lft-baby-shad-2-1-4">&#8220;Live&#8221; Baby Shad</a> made by LFT Lures.</p>
<p>We put together two videos from our glory hole trip. Check out <a title="Ice Fishing Teaser" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV2dGoweZtU&amp;feature=plcp">Ice Fishing Teaser </a>and <a title="Opening Day Of Deer Season Crappie Fishing" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8iory2duBg&amp;feature=plcp">Opening Day Of Deer Season Crappie Fishing </a>on our YouTube page!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first trip of 2012 began on the 2nd January and consisted of a 12 hour road trip from Perth, Western Australia to Coral Bay.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-232" title="CoralBay01" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay011.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>With my wife and good mates Fredrico &amp; Sasha (names changed for all government agencies out there) we took to the road at 8pm. Fredrico owns a single cab Toyota Landcruiser with a canopy on the back, loaded up to the nines with fishing gear, swags, fridges, cookers and a couple of wild turkeys. Actually a couple of slabs of Wild Turkey, which may not be as useful as the turkeys themselves if we broke down and needed to eat, or ride to a nearby town. Speaking of towns, I will tell you now that if you are in Perth, Western Australia and planning to drive for 12 hours north to coral bay, don&#8217;t expect to see many (towns or turkeys). This drive would have to be one of the most boring I&#8217;ve ever done, with the road being straight and flat for nearly the entire way. The landscape which we missed on the way up in the dark, we experienced on the way back, and I will say it is one I only need to see once. Small trees turn to shrubs, which then turn back to small trees and there is barely a hill or a bump for most of the drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay29.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-234" title="CoralBay29" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay29.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>On a positive note, my old mate Fredrico knew heaps about the few small towns on the way up which included the Hutt River Province, an actual country within Australia due to a cheeky cocky (farmer) from back in the forties who found a loophole in the law books and claimed his land exclusively as his own nation. Sadly it was midnight and we weren&#8217;t exactly on top of the province and we heard he has a large army of goats and boxing kangaroos so we thought it best not to bother him. Apparently though he is a great old chap who is getting on now but still stamps your passport before making you drink his home-brew and fight his kangaroos.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-233" title="CoralBay12" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay12.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Another place to note on the way is of course Kalbari which is a small detour to the coast and a place I will be sure to make a halfway stop next time. The seaside town is famous for pristine beaches and great fish and many other things I cannot remember since my last visit was when I was 12. You may think this is a copout but since this is a post about Coral Bay I say you&#8217;ll just have to wait.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-237" title="CoralBay20" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay20.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Driving through the night and keeping each other awake via the two-way radio, we reached a rest stop just outside Carnarvon by sunrise. Rolling out the swags and crashing out for a couple of hours before the morning sun warmed up, we recharged enough for the final leg. I would not recommend tackling the entire drive in one go, even with two drivers as we did on the way back. I will definitely include a stop overnight next time. Having said that, driving at night was largely a good idea, being cooler and quieter on the road, albeit for the kangaroos and foxes. Thankfully though, Fredrico drove up front and alerted us to any wildlife hovering by the roadside, I&#8217;m sure the Holden Viva would have turned in to an accordion if we hit something.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-238" title="CoralBay18" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay18.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Passing through Carnarvon we tried to buy some bananas, the one thing the place is famous for, alas we did not find one farm selling them. Disgruntled and low on potassium we tackled the final stretch to arrive in Coral Bay. This one-street town is like an oasis after the 12 hours of shrubs and to see a pristine beach with ultramarine water makes it all worth while.</p>
<p>There are only a few options when it comes to accommodation in Coral Bay, being the back packers and a couple of caravan parks including the Bayview where options range from tent and caravan spots, to one bed villas up to multi-room dwellings. Prices are reasonable with a one bed villa with small kitchen and living room only $130 AUD per night for 4 adults. The living room has a single bed and trundle but being the bush boy that he is, Fredrico laid his swag out on the floor.</p>
<p>By the time we checked in it was close to 2 o&#8217;clock and over 30 degrees so we went down to the pool in the camp grounds and had a much deserved drink, which we were lucky to have the foresight to bring, since Coral Bay has no bottle shop. Fredrico devised a plan to load the ute up full of cartons on our next trip up here, a kind of black market import business where we can charge outrageous prices for liquor to unprepared campers.</p>
<p>With only a couple of days here in Coral Bay, we grabbed our snorkel gear and headed down to the beach. Ningaloo Reef runs from Coral Bay all the way up to Exmouth around 150kms north and is one of only a few places where the magnificent Whale Shark is known to frequent. Unfortunately for us, this mysterious creature can be found here from March to June so we had to entertain ourselves with the other marine life in the shallow reef off the beach. Parrot fish, Snapper, Stingrays and the odd turtle are frequent inhabitants amongst the giant purple and blue coral and sea grasses. My wife dived straight back into the snorkelling since her last time in Florida almost 18 months ago and calls it: &#8220;the best snorkelling I have ever done&#8221; largely due to the great coral and marine species as well as the reef&#8217;s close proximity to the beach.</p>
<p>Fredrico spent a lot of his time in the water worried about being taken by a tiger shark, especially after a dusk fishing session. Over near the Coral Bay boat ramp, we parked the 4&#215;4 on the rocky headland in a spot we scoped out earlier in the day. The half-metre deep water was teeming with schools of fish that afternoon so we thought it a spot we couldn&#8217;t go wrong. On arrival at sundown, Jen and I followed some kangaroos and wild sheep along the cliff line. Fredrico and Sasha threw a line in and caught a small reef fish in seconds. Fredrico then peed into the shallow water and minutes later the pair witnessed a 1.5 metre tiger shark move in and circle the area below them. When we returned we threw a line in, the sun now set. We spent an hour casting out and received nothing, not even a bite.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-236" title="CoralBay22" alt="" src="http://ardunward.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/coralbay22.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" height="682" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>We returned that night empty-handed, disappointed we were not feasting on the pink snapper we have been diving with, and resort to a diet of Wild Turkey. As any good camping trip needs, we spend the night playing UNO and board games. On our final day we do much the same, snorkelling and soaking up the sun and 30 degree weather. From the shark incident, Fredrico is not the same in the water and is furious when i inform him of my need to go (pee) in the water. With a final swim and no further shark sightings we say goodbye to our friends who continued on to Exmouth.</p>
<p>Coral Bay is an incredible place if you enjoy swimming, snorkelling and sun baking and for Jen (my wife) and I it was the perfect escape no matter how brief. If you need a bit more, Exmouth is the place to go with pubs, restaurants and better fishing. Sasha and Fredrico were lucky enough to witness the turtle egg laying season (January), where they saw 12 turtles slowly crawl on to the beach the second the moon came out. With Coral Bay providing a great escape, I know it will be a place I will return to again perhaps even this whale shark season.</p>
<p>Get in touch when you make it &#8216;down under&#8217; my foreign friends!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to cleaning the kitchen floor, NOTHING works better than a Spencer. I&#8217;ve had many different floor cleaners, and I realize Oreck is a good brand, but come on, let&#8217;s get real here. It doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to a Spencer. Why do I say that? Well, I will enumerate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1. Suction Power</strong><strong>:</strong> A Spencer leaves no crumb unvacuumed. Where an Oreck might miss the crumbs in the corners and under my feet while I&#8217;m cooking, I can always count on my Spencer to find every single one &#8211; whether I&#8217;m standing on it or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Removal of waste: </strong>A Spencer has a self-emptying bag. An Oreck must be emptied periodically to keep it from becoming gorged with floor-gunk, whereas my Spencer empties itself, without my help. But then . . . I do have to remember where it empties, and avoid that area until its contents have solidified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3. Thoroughness: </strong>An Oreck just vacuums up the debris. My Spencer not only sucks up every single crumb in sight, but it also licks up any little grease spots in the process. When my Spencer is finished, the floor looks like it&#8217;s been mopped! Just try to get an Oreck to do that!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4. Storage:</strong> After using an Oreck, it must be put away in the closet. A Spencer puts itself away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5. Trip hazard:</strong> The electrical cord on an Oreck is long and one must be careful not to trip over it. A Spencer is self-propelled. No cords to worry about &#8211; but there may be just the slightest danger of getting rear-ended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6. Cost: </strong>An Oreck is expensive. A Spencer works for Kibbles. And Bits. But mostly Kibbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7. Ease of operation:</strong> I have to push the Oreck around in front of me and direct it toward the item I want picked up. It can be tiring and slow. A Spencer not only is self-propelled (see item #5), but is also extremely fast. My Spencer is fine-tuned to sense where the crumbs and bits of food are about to fall, and can dart in almost before they hit the floor. A couple of times I&#8217;m sure they were caught in mid-air.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Motivation:</strong> An Oreck just sits there, waiting for me to force it into action. My Spencer is ready to work as soon as I get up in the morning, and leads me to the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9. Multi-Use Function: </strong>An Oreck only cleans floors. My Spencer can find crumbs and remove them instantly from floors, beds, couches, shirts, and bathrobes, and can even clean any stray food particles from between my fingers. It would work just as well on faces if I&#8217;d allow that, but that&#8217;s what napkins are for. My Spencer is a floor-cleaner, face-washer, foot-warmer, lap-quilt, intruder-alert, guest-greeter, deer-stalker, and best buddy. Now I ask you, can an Oreck do all that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10.</strong> And finally, unlike a Spencer, <strong>an Oreck has no personality.</strong>  I rest my case.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CB is stalling. It’s time for bed, past time, way past time. Water, snacks, brushing teeth, books, we’ve run the gamut. Now she’s got to go the bathroom. I tell her that I’m going to have to get up early the next morning but that she’ll see me before we go.</p>
<p>CB: “Are you sure? Last time you said that you’d see me but you lied.”</p>
<p>Dad: “ I didn’t lie, hon, I was wrong. There’s a difference. I ran out of time and you weren’t up yet so I had to go. I thought I was going to have time but didn’t.”</p>
<p>She’s chewing on her lip.</p>
<p>Dad: “Ok, hold on, I’ll show you what I mean.”</p>
<p>I go and get a nickel off of the desk in the front room.</p>
<p>Dad: “You know what the heads-or-tails game is?”</p>
<p>CB shakes her head.</p>
<p>Dad: “Ok, on this side, there’s, like always a picture of some famous person, usually a president or something. This guy’s name is Jefferson. That’s the head, you can see his head. On the other side is the tail, could be anything on that side.”</p>
<p>I put the coin on my thumb.</p>
<p>Dad:” Ok, now I guess that it’s going to be heads.”</p>
<p>I flip the coin, it lands. We look. Tails.</p>
<p>Dad: “Ok, tails. Now, was I lying, or was I just wrong?”</p>
<p>She thinks a second.</p>
<p>CB: “You were wrong!”</p>
<p>Dad: “That’s right. Now you try.”</p>
<p>I flip the coin, it lands, I cover it.</p>
<p>Dad: “Heads or tails?”</p>
<p>CB: “Heads!”</p>
<p>Dad: *checks* You’re right! See?”</p>
<p>CB verifies it, has dad flip the coin a couple of more times to watch the flipping and catching process.</p>
<p>She’s ready for bed now.</p>
<p>CB: “Can we play the flipping game a couple more times tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Dad: “Sure hon, we can do that…”</p>
<p>CB: “And maybe it will land on the LYING side!”<a href="http://feralcreatures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/20101013135636.jpg"><img id="i-624" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://feralcreatures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/20101013135636.jpg?w=1014" /></a></p>
