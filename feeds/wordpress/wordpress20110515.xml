			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://josephmallozzi.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sgu15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13917" title="SGU1" src="http://josephmallozzi.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sgu15.jpg?w=300&#038;h=167" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>The ending to Gauntlet that aired was different from the one originally conceived.  Before the script was written, hell, even before the writers sat down to spin the actual story, the original pitch had Young and Rush as the last two men standing.  With one, lone serviceable pod remaining, they argue, then make the decision to let fate decide.  They flip a coin.  Winner makes the sacrifice and stays out; loser goes into stasis.  The coin flip is made and, as it descends, we FADE OUT, not knowing the results.</p>
<p>One of the possibilities this particular ending set up was a season 3 opener which finds Rush, three years later, a little loopy from his time alone.  As he goes through his daily maintenance of the ship&#8217;s systems, he converses with members of the crew who, it turns out, are hallucinations.  Suddenly, the gate activates.  A bewildered Rush hurries to the gate room in time to see Telford lead a rescue op through.  Turns out, after several years, Earth finally acquired a means to dialing Destiny.  Of course, the rescue turns out to be shortlived as it ends up being a hallucination as well when, in the episode&#8217;s final turn, we discover Rush in stasis (he was the one who lost the coin toss), evidently dreaming, while Young maintains the solitary existence as Destiny&#8217;s caretaker.</p>
<p>As cool as the idea was, it was problematic for a number of reasons. First &#8211; sure, someone might go a little batty after spending three years with no human contact, but Rush?  Even though it does turn out to be &#8220;all in his head&#8221;, I have a hard time imagining our antisocial Rush minding all that much being alone to explore Destiny, free of outside interference.  The second problem was that, essentially, the episode was one big stage-weight &#8211; the equivalent to the &#8220;It was all a dream&#8221; short stories your third grade teacher, Mrs. Haversham, used to love so much.  A third problem presented itself in the simple fact that this was to be the third season premiere and, as season premieres went, it was lacking in action.  We discussed moving the stasis reveal to the end of the second act, then, maybe, the end of the first act, but this story still wasn&#8217;t working until we finally found the solution &#8211; which was to not do the story at all and make Eli the one who stays awake.  After all, who better than Eli, the embodiment of our fans and viewers, to make the sacrifice and leave us with that final sense and wonder?</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s the way we wrote it.  And now you want to know how we planned to write our way out of it.  Does Eli fix the pod or does he somehow manage to access enough power to ensure his survival for the length of the jump?  How long does the journey to the next galaxy end up taking?  And what was in store for our crew after the jump?</p>
<p>Search me!  Unlike that imagined season 6 of Atlantis that never came to fruition (check out the AU season that might have been here: <a href="http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/september-30-2008-an-au-season-6/">September 30, 2008: An AU Season 6!</a>), there were no inklings spun, no stories established, no ideas from the previous season that could be moved into the next.  What we had, instead, were a few potential scenarios, vague notions of where we could go.</p>
<p>So, no definite answers for you (sorry) which, as I said in yesterday&#8217;s blog post, isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing as it allows you, the viewer, to envision the ending you prefer.  And, at the end of the day, the conclusion you come up with will be just as legitimate as anything I could throw at you.</p>
<p>But, realistically, there are more than a few of you who go to movies and watch television shows so that you don&#8217;t have to make up your own damn ending! Well, for those of you, this entry hopefully gets you one step closer.  Like I said, it doesn&#8217;t provide any definite answers but, in allowing you some insight into the possible scenarios we were spinning, it hopefully makes it somewhat easier to choose your own adventure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Eli fixes a pod</strong></span></p>
<p>This was one scenario.  Somehow, someway (sorry, don&#8217;t have the details but I&#8217;m sure the solution would have been all sorts of cool &#8211; right, Mr. Scalzi?) Eli manages to fix one of the damaged pods and joins the others in stasis.  He awakens with the rest of the crew anywhere from three to one thousand years later. I jokingly pitched out a scenario in which the crew awakens from stasis with the horrible realization that Eli is not there to greet them and that the pods haven&#8217;t been fixed.  As they mourn their friend, they unseal Chloe&#8217;s stasis pod only to discover both Eli and Chloe inside, spooning (Yes, I was kidding and, no, that wouldn&#8217;t fly)!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Eli taps some hitherto unexploited power reserve which allows him to extend life support for three years</strong></span></p>
<p>Another potential scenario with no firm solution.  Again, it would need to be something a little more clever than Eli awakening Rush three years later and informing him: &#8220;Yeah, I managed to reroute enough power to life support.  How?  Oh, I&#8217;ll tell you later.&#8221;.  In my mind, the solution rested with the lone remaining shuttle.  Given its independent system, Eli could reroute all of Destiny&#8217;s power reserves to maintaining life support with the closed confines of the shuttle and, perhaps, the sealed-off antechamber to the ship where he could store enough food to last him three years.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eli fails to fix the pods or extend life support, so he survives by sitting in the chair and uploading his consciousness to Destiny&#8217;s computer</span></strong></p>
<p>Since this way-out solution would have Eli relinquishing his physical form (in essence, dying), it was an option reserved for a potential movie as we couldn&#8217;t imagine having our hero exist in this form for an entire season.  It would allow him to reunite with Ginn (for another Eli/Ginn reunion scenario, read on) and allow the crew full control of the ship with Eli &#8211; who better? &#8211; as their eyes to all of Destiny&#8217;s systems.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rescue comes in the form of some outside force</span></strong></p>
<p>Another way to go but, potentially, not as satisfying as it takes the solution out of our hero&#8217;s hands.  Maybe -</p>
<p>Over the course of three (+?) years, Earth finally finds a way to dial Destiny and launches a rescue op.  The power source used could be something the combined brilliance of both Samantha Carter and Rodney McKay engineer (if the SGU movie had happened, they would have surely guested, boarding Destiny as part of the retrieval team) or, perhaps former leader Jonas Quinn comes out of early retirement  and &#8211; again with Carter and McKay&#8217;s help &#8211; finds a safe way to dial Destiny from his planet.  As for what other familiar faces from SG-1 and Atlantis would make an appearance &#8211; well, aside from the obvious (Daniel Jackson who certainly wouldn&#8217;t miss this opportunity), it was up in the air.</p>
<p>When Destiny comes up short and drops out of FTL hundreds of years from the next galaxy, rescue comes in the form of a branch of our descendants, an advanced military society that has mastered space flight and is now in possession of a massive armada.  They save us but their motives turn out to be less than honorable as, it turns out, they have designs on Destiny.  This was probably my favorite scenario as I loved the idea of a plausible human military force becoming our third season Big Bad.</p>
<p>Rescue comes in the form of some alien race, maybe remnants of the Ursini or, perhaps, the blueberry aliens who &#8211; now armed with the information they mined from Chloe in Deliverance &#8211; finally seize the opportunity to take Destiny, something they&#8217;ve been trying to do for some time (At one point, we tossed around the idea of our crew coming upon the desiccated remains of an advance alien scouting party in one of the ship&#8217;s unexplored sections but, ultimately, decided against it because we wanted to maintain the idea that, despite repeated attempts, the blueberry aliens were unable to penetrate Destiny&#8217;s automated defenses and gain entry).  There was also talk of salvation coming in the form of a completely new alien species (Brad&#8217;s uber-cool idea), possibly an energy-based race we unwittingly picked up during a refueling stop at a star.  Eli starts glimpsing these entities and assumes, after three years by his lonesome, he is going nuts and hallucinating.  Eventually, the aliens reach out to him and, being energy based, are able to provide the power needed to ensure Destiny complete its journey.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And how long does the journey take?</span></strong></p>
<p>Oh, anywhere from three to roughly one thousand years.  Smart money was on the minimal three year journey which would have allowed our crew to touch base with a fairly unchanged Earth.  A ten year journey would have been more interesting in that it would offer up some great story possibilities as our crew inevitably try to reconnect with loved ones following a decade&#8217;s absence.  Are they still alive?  How have they moved on?  What has changed in their lives? There was even talk of returning to an Earth in the midst of a multi-year war with the Lucian Alliance.  For my part, I preferred the idea that our characters don&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;ve been in stasis and, when they contact Earth, are horrified to discover it&#8217;s been 100+ years.  Their loved ones are long-gone, the lives they led distant memories, and they must adjust to a world very different than the one they left behind.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">And what was in store for our crew once the jump had been completed?</span></strong></p>
<p>Again, a number of potential developments were floated.  Initially, when we were thinking in terms of a third season, I very much liked the idea of Colonel Telford leading a resupply mission through the gate. Earth had finally secured a power source that would allow them to dial Destiny.  Maybe it was a one-way trip because Destiny would still be ham-strung by the inability to dial Earth without explosive consequences or, on the other hand, Telford and co. bring the portable power source with them and allow some of the civilians to leave, establishing a stronger military presence on board.</p>
<p>Later, when it became clear that a third season wasn&#8217;t in the cards, Brad floated the idea of two movies: The first would focus on a rescue op that would see several familiar faces (Carter, McKay, Daniel Jackson among the first few mentioned) coming aboard Destiny and, ultimately, helping our crew fend off the advances of the previously mentioned human military race.  The second would have been a solo adventure that would have seen our crew finally completing Destiny&#8217;s mission (Sorry.  No details available on this one.  Brad and Robert had a mind-blowing idea for the series/franchise wrap-up and, in deference to them, I&#8217;ll keep my mouth shut and allow them to one day reveal their master plan).</p>
<p>We probably would have found a cure for T.J.&#8217;s condition &#8211; but only eventually.  I liked the idea of one of our main characters having to face her mortality, perhaps even exhibiting early signs of physical deterioration that forces their friends and loved ones to face the sad prospect as well.  If we were going to cure her (and, again, that was the most likely scenario) I would have lobbied to play out T.J.&#8217;s battle with ALS over the course of a season at least.</p>
<p>In similar fashion, I would have preferred to keep Park blind for an extended stretch as well.  It&#8217;s something you rarely see on television and something I really wanted to emphasize in Gauntlet (when she comes up with the idea of using the shuttle as a decoy), that despite the loss of her sight, she can continue to be a strong and productive member of the crew.</p>
<p>So who would T.J. have ended up with?  Young or Varro?  I don&#8217;t know. I honestly don&#8217;t think this would have ever been resolved.  If it was up to me, she would have ended up with Varro.  If it was up to Carl and most everyone else, she and Young would have lived happily ever after. In retrospect, it might have been better for the character if, in the end, she elected to say no to both and embrace her independence.</p>
<p>What about Ginn and Perry?  Was Hope the last we&#8217;d ever see of them? Certainly not.  At episode&#8217;s end, they were quarantined, not deleted from the database. At some point, Eli would have no doubt found a way to address any potential threat and re-upload them to Destiny&#8217;s mainframe.  That was one possibility. Another deliciously diabolical idea Brad came up with would have been a huge game-changer.  In this scenario, Eli goes to awaken the crew from stasis and discovers Chloe&#8217;s pod has been damaged.  She is almost brain dead and fading fast.  In a desperate, last ditch effort to save her, Eli downloads Ginn&#8217;s consciousness into her body.  Would he tell the others what he has done or would Eli attempt to maintain the subterfuge?  What effect will this have on the rest of the crew, especially Scott who has effectively lost Chloe but will always be reminded of what he had.  And how will he react to the sight of the body of his former love, now permanently occupied by Ginn, re-establishing a relationship with Eli?  This would have been huge and, I think, an awesome opportunity for the immensely talented Elyse Levesque to switch gears to play a completely different character.</p>

<p>Lisa R writes: &#8220; would appreciate everyone’s thoughts and prayers tomorrow. Hubby’s contract job ended today, but all is not lost. He has a second phone interview for a permanent job in CT tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Fingers crossed for you and hubby, Lisa.  Please keep us posted!</p>
<p>sg1efc writes: &#8220;Suppose you had some free time (of course I don’t know where you’d get such free time, lots of laughs) and wanted to write up an appropriate ending yourself. Is that something you might try in the future and I assume you would you need to get clearance from MGM? If you did want to write an ending and did get MGM approval, would you ask the others to contribute writing the end as a collaboration&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: The answers to those questions lie with MGM.  Only they can decide when to revive the franchise, under what circumstances, and who would be involved.</p>
<p>sg1efc writes: &#8220;My white german shepherd is getting his toe amputated at the knuckle tomorrow, cancer ate the bone away. <img src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif?m=1268498784g" alt=":(" /> Have to wait and see if it is malignant or not from the biopsy. :-/&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Best of luck to your dog.  Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>SG-UNIVERSE writes: &#8220;Maybe Stargate Universe return in 3 years ? Maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Sorry.  That&#8217;s not going to happen.  Even though we&#8217;d struck the SG-1 and Atlantis sets, I still held out hope for both movies because, in the case of Stargate: Revolution, the lionshare of the action would have been off-world and ship-based while, in the case of Stargate: Extinction, although there was some action on Atlantis itself (eminently achievable through the magic of VFX), much of the story takes place on Earth and off-world.  In the case of Universe, however, most of the action would take place on the Destiny set which is in the process of being de-rigged as a I write this.  Tanja, back at the production offices, reports that Stage 5 that once held the SGC and, later, Icarus Base, now sits empty.  Sad.</p>
<p>SG-UNIVERSE writes: &#8220;On the Official Stargate Website, no Behind the scenes &amp; FX pics from your episode “The Hunt”. Why ? Where they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Don&#8217;t know.  Maybe you should contact their webmaster to find out what&#8217;s up.</p>
<p>flo writes: &#8220;1/Was the odissey’s secret mission from EATG a plan for something ? stargate revolution?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Initially, Odyssey&#8217;s secret mission was tied to the search for a naquadria-rich planet capable of providing the energy needed to dial Destiny.</p>
<p>flo also writes: &#8220;Did you plan a stargate reveal at some point ? Ever since it was planned to happened at the end of “Lost City” then cancelled when SG1 was renewed, i’ve always hoped we would see it at some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: This subject (the revelation and its many implications) would have formed the plot for the planned SG-1 movie, Stargate: Revolution.</p>
<p>Flor also writes: &#8220;If i remember correctly, Air takes place a few weeks after EATG, meaning early 2009. That makes Gauntlet early 2010.<br />
Was that a clever plan in order to accomodate the 3 years gap ?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Nope.</p>
<p>Chris L. writes: &#8220;I still wonder where Franklin went.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Franklin was subsumed by the ship, his engrams (brain patterns) incorporated into the mainframe to form the default for the ship&#8217;s developing A.I. Which is why, unlike Ginn or Perry, he is not so much Franklin as he is an emotionless embodiment of Destiny itself.</p>
<p>Maria writes: &#8220;You once said something along the lines of ‘Stargate Sg-1 was offered an 11th season but…’ I was just wondering what the ‘but’ was and why they weren’t taken up on the offer. Will the Stargate World’s game ever be released? Off of the set, what was your favorite moment on Stargate? Also, which was your favorite episode (or top five) out of all three series?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: We pursued the possibility of producing an eleventh season of SG-1 for an alternate platform but, in the end, were unable to reach a deal that made financial sense for the parties involved.  Alas, I know nothing about the Stargate World&#8217;s game.  My favorite off-set moments on Stargate?  The great time I had with my co-workers on a daily basis.  My favorite Stargate episodes?  This list may need to be updated but the last time I thought about it: <a href="http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/august-15-2010-my-top-10-favorite-stargate-episodes/">August 15, 2010: MY Top 10 Favorite Stargate Episodes</a></p>
<p>Expletive:BMP writes: &#8220;Joe, will Eli Ascend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Eventually?  Sure, it&#8217;s possible, but that wasn&#8217;t one of the scenarios we had planned for the show&#8217;s third season.</p>
<p>MG writes: &#8220;It’s said that a picture speaks a thousand words.. I am hoping you have something with which to counter to the following&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I put your comment in moderation because I suspected this was faked.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have an HD copy of the episode with me in Toronto and the versions I accessed online are too dark.  I sent word back West for what I believed would be proof discrediting the still. After all, I figured, would someone be so stupid/ignorant to do something like this and think no one would eventually notice?  Well, it pains me to report that it isn&#8217;t a fake.  And so, as one of the show&#8217;s Exec. Producers and the one on the front lines of the internet, it falls on me to offer an apology to all of our French fans who have been nothing short of fantastic in their support of the franchise.  I am, and you&#8217;ll excuse me as I go off here, mighty pissed-off as, not only someone who has appreciated the French support our show and this blog have enjoyed over the years, but someone who grew up in Montreal, a multicultural and bilingual city, speaking French from fourth grade on.</p>
<p>How the hell did we miss it?  No excuses.  I don&#8217;t know.  In the past, certain things have gotten past us.  There was the infamous Snickers bar in SGA&#8217;s The Ark.  There was the boom mike in SGU&#8217;s Space.  And, most memorable of all, was the camera operator in the SGA season four premiere that we only noticed during the Day 2 mix &#8211; and only because eagle-eyed Martin Gero was the one to suddenly notice &#8211; in the opening scene, a bunch of medical equipment sweeps by followed by Weir on the gurney and, finally the camera operator bringing up the rear!  In the case of this incident, we missed it and I&#8217;m sorry.  Paul suspects that the reason it got by everyone is that the shot is actually a visual effect and that, whenever we watched it, rather than taking in other aspects of the room, we were focusing on the set extension behind the approaching Chloe to make sure it worked &#8211; thereby missing what was right in front of us.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m pissed-off and also extremely disappointed that: a) fans were offended and b) this taints an otherwise noteworthy episode.  At present, I have no idea who was responsible but, in the event the guilty party frequents this blog (or someone who knows the guilty party frequents this blog and would be kind enough to pass this along), I&#8217;d like to say: &#8220;Seriously?  The fucking series finale?  Thanks a lot, douchebag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don Matthews writes: &#8220;He has made progress on TJ’s ALS, enough so to create a treatment to slow the progression of it. Maybe he creates an interface for Lisa that lets her see via Kino transmission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Damn, Don.  Those are both excellent ideas.</p>
<p>Rob writes: &#8220;So, as an avid fan of space-based sci-fi, where do I turn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Our comic book series, Dark Matter (<a href="http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/may-10-2011-thanks-for-the-thanks-transporter-the-series-my-comic-book-series/">May 10, 2011: Thanks for the thanks!

<p>Ponytail writes: &#8220;Even though I loved seeing them all together like a family and actually enjoying each other, I couldn’t help but think whoever is left out of a stasis pod could use that food. Did they really need to eat before entering stasis?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: At the time, they didn&#8217;t know anyone would be left out.</p>
<p>Tanith writes: &#8220;Can you at least tell us what the outcome of “The Mission” was intended to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: As I already mentioned in this entry, that&#8217;s a story for Brad and/or Robert to tell.</p>
<p>dasNdanger writes: &#8220;Joe, I think I love this idea from Dreaded Anomaly over on the Benbo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eli to Young: “I’m smarter than him. And all three of us know it.”</p>
<p>Rush isn’t just defined by his intelligence, though; it’s his Machiavellian use of it. What if Eli started down that same path? He’s standing on the balcony smiling because he’s got everyone right where he wants them.</p>
<p>Eli’s had total control of the drones since he brought that one on to the ship. He’s kept them attacking Destiny, but not destroying it, so that everyone would have no choice but to follow his plan and get into the stasis pods. One of them “happened” to malfunction, so he wouldn’t have to go into stasis.</p>
<p>Of course, one might wonder how he was able to control the drone attacks while simultaneously fighting them off. But the answer’s simple: he has an accomplice, Ginn. He didn’t keep her program in quarantine; he just wanted everyone to think that, so she could carry out her part of the plan covertly.</p>
<p>Now, with a drone army and control of Destiny, he can reawaken the crew members that he likes, turn Destiny around, and start taking over the galaxy, with the infrastructure created by the civilization that his alternate self built.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Answer: A very cool twist &#8211; but not really our Eli.</p>
<p>kimmy writes: &#8220;Again, we see Col Young working himself ragged&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: That&#8217;s what I wanted to play on in this episode, the fact that things are catching up with the seemingly tireless Colonel Young.  He&#8217;s exhausted and, right off the bat, Wray notices and admonishes him, suggesting he get some sleep.  Well, at episode&#8217;s end, he finally does get that long-awaited opportunity to rest his weary bones.</p>
<p>Chris L writes: &#8220;Do you have any photos of the sets you can share with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;ve posted plenty of behind-the-scene pics over the past four years.  Just peruse this blog&#8217;s archives.</p>
<p>Carl writes: &#8220;And has our canadian dollar value had any impact on doing or not doing the movies (SG1, SGA, SGU)?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: That may have hampered us had we received the green light, but I believe the state of dvd sales is what really impacted the movies.</p>
<p>Brian C writes: &#8220;A number of shows have continued their Story in comic book form, Star Trek, Jericho, and Buffy to name a few fan favorites. The numbers on these comics look good do you think the studio would accept this as a low cost high gain way of continuing the series?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Again, I can&#8217;t speak for the studio.  If the sales figures on the pre-existing Stargate comic books make this an attractive proposition, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s something they&#8217;ll consider.</p>
<p>Rachael writes: &#8220;And can I ask again, please, if the set/lot used for Terminus was same set/lot used for Sateda?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;ll have to double-check but I believe so &#8211; Terminal City.</p>
<p>shiloh writes: &#8220;Now – you hinted at telling us some spoilers about the SG movie Extinction – how about the Atlantis movie too?? Pretty please?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Well, since you asked nicely, I&#8217;ll tell you all about Stargate: Extinction next week.</p>
<p>David Knowles writes: &#8220;So Joe you are going back on your word, you said a few weeks ago that you would answer the fan questions. [...]  I can now understand at least some of the hate mail you receive especially when you go back on your word in such an obvious way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Uh, I never said I wasn&#8217;t going to answer fan questions (especially since I asked for them).  I was simply pointing out that, regardless of the answers I provide, they won&#8217;t be canon and, at the end of the day, bear no more import than any alternate answers provided by you at home.</p>
<p>Lloyd 67 writes: &#8220;Hello, do you think that if DVD sales of Season 2 of SGU are good, a film production is feasible?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: At this point, I&#8217;m sorry to say, no.</p>
<p>Escyos writes: &#8220;How exactely did the Priors get to the Milky way, did they just create wormholes out of nothing, did they create stargates when DJ and Vala arrived or were there always gates in their galaxy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Don&#8217;t recall if we ever discussed this.  It&#8217;s a question for Rob Cooper.</p>
<p>JimFromJersey writes: &#8220;Besides the obvious dramatic elements, why couldn’t Eli complete the Novus Archive data transfer from the safety of Destiny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: The conceit was that the transfer had to be initiated and maintained from the send point and I had no problem with that.  One of my biggest pet peeves is convenience, strokes of luck that end up benefiting our character.  On the other hand, I don&#8217;t mind complications that make our hero&#8217;s life difficult. The former is lazy writing.  The second is good drama.</p>
<p>Italian fan! writes: &#8220;NON FACENDO NULLA PER SALVARE STARGATE, HAI TRADITO TUTTI I FANS!&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Everything we could do to save the series was done. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s out of our hands.</p>
<p>stryse writes: &#8220;It’s been suggested in a couple of places that SGU should return to the air in about three years… Obviously extremely unlikely (I don’t accept impossible in anything, but what is probable is another story).. but still… how cool would that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Cool but not very realistic I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<p>Tammy Dixon writes: &#8220;It’s exciting to read about the comic book project. You said that it was more fun than TV. How so? Will you get to stay in Vancouver if you do comics exclusively?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: At this point, it&#8217;s a very different animal but, creatively, just as fulfilling.  As for where I&#8217;ll be next year &#8211; who knows!  We&#8217;ll be finishing up production on the first season of Transporter: The Series winter of 2011.  I have no doubt it will get a second season.  Whether I&#8217;ll be part of that second year remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Tammy Dixon also writes: &#8220;When does <em>Transporter</em> premiere?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I don&#8217;t we have a premiere date yet.  Stay tuned!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post in this series, I wrote about <a href="http://blog.avigerver.com/2011/05/09/how-i-became-a-professional-photographer-and-what-i-saw-along-the-way-my-first-photo/" target="_blank">the first photo I ever took</a>. At age 7, it was literally the first time I pushed the shutter release on a camera. For the next several years, I would take pictures occasionally, probably in no greater numbers than my peers. I wasn&#8217;t particularly excited by photography, but just as for anyone else, it was an efficient way to document special occasions.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my freshman year at Brookline High School (just outside Boston), at age 14, I needed to decide what elective to take the following fall semester. On a whim, I chose Photography I, taught by Leon Kestenbaum (or Mr. K, as he was known). That September, one of our assignments (if I recall correctly) was to photograph a single subject in many different ways. Armed with one of my grandfather&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buhla.de/Foto/Konica/eATHaupt.html" target="_blank">Konica Autoreflex T cameras</a>, I set out onto the streets of Boston in search of inspiration. I came across the John Hancock Tower, the city&#8217;s tallest skyscraper, near Copley Square. I began to take dozens of photos from as many different angles as I could think of (mostly with a <a href="http://www.buhla.de/Foto/Konica/Objektive/e28_35Hexar.html" target="_blank">28mm f3.5 lens</a>). When looking over the contact sheets days later, one image in particular stood out as one I needed to print immediately:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4228" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;" title="JohnHancockTower1997" src="http://avigerver.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/johnhancocktower1997.jpg?w=409&#038;h=600" alt="" width="409" height="600" /></p>
<p>This instantly became my favorite photo and I held it on that pedestal for at least a year. It inspired me to put 100% of my effort behind trying to create images that matched it, and I can trace it as the likely source of my passion for photography. Why was I so attached to that image? For one, it reminded me of a photo I might see hanging on someone&#8217;s wall. The fact that I could picture it placed somewhere other than in a personal photo album was a thrill. Also, it was sharp, and I mean tack sharp. Every little window pane leading all the way to the top of the building was easily discernible. I was a sucker for sharp photos back then, and that hasn&#8217;t changed to this day. Finally, I distinctly remember the interesting way the image gradually appeared in the darkroom development tray each time I printed it. Because any image in a dimly lit darkroom initially appears in a cloudy pattern as the developer washes over the paper, I was never really sure how much more intense the clouds in this photo might get as a result of the burning and dodging I had done at the enlarger. I loved, and was possibly in love with, this photo.</p>
<p>On a sad note, at some point later in high school my mother put a stack of heavy books on my sheets of John Hancock Tower negatives, and the one and only negative that got creased was my treasured image. It was probably for the best.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes one of the most difficult problems people face is actually putting aside the time to work. People often attempt to multi-task multiple projects at one time while simultaneously juggling email, Twitter, etc. Frankly, it&#8217;s an incredibly ineffective method in which to conduct your work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long preferred a system of time management known as the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a task to be accomplished</li>
<li>Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)</li>
<li>Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper</li>
<li>Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)</li>
<li>Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignleft" title="t" src="http://freegraphicsart.com/wp-content/uploads/realistic-Tomato-vector" alt="" width="290" height="313" />The method&#8217;s brilliance is in its simplicity. Instead of some complex system of time management, you merely choose one task, turn off email / Twitter / other distractions around you, and work on it non-stop for 25 minutes. Take a short break, rinse &amp; repeat.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The name Pomodoro comes from the  Italian word for tomato. The creator of the method, <a href="http://www.francescocirillo.com/fc.html">Francesco Cirillo</a>, had an egg timer in the shape of a tomato and came up with the concept while studying as a student in Rome. Hence, the Pomodoro Technique. If you want to learn more, the entire theory behind the method <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">is available for free</a> (PDF link).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Since you probably don&#8217;t have an egg timer sitting around the office, you can just <a href="http://e.ggtimer.com/pomodoro">click here</a>. It&#8217;s a web-based 25/5 countdown timer.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Give it a try, I bet you&#8217;ll be surprised by the amount of work you are able to accomplish with it.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve got lots of pictures coming up, so I will keep the introduction short. In a nutshell: We were going to the Strawberry Festival, Festa Frawli in Mgarr, we had to change buses in Mosta and there we happened to find a lot of classic cars&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Classic-cars-Mosta by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607322682/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5607322682_cb92bdde76.jpg" alt="Classic-cars-Mosta" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s start with a line-up&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Ford-bird by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606701753/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5606701753_0075a6d5e2.jpg" alt="Ford-bird" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>This little birdie was on a Ford, why don&#8217;t they have them any more?</em></p>
<p><a title="Plymouth-Mosta-Dome by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606710961/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5606710961_5a49fb3f26.jpg" alt="Plymouth-Mosta-Dome" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Love how you can see the Mosta Dome reflected in this Plymouth&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Jag-350-Mosta by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606731367/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5606731367_63e9cc84a0.jpg" alt="Jag-350-Mosta" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>OK so the picture is only so so, but look at the number plate!</em></p>
<p><a title="Maltese-crest-front-of-car by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607303662/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5021/5607303662_faf1f671d4.jpg" alt="Maltese-crest-front-of-car" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>You can&#8217;t help but wonder what the name of the owner of this car is&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Man-looking-at-engine by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606722923/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5066/5606722923_e08af82f8a.jpg" alt="Man-looking-at-engine" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Not quite sure what he can see through there, I really should have asked&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Back-of-classic-cars-Mosta by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607331810/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5105/5607331810_39a2e1f799.jpg" alt="Back-of-classic-cars-Mosta" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>You can&#8217;t just take a picture of the front of the cars&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Other-classic-cars-Mosta by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607341914/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5607341914_0414a6534f.jpg" alt="Other-classic-cars-Mosta" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Unless you can&#8217;t be bothered to walk all the way to the back&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Flower-Bee by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606766769/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5304/5606766769_2f6a96309f.jpg" alt="Flower-Bee" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>There was lots of traffic so we got off the bus to walk, this would have been faster if I didn&#8217;t have a camera&#8230; This bee decided to land on the flower just as I was taking pictures of it, I&#8217;m not complaining&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Artichokes by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607355976/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5607355976_bb405a4031.jpg" alt="Artichokes" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Artichokes are cool! End of&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Flowering-trees-Mgarr by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606787743/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5606787743_32423a22e9.jpg" alt="Flowering-trees-Mgarr" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>I really need to find out what sort of tree this is&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Festa-poster by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606806301/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5606806301_ea8613e88c.jpg" alt="Festa-poster" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>We got there in the end!</em></p>
<p><a title="Cupcakes-Festa-Frawli by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607379250/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5141/5607379250_be32216427.jpg" alt="Cupcakes-Festa-Frawli" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>They had cupcakes too&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="More-cupcakes by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607387350/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5607387350_1db2b11305.jpg" alt="More-cupcakes" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>A lot&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Strawberries by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606814009/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5606814009_1c456cbe00.jpg" alt="Strawberries" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p><em>And they had strawberries&#8230;</em> <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><a title="Add-&amp;-Alt-Mgarr by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607407468/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5607407468_4ac79c3672.jpg" alt="Add-&amp;-Alt-Mgarr" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>True to form I started to take pictures of random stuff&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Door-Mgarr by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606826253/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5606826253_1b6c337aba.jpg" alt="Door-Mgarr" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>And doors, what a surprise&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Wires-Mgarr by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606829967/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5606829967_22890206eb.jpg" alt="Wires-Mgarr" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah, wires&#8230; I liked the contrast the pole makes with the sky, the sort of orangey tinge makes for an almost complimentary contrast&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Still-life-with-Cisk-&amp;-Santana by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607420586/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5026/5607420586_ff0c01aabd.jpg" alt="Still-life-with-Cisk-&amp;-Santana" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>I call this composition &#8220;Still life with Cisk &amp; Carlos Santana&#8221;&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Rusty-lock by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606840325/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5606840325_11da208aa2.jpg" alt="Rusty-lock" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>A rusty lock&#8230; Uhm yeah I liked the look of it&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Pods-on-a-tree by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607434360/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5223/5607434360_404724c64b.jpg" alt="Pods-on-a-tree" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Pretty flowers&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Plants-in-a-paintpot by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607437016/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5607437016_0ecc7e2a8b.jpg" alt="Plants-in-a-paintpot" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Thrifty!!!</em></p>
<p><a title="Classic-car-in-action by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606858163/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5226/5606858163_38c045067a.jpg" alt="Classic-car-in-action" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s one of the classic cars out and about, the man inside actually made the car even cooler!</em></p>
<p><a title="Facade-Mosta by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607450564/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5607450564_a485dc289e.jpg" alt="Facade-Mosta" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>I like the fact that some of the decorations on this house was on the underside, makes perfect sense really as you mainly look up on it from the underside&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="47-&amp;-Flowers by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5606872583/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5606872583_47658d61ab.jpg" alt="47-&amp;-Flowers" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Then I spotted this pretty fence as we were walking home from the bus stop&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a title="Flowers-columns by Orange&amp;Green, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orangeandgreen/5607464962/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5607464962_54967a96cc.jpg" alt="Flowers-columns" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><em>Something about the combination of these columns and the flowers appealed to me&#8230;</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I lay in bed at night with the lights off and watch the airplanes go by. I see their lights in the distance and I watch as they get closer and closer, sometimes even lighting up my bedroom. (They must be some very powerful lights.) I love living this close to an airport. I find airplanes to be romantic. I wonder about where the people are coming from and where they&#8217;re going. The idea of just getting on a plane and going anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved airports. I&#8217;m really looking forward to warmer weather so I can go to the park by the airport, ride my bike over there, sit and watch. I&#8217;ve heard BWI still has an observation deck that anyone can get to without going through security. I want to check it out. Can you imagine what it would be like in the rain? If I&#8217;m not worrying about my luggage getting wet, then I can really get to enjoy that scene. (I have been at the airport while it was pouring. While I wanted to sit there and watch, my bag got completely drenched, along with everything inside it.) No trips are planned for this year, so watching other people take them will have to do.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I just looked up the definition of romantic. I knew I was romantic, but didn&#8217;t realize I fit everything in it.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">romantic |rōˈmantik; rə-|</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> adjective</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> 1. inclined toward or suggestive of the feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> • relating to love, esp. in a sentimental or idealized way</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">The thesaurus says..<br />
romantic:<br />
adjective-<br />
passionate,  idealistic, idealized, romanticized, unrealistic, fanciful, impractical; head-in-the-clouds, starry-eyed, optimistic, hopeful, visionary, Utopian, fairy-tale. ANTONYMS practical, realistic.<br />
noun-<br />
an incurable romantic: idealist, sentimentalist, romanticist; dreamer, visionary, Utopian, fantasist, fantasizer. ANTONYMS realist.</span></p>
<p>Yes. Yes, that is me. The poor men in my life.</p>
<p>The first three are to and from Las Vegas, with the Grand Canyon and Rocky Mountains below. The fourth one is at the Providence airport from my trip to Newport, Rhode Island. The last one is on the way home from there, high above the clouds where it&#8217;s always sunny.</p>

<p>From: Jamie Oswald<br />
Sent: Thursday, April 29, 2004 2:30 PM<br />
Subject: Last Night<br />
 <br />
After much fanfare and bally-hoo, I got engaged last night.  No date is set, probably sometime around next May.<br />
 <br />
As a disclaimer, it may get cutesy below, so if you aren’t into that sort of thing, you should stop reading…now.<br />
 <br />
To start out, I should say that Becca is romantic, and I am not.  Our entire relationship is basically like that video for “Opposites Attract” with Paula Abdul and the animated cat.  Knowing this, we had been talking about getting married for a while, and I, knowing that I would have a great propensity for screwing up all things romantic, made her promise me that if I asked and it wasn’t perfect, then she should tell me, and I would ask again.  I figure it isn’t that big of a deal for me (I just want to be engaged to her) and I really want her to have the kind of memory of this event that she wants.  Plus, I figure, if I screw it up once or twice, it will be that much better a story for the grandkids.  I can’t really explain anymore what I did next; all I know is that it seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.<br />
 <br />
Let’s break momentarily and let me give all of you who may one day consider proposing on a golf course a couple of words of advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you’re dating Annika Sorenstam, don’t propose on a golf course.  Ever.</li>
<li>If you are standing behind her at the tee with the ring, and she shanks it, you should abort the mission and go to secondary protocol.</li>
<li>If you can’t spit anything out that sounds even remotely sweet, pretend like you have something in your eye and try again later.</li>
<li>If you go ahead and propose anyway, and she says “Yeah” and then asks for another ball, go ahead and drown yourself in the nearest water hazard.</li>
<li>Finally, don’t ever propose on a golf course.  It may be unique, but sweating and cussing for 2 hours beforehand isn’t nearly as romantic as it may at first seem.<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<p>To make a long story considerably shorter, we immediately talked about my indecent proposal and decided that wasn’t the right way, so, true to her word, Becca kept her promise (and I had made her promise), and I took the ring back.  I am still very, very happy about that decision.  Grandkids’ story: check.<br />
 <br />
Now, having to propose twice presents one especially interesting logistical obstacles.  It is impossible to surprise her.  She knows it is coming, she is antsy, she has seen the ring, and she wants it.  So, you have to balance out holding her off and coming up with a way to get to a romantic spot without her thinking it is for a proposal.  This is where my mother came in.  She gave birth to me on a very convenient date 27 years ago yesterday.  Thanks, Mom!  So, I had an excuse to have her out, and have reservations, and get a private room at said restaurant.  I also asked her three different times what we were doing on the 29th, which is the day after my birthday, which was nice, because she did not see anything coming on the 28th.  So, after working with her family, the restaurant, and my jeweler for 3 days on it, it was finally go time.<br />
 <br />
We went to dinner at Rich and Charlie’s, an Italian restaurant out by where she lives.  We walked in, I said I had reservations and it was my birthday, so they led us into the back room.  At this point, all I had to do was keep it together until the show started.  The waiter came in and got us some drinks, and I proceeded to “not be able to decide” what I wanted for what seemed like an eternity.  Finally, he brought in a vase with nothing but greens in it and set it on the table.  Becca thought it was weird, but assumed that they had just forgotten our center piece.  I had her right where I wanted her.  A minute or two later, he came back in with a ring box and a red rose.  He knelt down and gave her the box.  Right now, reading her face, I can tell she’s thinking, “He’s having the waiter propose to me, I should have just said yes on the golf course.”  Inside the ring box was no ring, however, just a note.  A minute later, another server came in with a box and a flower and another note.  Then another server, and another server, all with little notes like “I adore you,” “You amaze me,” or “I love your butt.”  After 6 servers came in, her brother’s girlfriend Valerie came in with a box and a flower.  Then Becca’s Mom’s husband Ed came in.  Then her brother Zak.  Then her brother Sam. And finally her mom.  Her mom came in with two roses and gave me the white one.  After Becca had opened this last box, I got down on one knee, gave her the last rose, which had a note on it asking the big question, and I let her open the ring box with the actual ring.  She said yes.  Or possibly “yep” (there is some confusion), but the second time around definitely took.  We all had dinner together and had a great time.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I just want to say that I’m really glad that we didn’t just stop with the golf course.  This is a much better memory, and story, and I love her to death and just want for us to make each other happy for the rest of our lives.  I know I’ve been kind of rough on those of you were already married or engaged, but now that I have found that perfect someone for myself I completely understand.<br />
 <br />
And, if you think I’m a big girl now because I got all sappy, at least I warned you at the top.<br />
 <br />
Love you, Jamie</p>
<p><em>So there you have it. A bit of nostalgia, a bit of romance, and a bit of me being too lazy to create new content.</em></p>

<p>From yesterday&#8217;s birthday poem to a cartoon of AMBIDEXTROUS rings on two fists. Inspired by the LOVE and HATE rings worn by Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) in  Spike Lee&#8217;s <em>Do The Right Thing</em>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zgzp83dL1E" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has a video of Radio explaining the interaction of the two, the story of left hand and right hand, of good and evil. I&#8217;m not ambidextrous, but I&#8217;m impressed by people who are.</p>

<p>When Sur La Table is selling a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-ICE-20R-2-Quart-Automatic-Frozen/dp/B0001540DW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303188304&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Cuisinart ice cream machine</a> for $37 (including tax, which is now 10.25% in Santa Monica, by the way) one is not allowed to say no. Los Angeles&#8217; hot, humid weather and the fact that we had just finished a gallon of Dreyer&#8217;s vanilla ice cream recently assured me that my decision to buy yet another appliance would only bring me true, everlasting happiness. When blackberries are 2 boxes for $4 at Ralphs, one has no excuse to not eat antioxidant and flavanoid-rich fruit. Clearly, these were forces beyond my control. I was only doing the right thing.</p>
<p>This post is about a blackberry ice cream that is perfectly rich and unbelievably smooth. It&#8217;s the kind of the ice cream that is so wonderful that it may prevent me from purchasing ice cream elsewhere.</p>
<p><span id="more-767"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-771" title="blackberry3" src="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry3.png?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Fun fact about me: I did a science project in high school about antioxidant activity in blackberries. I used paper chromatography and actually separated the dark purple pigment into different bands of color! Granted, I had the guidance of a friend&#8217;s mother who ran a very prestigious lab around UCSD, but I did end up presenting at the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair as a sophomore, winning first place in the chemistry category, a handful of cash scholarships, and &#8220;Sweepstakes Runner-Up.&#8221; Considering that I now study art history and can barely distinguish an isotope from an isosceles triangle (kidding!) I definitely consider that time to be the apex of my scientific career.</p>
<p><a href="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-772" title="blackberry4" src="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry4.png?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>For the time being, I&#8217;m going to stick with ice cream chemistry. It&#8217;s the only kind of chemistry that won&#8217;t make me wear dorky goggles or balance reactants and reagents. I would get an A+ in ice cream chemistry.</p>
<p><a href="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-773" title="blackberry2" src="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry2.png?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>When I took this picture, I scooped just a little ice cream into my bowl. I clearly left most of it in the glass pan for Stephen, because I&#8217;m so generous like that. It&#8217;s ridiculously hard to share good ice cream. Especially when it&#8217;s so pretty. If I could make, package, and sell this ice cream, I would call it <strong>Blackberry Blush</strong>. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d also get a good make-up line out of this!</p>
<p><a href="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-768" title="blackberry1" src="http://kraftedbykelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/blackberry1.png?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>After freezing the newly made ice cream overnight, the consistency is lush and rich, just sweet enough to enhance the natural blackberry flavor with a pleasant, yet insistent tartness that makes the flavor stand out.</p>
<p>Just in time for some late April heat, this ice cream is definitely going to carry me through my upcoming weeks of midterms!</p>
<p><strong>Blackberry Ice Cream (From <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Blackberry-Ice-Cream">Saveur.com</a>)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 1⁄2 cups whole milk</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 egg yolks</li>
<li>1 1⁄2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 1⁄4 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1 pint fresh blackberries</li>
<li>Juice of 1⁄2 lemon (We used a whole lemon)</li>
</ul>
<div>I would follow the directions on their site for the entire process. The only thing I would like to add: I would recommend adding a little extra sugar to the blackberries when combining it with lemon juice to create a thick, jam-like slurry of blackberries.</div>
