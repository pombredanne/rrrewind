				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have noticed that it’s shark week on the Discovery Channel, that week when we celebrate the most ferocious beast on planet Earth. For 25 years now, the Discovery Channel has been bringing us a combination of fun, educational, and terrifying documentaries about sharks. And it’s a great public service they perform, too, since, 1 out of every 500 million people die every year from shark attacks.</p>
<p>To put that in some perspective that means that if the US follows the world trend, that’s about 1 lost American citizen every other year! Of course, the US doesn’t usually follow world trends. In 2011, a third of the world’s shark attacks occurred in the US. Most American shark attacks occur in Florida, a state that (appropriately) serves as home to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), an organization responsible for authenticating and documenting suspected shark attacks. It makes sense then that the state of Florida has shark attack emergency response down to a science. In 2011, eleven authenticated shark attacks occurred off the Florida coast resulting in zero lost lives.</p>
<p>So I guess what I’m saying is that you probably won’t be killed by a shark, and, more importantly, if you are, then my odds go way down. In fact, according to Mythbuster Jamie Hyneman, “You’re more likely to be killed by: a hot dog, a regular dog, a pig, a horse, a toilet, a vending machine, a black Friday stampede, a lightning strike, a bed, an ant, a game of football, or a roller coaster.”<br />
But even under the shadow of this overwhelmingly non threatening bunch of (possibly made up) statistics, we somehow remain obsessed with these creatures.</p>
<p>Why is that? The answer is fame.</p>
<p>Think about it. The odds of an individual getting gnawed on by a shark (let alone dying from it) might as well be about a gazillion to one, which means if you’re one of the few (thanks to the Discovery Channel) you are instantly famous, meaning you might have an entire 15-minute segment of one documentary devoted to your story.</p>
<p>But the shark attack rocket to fame predates Shark Week. The first well-documented case of a shark attack comes from 1749, when 14-year-old Brook Watson, sailor on one of his uncle’s merchant ships (and later a member of British Parliament and Lord Mayor of London), was attacked while swimming in the Harbor of Havana. The shark came at him twice, the first time biting off a chunk of his right calf, and the second, taking off the foot on the same leg. Crewmembers managed to pull Watson to safety, though he would require amputation of the leg below the knee.</p>
<p>It seems Watson knew what he was doing, though, and he managed to turn misfortune into notoriety. Even though he was born into a good family, Watson was orphaned early in life, leaving his future success uncertain. He proved to be a good merchant and eventually a successful (if not especially well loved) politician, but that is not why he is remembered today.</p>
<p>Those who recall the name of Brook Watson, most likely remember him for the John Singleton Copley painting which Watson himself commissioned, entitled Watson and the Shark. The work was a hit when exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1778. Later, Watson made a great show of bequeathing the work to The Royal Hospital of Christ in London where it was displayed from shortly after his death until 1963 when it was sold to the National Gallery of Art where I’m sure you will rush to see it as soon as Shark Week is over.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 143px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Watson_and_the_shark_-_Detroit.gif" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Watson and the Shark - small version" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Watson_and_the_shark_-_Detroit.gif" alt="Watson and the Shark - small version" width="133" height="170" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Watson and the Shark &#8211; small version (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>In his will, Watson went to great lengths to explain that he hoped the painting would serve as a “useful lesson to youth.” And it seems to me that’s what shark week is about, too. I mean, sure Shark Week (and its massive ratings) took the Discovery Channel from a small struggling little cable channel to a huge network that now reaches more than 100 million US homes (at least one potential future shark attack victim) and more than 180 countries, but it’s not about the ratings. Like Watson before them, the Discovery Channel is simply attempting to provide a useful lesson to the youth.</p>
<p>So here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<p>1.There’s safety in numbers.<br />
2.Don’t bleed.<br />
3.Don’t wear or use safety equipment that is “yum yum yellow” (though if we can believe the painting, Watson didn’t actually wear anything at all and that didn’t work out so well either)<br />
4.Don’t swim in “shark infested” waters (And definitely don’t call it “shark infested” water. I mean they live there. It’s kind of rude.)<br />
5.If you feel you must be attacked by a shark, do it off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>Happy Shark Week!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every job has to have a description and every employee has to have a job and everyone has to report directly to someone who has to report directly to someone who reports directly to god, himself. Every job falls under a department which is headed by a department head who reports to one of the people who reports to someone else. No person who reports to more than three people will have anyone who reports to him, because he&#8217;ll be too busy reporting to the three other people. It&#8217;s not possible to be a part of more than one department unless you&#8217;re in charge of people from multiple departments, in which case you will be a part of all of those departments and you will report to each of those department heads, unless you&#8217;re one of the department heads, in which case the other department heads of the other departments where the people who report to you work will be your peers. You will all report to one of the people who reports directly to god.</p>
<p>Each department will be required to meet once a month to discuss things happening in that department, and to do a quick head count to make sure all the heads are counted for. The head count must be done by the department head. To avoid fraudulent activity, the department head&#8217;s head cannot be counted by the head of the department and must be universally recognized by all other heads in the department.</p>
<p><strong>Every department has to have a committee</strong>, and the committee must be headed by someone who reports to less than three people, because those people will be too busy reporting to the three other people who they report to. The head of the committee cannot be a department head, because that person would be two heads at once, which isn&#8217;t covered by the company health insurance plan. The committee members will be chosen by committee and the committee head will be selected from among those chosen. Once the committee head is chosen, he or she will select his or her own vice head in the event that he or she is beheaded and cannot fulfill the duties of his or her post. The department committees will meet once a week to strategize what should be discussed at the monthly department meeting.</p>
<p>Every quarter a quarter of all the departments will meet to discuss what&#8217;s going on in the other departments that quarter. These meetings will be led by a committee of committee heads. If any of the committee heads is beheaded between the time of that committee&#8217;s last weekly meeting and the quarterly quarter department meeting, the committee head&#8217;s vice head will serve on the committee for the quarterly meeting for a quarter of all departments.</p>
<p>All departments will gather once annually for the annual all department picnic. It will be pot luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away.” -Barry Goldwater</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 448px"><a href="http://www.libertyjuice.com/2011/01/05/the-damage-caused-by-excessive-regulations/"><img src="http://www.libertyjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/regulation.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Republicans are going to feed y’all to the Minotaur!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I like regulations. In theory, they do great things like <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cwa.cfm?program_id=45">protect the environment</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">keep people from dying</a>. They can also keep lead out of our children’s toys and prevent <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2010/04/06/did-consumer-protection-laws-prevent-texas-housing-bubble/">disastrously precarious</a> <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/15/dont-mess-with-the-texas-housi">housing bubbles</a>. But when you realize that given regulations could cost as much as <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/epa-regulation-would-cost-12-million-job-created">$1.2 million per job created</a>, you start to wonder how serious the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv28n3/v28n3-3.pdf">cost-benefit analysis</a> on these proposals are and whether they’re really worth it. Then again, given that President Obama’s stimulus, by the administration’s own numbers, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/05/18/152994843/weekly-standard-stimulus-what-stimulus">cost $317,000 per job</a>, I guess things could be worse. But if we&#8217;re throwing yet another party of low expectations, I&#8217;d rather just head to the bar.</p>
<p>Speaking of costs, Boston officials recently shut down <a href="http://support.uber.com/entries/256502-what-is-uber">Uber</a>, a smartphone-accessible on-demand car service, because the company uses GPS to better serve its customers. That’s right, government officials actually shuttered a successful startup—and all the jobs it created—because its <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120814/14441720049/boston-shuts-down-uber-because-massachusetts-doesnt-approve-gps.shtml">technology was too advanced</a> for the Massachusetts Division of Standards. I can’t imagine why that region is <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/10/23/a_state_of_decline/?page=full">losing people</a>.</p>
<p>Lest you think this madness isolated to New England, Uber has also had a rocky relationship with Washington, D.C. Apparently, the startup’s innovative business model <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/14/ubercommissioner/">threatens to compete</a> with the district’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/dc-taxi-official-turned-fbi-informant-recalls-role-in-corruption-probe/2012/04/02/gIQAErYhrS_story.html">dysfunctional taxi establishment</a>. Rather than applaud this development like reasonable people, D.C. lawmakers want to protect the antiquated system by <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120709/22540419635/dc-seeks-to-legalize-uber-forcing-it-to-be-way-more-expensive-than-cabs.shtml">forcing Uber</a> to be <em>five times</em> more expensive than regular taxis. How any of this is supposed to save lives or protect consumers is beyond me. But it would definitely be good for the taxi industry that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/14/AR2010091407030.html">helped elect</a> D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray. You know, the guy whose administration is a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/local/dc-corruption-scandals/">cesspool of corruption</a>.</p>
<p>We can all agree that common-sense regulations have their value. But the conversation has gotten far beyond questions of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2182179/Sherry-Vargsons-blames-fracking-flammable-tap-water.html">flammable tap water</a> and polluted air. Government control is creeping ever deeper into the everyday operations of the private sphere, not for the good of society, but to repay the political support of special interests. Strangely, all this nepotistic protectionism is proving detrimental to the economy. It’s almost like feudalism failed or something.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a free-market libertarian to notice that even the strongest arguments for robust regulations still must contend with very human—and often <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/wolf-blitzer-cant-get-debbie-wasserman-schultz-to-fully-accept-facts-of-paul-ryans-medicare-plan-in-frustrating-interview/">irrational</a>—actors. At the end of the day, people in power will usually do what’s best for the people who support them, the public good be damned. The fairest approach is to limit the ability of the state to interfere with the success of small business that can’t afford the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">bribes</span> political contributions to buy special treatment. Only then can we get the full range of innovation and economic growth that will benefit everybody.</p>
<p>Now is not the time to put <span style="text-decoration:line-through;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/onion-joe-biden-wild-and-unchained/2012/08/14/94a6c2fc-e645-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_blog.html">y’all</a></span> the economy back in chains. Successful, innovative businesses toiled long days and hot nights to build this country. It’s time to set them free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This statement antedates spellcheck, or at least the spellcheck feature that underlines dubious words. The writer is clearly oblivious not only to his spelling error but also to his error of diction, or tone.</p>
<p>With great energy, simplicity, and confidence, my student is writing about <em>The Iliad</em>, that stately epic poem about war, glory, and loss. Together with <em>The Odyssey</em>, it defines the epic—not only its form and subject but also its stature. Heroic, that&#8217;s what an epic is supposed to be, in every dimension.</p>
<p>So my student reads about the rage of Achilleus that follows on Agamemnon&#8217;s autocratic and self-centered distribution of the spoils of war—and of Achilleus&#8217; &#8220;prize&#8221; woman in particular. This anger is so great that despite his hunger for glory in battle, and despite his supposed loyalty to the Greek confederation that has come to Troy to take back Helen, the kidnapped wife of Menelaus, Achilleus sits stubborn in his tent and refuses to join the battle even when the tide turns against the Greeks and everyone pleads with him.</p>
<p>Admirers of Achilleus and those sympathetic with his need for respect would say he&#8217;s in high dudgeon, or in a towering rage. Those readers who prefer Hektor&#8217;s brand of heroism (of which I am one) would say Achilleus is throwing an heroic temper tantrum, or having a big sulk.</p>
<p>My student makes a different choice. Is it some perverse delicacy of mind that keeps him from spelling out &#8220;pissed,&#8221; or does he think there are two different words depending on whether there is urine involved or only spleen—or does he actually think that&#8217;s how the (single) word is spelled?</p>
<p>At any rate, even &#8220;royally pissed&#8221; would have more dignity than my student has allowed this &#8220;hero&#8221;: he has managed to trivialize Achilleus, or infantilize him, or unclass him, in a single stroke. All that might be epic is piddled away.</p>
<p>Next time you&#8217;re feeling pissed, picture my student&#8217;s word. Tell yourself you&#8217;re pist. It will probably tickle you so that you cheer right up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://slowmuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/32154075_b242c23aa8.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9276" title="32154075_b242c23aa8" src="http://slowmuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/32154075_b242c23aa8.jpeg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a><br />
<em>Who needs a peacock&#8217;s tail when you can build this for your lady love? The bower created by a male bowerbird.</em></p>
<p><strong>David Rothenberg</strong> is a jazz musician and a professor of philosophy. He has written a number of books, several of them focused on the interface between natural sounds (like the songs of birds and whales) with jazz and other musical forms. In his most recent and thought provoking book, <em>Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution</em>, Rothenberg moves into the visual realm, exploring how beauty fits into the current concept of Darwinian evolution. Is beauty part of natural selection? Can its abundance in nature truly be explained by sexual selection?</p>
<p>Rothenberg makes a strong case for aesthetic selection. Beauty as a determiner. This is a delicious thought.</p>
<p>One of Rothenberg&#8217;s prime examples is the bowerbird. Each species creates a very particular style of bower, an undertaking that is extremely arduous. Amazingly, these structural&#8212;and very sculptural&#8212;creations are not nests nor are they used for anything &#8220;practical.&#8221; They are extravagant expressions designed to please the eye of the female bowerbird.</p>
<p>In many ways they seem to defy evolution since their sole purpose is to look good. But Rothenberg suggests that birds have their own aesthetic, similar to human &#8220;schools&#8221; of art, like abstract expressionism or cubism. And looking at the photographs of bowers below, how can anyone not think of our own human bowerbird, <strong>Andy Goldsworthy</strong>?</p>
<p>From the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>The female satin bowerbirds <em>do</em> choose their mate after what they see in the bower and what they take in from the song and dance. But are they really evaluating the quality of their mate? Modern sexual selection theory says what they are looking for is good genes, while Darwin&#8217;s original sexual selection theory focused only on what the females like. Look what he has created&#8212;an artwork with style and substance, something no animal besides humans is known to do. Are we to brush all this effort off as a sign or a code for something more mundane and hidden? What if bowerbirds attract, mate and procreate for the propagation of bowers, not offspring? Look at the process as an example of <em>aesthetic</em> selection&#8230;</p>
<p>[These are] not structures to live in, but for the females to admire. They are built to be one thing&#8212;beautiful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rothenberg goes to to say that he does not believe evolution as we know it can explain art, but &#8220;a deeper consideration of art can enhance our understanding of evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also writes this memorable line:</p>
<p><strong>I believe our understanding of nature increases if we spend more time wondering about all this useless beauty.</strong></p>
<p>This book is full of many treasures. I&#8217;ll be drawing from it in future posts.</p>
<p>Below, a sampling of different bowerbird offerings:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why Do Women Crave Chocolate?</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I really want right now?&#8221; Asked Becky,</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;  Sarah asked as she looked at her friend.</p>
<p>Becky answered with one word, &#8220;Chocolate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, of course Becky and Sarah are fictional, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in Becky&#8217;s shoes and said or thought that phrase?  I did, about an hour ago when I went downstairs for my morning cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally crave chocolate.  It&#8217;s wonderful of course, but I&#8217;ve never really had a big sweet tooth.  I&#8217;ll never turn it down, but if I have the option between a big juicy burger and a piece of chocolate cake, I&#8217;m almost always going to pick the burger.  So, as I brewed my french vanilla coffee this morning and added my matching french vanilla cream, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder:</p>
<p>Why do women crave chocolate?</p>
<p>Lucky for us, this question doesn&#8217;t have just one simple answer.  Don&#8217;t you just love questions like that?</p>
<p>Our first answer is the most obvious answer out there:</p>
<p>Dear Aunt Flow.</p>
<p>Once a month, if you&#8217;re of the female gender, your annoying and mean Aunt Flow comes to town.  She is never welcome and the week that she&#8217;s in town is always the worst week of your life.  She&#8217;s needy, annoying, and just when you&#8217;ve managed to forget about her she kicks you right where it hurts.  While Aunt Flow is in town, our body is suffering from a deficient in minerals, such as <a title="Magnesium" href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank">magnesium</a>.  Which, you guessed it, chocolate contains.  So, next time Aunt Flow is in town have some chocolate.  You need it.</p>
<p>But, what if Aunt Flow isn&#8217;t in town? Why am I craving chocolate?</p>
<p>Have you been stressed out lately?  Maybe a big paper is due or you have a really important meeting at work?  Maybe you&#8217;re starting a new job or school for the first time and you&#8217;re a little nervous?  Maybe you&#8217;ve been having some family problems and you&#8217;re a little down in the dumps?</p>
<p>By eating chocolate, you increase the <a title="Serotonin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a> levels in your brain.  If you didn&#8217;t know, <a title="Serotonin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a> is the neurotransmitter that causes you to have a better mood.  So, if you&#8217;re stressed out or upset, increasing your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a> levels will not only help by increasing your mood, but they will also cause a significant decrease in anxiety.</p>
<p>Ingredients in Chocolate:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine" target="_blank">Theobromine</a> &#8211; Caffeine-like stimulant</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan" target="_blank">Tryptophan</a> &#8211; Increases <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a> levels, leaving you feeling good</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine" target="_blank">Phenethylamine</a> &#8211; releases endorphins causing passionate feelings</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar" target="_blank">Sugar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat" target="_blank">Fat</a> &#8211; This causes the wonderful texture</p>
<p>With a combination like this, who wouldn&#8217;t want chocolate?</p>
<p>However, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.  Having a piece of cake or candy bar is fine every once in a while, but don&#8217;t become addicted to it.</p>
<p>Alright, so you&#8217;re happy and Aunt Flow isn&#8217;t in town, why else could you be craving chocolate?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of the many that suffer from low blood sugar.  If I&#8217;ve gone too long between meals or I haven&#8217;t eaten enough during the day, I start to get a little shaky.  When this happens, my<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar" target="_blank"> blood sugar levels</a> have dropped.  So, when my levels have dropped and I&#8217;m getting shaky and sweaty, the one thing that will bring me out of my little attack is chocolate.  Because of the sugar and caffeine that chocolate has, it immediately raises my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar" target="_blank">blood sugar levels</a>.  Dark chocolate specifically helps stabilize the levels.  So, if you&#8217;re in-between meals and you&#8217;re starting to feel tired and odd, you may be experiencing low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar" target="_blank">blood sugar levels</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, ok, I hear you.  Aunt Flow&#8217;s not in town, you&#8217;re happy and you&#8217;re not suffering from low blood sugar levels.  Why are you still craving chocolate?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s addictive.  There has been some research that shows chocolate contains the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid" target="_blank">alkaloid</a> compounds that make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" target="_blank">alcohol</a> addictive.  Because of this research, it has led many to believe and start to consider that chocolate is physiologically addictive.  Chocolate also contains the compound <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide" target="_blank">anandamide</a>, which many believe stimulates the brain the same way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" target="_blank">marijuana</a> does.  However, there is a huge debate going on whether or not chocolate contains enough of the compounds to be as addictive as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" target="_blank">alcohol</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" target="_blank">marijuana</a> are.</p>
<p>And finally, if none of these answers have satisfied you as to why you are craving chocolate, here is my final answer to the question why you are craving chocolate.</p>
<p>Chocolate has a wonderful delicious texture that is unlike anything else.  It&#8217;s just good.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re satisfied with this answer.  I spent quite a bit of time researching and learning about the different kinds of levels in our brain and why chocolate does what it does.  However, if you aren&#8217;t satisfied, let me know why so I can be sure to do a better job next time.  Or, you know, just go have a piece of chocolate.</p>
<p>Remember, never stop asking why!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://keysandkeys.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ford-microsoft-apple-battle1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-553" title="ford microsoft apple battle" src="http://keysandkeys.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ford-microsoft-apple-battle1.png?w=512&h=449" alt="" width="512" height="449" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tim Cook tried to do his best Steve Jobs at this year&#8217;s World Wide Developers Conferences , but one of his big announcements was that Apple was going to march right into the heart of the automotive world. Apple announced one button in-car Siri integration with partners such as Honda, GM, Chrysler, BMW, and Mercedes curiously leaving Ford off their A-list. The media was quick to question the blue oval&#8217;s shortsightedness for not kneeling to the altar of Jobs  and damn the &#8221;ball and chain&#8221; partnership Ford carries with Microsoft for it&#8217;s own SYNC system. <strong><a href="http://jalopnik.com/5917708/how-ford-just-got-screwed-by-apple">Jalopnik</a></strong> even claimed that missing the Apple boat means Ford could become the uncool PC vs. others becoming the trendy Mac.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 523px"><img class="   " title="Jalopnik: Ford PC MAC Comparison" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17pjv6k54vwinjpg/xlarge.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="288" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo from Jalopnik&#8217;s &#8220;Ford got screwed&#8221; article</p></div>
<p>Well I say hogwash! In the past 4 years, Ford has been quick to adapt forward thinking connected technologies more so than any of its competitors. Today they continue to use unique approaches to developing new solutions across a host of different platforms. Here is why Ford has bet smart money against integrating Siri into its vehicles:<span id="more-541"></span></p>
<p><strong>1) Siri Is Nothing New: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Some reports are clamoring that in-car Siri integration is going to change how we drive by magically automating everything we do. Calling, controlling music, scheduling meetings, checking appointments, etc. The truth is voice control in cars has been around for a long time. Siri certainly will raise it to a new level of sophistication with additional connected functionality, but there is nothing ground breaking here. The fact is Siri uses voice recognition technology from a company called <strong><a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-business/by-industry/automotive/index.htm">Nuance</a></strong>. Check the link to see the list of automakers already using Nuance for their in-house infotainment systems (hint it&#8217;s more than I can even count on 2 hands)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>2) Siri is Not That Great: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ah, haven&#8217;t you seen those magical ads in which Samuel L. Jackson prepares for a date with Siri or Zoey Dechanel and Siri dance around doing, well,  Zoey Dechanel things? Well in the real world, it is no secret that Siri doesn&#8217;t actually work that well and Apple has recently gotten in some hot water over its ads that sell sophistication that Siri does not have.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 325px"><img class="   " title="Ford Sync App Link" src="http://ford-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_49471.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="210" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sync AppLink is Universal</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ford&#8217;s SYNC system, despite it&#8217;s recent MyFord Touch hiccups, already has best-in-class voice recognition and has initial app integration that works with iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. <strong><a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/13/android-51-8-market-share/">Nielsen</a></strong> reported Android has over 51.8+% market share as of last month.  That is over half the smartphone using country not eligible for a date with Siri.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>3) Siri Loses Home Field Advantage:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What makes Apple&#8217;s products and software ecosystem so enchanting is that it is meticulously crafted from start to finish in Apple&#8217;s beautifully orchestrated, almost vertically integrated world. Apple loses all of that control partnering with automakers. Iphones will have to play nice with each automaker&#8217;s infotainment systems with varying screen sizes, features, and internal hardware not to mention the notoriously longer development times needed for cars. Who knows, this could turn out similar to Android&#8217;s current fragmentation predicament.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>4) Siri is Stuck in a Conflict of Interest:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Automakers are not going to throw away the millions of dollars already plowed into their own app integrated infotainment systems (Toyota Entune, Cadillac Cue, BMW I-Drive, etc.). In affect, Siri will function as a simple add-on to these systems withholding the greater potential that comes with core integration. For example, how will Mercedes or BMW have Siri&#8217;s free turn-by-turn navigation play with their pretty ~7000$ buy-in-a-package 3d navigation system? We will wait and see.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>5) Siri is Not Specialized:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The saving grace for Siri is if Apple can get developers to create specialized automotive apps that bring out its true value. The problem here is that Siri currently works with only Apple developed core apps. Also motivation for 3rd parties to develop other than music/audio based apps could be thin. You cannot click on an in-app ad in your car, audio ads would be infuriating, and I guess I could audibly post my Facebook status, but most popular apps today require a highly visual component. Apple could also look to the automakers themselves to develop apps, but you think Toyota will throw in money to develop an app that would work the same in a Chevy?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Now here are a key list of factors Ford has in its favor:</p>
<p><strong>1) Core Integration:</strong></p>
<p>Ford created an open app framework that hooks into the core systems of their vehicles accessing unique data such as speed, instant fuel economy, and vehicle diagnostics. This allows the creation of specialized automotive apps as well as interesting integration opportunities with typical media apps.</p>
<p><strong>2) Incentivised Developers:</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 259px"><img class="  " title="Ford at Tech Crunch Disrupt" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTYqkBN8AgEL2EY-94vfTKnbYs1PZyfTE-NR3VYG9AxlaFuM64U" alt="" width="249" height="164" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ford at Tech Crunch&#8217;s Disrupt Conference</p></div>
<p>No other automaker has taken such an aggressive stance to  foster an ecosystem of app developers using startup like tactics such as  creating an official developer network, wooing developers at college <strong><a href="http://www.xconomy.com/detroit/2011/06/30/mobile-apps-are-not-just-for-smart-phones-ford-courts-app-developers/">campuses and trade shows</a></strong>, and throwing <strong><a href="http://social.ford.com/our-articles/auto-show-coverage/2012-ces/how-ford-encourages-developers-to-innovate-new-app-ideas-for-sync/">developer contests</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3) Focused Development:</strong></p>
<p>They do not have to split their development resources trying to accommodate Siri.</p>
<p><strong>4) A Deep-Pocketed Partner:</strong></p>
<p>Despite what people perceive, Microsoft is still immensely profitable, has a robust ecosystem of its own, and is going through a second renaissance of sorts. Could you imagine Kinect motion control in a car? It would probably be the most dangerous distraction of all time, but I&#8217;ll still mark one in the AWESOME column.</p>
<p>By avoiding Siri&#8217;s siren song, Ford is going to save substantial time and effort trying to develop something it frankly already does very well. More importantly, it is going to allow Ford to really differentiate itself from the lemmings in the automotive space by, ironically enough, taking a similar page out of Apple&#8217;s playbook. They have decided to meticulously craft their own tech ecosystem from start to finish focused solely on enhancing the automotive experience.</p>
<p>Do you agree with my assessment? I would love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Oh and Ford has not completely shunned Apple. Check out how Ford&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.insideline.com/ford/fords-new-dealership-ipad-app-to-ease-buying-process-for-consumers.html">dealership Ipad app</a> hopes to change the car buying experience.</p>

<p>One thing I love about Europe, especially coming from the US, is that nothing there is purely utilitarian (or at least wasn&#8217;t before the Soviets came along). Even the art isn&#8217;t just there to look pretty&#8211;I was caught off-guard the first time I saw people holding empty water bottles up to the public fountains, not comprehending that their primary purpose was not actually decorative.</p>
<p><span id="more-742"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-130235.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-130235.jpg" alt="20120816-130235.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>But even the smallest, most basic things have a touch of artistry. I found my eye caught more than once by a storm drain, stamped with the seal of whatever city I was in.</p>
<p><strong>Prague</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105918.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105918.jpg" alt="20120816-105918.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105929.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105929.jpg" alt="20120816-105929.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Florence</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105940.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105940.jpg" alt="20120816-105940.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ljubljana</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105954.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-105954.jpg" alt="20120816-105954.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-110003.jpg"><img src="http://restlessromantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120816-110003.jpg" alt="20120816-110003.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>If Los Angeles had storm drains like this, I&#8217;m not sure anyone would even notice. But then, the city doesn&#8217;t have the money for it anyway.</p>
