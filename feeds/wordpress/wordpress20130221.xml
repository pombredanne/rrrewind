				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/johns-dancers-on-a-plane-t03242" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-436 aligncenter" title="Dancers on a Plane by Jasper Johns" alt="Dancers on a Plane by Jasper Johns" src="http://abetterwhirlpool.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dancers-on-a-plane.jpg?w=195&#038;h=240" width="195" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Once again, I feel compelled to address some claims made by the art critic Jonathan Jones at <i>The Guardian</i>.  This time, Jones has written <a title="Banksy: overrated purveyor of art-lite" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/19/banksy-overrated-art" target="_blank">a piece attacking Banksy</a>.  This in itself is not the problem.  The problem is that the attack makes very little sense under close examination.</p>
<p>Here is the crux of Jones’s argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some art can exist just as well in silence and obscurity as on the pages of newspapers. The Mona Lisa is always being talked about, but even if no one ever again concocted a headline about this roughly 510-year-old painting it would still be as great. The same is true of real modern art. A Jasper Johns painting of a network of diagonal marks surrounded by cutlery stuck to the frame, called Dancers On a Plane – currently in an exhibition at the Barbican – was just as real, vital and profound when it was hidden away in the Tate stores as it is under the gallery lights. Johns does not need fame to be an artist; he does not even need an audience. He just <em>is</em> an artist, and would be if no one knew about him. Banksy is not an artist in that authentic way.</p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly disagree that art can exist in a vacuum; I think it needs an audience to be art.  Thus, I cannot fathom the absurdity in the statement that Jasper Johns “does not even need an audience” to be an artist.  How does that work exactly?  It doesn’t.  Jones is simply presupposing a metaphysical reality in which art possesses inherent value independent of humans.  This presupposition, being fictional, remains unsupported.  How can a work remain profound if no one is around to bestow the value of profundity upon it?  And does it not take a human mind to transform Jasper Johns’s “network of diagonal marks surrounded by cutlery stuck to the frame” into a cohesive whole?  Truly, then, one cannot dismiss Banksy on the grounds that his work demands an audience.  All art does.</p>
<p>Another problem that I have with Jones’s argument is that he takes the properties that make Banksy aesthetically interesting to most people and transforms them into Banksy’s aesthetic shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banksy, as an artist, stops existing when there is no news about him. Right now he is a story once again, because a &#8220;mural&#8221; by him (street art and graffiti no longer suffice to describe his pricey works) has been removed from a wall and put up for auction. Next week the story will be forgotten, and so will Banksy – until the next time he becomes a headline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of Banksy’s “art” is in the impermanence of his pieces and in the confrontational nature of his “murals” that are designed to disrupt people from their daily routines to make them stop and notice something, to see things differently.  Perhaps comparisons to static pieces like the <i>Mona Lisa</i> are not the best means to understand performance-based work of this nature (though I admit that because the art market has laid claim to Banksy, such comparisons are not necessarily off base, either).</p>
<p>But “street art” is hardly the first recognized art form to be temporary and confrontational in the manner adopted by Banksy. And why does Jones consider fame and branding as faults or weaknesses of the artist?  These attributes were obviously as essential in solidifying the legacies of the artists whom Jones admires as they were in elevating Banksy above his peers.</p>
<p>Jones claims that he wants “art that is physically and intellectually and emotionally real.”  Unfortunately for him, as his blog on Banksy makes clear, he seems to have no idea what that even means.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/world/europe/russians-seek-clues-and-count-blessings-after-meteor-blast.html?_r=0">meteor striking</a> the atmosphere over Siberia on February 15, 2013, was, of course, not the first such disaster to strike the region. In 1908, an asteroid struck <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">Tunguska, Siberia</a>, ramming into the earth with power 1,000 times that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.  My grandfather, Werner Wehlen, saw that explosion when he was twelve years old on his parents&#8217; farm near Sundsvall, Sweden.  Only when he was 83 years old, after he had immigrated to the United States and settled in the Midwest, did he learn what it was he had witnessed that summer day 70 years before.</h3>
<div id="attachment_1511" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/220px-tunguska.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1511" alt="Trees knocked over in the blast from the 1927 expedition." src="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/220px-tunguska.png?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Trees knocked over in the blast from the 1927 expedition.</p></div>
<h3>As he told his story in his lilting accent, &#8220;Last week I went to a lecture given at the University of Chicago given by a famous astronomer from Harvard.  He told about a new theory they have now; that a tiny particle of antimatter&#8211;something very dense but very small&#8211;passed right through the earth in 1908. It left a big circle of wreckage in Siberia and it came out somewhere in the South Atlantic.  There was a flash of light seen over northern Europe at the time that it was supposed to have hit.  As he was talking, I remembered seeing such a flash, sitting in my farmyard in Sweden when I was a boy.  It was so bright it took the color out of everything, even though it was daytime when I saw it.</h3>
<h3>&#8220;After the lecture, I raised my hand and told the astronomer I had seen that light.  He became very excited and asked me where I was when I saw it and what year it was.  I was able to date it pretty exactly, because it happened at about the time of the death of a cousin of mine.  The astronomer wrote down my name and the place I lived in Sweden.  Then he told me I was lucky, because I was probably the only person in the room to have seen that flash.  In fact, I was the only person he had ever met who had seen it.  Most of the other people in the lecture room were young students, and the astronomer himself was only about forty years old.</h3>
<h3>&#8220;Just think. I had seen that flash from my farmyard in Sweden when I was a boy, and I had to wait till I was eighty-three to learn what it was.  Isn&#8217;t life strange?&#8221;</h3>
<div id="attachment_1519" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/scan-130510001-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1519" alt="My grandfather, Werner Wehlen, in 1984 at age 87 after his first airplane ride." src="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/scan-130510001-1.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My grandfather, Werner Wehlen, in 1984 at age 87 after his first airplane ride.</p></div>
<h3>For my grandfather&#8217;s generation, waiting a lifetime to find out about a scientific or environmental calamity, would not be unusual.  Now, videos of catastrophes are uploaded on YouTube filmed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK-pdMGj9Sk">dashboard cameras</a> and shared with the world almost instantaneously.  Isn’t life strange?</h3>
<h3>Sometimes stories don&#8217;t have an ending for decades, as my grandfather sensed with this event, tying his youth to his old age.  His story was recorded for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Mosaic-Immigrant-Experience-History/dp/0822954885/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361386665&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=american+mosaic"><i>American Mosaic</i></a>, a book co-written by my mother Joan Wehlen Morrison.  My mother felt that everyone has a story, one that may not yet be apparent. As she writes at age 18 on October 19, 1941, “to understand one’s story is to weep with pity.”</h3>
<h3>Joan also writes about the coincidence of personal, political, and environmental calamity.  On Thursday, January 26, 1939, at age 16, she writes about the death of her best friend’s father.</h3>
<h3><i>&#8220;Gee, I came home and Mom told me. I used to play cards with him and tell jokes and I saw him last Saturday and today he is dead and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War">Spanish Civil War</a> is over and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War">Chinese War</a> is going on and 8,000 people died in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_Chill%C3%A1n_earthquake">Chile Earthquake</a> <i>and people all over the world are eating their suppers and doing their homework (as I shall) and laughing and reading and moving about in lighted rooms and a man I know is dead.</i></i></h3>

<h3><i>It’s funny . . . coming home on the elevated train tonight I made an equation—a geometric equation to prove that Life cannot be cancelled.</i></h3>
<h3><i>Matter + Energy + X = Life</i></h3>
<h3><i>Matter and Energy cannot be cancelled.</i></h3>
<h3><i>Therefore: you cannot cancel Life.</i></h3>
<h3><i>But I don’t know. I will not be speaking to my friend&#8217;s father any more.</i></h3>
<h3><i>I feel low to be eating and writing in here and doing my homework when someone is dead . . . but someone is always dead. . . . 8,000 people that other people knew are dead in Chile. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPfL9SoVSc8">Barcelona fell to the Rebels </a>and a war is over and I talk thus.&#8221;</i></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">The actual death toll in Chile was much higher, estimated to be between 25,000 and 50,000.</h3>
<div id="attachment_1518" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/800px-1939_chile_earthquake_memorial_placard.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1518" alt="50th anniversary  of 1939 Chilean Earthquake Commemoration placard " src="http://homefrontgrrl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/800px-1939_chile_earthquake_memorial_placard.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">50th anniversary of 1939 Chilean Earthquake Commemoration placard</p></div>
<h3>My grandfather, on learning what he had seen in the “old country,” asked, “Isn’t life strange?”  Now we know that an object half the size of a football field narrowly missed the earth on the same day that another object –thankfully, much smaller – slammed debris into it.  Life is strange—and precious.  All we have—the dashboard cameras, the YouTube videos, the farmyards, the diaries, the memories—could disappear in a flash.</h3>
<h3>A flash that may be remembered by someone decades hence.</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are all familiar with those well-known, over-used turn-of-phrases that add conversational color. So, let&#8217;s beat a dead horse and see how many clichés we get crammed in like sardines.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got you by the short and curlies, I&#8217;ll tell you a story. Let me bend your ear as far as the eye can see, but don&#8217;t try following in my footsteps, for it is a tangled web I weave. Face the music, you&#8217;d be in over your head.</p>
<p><a href="http://thisismycorn.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mjaxmy1hyje1odrmytljm2vhyzk2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-502" alt="Cliche someecard" src="http://thisismycorn.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mjaxmy1hyje1odrmytljm2vhyzk2.png?w=720"   /><span id="more-500"></span></a></p>
<p>I was talking to Ralph on the big white telephone, and nervous as a whore in a church, but he had already heard it through the grapevine. I was coming apart at the seams trying to live on a shoestring budget and wanted to make a fast buck by giving him a run for his money. I didn&#8217;t expect the Spanish Inquisition, but he asked the $64,000 question: &#8220;where&#8217;s the beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was under the gun and lying through my teeth, but when the chips are down you play the cards you&#8217;re dealt. I&#8217;m smarter than the average bear, so I gave it the old college try. I mean, he&#8217;s not the kind of guy you would kick out of bed for eating crackers, but he couldn&#8217;t hit the broad side of a barn. Still, he&#8217;s hotter than a snake&#8217;s ass in a wagon rut. But I digress.</p>
<p>Since a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, I put my heart into it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? He was waiting for the bottom line and I was shooting for the moon. I told him, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a monkey on my back and it&#8217;s playing with fire.&#8221; Figuring we were two horns on the same goat, and knowing there&#8217;s a sucker born every minute, I was really going to town on him like ugly on an ape.</p>
<p>He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth with the pick of the litter given to him on a silver platter. I told him, &#8220;it all boils down to this: no way on God&#8217;s green Earth everything&#8217;s copacetic.&#8221; He said &#8220;get your ducks in a  row, but this oughta tide you over, and don&#8217;t use a lot where a little will do.&#8221; It was a sweet deal, and I took off like a bat out of hell. Now I have a new lease on life and he learned his lesson: actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it in a nutshell. Thanks for playing. That&#8217;s all folks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was seven, my mom gave me her old copy of <em>Spice</em>, the first album by the Spice Girls. I had been too young to realize what that album had meant to the world and, more specifically, to girls. But as I grew up and as I became more aware of pop culture and media representations of girls, I found myself admiring the album on a whole different level than from when I was first given it. There is something so empowering about watching confident, talented ladies preach self-love and independence. In a world that is very much still stuck in the idea that a girl is only as good as the man she’s with, these groups are a necessary counterpoint.</p>
<p>Following the Spice Girls, though, there seemed to be a lull in girl power pop music. The mid-to-late-90s were a great time for this movement. We had groups like the previously mentioned Spice Girls as well as Destiny’s Child. They were distinct from other female performers of that era. For example, Britney Spears gained popularity as a solo artist around the same time as these girl groups claimed rises to fame. From the very beginning of her career, her sexuality was a huge topic. She had made a chastity pledge and yet appeared in her video for &#8220;Hit Me Baby One More Time&#8221; in a sexy school girl outfit. It&#8217;s the common double standard society holds women to: to be pure, but attainable. To be provocative but not &#8220;slutty&#8221;. On the other side of spectrum during this time were the Spice Girls and Destiny&#8217;s Child, who didn&#8217;t buy into the virginity movement and who realized that those types of things were their own private business and shouldn&#8217;t factor into careers. Most distinctly, the Spice Girls were, in fact, the group that popularized the phrase and the idea of &#8220;Girl Power&#8221;.</p>
<p>But as the boy band fad began to fade, so too did these girl groups. During that period, Cobra Starship broke into the radio-play mainstream with their song “<a href="http://youtu.be/Ix5z1bRz4Sc">Good Girls Go Bad</a>” (released in 2009 and featuring Leighton Meester, of &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; fame). The song is repetitive and catchy, like any good pop song should be, but the lyrics leave a bit of sour taste in the mouth. The most repeated expression in the song seems to be “I make them good girls go bad”.</p>
<p>Well, girls are a lot more complicated than that. We don’t fit into two arbitrary categories. And even if we did, how do we define the difference between “good girls” and “bad girls”? Stereotypical “bad girl” traits seem to be things like &#8220;trashy&#8221; clothing, &#8220;bad company&#8221;, and number of sexual partners. And yet, there are girls out there who wear what society likes to think of as “trashy” clothing, dark red lipstick and stiletto heels with short skirts, for example, who aren’t interested in sleeping with anyone. The most conservatively dressed girl could also be the horniest. There is a distinct different between true behaviour and what society takes as an indicator of behaviour. People aren&#8217;t that simple. People, or girls in this case, are all unique. They all make their own decisions about fashion, what they desire, etc. Nobody fits inside a box.  Furthermore, it’s not anyone else’s business what a girl does with her body. She surely doesn’t deserve flimsy labels like “bad girl” or “good girl” for her choices.</p>
<div id="attachment_1204" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://velociriot.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tumblr_mbxsosfqyr1qf1ango1_1280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1204 " alt="miss A." src="http://velociriot.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tumblr_mbxsosfqyr1qf1ango1_1280.jpg?w=300&#038;h=227" width="300" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">miss A&#8217;s 5th album, entitled &#8220;Independent Women&#8221;, cover. Found <a href="http://hallyu8.com/topic/179-miss-a-%EB%AF%B8%EC%93%B0%EC%97%90%EC%9D%B4-official-thread/">here</a>.</p></div>
<p>To cleanse your pallet, I suggest Miss A’s “<a href="http://youtu.be/8TeeJvcBdLA">Bad Girl, Good Girl (Bad But Good)</a>”, which features lyrics that fight against these ideas we have about bad girls and good girls. We could consider this song, released a year after, a direct response to Cobra Starship&#8217;s “Good Girls Go Bad”. The group sings, “outside I’m a bad girl / inside I’m a good girl / you don’t even know me that well,” an important message to all the girls out there who feel the weight of people judging them every day. Miss A seems to have started the reintroduction of girl power music into the Kpop scene. After the release of their first single came songs like 2NE1’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o">I Am The Best</a>” and Brown Eyed Girls’ “<a href="http://youtu.be/pIqkDBsSJOw">Sixth Sense</a>” (for which I highly recommend watching the video, if for nothing but the symbolism and message behind it). Miss A has also stuck with that girl power image. Last year they released the single, “<a href="http://youtu.be/EkSOOiMDGiY">I Don’t Need A Man</a>”, which starts off member Min introducing the song as being “for all the independent ladies,” in a way that’s reminiscent of Destiny’s Child’s hit song, “Independent Women”.</p>
<p>On that note, it’s safe to credit the return of girl power pop music into modern western music to Beyoncé. Her entire recent discography features songs meant to empower young women. The one that sticks out is obviously the 2011 single “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U">Run The World (Girls)</a>”. The song has since become <a href="http://sikened.tumblr.com/post/34651923925">a staple in fandom communities</a>, related to any widely loved female character or <a href="http://youtu.be/kUOEmuHz0iA">groups of female characters</a>. Additionally, with the return of boy bands, girl groups were bound to make a comeback too &#8212; contributing to girl power pop music becoming a common theme in mainstream music once again.</p>
<div id="attachment_1205" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://velociriot.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/515273-little-mix.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1205 " alt="Little Mix.

Photo credit to Sony Music.</p></div>
<p>This is where the British band Little Mix comes in. The girl group are steadily becoming more and more popular after winning season eight of the &#8220;X Factor&#8221; (which had given us artists like Leona Lewis and One Direction) and are sure to make their U.S. debut any day now. Their first single was entitled “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOQDsmEqVt8">Wings</a>” and was a powerful, poppy song about self-love, self-confidence and not letting labels (like “good girl” and “bad girl”) and other people’s perception of you get you down. The girls that make up the group seem very girl-power oriented, as well. <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/a9b5a633db5289e187f7ffe892ca49ce/tumblr_mhei7jkgus1r8pk2do1_500.gif">They use boys as furniture during concerts</a>. They frequently hold hands and talk about not needing boyfriends as long as they have each other. It’s refreshing. These are the girls you want all the little girls in the world to call their role models: girls who put themselves, and each other, above society’s perception of having the perfect life is &#8212; i.e., pleasing your significant other. These girls may just be the linchpin the music industry needs to see the triumphant return of true girl power pop music.</p>
<p>January saw the release of Little Mix’s new single. &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/ifRoMGG8Wvs">Change Your Life</a>&#8220;. The song is a beautiful ballad-esque track that revisits the theme of self-love, but also includes lyrics about having the inner-strength and the power to be able to make your life what you want it to be. These are the messages the media should be sending out regularly, not once every few decades. These are the messages that should be reaching little girls, young women and mature women, alike. In addition to the wonderful messages that come through their music, the girls themselves represent a wide demographic. Little Mix are one of the few groups where they number of women of colour dwarfs the number of Caucasian women. In addition, Jesy Nelson &#8212; a well-loved member of the group &#8212; does not represent society&#8217;s traditional views of what a girl should like. Nelson has curves. She isn&#8217;t stick thin but she&#8217;s still beautiful and not treated any differently than the rest of the girls. Because of these things, it&#8217;s easy for girls all over the world to identify with Little Mix and seek them out as role models and inspirations. These are the groups that can give girls the confidence to do what they like, when they like regardless of what other people think. And that&#8217;s empowering. Girl power!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class=" wp-image-1687 aligncenter" alt="okc" src="http://keychangesblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-19_07-15-59_931.jpg?w=270&#038;h=479" width="270" height="479" /></p>
<p>There’s no easy way to say this, so here it goes: My friend and I have a ghost OkCupid account. I know, it’s weird and we need therapy. But this fake profile has proven itself to be immensely helpful and afforded us opportunities that simply don’t exist when playing by the standard OkCupid rules – including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stalking people without having them know that YOU are the one visiting their profile five times per <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">hour</span> day.</li>
<li>Seeing what your real profile looks like to outsiders, and if it is listed as “replies often” or “replies selectively.”</li>
<li>Spending inordinate amounts of time browsing profiles on the site. (Doing this from your real profile would cause your “Last Online” meter to perpetually read “Online Now,” making you look like a desperate person who probably has four cats and a freezer full of ice cream/maybe eight DiGournos – and that’s just not ideal.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The other day I logged into this secret weapon in order to check out some dude’s pictures, and inevitably ended up combing through the profiles of every gay man in Connecticut (because <em>what else is new?</em>).</p>
<p>And then I came across a page that was hilarious, well written, and actually fun to read. And – bonus! He was really cute.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to such compelling content on the site, I decided it was imperative that I send him a message. I spent a good twenty minutes coming up with something that referenced the things I liked most about his profile while simultaneously introducing myself as someone who is funny, well-read, and totally worth his hand in marriage.</p>
<p><i>Sent</i>.</p>
<p>And then I went to check our compatibility match and saw that we were rated as 50% enemies. <i>That’s weird</i>, I thought, <i>we’re so similar.</i></p>
<p>AND THEN.</p>
<p>I looked to the top of my screen and came to the earth-shattering realization that I had <i>sent the message from the ghost account!</i> (The ghost account, mind you, is a straight man from Tennessee with no pictures.)</p>
<p>Unsure of whether or not to cry or laugh or scream bloody murder, I did all three.</p>
<p>I tried to ask myself, “What would a normal person do to fix this?” but instantly realized that a normal person would never be in this predicament to begin with. Then I tried to ask myself, “WWJD?” but realized that Jesus would never need to create a ghost account in the first place because he’s Jesus and would probably just be like “I’m the son of God and I’m going to browse anonymously right now, and you’re going to be fine with that – okay, Cupid?”</p>
<p>So then I evaluated my realistic options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send the exact same message from my real account and pray that he’d just chalk up the duplicate message to a strange OkCupid glitch.</li>
<li>Come up with a brand new message to send him from my real account – one written in a markedly different tone than the one sent from the fake account – and hope that he’d just be like, “Hm. Two guys named Nic in the same day. <i>Weird</i>.”</li>
<li>Say this: <i>Hey &#8211; I&#8217;m about to come off as the creepiest person ever, but well, my friend and I have a ghost OkCupid account for stalking purposes&#8230; and I just accidentally sent you a message from it. I know. I need therapy. But the thought of formulating a NEW message that didn&#8217;t involve anything from the sent-from-creepy-TN-profile original message was too daunting, so I&#8217;m just coming clean. </i></li>
</ol>
<p>Inexplicably, I somehow decided that number three was the best option and I sent it and I KNOW – anyone on the receiving end of a message like that should absolutely be cautious that the sender is a psychopath and probably block him or her.</p>
<p>In the heat of the moment, though, I ridiculously expected that he would see it and be like, “Wow, I admire this guy’s honesty. <i>He’s keeping it real</i>. He’s also handsome and brilliant!” and then message me with something to the effect of, “Hey, thanks for the message. You seem like someone I could spend the rest of my life with, probably. Totally okay about the ghost account; I understand. Let’s meet up for a drink sometime and maybe get married?”</p>
<p>Instead, I got this: <i>Haha. Well, this profile is very different from the other.</i></p>
<p>Polite, but doesn’t exactly open the floor for me to respond with anything at all. The subtext was obviously very <em>I’ve-seen-both-messages-and-you’re-crazy-but-I’m-just-going-to-give-a-dead-end-response-now-so-that-you-don’t-continue-to-stalk-me, </em>but really, the fact that he responded at all is probably more closure than I deserve in this whole scenario anyways, so I guess on some level I got lucky.</p>
<p>What did I learn from this experience? A few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m the biggest contradiction ever. Like, my sending of the overly honest second message was clearly me trying present this whole, “I’m just going to be <i>so</i> real with you right now. I’m that kind of person – I’m impulsive and transparent and don’t care what people think. <i>I’m just doin’ me!</i>” vibe to him – but someone who doesn’t care what others think would never create a ghost profile in the first place, so,<em> yeah.</em> Contradiction.</li>
<li>Sometimes, when trying to make yourself not seem like a crazy person even though you are, it’s okay and extremely necessary to lie and take the secret with you to the grave.</li>
<li>Life would be so much easier as a <i>non-</i>crazy person to begin with. (But how to become one?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh and also – I really, <i>really</i> need to stop trying so hard.</p>
<p>But <a title="Not OK, Cupid" href="http://keychangesblog.com/2012/07/06/not-ok-cupid/">this we knew</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://acvoice.com/author/ccampbell15/">(Craig Campbell)&#8211;</a> Last Friday, my visiting parents and I drove to Hampshire College to take a look at the <a href="http://www.carlemuseum.org/Home">Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art</a>.  For a 10-minute bus ride and $6 admissions fee, I recommend the museum for anyone who has ever read a picture book – that is, everyone.  </p>
<p>The gallery displayed original drafts of illustrations from a variety of classic children’s literature, including a special exhibit on <em>Charlotte’s Web</em>, anniversary illustrations by Maurice Sendak, and Carle’s own tissue paper collages that make up the striking images in <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>.  As I browsed the collection, I perceived a distinct sense of familiarity with many of the images; I had evidently read the stories at some point in childhood.  Although I couldn’t put a finger on the narrative associated with any of the pictures, I felt, on a visceral level, what I had felt some 15 years ago when experiencing them for the first time.  <em>The Night Kitchen</em> was exhilarating and fantastically escapist; <em>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</em> elicited the comfort of familial affection; the<em> Frog and Toad </em>series aroused a feeling of giddy platonic appreciation. </p>
<div id="attachment_11888" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img src="http://acvoice.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/frog-and-toad-pic.jpg?w=300&#038;h=275" alt="Frog and Toad by Arnold Lobel" width="300" height="275" class="size-medium wp-image-11888" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Frog and Toad</em> by Arnold Lobel</p></div>
<p>In my ‘Senses in Motion’ research seminar, a recurring point of discussion has been the effect of sensory stimuli in digital media.  One of my classmates showed us the “iPad baby,” a picture (above) of an infant reading a Dr. Seuss book on the Apple device.  We agreed that we should be wary of the increasing prevalence of digital culture in the lives of children and its effect on the developing brain; however, we unanimously voiced this concern while all looking at the picture on our <em>own</em> individual iPad screens.</p>
<p>One of <a href="http://acvoice.com/2012/01/31/math-multitasking-and-modern-education-a-commentary-on-e-learning/">the issues with “online learning”</a> is the ever-growing abundance of hyperlinks on webpages.  <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2011/08/01/6-advanced-ways-to-improve-your-search-engine-rankings/">Sites are encouraged</a>, in fact, to fill their text with external links as it raises their search engine indices.  However, the convention of linking diverse sources disrupts the temporal linearity of any textual thought.  Each link serves as its own digression to another topic, and so the wholeness of an otherwise cogent text becomes fundamentally fragmented.  Replete with blue underlined phrases, Wikipedia is so successful because of its relatively concise presentation of a general topic, with plenty of opportunities (links) for tangential discovery.  However, research confirms that, although web-based learning increases students’ ability to “multitask,” it diminishes their capacity to think <a href="http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/92/4/8.abstract">abstractly and creatively. </a></p>
<p>So why is “multitasking” considered a desirable, employable skill?  Studies indicate that media multitasking results in <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/13/multitasking-infographic/">sloppier performance</a> in each simultaneously executed activity.   This is not surprising: consider the dual lines of mental processing necessary to drive a car and use a cell phone at the same time. </p>
<p>The more we replace physical media with constantly changing digital forms, the more efficient we become at processing multiple sources of data at once; we train our eyes to hurriedly follow the changing images in front of us.  Try this experiment: open a new tab in this browser and look at your browsing history for the past week.  How many sites listed do you even remember visiting?  Are you noticing just <em>how many</em> different Facebook links show up stacked on top of one another?  Check the time stamps; how many different pages did you navigate through in any <em>one</em> minute?</p>
<p>“Multi-tasking,” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking#Continuous_partial_attention">as we understand it</a>, comes from the term “computer multi-tasking.”  As technology charges fearlessly and endlessly onward, the dread of <a href="http://singularity.org/what-is-the-singularity/">The Singularity</a> – the moment when robots become self-aware – continues to foment in the collective consciousness.  But the converse is rarely considered; in the age of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/timeline.html">record numbers of ADHD diagnoses</a>, shouldn’t we be worried about what happens when we train our minds, and our kid&#8217;s minds, to model the multitasking of computers, robots, and machines?</p>
<p>Children’s literature is designed to build the foundation of <a href="http://vimeo.com/58659769">“abstract thinking” in young people</a>.  Simple picture books teach a basic understanding of right and wrong, of the superlative value of family and friendship, and the notion that being “lost” is the worst conflict one could ever face.  Besides learning how to apprehend language, reading picture books facilitates parent-child bonding, develops fine motor skills (turning thin pages) in readers, and encourages fastidious attention.  Remember how often you wanted to read the same story, over and over again, despite the fact that you knew each word by heart?</p>
<p>If the generation of iBabies were to enter the Eric Carle Museum 20 years from now, would their brains be capable of the visceral childhood associations that I had?  Or would the barrage of unrelated images juxtaposed throughout their childhood lives hinder their sense of what the messages of those stories even were?</p>
<p>Only in picture books is the medium more important than the narrative, and a book in hand is by no means the same as a book on screen.</p>
