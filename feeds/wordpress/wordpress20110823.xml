			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first official post for the newly-instated &#8220;Free-For-All Fridays.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a funny coincidence.  On Tuesday Clay talked about being <a title="Tatted Up" href="http://educlaytion.com/2011/08/15/tatted-up/" target="_blank">&#8220;Tatted Up&#8221;</a> on his blog EduClaytion.  Of course, his story is about receiving a few temporary tattoos from his niece, but still.  Tattoos.  Major coincidence, because I’ve planning to write a blog about tattoos all week.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tattoolit.com/post/4746930118/one-of-these-has-to-be-literary-right"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljgq5yACO71qbycheo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Let me begin by saying I don’t have any tattoos, but I am endlessly fascinated by them.  I really want one, but haven’t worked up the guts to get one.  Here’s the thing: my mother is one THOSE people.  You know the kind.  One of those people who honestly believes that anyone with a tattoo must automatically be a punk and quite probably a criminal.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen or fifteen years old my mother told me in no uncertain terms that, besides from the obvious things like drugs and alcohol, there were four things I was never allowed to do: die my hair an outrageous color, get body piercings (for her meaning anything besides a single ear-piercing), get a tattoo, or date a guy who owned a motorcycle.  (You can see what kind of mentality my mother has pretty easily from this list.)  And, purely by accident since I’d never said anything, these were almost all things I was interested in.  I’d thought about dying my hair purple on a number of occasions (though I have since decided that I like my hair just the way it is, thanks), I’d thought about getting an ear-cartilage piercing, I wanted a tattoo, and I loved motorcycles (though I’d rather own one myself rather than date someone who owned one).</p>
<p>I am twenty-six years old now.  I have never done anything of these things.  And for the most part, I’m okay with that.  But after all this time, my fascination with tattoos as remained.  As long as they are carefully planned and done by a professional, they are beautiful, expressive, and a wonderful portrayal of a person’s tastes, beliefs, etc.  But more than any other kind of tattoo, I have recently discovered a trend that I love above all others: literary tattoos.</p>
<p>As is true for most of the people who read this blog, words are my life.  Period.  I read, write, dream them.  I breathe them in.  Words stay with me forever.  Books that are important to me, leave an indelible mark on my thoughts, beliefs, and life.  It seems to me that have a tattoo at all gives you a permanent connection to art.  Having a literary tattoo gives you a permanent and explicit relationship with the words that have touched you, marked you.  How can could I say no to that?  So when it first occurred to me that one could get a tattoo based on a book, poem, etc., I was hooked.</p>
<p>I have been going through a few blogs devotedly specifically to literary tattoos, admiring and also scheming.  The two best blogs are <a title="Contrariwise" href="http://www.contrariwise.org/" target="_blank"><em>Contrariwise</em></a> and <a title="Word Made Flesh" href="http://tattoolit.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Word Made Flesh</em></a>.  <em>Contrariwise</em>, unfortunately, hasn’t been updated since May 2010, so I’m assuming it’s essentially been abandoned, but there are still plenty of pictures to go through and admire.  <em>The Word Made Flesh</em> updates with new pictures of tattoos a couple times a week.  I find myself checking back every day to see if there’s a new one yet.  <a title="Word Made Flesh Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Word-Made-Flesh-Bookworms-Worldwide/dp/0061997404/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1283181982&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank"><em>The Word Made Flesh</em></a> is also a book (and the creators are apparently working on a second one), that I really really want but haven&#8217;t shelled out the cash for yet.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites from The Word Made Flesh are (each image links back to the original post on <em>The Word Made Flesh</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tattoolit.com/post/8040979937/i-got-this-tattoo-about-3-weeks-ago-its-from"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm9y3eRf6v1qcm6bvo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="221" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tattoolit.com/post/2651244437/this-very-real-little-poem-by-william-carlos"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lent0n9N1s1qcm6bvo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>After years and years of being fascinated by tattoos, I’ve finally decided that this isn’t some passing fancy that will go away.  And I think it’s about time I finally said ‘screw it’ and get a tattoo.  So my plan is for my birthday next May, I’m going to get one.</p>
<p>I like to plan everything very carefully, so before I go through with anything, I want to make sure I know exactly what I want, and where I went to go to get it.  There are quite a few tattoo parlors in Houston, and I have no idea how to go about picking one.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I have a few ideas for tattoos I want to get.  The first, and I think strongest, choice is the words “Still Rowing” <ins cite="mailto:Amanda%20Rudd" datetime="2011-06-15T18:54"><ins cite="mailto:Amanda%20Rudd" datetime="2011-06-15T18:54">—</ins></ins> from Anne Sexton’s poem, “Rowing” <ins cite="mailto:Amanda%20Rudd" datetime="2011-06-15T18:54"><ins cite="mailto:Amanda%20Rudd" datetime="2011-06-15T18:54">—</ins></ins> in white ink.  White ink is a fairly new trend, and it looks really cool.  Here’s a couple examples (also from <em>The Word Made Flesh</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tattoolit.com/post/4363886566/fuckyeahtattoos-i-got-a-white-ink-tattoo-around"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfjzedUS291qzabkfo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="237" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tattoolit.com/post/4022656989/fuckyeahtattoos-in-loving-memory-of-my-papa"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lguxa7HNoP1qzabkfo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>Another idea I’m really leaning toward is a tattoo based on <em>Watership Down</em> by Richard Adams.  I’d love to do something with El-ahrairah and The Black Rabbit of Inle in a circle, possibly with Frith in the center, and the quote “All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you” encircling them.  I&#8217;ll have to find someone who can design it for me though.  And those of you who haven’t read <em>Watership Down</em> are completely lost right now, but that’s okay (and if you haven’t read it, you need to.  Hmm… I think I know what book I need to blog about next now…).</p>
<p>There are at least a dozen other books and poems I’ve considered doing a tattoo for, but I think the two above or the most promising right now.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, tattoo enthusiasts, chime in!  How many do you have?  What are they for?  What inspired them?  Etc.  And those of you who don’t have any tattoos, have you ever considered getting one, or are they just not your thing?  And if you have considered it, what kind do you want, and why haven’t you done it yet?</strong></p>
<p>(Again, all images are from <em>The Word Made Flesh</em>, clicking on the image will take you to the original post.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I crashed a book club party. Donna Reed attire required. So, I darkened the brows and dawned the hornrims, pumps, pearls and hairpiece. This was what I was going for:</p>
<p><a href="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mod.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484" title="mod" src="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mod.jpg?w=218&#038;h=211" alt="" width="218" height="211" /></a>Of course I hadn&#8217;t even read the book, but I heard they were going to the movie after the meeting. Only once did I feel a bit like Jim from <em>The Office</em> episode when he sits in on Pam&#8217;s book club, &#8220;Angela? &#8230;the Ashes? nope.&#8221; This party was amazing, though. The hostess, Meredith, played the movie soundtrack and served foods straight the book, including paprika-less deviled eggs and Chocolate Pie. She decorated, had questions mapped out, and she gave us parting gifts with lines from the book and personalized notes attached. She&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-487" title="THE HELP" src="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-help-movie-photos-20.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" />And then, the unexpected: in what I had assumed would indeed be the &#8220;sleeper hit of the summer&#8221; I found a personal <em>Shawshank</em>. Some may slap my face in blasphemy for that comparison, but the truths of this film should wake us up. Hatred has a million faces, but we don&#8217;t expect it mingling with beauty.</p>
<p><a href="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-help-photo-ahna-oreilly-viola-davis-bryce-howard-emma-stone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-490" title="the-help-photo-ahna-oreilly-viola-davis-bryce-howard-emma-stone" src="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-help-photo-ahna-oreilly-viola-davis-bryce-howard-emma-stone.jpg?w=500&#038;h=332" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a>Bryce Dallas Howard&#8217;s gorgeous Hilly Holbrook, proved the formidable opponent, though an almost comic book antagonist. Emma Stone plays her vital opposite as Skeeter, always wishing for beauty until she finds it within. As Skeeter presses in for the true stories of the ever-present under-appreciated &#8220;help&#8221; she learns to speak her story as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-help-movie-image-viola-davis-01-600x334.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-489" title="the-help-movie-image-viola-davis-01-600x334" src="http://splatteronfilm.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-help-movie-image-viola-davis-01-600x334.jpg?w=500&#038;h=278" alt="" width="500" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>In this film we gain new eyes. Shame on you if you don&#8217;t cry. Go on. Let yourself. Life Lessons like these cannot be understood without new eyes.  So, wash out the old ones with tears of new beginnings. Become a human being who cares about the hearts of the hurting -whatever their stations, races, crimes, and conclusions. Love one another as God loves you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">For Aibileen&#8217;s motto applies to all: &#8220;<em>You is kind. You is smart. You is important.</em>&#8221; And don&#8217;t you forget it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong> Innovation requires the ability to experiment, and along with that, the ability to let go of things that don’t work. Failure should be a lesson, not a marathon to rehabilitate the mistake. Don’t experiment in a linear, overly-cautious way. Experiment with a bit of abandon and watch carefully for workable outcomes. Kill what doesn’t work quickly and spend time with promising ideas—not so much time that you nurture them to death, but long enough that you understand how to make the idea commercial—then turn it loose so the operations people can start learning from their experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Delivers What People Want </strong>A great idea that nobody buys may still be a great idea, but it isn’t an innovation. Innovations change experiences and they change people. Some of DaVinci’s great work wasn’t innovative because it never left his personal notebook, and when it did, it was far too late to influence anything, regardless of its awe inspiring insight. If you want to be innovative, you have to put ideas into the market, and Gaga knows all about inserting herself into the market.</li>
<li><strong>Borrow from Those Who Came Before</strong> Or steal with no regrets. Let your conscious be your guide. Chances are you aren’t creating something entirely new, be it a product or an experience. School yourself in people who have attempted to do what you are attempting to do and let that knowledge infiltrate your creation. Sure, you have to pay license fees for directly barrowed IP, but inspiration remains free.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> Even if you barrow, that doesn’t mean copy. Innovation is about differentiation —different combinations that define the person, the product or the service. You can’t differentiate if you don’t know the competition—so again, study history and study the competition. Innovations are recognized by how they make a product, service or experience different for others in the same market. Getting to par doesn’t cut it.</li>
<li><strong>Be the Brand</strong> It is hard to be innovative if you don’t know what you stand for. Innovation should reinforce the brand. Something innovative may come out of a skunk works that is orthogonal to the brand, and that’s fine, but it either needs to be aligned and integrated, or spun off. Innovation is useless if all it does is confuse consumers.</li>
<li>

</table>
</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Sit Still</strong> The deep breath and the pat on the back may be just what you need after a grueling day, but they are also the momentary lapse that triggers competitors to pounce. Being innovative means keeping up the pace. When you slow down and start thinking about retirement, just retire, because the slower pace means it’s already over. Someday Gaga will slow down and we will reminisce about her drive. You can’t tie innovation lessons to a single icon. You need to decide how you are going to fuel your drive. Only companies, not individuals, can create truly sustainable innovation because they can develop an infrastructure of policy and practices that permits experiments, failures and reinventions over long periods of time.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Takes Place in Realtime </strong>Today’s innovation takes place before the world. There may be some cloistered meetings here and there, but real innovation takes place on a public stage, and you know if it is good or bad within minutes of presenting the idea.</li>
<li><strong>Strange Combinations</strong> Don’t look just to your domain for innovative inspiration. Gaga is integrating computing technology, social media, couture, music, visual arts and many other ideas into the experiences she creates. Lyrics and music are just the starting point, or perhaps the mid-point, as various influences drive musical and lyric formulation and other turn notes and words into experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Deliver on Expectations </strong>Everything up to this point is about creating a set of expectations in the mind of the consumer. Some call delivering on the brand promise. In businesses, that consumer may be an employee, a partner or a customer. Whatever you call deliver, and whoever your customer is, number 9 means innovation doesn’t stop until you deliver the promise to the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Be Brave </strong>Lady Gaga flaunts her contrarian interpretation of culture, and by doing so, redefines it. She unabashedly confronts convention. Organizations that want to innovate need to be brave, relying on a deep-seated trust in their work, and not on benchmarking studies about how other organizations are doing things. The brave recognize risks worth taking.</li>

<p>Last night, not long after I mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a> in my discussion of <a title="Is storytelling obsolete?" href="http://nevalalee.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/is-storytelling-obsolete/">the future of storytelling</a>, my wife and I found ourselves at <a href="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=251">Ravinia Park</a> in Chicago, where we saw <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> with a full orchestra and choir performing Howard Shore&#8217;s famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy">score</a>. An excited crowd had packed itself into the pavilion and lawn, and looking around, I was reminded of the true definition of a <a href="http://www.fivesprockets.com/resources/content/four-quadrant-picture">four-quadrant movie</a>, which has nothing to do with marketing and everything to do with how it fires an audience&#8217;s imagination. &#8220;Three generations of any family,&#8221; David Thomson has drily noted, &#8220;could see [<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>] at the same time, in emotional comfort.&#8221; And it&#8217;s true. For one thing, I&#8217;m pretty sure that there were grandchildren in attendance last night who had not yet been born when the movie came out almost ten years ago.</p>
<p>And whatever its other qualities, the movie <em>works</em>. It still looks great, and the special effects, if not miraculous, do a fine job of serving the narrative and performances. And while I&#8217;m personally of the opinion that Peter Jackson never quite figured out the right tone for his material until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King"><em>The Return of the King</em></a>, <em>Fellowship</em> still has the strongest story in the trilogy. There&#8217;s something inexpressibly satisfying about seeing the pieces of the epic falling into place, as the Fellowship is gathered, tested, and finally scattered. The other two movies have their moments, and <em>Return of the King</em> in particular is a masterpiece, but I&#8217;m guessing that when most viewers think back to their favorite scenes, whether they&#8217;re casual fans or Tolkien obsessives, this is the installment that first comes to mind. And the individual moments haven&#8217;t lost any of their power: when Aragorn beheads the Uruk-Hai at the end, for instance, the entire auditorium erupted in cheers, drowning out the orchestra.</p>
<p><a href="http://nevalalee.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/ten-years-later-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/lord-of-the-rings2/" rel="attachment wp-att-5477"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5477" title="Ian McKellen in The Fellowship of the Ring" src="http://nevalalee.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/lord-of-the-rings2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>There are small problems here and there. Jackson&#8217;s treatment of Saruman&#8217;s army verges on Sam Raimi-style horror, and not in a good way; he occasionally botches big moments, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX3px_Ivs44">Galadriel&#8217;s speech</a>, with overuse of special effects; and there&#8217;s a little too much slapstick in the Shire. All of these qualities would be progressively improved over the course of the trilogy, and to my relief, I found that that the acting was strong from the very beginning. Now that we&#8217;ve come to know these actors so well, it&#8217;s important to remember that many of them were unknowns or doubtful quantities at the time, and in many cases, their performances have been enriched in retrospect. It&#8217;s hard to watch Orlando Bloom, for instance, without seeing something comic in Legolas&#8217;s unblinking intensity, while Viggo Mortensen, who once came off as miscast, now seems perfect as Aragorn. Throughout it all, Ian McKellen&#8217;s Gandalf remains the film&#8217;s perfect calm center—it&#8217;s a performance that looks even better as the years go by.</p>
<p>Watching the film again with an audience, for the first time in almost a decade, reminded me of how movies serve as markers in our own lives. When I first saw <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>, I was a college senior; now I&#8217;m married and about to get my first mortgage. Movies, too, have changed. It would be premature to say that this kind of film now seems old-fashioned, with <a title="McKinney versus McGonagall" href="http://nevalalee.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/mckinney-versus-mcgonagall/"><em>Deathly Hallows</em></a> having done a commendable job with a rather different franchise, and the two parts of the <em>Hobbit</em> still on the way. Yet with Universal <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dark-tower-crumbles-as-universal-212572">canceling</a> <em>The Dark Tower</em>, directors like Guillermo Del Toro <a href="http://criterioncast.com/2011/03/07/guillermo-del-toro-confirms-he-wont-be-heading-to-the-mountains-of-madness/">unable to finance</a> their dream projects, and the likes of <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/disney-executive-says-that-story-doesnt-matter-whe,60512/">Andy Hendrickson</a> running the show at Disney, one senses a certain lack of the will that led New Line and Peter Jackson to risk so much on this trilogy. Thankfully, though, they did. And the movies are permanently richer as a result.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is always amazing to me and sometimes frustrating (to be honest) the questions that my children come up with.   They are curious about everything from flowers and colors to death and leveled parking structures.  The underlying theme in most of the questions seems to be &#8220;why.&#8221;  I understand that this is an effort  to understand why and how everything around them works, at least, that is what I have been told.  Sometimes I think it is a means to test the mental agility and stamina of a parent. Anyhow, as I was pondering the answers to the the ten rapid fire questions that I received in the five minutes between the car and the pool deck, I put these questions into three categories: Genius Questions, Glad I Have Kids Questions, and Procrastination Questions. </p>
<p>The first category is my favorite.  These Genius Questions are the ones that make us as parents, feel like we have done right by our kids and that we may have actually taught them some type of critical thinking that will benefit them later in life.  Example: Today, Maya, Ethan, and I were discussing the &#8220;Big Woods&#8221; (more to come on the Big Woods, think Laura Ingalls Wilder)  near our new house.  This seems to be a frequent topic in the car these days.  Anyway, we were talking about how the wooded areas are getting smaller because people are cutting down the trees.  Both kids quickly concluded that this is a terrible thing to do to trees.  They wanted to know why people can&#8217;t just live in the shade of the trees or build their houses somewhere else?  I was impressed with the level of  concern and thinking.  That leads to the next type of questions.</p>
<p>The second type of question usually presents shortly after the Genius Questions or when you are having a really bad day.  These are the questions that make you glad that you have children and tend pull you out of even the deepest funk.  As is usually the case, just as I was thinking that I have the two smartest kids in the world and that they are going to be renowned scientists or discover the cure for all that ales the world, I got hit with the question of the day, &#8220;Mommy, why are my (Ethan) buns small and  yours are so big?&#8221;  How do you answer that? Not with anger, it is an innocent question that means exactly what was asked.   Nevertheless, This is not the first time my big buns have been called into question.  This put me in mind of another such occasion.  Maya had been helping me fold laundry.  I am sure we were having some type of insightful and Earth moving conversation when I heard the question. &#8221;Gee mommy, those are pretty panties.  When I grow up, can I wear big panties like yours?&#8221;  Again, I couldn&#8217;t be mad.  These are the questions that make me stop and just laugh aloud.  I have no answers to these types of questions other than a big hug and lots of smiles.  occasionally I will try and explain the science of it, but typically we are laughing so hard we become distracted and forget the original question.</p>
<p>That brings me to the front door of the final type of question.  I am not sure if this should be a type of question or a strategy for questioning.  I am referring to the burning questions that need to be answered right away or one might perish, or more likely be ushered off to bed.  These are the questions that are meant to derail the train that is heading down the hall to the Naughty Step (if you have to ask about the naughty step, you probably don&#8217;t have kids).  The ultimate kid trick, the Procrastination Questions.  These questions, like the Genius Questions, are usually insightful and require a lengthy answer which provides the perfect distraction from bedtime routines or disciplinary actions.  Maya and Ethan like to save their Procrastination Questions for the moment in which the toothbrush with dangling toothpaste is headed towards his/her mouth.  I can almost always see it coming.  It is like a slow motion event.  The tiny mouth slams shut, little hands reach for the toothbrush, usually knocking it out of my hand, and then the words flow out, &#8220;Mommy, wait, why. . .&#8221; I try not to get sucked in, but alas, is it not my job to impart the wisdom of the world into the young minds of my children?</p>
<p>And so it goes.  These three categories of questions fill my days with pride, laughter, and sometimes the frustration of not being able to answer.  Maybe, some of the frustration comes from being overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of questions being asked. Either way, I would not trade these questions for all of the answers in the world.  I just pray that I have the strength keep answering them and that my children continue to believe that I know everything!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Difficulty: Class IV rafting: Long, difficult rapids with constricted passages that often require precise maneuvering in very turbulent waters. Moderate to advanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intriguing difficulty level and open schedule made rafting with <a href="http://www.rainforesttours.com/tenorio_rafting.htm" target="_blank">Costa Rica Rain Forest Tours</a> in Guanacaste, Costa Rica too exciting to pass up.</p>
<p>Our meeting point at the Rincon Corobici Restaurnat in Canas, Guanacaste was the perfect<a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-045.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-474" title="David - Costa Rica White Water 045" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-045.jpg?w=300&#038;h=201" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a> backdrop for a day of rafting and sightseeing. The howler monkey noises from above the restaurant set the scene and the bumpy, long truck ride to the waters intensified the experience. It was official &#8211; we were in the middle of nowhere!</p>
<p>Our first &#8220;putt-in&#8221; began with a few practice strokes then we were off on our 2.5 hour white-water trip.  Just when I was starting to feel disappointed with the difficulty level, there was a tight passage with little room for error. By the end of that stretch, I was the only one who hadn&#8217;t fallen out of the raft. Although that may sound like a good thing, it most certainly was not! I became prime target number one.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-024.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-475" title="David - Costa Rica White Water 024" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-024.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=687" alt="" width="1024" height="687" /></a></p>
<p>Every turn and drop after that mysteriously hit the hardest on my side as our guide smirked and anxiously awaited my big fall. The one hour mark was our first rest stop and my thirst for extreme adventure had yet to be quenched. I egged on our guide with a challenge of getting me in and not upsetting our older guests.<span id="more-468"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-025.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-476" title="David - Costa Rica White Water 025" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-025.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=687" alt="" width="1024" height="687" /></a></p>
<p>We relaxed and enjoyed our snack of fruit, cookies and beverages on the river bank, but long and aggressive rapids were not far ahead and he guaranteed to give me the thrill I was seeking.</p>
<p>As we neared the end of the line, I wondered if he was going to live up to his promise, but I<a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-0451.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-477" title="David - Costa Rica White Water 045" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-0451.jpg?w=300&#038;h=201" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a> wasn&#8217;t aware of the 12 foot, class V drop that was going to conclude our journey. Due to the river&#8217;s topography, that part of the rapids can be skipped but my continued stupidity led our guide&#8217;s decision to take it head on.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in&#8221; is a rafting call that requires all participants to paddle in unison as hard and as fast as they can, but &#8220;all in&#8221; was taken literally when we reached the 12 foot drop. The back of the raft landed in the drop before the front of the raft, making me the first one out.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-028.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-478" title="David - Costa Rica White Water 028" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/david-costa-rica-white-water-028.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=687" alt="" width="1024" height="687" /></a></p>
<p>I knew I was under the drop and the raft was upside down. I knew I had to swim hard, away from the raft, and in one direction no matter what. What I didn&#8217;t realize was that Darren had fallen on top of me and I was pinned to the bottom of the river. Panic set in just before he was able to move and free me from the bottom; I frantically struggled to get out of the water and regain composure. Surfacing was a relief as I was able to get a breath but I still needed to swim hard and strong away from the falling water rushing down on top of me.</p>
<p>An instructor was guiding me by yelling and encouraging me to go in his direction. I finally reached him and he pulled me into a cave until the next raft completed the drop. The other riders in my raft, including my husband, were rather far up the river, comparatively. I joined the next raft until we could meet in an eddy and rejoin my group.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/white-water-rafting-063.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-479" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://lesleycarter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/white-water-rafting-063.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>My worried husband anxiously looked at me with fear and his eyes and I said, &#8220;I still have my paddle&#8221;, which was a good sign that I was ok.</p>
<p>At the end of the tour, we took a 55 minute drive back to the Rincon Corobici Restaurant where we had a delicious lunch waiting for us. I thanked the guide for giving me my just desserts and I had a better view of the rafting in Guanacaste.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get asked quite frequently about my “secrets” for time management because apparently I seem to look like I have it all together. This couldn’t be further from the truth and even I have moments of stress, panic and sheer exhaustion. But I have established some guidelines that I regard as my foundation for better time management that I’m more than happy to share. They’re not one-size fits all, but they fit perfectly into my life.</p>
<div id="attachment_119" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 440px"><a href="http://bennisinc.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/287940_1928947551108_1464780029_31717789_2645668_o.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-119  " title="Pinot the cat" src="http://bennisinc.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/287940_1928947551108_1464780029_31717789_2645668_o.jpg?w=430&#038;h=323" alt="" width="430" height="323" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My Office Assistant, Pinot sets a poor example of time management</p></div>
<p><strong>Keep a Weekly White Board</strong></p>
<p>I keep a white board in my office that’s divided into seven columns for each day of the week.  This allows me to visually map out my “Must-Get-Dones” for each day and set priorities for the week. Moving these tasks from my mental to-do list and to my white board has been a huge stress reliever and organizational tool. I can clear my mind long enough to focus on a single task and when I have time to move on to the next project or if something were to come up and change my plans, I can visually move around my tasks from day-to-day and change them as often as my schedule does. I also find myself completing tasks based on priority not based on ease or interest which I’ve found to be my own personal form of procrastination.</p>
<p><strong>Block Schedule Your Time</strong></p>
<p>All too often I would find myself in the same workday scenario. I would be trying to complete 4 tasks at once, have at least 8 pages open on my browser and be checking my email every 3 minutes. Not only was I not getting anything done, I was also causing myself more frustration and stress. The answer I found was to block-schedule my work time. I focus on what task I need to complete, estimate the appropriate time it should take me and schedule time on my calendar to work solely on that task until completion, just like I would schedule a meeting or conference call. And because I wouldn’t check my email in the middle of a meeting or hang up in the middle of a conference call, I am able to see one task through to completion and find myself with a better quality product in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Be Productive Even When You’re Not Working</strong></p>
<p>No one can be productive for 8+ hours straight. Ok, no HUMAN can be that productive…but we are just that—human. We need to take breaks and my best advice is that when you feel like you need 15 minutes away from the computer screen, take it and make it count. I use my breaks throughout the day to still do productive things that I <em>want</em> to get done, they just might not be work related. I’ll read through a magazine, clean, do laundry or browse Word Press and see what other people are writing about. By using these little breaks to knock routine or housekeeping items off of my list, I’m still gaining that moment of relaxation and mental clarity while clearing even more free time for myself in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Get Into a Routine</strong></p>
<p>As a freelancer and business owner, I set my own schedule. I COULD sleep in until 11am each morning or spend the afternoons shopping, but I don’t. I wake up earlier now than I ever did with a desk job. I exercise, eat breakfast and shower just like I would if I were going to an office. Then I use the first hour of my work day to complete routine business-building tasks. I browse the news, answer emails and update my social media. After one hour, no matter what, I stop. I then focus solely on client work and what my white board has laid out for me that day. My goals for the day are already outlined and I know exactly how much time I’ve allotted to complete each one. This structure in my day helps me to move forward and with greater speed and efficiency. Find whatever routine works for you, <em>but stick with it!</em></p>
<p><strong>Make the Most of Your Mornings</strong></p>
<p>Get up early. Get up two hours earlier than when you would normally feel like waking up. <strong>I promise you, this is some of the best advice I can give to anyone who wants to be successful.</strong> Those morning hours are ones you’ll never be able to make up for the rest of your day. If you wake up late, you’ll be playing “catch-up” until you finally crash into bed that night. Mornings are your time to knock as much off your to-do list as possible. If a crisis were to strike in the afternoon, you’ll be well-equipped to handle it without it causing other tasks to roll over to the next day. If you work hard enough in the mornings and find yourself with some free time in the afternoon, then that’s all yours! You paid the piper now enjoy it, guilt-free. Run an errand, exercise, check-in with a friend, nap or give into a guilty pleasure. Eventually this “free afternoon” reward will inspire you to <em>want</em> to work hard in the momings and if you use today’s free afternoon to work ahead on tomorrow’s tasks, you can “earn” an entirely free <em>day</em> later that week.</p>
<p><em>These guidelines aren’t easy or always fun. They take discipline and accountability. But I promise you, you’ll adjust to the early mornings and new routine and will be even more prepared to accommodate the future growth of your business, your family and all of the chaos that comes with it!</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summers always go by fast, but didn&#8217;t this year seem especially fleeting? Good thing we have football to make us feel better. As the calendar turns to late August, when I&#8217;m photographing all things gridiron, I think of the Better Than Ezra song &#8220;This Time of Year&#8221;.</p>
<p>It goes like this: <em>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a feeling in the air. Just like a Friday afternoon. Yeah, you can go there if you want, though it fades too soon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I had these lyrics in my head as I arrived at Nick Novak&#8217;s house in Forest Park this weekend. I was there to photograph a story about a 30-yard by 20-foot football field Novak carved out — complete with painted yardage markings — in the side lawn of his home for his kids to play on. In fact, all the neighborhood youngsters flock to it and Saturday was one of the first games of the season. Call it a <em>pre</em>season game as it&#8217;s a mixed-use facility that doubles as a Wiffleball field so Novak had just recently painted it. Appropriately stretched across one end zone is the family name &#8220;NOVAK&#8221;, while the other pays homage to the hometown heroes with an orange and blue block-lettered &#8220;BEARS&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was popcorn, and a scoreboard, and many of the kids wore the jerseys of their favorite professional players. Some parents sipped on cold beer and laughed as they watched from the sidelines. It&#8217;s Rockwell meets Lombardi, err Halas.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;So go on, let it be. If there&#8217;s a feeling coming over me, seems like it&#8217;s always understood this time of year.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Turns out Novak grew up directly across the street. The side yard that is now home to this mini mecca of the midway was once forbidden territory. As Novak recalls, the old man who previously lived there wasn&#8217;t too keen on letting him and his brother use the yard as a pass-through, much less a football field. Uncharted territory can manifest as the holy grail to young boys and so when the property — a two family residence — came up for sale a decade ago, the brothers Novak jumped at the chance to buy it. They thought they might stay a few years as they lived out their bachelorhood but neither moved and both are now married with families. It&#8217;s a full house, though no one seems eager to leave. And why would they? They&#8217;re having too much fun. </p>
<p>All this leads to one big family football affair and it plays out each week in that same side yard the Novaks were never allowed to set foot in as kids. They gather there now and play a game perfectly designed for this time of year. A time to huddle together outdoors and enjoy the company of one another before it&#8217;s too cold. Before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a football in the air, across a leaf blown field. Yeah, you can go there if you want, though it fades too soon.&#8221;</em><br />
