				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>We no longer enslave animals for food purposes.<br />
- Will Riker, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, &#8220;Lonely Among Us&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What do science fiction and going vegetarian or vegan have in common? Science fiction scholar Darko Suvin has coined the term <em>novum </em>(latin for &#8216;new thing&#8217;) in order to describe the (scientific) innovations and novelties distinguishing science fiction from fantasy fiction. To put it briefly, novum is an element by which the work is shown to exist in a different world than that of the reader or the spectator. It must be validated by cognitive logic, which means that the audience must be able to  extrapolate it of today&#8217;s science &#8211; if  the novum in question is the warp drive, for example. However, a novum can be something completely different that a scientific innovation: it can also be <strong>an idea</strong>, like elimination of gender in Ursula K. Le Guin&#8217;s classic <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> (1969). Even if these ideas were strange, in science fiction they are grounded in the world we know and therefore they are capable of <em>estranging</em> us from our everyday conceptions. The reader of Le Guin&#8217;s novel might think something along the lines of &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m familiar with the idea of gender, but&#8230; &#8216;The king was pregnant?&#8217; What the&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_67" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://theflexgeneration.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/romulan_ale.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-67 " style="margin:5px;" title="romulan_ale" src="http://theflexgeneration.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/romulan_ale.jpg?w=300&h=237" alt="" width="300" height="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What if we had Romulan ale in pubs in Tampere?</p></div>
<p>Since I was raised in a quite &#8220;ordinary&#8221; Finnish family, I feel that going vegetarian introduced a novum of one kind into this world. When I was a child, I ate animals almost every day: my favourite dishes included spaghetti bolognese (my father used to make the best sauce ever), chicken breast in sweet curry sauce (one of my mother&#8217;s bravuras) and fried Baltic herring fillets. Of course, we sometimes ate vegetarian dishes such as vegetable soups or cauliflower gratin, but giving up eating meat completely would have been a really<em> strange</em> idea &#8211; definitely like something out of a science fiction novel. So why did I ever choose going vegetarian?</p>
<blockquote><p>If we were to one day encounter a form of life more powerful and intelligent than our own, and it regarded us as we regard fish, what would be our argument against being eaten?<br />
- Jonathan Safran Foer, <em>Eating Animals</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What if, indeed? &#8220;What if&#8221; is one of the most common starting points for a science fiction work, and this is also why science fiction was once dubbed as a &#8220;literature of ideas&#8221;. This means that science fiction is not only concerned with science or fascinating new gadgets, but also with <strong>consequences</strong>. In science fiction, it is possible to explore and examine endless variety of ideas, and during the years science fiction has certainly taught me to weigh the consequences of my actions and choices in a much more intellectual way. Finally, it was not that hard to present the question myself: &#8220;What if I went vegetarian?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]here&#8217;s nothing like constructing a world, or recognising a constructed world, for teaching you to see your own world as a construct.<br />
- Gwyneth Jones, <em>Deconstructing the Starships</em></p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, constructing a coherent model of the world we live in is one of our primary &#8220;survival strategies&#8221;.  We tend to see the world as a neat and simple network of entities, events and causes, because it makes our life a lot easier. Unfortunately it also lets us forget that our model of the world is <strong>not natural</strong> or inevitable. Eating animals on a daily basis, or at all, is not necessary. Good fiction such as challenging science fiction novels reminds us that things do not necessarily have to be the way are. It is possible to invent something new, to ask new questions, and to make a change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just recently returned from a fifteen-day <a href="http://elbelbelb2000.blogtog.com/archives/6297_1579073640/359664">road trip</a> out West. Along the way, I ate amazing barbecue food in Kansas City, saw the <a href="http://EruditeExpressions.com/archives/6297_1579073640/359661">most gorgeous sunset in rural Kansas</a>, crossed paths with celebrity mechanics in Colorado, and made way too many photography <a href="http://EruditeExpressions.com/archives/6297_1579073640/359700">pit stops</a> while getting to the ultimate destination, Yellowstone National Park (where we spent seven days). I have been slowly editing the images I have taken in and around the park with my primary cameras (Canon 7D and Canon 5D Mark II) as individual posts on my photoblog, <a href="http://EruditeExpressions.com"><em>Erudite Expressions</em></a>; that <a href="http://EruditeExpressions.com/galleries/6297_1579073640/70471">Yellowstone gallery</a> is now complete. Here, I wanted to highlight some of the mobile photographs I captured during this trip, most of which were taken with <a href="http://statigr.am/eugenephoto">Instagram</a> on my iPhone.</p>
<div id="attachment_2800" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://readingbyeugene.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-09-06-11-44-12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2800" title="2012-09-06 11.44.12" src="http://readingbyeugene.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-09-06-11-44-12.jpg" alt="Stopping in rural Wyoming" width="490" height="490" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stopping in Rural Wyoming.</p></div>
<p>One of the most fruitful stops was this unassuming place called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cowboy-Cafe-Dubois-WY/116497418396181">Cowboy Cafe</a> in the town of Dubois, WY. Don&#8217;t let the tiny size fool you: the food here is spectacular. We met a group of people inside who said they&#8217;ve been coming to Dubois for fifteen years, and for every year they come, they have their breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. The <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60453-d511429-Reviews-Cowboy_Cafe-Dubois_Wyoming.html">TripAdvisor reviews</a> aren&#8217;t wrong here. This hole-in-the-wall is a must when stopping in Dubois (or perhaps even making a special visit out of your trip if you&#8217;re in the Jackson Hole/Grand Teton area). The pies here, made daily, are to die for.</p>

<p>Because of the wind gusts, it was a not-so-uncommon occurrence with people losing their hats at the park. Here, I document a white hat lost in the Grand Prismatic Spring area.

<p>We spent a few days in West Yellowstone, Montana. Among other things, the town is famous for these decorated bison found on its streets. You can read more about <a href="http://www.wyed.org/west_yellowstone_painted_buffalo_roam.htm">this initiative</a> here.</p>

<p>I took a late evening bike ride to the far edge of the city of West Yellowstone. I wound up on this rural road and saw an incredible sunset in the distance:</p>

<p>On the way back from Yellowstone, we took a different road: I-90 in Montana to I-25. We stopped in historic Sheridan, WY:</p>

<p>And what would a trip to Wyoming be without a stop in one of its greatest store specializing in barbed wire?</p>

<p>I have dozens of more mobile photos that I captured on this trip, but the significant ones I&#8217;ve profiled in this blog post. If you&#8217;re still curious to see more photos, I highly recommend checking out <a title="Yellowstone Gallery // Erudite Expressions" href="http://EruditeExpressions.com/galleries/6297_1579073640/70471" target="_blank">my Yellowstone Gallery</a> and reading through the captions of each individual post. This was an amazing road trip, if my photos are any indication <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">This is how my game went. It&#8217;s cool, Bella. I get you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://maybesomaryfaith.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/volleyball-ptsd-its-a-thing/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/e4HcWtTlrWg/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tonight I (very, very graciously) stepped in and played volleyball on a friend&#8217;s <strong>intramural team</strong>. They were short on their token girls and I guess I came to mind simply because <strong>I&#8217;m always workin&#8217; on muh fitness</strong>. HOWEVER, I was not a good choice and I said so repeatedly, but their only other option was to forfeit. So I sucked it up and drove over to the gym.</p>
<p><strong>I had a horrible feeling of dread in my stomach</strong>. This is pretty weird for me because while I know I&#8217;m not very good at volleyball, I also know I&#8217;m a fairly athletic person. I played soccer from the time I first learned to toddle around the field (rec, club, and school) until I graduated high school. I run obsessively. I work out daily. I can definitely figure out volleyball for one night and hang in there. So <strong>why in the world was I so nervous</strong>?</p>
<p>I opened the door to the gym, I swiped my student ID, and I made my way to the volleyball courts. Every step felt heavier than the last. <strong>You probably think I&#8217;m exaggerating. Let me assure you, I wish I were. </strong></p>
<p>Just as I was considering leaving, I was spotted. My friend bopped up to me, all smiles, and I followed her to what I was sure was my <strong>certain doom</strong>.</p>
<p>We started playing. The other team looked profesional. <strong>They were enormous! They had matching shirts. And kneepads</strong>. Oh God, why didn&#8217;t I have kneepads? Why didn&#8217;t a single person on my team have kneepads? This was going to be awful. The whistle blew, the ball was served. And so it began. And then it stopped. <strong>The stupid ref on her stupid tall chair was pointing at me and blowing her stupid whistle!</strong> I hadn&#8217;t even moved yet!</p>
<p>Turns out it was because I had earrings in. They were little tiny studs, but whatever. Also, about five other girls had on some sort of jewelry. Also whatever. The other team got a point because I was well accessorized. <strong>Not a good start</strong>.</p>
<p>We continued to play. I learned very quickly that I have not gotten any better over the years in which I have successfully avoided volleyball. Absence had not made my heart grow any fonder one bit. I hit the ball and it went backwards. I hit the ball and it slammed into the back of my teammate&#8217;s head. I hit the ball and it about knocked the stupid ref off of that stupid chair. <strong>We lost the first game</strong>. I decided not to hit the ball anymore.</p>
<p>We switched sides. Because we had the absolute minimum number or girls, we all had to remain on the court the entire time. <strong>No subs for us.</strong> I know all the men were super thrilled by that rule.</p>
<p>The second game. I learned that I know how to serve pretty okay. In fact, after the match, some of my teammates went on to refer to my serves as &#8220;decent&#8221;. We even won. This is because <strong>I did not attempt to touch the ball, not a single time.</strong> I moved away if it came flying towards me so that one of the more gifted players could swoop in and save us all.</p>
<p>Third game. The tie breaker. Apparently you only play to 15. Or something like that. We were winning. I was up at the net. We had 14 points, just one more until victory! Then that volleyball decided to take me out itself. It was coming towards me in slow motion. No one was there. I had to do something. I squinted up my eyes and&#8230; tapped it. It was more of a swat. <strong>Like a kitten that&#8217;s afraid of a bug.</strong> But it went over the net and <strong>WE WON!</strong></p>
<p>Now while this ball was moving at the rate of a handicapped tortoise, forcing me to decide how to act, I was able to think clearly. It suddenly came to me! <strong>I had an honest-to-goodness flashback, just like in the movies.</strong> I KNEW WHY I WAS AFRAID OF VOLLEYBALL.</p>
<p>It all dates back to elementary school. 5th grade. PE. We played volleyball (I mean&#8230; obviously) and it was awful. My teacher (who would be arrested a few months later for beating a kid on the playground) had tried to make an example of me because I was tall. <strong>This may be the most shocking thing I&#8217;ve said so far</strong> because I&#8217;m only 5&#8217;3&#8243;. But I was 5&#8217;3&#8243; then, too! Early growth spurt.</p>
<p>On top of being the awkward, lanky girl, I truly sucked at volleyball. But I wasn&#8217;t supposed to suck at volleyball DAMMIT, because I was TALL! And every class, <strong>this horribly intimidating man who I thought was actually Hulk Hogan (because they looked the same, complete with blonde handlebar mustache and bad tattoos)</strong> would stand me up in class and try to force me to demonstrate volleyball techniques. I failed. Always. Then this horribly intimidating man would yell. And I wanted to die.</p>
<p>We never played soccer in PE. Thank the Lord that was kept sacred.</p>
<p>So there you have it. I played volleyball. I <strong>unlocked a hidden mystery in my past</strong>. I conquered volleyball. Not too shabby for a Monday night.</p>
<p>xoxo</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How often do people that you encounter find it their God given duty to rain on your parade?  The most innocent, yet, positive comment is body slammed to wallow with them in their negative mud.</p>
<p>In the first baby soft moments I snuggled our grandson, a sleepy grin tugged at his full lips.  </p>
<p>“Ah, Bren’s smiling!” I gushed with enough sugar to turn him pre-diabetic. “He already loves his grandma.”</p>
<p>“Mom, it’s just gas,” spouted one of the ungrateful varmints I painfully birthed roughly a quarter of a century ago.</p>
<p>Had I not been totally spellbound by the much waited for and prayed over bundle of amazing I held in my arms, I would have pulled the portable soapbox from my back pocket and argued that flippant statement.</p>
<p>Who has proof that a baby&#8217;s smile is gas? I believe we can all agree, that gas has never made anyone chuckle.  Be extremely uncomfortable is more like it.  Wouldn’t we all love to release the anguish much like….could it be….a screaming baby?  Strange, how no one explains those shrieks away.</p>
<p>As Bren nodded off into his first slumber since arriving into his new world, couldn’t his smile been appreciation that someone rescued him after his long, hard journey? </p>
<p>Or maybe he was remembering the good ol’ days-mere hours prior? The toasty in-vitro warmth.  The yummy umbilical buffet system.  The comforting Pandora feed of his mama’s constant heart rhythms.</p>
<p>And what about the body of friends he left behind? Of course, they politely shifted to make room for him to grow.  But, how do we know what goes on in there? What if the Liver did stand up, and cracked the Pancreas up with “You know why the Spinal Column is so audacious?  Because he has a lot of nerve.”  Yes, cheesy enough to make the Colon groan.  But without them working together, our little guy wouldn’t have survived.  Wouldn&#8217;t there be fond memories with more longevity than a fleeting burp in the pants?</p>
<p>When awake, this little package of energy kicks his legs and waves his arms, Karate Kid style, as his sapphire eyes crinkle and his mouth breaks into beams of toothless happiness.  The innocent fullness of his heart kicks up its heels&#8212;until he’s informed that he’s only got indigestion.</p>
<p>Just gas? Pooh!</p>
<p>So, the next time someone puffs:</p>
<p>                “Yes, it’s finally raining, but it’s not going to be enough to matter,”</p>
<p>                 Or “That marriage is doomed,”</p>
<p>                Or “You’re going to try what?  Ridiculous!”</p>
<p>                Or “That situation is hopeless,” remember their point of view does not define the situation.</p>
<p>Their downer tone and  pinched look may indicate you need to offer them a glass of compassion and a handful of Tums.</p>
<p><em>Every day is a terrible day for a miserable person, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast. Proverbs 15:15</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reluctantly forced into a hostel in Amman, Jordan, but I ended up doing a day trip to the Dead Sea with the hostel owner and his family. I say day trip, but Khaled assured me it&#8217;d be best if we left about three in the afternoon. &#8220;Too hot, too hot,&#8221; he told me repeatedly. &#8220;During morning it okay but at 12 it too hot even for us. You pale, you fry like egg.&#8221; The Jordanian hostel owner grinned at me as I sat in the hostel&#8217;s communal area next to the breeze of a fan.</p>
<p>If Khaled hadn&#8217;t been so damnably nice and if he wasn&#8217;t going to drive me to the Dead Sea later, I might&#8217;ve been annoyed. I&#8217;d been in this part of the world for over a month now and I thought my skin was taking on a nice healthy UV-blasted tone. Here&#8217;s a picture of me from Petra the day before:</p>
<p><a href="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hill-at-petra.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-133" title="After Hike to Petra Viewpoint" src="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hill-at-petra.jpg?w=1024&h=663" alt="Looking Over Petra" width="1024" height="663" /></a></p>
<p>If I was pale, that one kid I knew at school must&#8217;ve been Albino 2.0.</p>
<p>I passed the early afternoon wandering the area around the hostel, which was located in the centre of the city. Everything seemed bland now. The market/souq crowds were a nuisance rather than the magical unity of vibrant lives that they had been in Jerusalem and Akko. I just wanted to elbow everyone in the ribs and step on as many toes as I could. And that one guy who smashed right into me in a rush to buy his pastries? I wanted to ram that piece of cake right up his&#8211;</p>
<p>Would you look at that? Nearly three already! I stopped dreaming up ways of murdering these probably lovely Jordanians and headed back to the hostel.</p>
<p>Khaled was on the stairs and babbled to me, &#8220;Come! Come! Hurry!&#8221; so I raced up the stairs, shoved a towel and some swim shorts in my backpack, and headed back out into the heat. Thankfully Khaled&#8217;s car was air-conditioned. It seemed to be the only thing that did work, although the radio did cooperate after a few swift thumps. &#8220;Piece of&#8211; how do you say in English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Piece of shit, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shrugged. We drove out of the city to a little suburb. He lived with his family in a really cute neighbourhood, a very &#8220;American dream&#8221; kind of area, if America was middle-eastern and Arabic-speaking. Get your head around that one, rednecks. We changed cars to something a little more functional and practical &#8211; a silver seven-seater Nissan. I turned around in my seat and was surprised to notice two little girls and a wife sitting behind me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, err, hi,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello English,&#8221; the little girls said. The wife just looked at me like I was some kind of museum curiosity, a Roman jug perhaps, or maybe a 5th-century Japanese bowl.</p>
<p>We drove for 20 minutes and then Khaled stopped the car in a two-lane road. He didn&#8217;t pull to one side or anything, just stopped in his lane. He got out and went into the tiny store that was basically a big metal shed by the side of the road. He came back out with a bunch of bananas and a handful of ice creams. He gave us all one of each. No, wait, he gave me an ice cream and two bananas. Quite a number of car horns were blaring behind us but Khaled stood in front of the car and waved happily at everyone.</p>
<p>I should mention here that he wasn&#8217;t taking me along with his family out of the kindness of his heart. No, it was in fact the case that I was paying the petrol money that enabled him to take his family out for the afternoon. Quite a lot of petrol money, I might add, but if it was paying for ice creams for us all I wasn&#8217;t going to begrudge him anything &#8212; a child&#8217;s smile is one of life&#8217;s most beautiful things, particularly if there&#8217;s ice cream all round it. Aww.</p>
<p><a href="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/walking-to-the-dead-sea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136" title="Walking to the Dead Sea" src="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/walking-to-the-dead-sea.jpg?w=1024&h=680" alt="Walking to the Dead Sea" width="1024" height="680" /></a></p>
<p>We got to the Dead Sea resort and I was stung for $16. Jordanians get in for $1 apiece and kids were probably free. It&#8217;s a good system I suppose but not every tourist has money dripping out of their ears  to form large puddles at their feet. I headed in and left Khaled and his family at the swimming pool &#8212; his wife and kids apparently hated the Dead Sea itself. I hopped into the changing rooms and changed into my swim shorts and shoved everything else into my backpack. There were no lockers so I brought the backpack with me. I headed downstairs and out to the Dead Sea. Everyone else hopped, skipped and jumped across the burning hot sand but I&#8217;d wisely kept my shoes on to this point.</p>
<p>I left my socks, shoes and backpack at the water&#8217;s edge &#8212; I&#8217;m a trusting person and I wasn&#8217;t expecting anyone to take a liking to my backpack &#8212; and headed into the murky Dead Sea.</p>
<p><a href="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dead-sea-resort.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-137" title="Dead Sea Resort" src="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dead-sea-resort.jpg?w=1024&h=680" alt="Dead Sea Resort" width="1024" height="680" /></a></p>
<p>Let me tell you, floating in water at the lowest point on earth is neat. It would&#8217;ve been better without the &#8220;holiday resort&#8221; feel to it but access to the Dead Sea is controlled (fenced off in most non-resort locations) and I had no real means of getting here without assistance anyway, so I owed Khaled a lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/floating-in-dead-sea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-138" title="Floating in the Dead Sea" src="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/floating-in-dead-sea.jpg?w=1024&h=582" alt="Floating in the Dead Sea" width="1024" height="582" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to explain what the sensation of floating is like. It&#8217;s relaxing, definitely, because you&#8217;re not expending any energy to keep yourself like that. It&#8217;s like lying down on the comfiest couch in the world, one that changes shape to suit you. But despite what that picture might suggest, it&#8217;s not so comfy as to give you a boner (that&#8217;s just air bubbles, I swear).</p>
<p>Floating in the Dead Sea is an experience you&#8217;ll just have to enjoy for yourself, but whatever you do, don&#8217;t get the water in your eyes. It happened to me twice, I&#8217;m not sure how, but goddamn does it sting. Imagine cutting yourself then pouring a spoonful of salt into the open wound, then imagine the wound was in your eye. All right, it&#8217;s not quite that bad, but I couldn&#8217;t open my eye for about 10 minutes after the incident without being in saline agony. It burns, man, it burns.</p>
<p>You can also scoop up the mud at the bottom of the Sea and rub it over yourself for some weird health reasons. I rubbed the thick, sludgy stuff over myself and ended up looking like Bigfoot&#8217;s anorexic cousin.</p>
<p>I stayed in the water a good few hours and then headed up to the pool. I swam for a while and watched the sun set.</p>
<p><a href="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sunset-in-the-pool.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-139" title="Sunset at the Dead Sea" src="http://comedytravelwriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sunset-in-the-pool.jpg?w=1024&h=594" alt="Sunset at a Dead Sea Resort" width="1024" height="594" /></a></p>
<p>Then it was time to go.</p>
<p>The kids fell asleep in the back of the car looking entirely content with everything. They&#8217;d enjoyed a great afternoon out of doing homework or playing in the house. As I watched the Jordanian landscape change from rural back to urban, I remembered day trips out from when I was a kid &#8211; to Wicksteed Park or to the beach or caravanning in Wales watching the rain batter the windows as we played Uno or Monopoly. Me and my brother always fell asleep in the back of the car on the ride home, tired and content. I realised that, despite the language and the country and the climate and a thousand other things, this culture was entirely familiar.</p>
<p>The world isn&#8217;t as big as we think it is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After considerable self analysis, I have determined that I am neither scary nor obsessed with popularity. Both theories get put to the test regularly while photographing skittish animals.</p>
<p>Wildlife may tolerate my presence from a distance but only until I’m almost close enough to take a photo. Then the place clears out like I am a skunk that raised its tail. The longer my lens, the sooner this happens. I have no idea how they do all that math so quickly!</p>
<p>I could dress up in camouflage and hide but since I have also determined I am a confident person, I choose regular rejection instead.</p>
<p>I have learned to not take this personally. I just delete many photos of blurry animal butts rapidly leaving the scene. I will confess it gets tiresome watching wildlife flee as if their life depended on it. You would think I was scary!</p>
<p>But every once in awhile, a wild creature will be curious about what I am doing. That’s what happened with these two deer last week. As I walked around to find an unobstructed view, they turned to watch me and struck this interesting pose. In fading light, I had to quickly fire away before the young deer quickly lost interest and turned away.</p>
<p>Now it’s one thing to be wrongly perceived as a threat – it’s quite another to be considered boring. I wonder if there’s a support group for that?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s tackle an issue everyone has to deal with sometime: Jerks.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the guy at work who lords his higher spot on the totem pole over everyone else, or the girl who gossips loudly about other people, or perhaps the meat-head who makes fun of a shy person with a lisp. Assholes are out there. And they always will be.</p>
<p>It’s best to be prepared.</p>
<p>I don’t like confrontation, so believe you me, I’m not recommending we get up in the face of every jackass who says or does something mean. In fact, the key to these moves isn’t direct conflict at all. It&#8217;s all about understatement. The idea here is to throw the person psychologically off balance with weird, quiet, out-of-context reactions to their bad behavior. Even better, do it in front of a crowd, just to make the meanie extra uncomfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p><strong>1. Shhh…</strong></p>
<p>I just love this one. It’s great for when the person is blithering on arrogantly about their super-high standardized test scores or their naturally smooth hair or their golf prowess or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s easy: As the person is droning on about who-cares-what, just gaze into their eyes and mash your finger against their lips and whisper, <em>“shhhhhhhh.”</em></p>
<p>But not in a “shut up” way. In a <em>“please, my dear, say no more, for I can hear the words of your heart even when your lips are not moving,” </em>way<em>.</em></p>
<p>(“But that reaction makes no sense,” you might say. Yes. That’s the point. Assholes don’t like it when they try to goad people into one reaction but get another.)</p>
<div id="attachment_1143" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide13.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1143 " title="Dumb and Dumber" src="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide13.jpg" alt="Dumb and Dumber" width="480" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shhhh&#8230; Say no more. Your words enter my spirit through the air without sound.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p><strong>2. One Slow Tear</strong></p>
<p>This is another good one for when you&#8217;re held hostage by an endless rant.</p>
<p>It’s NOT full-on crying you’re going for here. No quivering lip, no sobs, no sound. In fact, no facial expression at all. Make your face completely blank. You’re a statue, devoid of feeling… THEN! Conjure one single tear and let it spill out of your unblinking eye and roll down your face. Even the most self-absorbed snotmonkey cannot help but be put off guard by your show of strangely emotionless emotion in response to his monologue on why he hates waiters who touch his plate.</p>
<p>This move is absolutely creeptastic, but it does take a lot of facial control. I recommend practicing it in the mirror every morning. You never know when you’ll need it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1144" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1144 " title="Litter is sad." src="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide2.jpg" alt="Litter is sad" width="480" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Remember the Crying Indian? Pretend you&#8217;re him and someone just told you about litter. Channel stone-faced, contained non-rage.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p><strong>3. The Unrelated Question</strong></p>
<p>This is best for when the mean person has just delivered what they believe to be a real zinger. Right when they’re basking in the afterglow of their one-liner and they’re waiting for everyone to high-five them for their cleverness – that’s your moment. Just wait a beat or two, blink a few times, and then pose a total non-sequitur, like this:</p>
<p><em>“I can’t help but wonder… Are the invisible eyeballs of our ancestors watching us from the clouds?”</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1145" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1145   " title="&quot;So, if you're from Africa, why are you white?&quot;" src="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide3.jpg" alt="&quot;So, if you're from Africa, why are you white?&quot;" width="450" height="338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Think Amanda Seyfried&#8217;s character in Mean Girls and how she threw everyone off balance with her spacey questions.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>
<p><strong>4. Unexpected Affection</strong></p>
<p>I’ll give you a money-back guarantee on this one. When it comes to taking the wind out of some bastard&#8217;s sails, this does not fail. Now, it could get you punched. But everything comes with risks.</p>
<p>The best way to time it is to wait until the person says something completely snide and awful to or about someone. The kind of thing that <em>should </em>make everyone around them haul off and slap them across the mouth, but never does, because people like this seem to have a force-field of compliance around them.</p>
<p>You go in for a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hug</span>.</p>
<p>I recommend leaning in for an extra-long moment of uncomfortable bonding. Again, it&#8217;s dissonance we&#8217;re after here. That person is trying to get a rise out of everyone by acting like a prick. Instead, you’re going to be a freaky, huggy love monster.</p>
<p>Then just step back and maybe stir your drink and start whistling. Look up like nothing just happened. If they start up again, just hug again. Hug and hug and hug.</p>
<div id="attachment_1146" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1146 " title="Talladega Nights: An Allegorical Piece of Cinema for the Ages" src="http://imissyouwheniblink.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/slide4.jpg" alt="Talladega Nights: An Allegorical Piece of Cinema for the Ages" width="480" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hug thine enemy.</p></div>
<p>Good luck.</p>
