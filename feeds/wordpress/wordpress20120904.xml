				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thethingaboutflying.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/spotify-674281_620x258-e1345746920584.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3392" title="Spotify" src="http://thethingaboutflying.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/spotify-674281_620x258-e1345746920584.jpg?w=300&h=124" alt="" width="300" height="124" /></a></p>
<p>The other night I took a momentary break from trying to sleep to check my Twitter feed. Boredom, Annoyance, and Exhaustion colluded in keeping me awake by calling their pal Debate, who crashed the party in that gleeful way of his. Two friends were having a &#8220;conversation&#8221; &#8211; the limitations of Twitter or any other social network w/r/t actually conversing should be apparent &#8211; about Spotify, the value we place on music, and our responsibilities &#8211; or lack thereof &#8211; as music consumers. Part of the discussion was centered on <a title="Derek Webb" href="http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense" target="_blank">this piece by Christian artist Derek Webb </a>. I jumped in (giving up on any hope of sleep for the time being), and pretty soon, we were filling up the timeline. For the sake of this piece, I&#8217;m going to focus primarily on my thoughts rather than trying to recreate or fully incorporate the views of my two friends. In this way, I hope to avoid putting words into anyone&#8217;s mouth, while leaving the door open for a future guest post that might offer some alternate perspective.</p>
<p>The following questions either came up in our discussion or occurred to me later that night as I lay awake, my brain still humming from the back-and-forth.</p>
<p><strong>1. What, if any, legitimate reasons are there for pirating music?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Knowing what I now know about Spotify (see the Derek Webb piece), how do I feel about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. How are we to adequately value music and compensate artists?</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. What, if any, responsibilities do consumers have towards artists?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tackle them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> My gut reaction is a strong &#8216;no.&#8217; There was a time where I would have said that for discovery purposes, pirating music would be alright. In college, I illegally downloaded a ton of music. In a huge majority of the cases, if I liked what I heard, I went out and bought the artist&#8217;s output on CD, and if not, I just deleted the files from my computer. No harm, no foul. The only problem is that, on occasion, I wouldn&#8217;t actually follow through and delete an album, even one I wasn&#8217;t crazy about. In this way, I accrued a pretty sizable collection of music that I hadn&#8217;t paid anything for. I used all kinds of rationalizations to justify the presence of these files. I&#8217;d tell myself that I was just extending the &#8220;trial period&#8221; to see if the artist grew on me, or that since I bought a ton of music legitimately, a comparably few downloaded albums wasn&#8217;t a big deal. It was all BS, of course. Even though this system did result in the discovery and support of a LOT of artists who I may never have otherwise gotten into, I was playing with fire, tempting myself at every turn to just burn a CD from illegally downloaded files rather than shell out money at the used music store on a hard copy.</p>
<p>At this point, I haven&#8217;t downloaded any commercially available music in a long time. I do still download the odd bootleg now and then, but only from artists who have given their blessing for tapers to circulate their shows for free via online trading communities. There are just too many other avenues by which to discover artists now to make the practice tenable. Both the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 Store offer recommendations based on past purchase and viewing history, extended listens of individual songs, Facebook (and, somehow, even MySpace) serve as solid discovery platforms and have led to more and more artists offering free streams of some of their music to inform consumers before they buy. This is all not to even mention streaming services (both free and paid), but I&#8217;ll get to that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, acquiring something of value (which music obviously does, both commercially, culturally, and &#8211; just maybe &#8211; spiritually) without payment is not only illegal, but immoral.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>If what Webb says about Spotify is true (and I have no reason not to believe him), then it does an awful job of compensating the artists who make it such a potentially valuable commodity. I&#8217;ll confess that the internet-as-model-for-music-distribution story has yet to be written in its entirety, but what long looked to be the answer (offering consumers the chance to listen to music on-demand via a streaming services and paying artists per stream) suddenly seems much shakier as a long-term solution. The discovery aspect, as Webb mentions, is all well and good, but the service itself doesn&#8217;t make it worth it for the artist to be sought out, because more times than not, Spotify users (other streaming services may offer greater incentive to the artists &#8211; subscription service Rhapsody, for example) substitute sitting at their computer and streaming the artists&#8217; songs (which they can do thousands of times before the author sees anything resembling adequate per-song compensation) for actually buying the music.</p>
<p>This gets back to the illegal download gambit. If you use Spotify with the express purpose of seeking out new music to buy, then it would seem not to approach the ethical cliff that it might otherwise (it seems like a cliff to me, anyway). But, just like with the &#8220;promise&#8221; I made about illegal downloading, you would have to be pretty resolute to ensure that you didn&#8217;t just end up using Spotify as a personal on-demand radio station when you sit at your computer, rather than as a means to more substantial support of artists you enjoy.</p>
<p>Webb points out that Spotify goes a long way towards assuaging any potential guilt on the part of users because it&#8217;s not technically stealing, and so users&#8217; consciences are clear, even as the artists receive a paltry compensation for their art. This seems like dangerous ground to me. It simultaneously devalues music by giving it away for basically nothing, and lulls consumers into thinking that they&#8217;re doing just enough to avoid feeling bad about that fact. Perhaps Spotify should only be seen as a tool, to be used for good or ill. I&#8217;m not totally convinced of that, though.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>The other night I accused my friend of taking a relativistic approach in his attitude towards artist compensation. He shot back, asking where exactly I had found absolutism regarding the value of music (I know I said I wouldn&#8217;t try to present my friends&#8217; views directly here, but he raises a valid point). I&#8217;ll concede that, as far as I&#8217;m aware, God has yet to offer his two cents (no pun intended), about what exactly a song or album should cost. However, as I said earlier, music has value (if you somehow have convinced yourself that intellectual property should not be recognized in any form, then we need to have a slightly different conversation), even if it doesn&#8217;t happen to be 99¢ per song or $9.99 an album. If we accept that music has value, and that, culturally, items of value require compensation &#8211; determined by the market, in almost every instance &#8211; then we must accept that music should be bought, and for a price that is both inviting to consumers and rewarding to artists. 0.00029 cents per stream meets neither of these criteria, and, obviously, paying nothing through piracy doesn&#8217;t either. I get that Spotify and the Pirate Bay are great deals for consumers, but they blatantly ignore what we should know to be fair. To argue that the consumer alone should be the key factor in determining what music is worth is to undermine the economic principles that have governed commerce &#8211; if you cringe at art being commercialized, sorry, but it&#8217;s been that way for hundreds of years (as Nick Hornby points out, Shakespeare wrote for money) &#8211; for ages.</p>
<p>By that specious logic, people with banged up cars should be able to tell mechanics how much their repairs should cost. That isn&#8217;t the way things work, and, believe it or not, it&#8217;s a good thing. Let&#8217;s face it, if people found a way to acquire car repairs that didn&#8217;t compensate the mechanic in any reasonable way, but simultaneously cost them (the consumer) little to nothing, they would take advantage, devaluing the service that mechanics provide AND lessening the incentive to offer that service in the first place. Who in their right mind would devote time, energy, and effort to enter the field of mechanics and attempt to get better at their jobs if the <em>knew</em> that the people enjoying their services had no interest in compensating them so that they might practice their vocation &#8211; if we&#8217;re being optimistic &#8211; without the pressing financial concerns that come with not get paid for doing the thing you feel called to do? A popular claim about artists &#8211; but not <em>among</em> them, curiously &#8211; is that artists should just love what they do enough to do it anyway, and if they&#8217;re seeking compensation for their art, then they cease to be &#8220;true artists,&#8221; whatever that&#8217;s supposed to mean. What arrogance! Dance for me, monkey! Entertain me! And I&#8217;ll offer you little-to-nothing in return, which you should be thrilled about, because, after all, artists should create without any concern for recompense.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get a couple of things straight. Artists <em>do</em> create because they love what they do, and they would probably do it anyway (as someone who has written one book and is 80,000 words into writing a novel, both of which will likely never, ever be published, I can vouch for this), but to assume that they should be happy in that toil, and that seeking to make a living by doing what they love somehow cheapens their art is insulting in the worst way. When we pay for an artists&#8217; work, be they painter, author, musician, or whatever, we are buying more than just the canvas or the book or the album, we&#8217;re buying time. We&#8217;re providing them with the  space in which to create, free &#8211; at least to some degree &#8211; from worrying about day-to-day financial survival. Money is approval, whether we like it or not, but it&#8217;s also a way to provide artists with the opportunity to continue to create &#8211; for themselves and for us. Which leads me to&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>None, as long as consumers have no interest whatsoever in the further creation of art. If they do, then you&#8217;d better believe the responsibility is immense; we should be crawling over each other to offer artists support. In past centuries, promising artists&#8217; work was funded through benefactors. I don&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;s a lot of benefacting going around these days, but if you happen to know any, or happen to be one yourself, please email me. Government groups like the National Endowment for the Arts constantly see their budgets, much of which already go to programs that encourage arts education and working artists, slashed. There is no magic fairy out there, keeping artists afloat. If we want to encourage great art, we must show that we value it. If we don&#8217;t, we can expect artists to struggle more and more to gain the traction necessary to get their work into the hands of even moderately large numbers of people. If we refuse to acknowledge the value of art <em>and</em> artists themselves, then, eventually, we will get what we&#8217;ve paid for: nothing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did I tell you about the time I set a <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">geocaching scavenger hunt</a> through the city for the boy I was infatuated with? Starting from Cambridge Boat Club, and directed solely with GPS coordinates, he was led to several locations, rewarded with different alcoholic treasures along the way. I waited for him, freezing, atop the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-hill-monument-somerville">Prospect Hill Monument</a>, the conclusion of the hunt.</p>
<div>The whole thing went terribly awry, actually. His GPS app was different than the one I had used to set the trail (which you think wouldn&#8217;t think would make a difference <em>because</em> <em>they&#8217;re GPS coordinates</em>), and he got fairly lost. Twice. And an adventure that should have taken thirty minutes stretched to an hour and then some.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_613" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 520px"><a href="http://inthegates.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/picture-81.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-613" title="Picture 8" src="http://inthegates.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/picture-81.png" alt="" width="510" height="272" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I might have miscalculated the beer.</p></div>
</div>
<div>But he made it. He hurriedly ascended the mock castle steps, looking slightly irritated, yet proud that he had solved my stupidly convoluted puzzle. And then he kissed me.</div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>I have never experienced the reciprocal equivalent of this story. Which is fine in the case of the above situation; all memories of that relationship are covered in a viscous, permeating filth that rotted every fond affection that bore those memories anyway. But in the grand scheme of my existence, I have never been the recipient of a gesture of romantic affection. I have never had a Valentine, received flowers, been given a sweet note.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>I have never inspired love.</div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>This eviscerates me. Even typing these words induces a crushing sensation in my chest, or what I imagine it would feel like if my pulmonary system were placed inside a Space Bag and the connected Shop-Vac switched on.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_611" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px"><a href="http://inthegates.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/heart-in-a-bag2.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-611  " title="Heart in a Bag" src="http://inthegates.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/heart-in-a-bag2.jpeg?w=384&h=288" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can find anything on the Internets!</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This past week seemed to mark the tipping point for those in my social network in terms of them getting serious with their significant others. In the last three days alone, Facebook informed me of four engagements. (My older friends warned me of this. Next comes weddings, then, babies, plastered all over your Newsfeed.) It&#8217;s not that I am anything but ecstatic for their collective happiness—I really am. And, as you may recall, matrimonial union is <a href="http://inthegates.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/fears%E2%80%93irrational-rational/"><em>not</em> my idea of a fun time</a>. But it does serve as a cutting reminder of a feeling I have so earnestly hoped for, yet failed to evoke.</div>
<div></div>

</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If taking the mathematical approach, when all the factors of my 25 years is distilled into its constants, the lowest common denominator is&#8230;me. Thus, logically speaking, there is something inherently defective about me that has resulted in this sorry state of solitude.</div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>This is not news. But it is there that I am baffled. For I have searched—honestly and achingly—for what this defect is, that I might correct it and maybe one day finally understand the sentiment behind Eric Clapton&#8217;s &#8220;Wonderful Tonight.&#8221; And while I have found many inadequacies, none are so unique or horrid as to explain why I seem to be such a leper to the opposite sex.</div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>At least I don&#8217;t think they are.</div>
<div><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>I can see the encouraging Facebook comments now:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;You&#8217;re a beautiful person, Katie.&#8221; <em>—an older friend (40+), possibly an aunt</em></li>
<li>&#8220;Love will find you when you least expect it.&#8221; <em>—English/philosophy major</em></li>
<li>&#8220;I looove you!!&#8221; —<em>a girl</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In advance, please know that I am deeply appreciative of your kindness. But save it. What I really need is some good, old-fashioned constructive criticism. Even though ego-stroking is largely what I designed this blog for, it will get me no where in solving this particular problem. (In fact, it would actually make matters worse.) So lay it on me, thick and unforgiving. Help me dig out of this hole.</p>
<p>Because I want to stop writing this morose shit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In August, WordPress.com bloggers hit us with their best: Smart takes on the month&#8217;s biggest stories. Thoughtful musings on culture. Photographs and art that bring the world to life.</p>
<p>The following ten picks represent what Freshly Pressed is all about: original content that engages readers, timely posts that contribute to a larger discussion, and personal writing that resonates with others. Enjoy!</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/2012/08/15/faces-of-iran-2/">Glimpses of Iran</a></h3>
<p>This photo essay documents quiet, unexpected moments of daily life in Iran and captures the delicious details and textures of Yzad and elsewhere. The collection of six photographs illustrates quality over quantity—each image is strong, well-composed, and tells its own story.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/2012/08/15/faces-of-iran-2/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12039" title="quintin lake" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/quintin-lake.png" alt="" width="620" height="414" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://beamagazine.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/patricia-heaton-the-middle-feminism-abortion/">Frankie V. Debra, Roe V. Wade: Patricia Heaton&#8217;s Two Famous Moms, and Can You Still Be a Feminist If You&#8217;re Anti-Abortion?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But I’m still happy to be in their gang, because we don’t all have to think the same.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This post examines hot-button topics—abortion and feminism—through an original and nuanced discussion of actress Patricia Heaton. We are impressed with the blogger&#8217;s honesty, respectful but confident voice, and willingness to ask questions; these elements encourage readers to comment and join the discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://beamagazine.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/patricia-heaton-the-middle-feminism-abortion/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12046" title="bea magazine 2" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bea-magazine-2.png" alt="" width="620" height="353" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://aviatrixkim.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/thinking-of-new-orleans/">Thinking of New Orleans</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why do we turn to these stories? For shelter. We need an explanation, because “<em>It happened for no reason at all</em>” is somehow too horrifying to face.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In this reflection on Hurricane Katrina, writer/photographer Kim weaves thoughts on Louisiana, loss, and the film <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>. We especially like her musings on how we create stories to cope, and to make sense of why things happen in the world. Her gallery of evocative images of New Orleans complements the piece.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://aviatrixkim.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/thinking-of-new-orleans/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12047" title="the greenery 2" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/the-greenery-2.png" alt="" width="620" height="351" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://meisterblogger.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/armstrong-is-probably-guilty-but-it-is-definitely-meaningless/">Armstrong Is Probably Guilty, But It Is Definitely Meaningless</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This whole long, sordid episode ends in two competing realities. The first is that Armstrong – despite his protests – likely is guilty. The second is that doesn’t matter if he is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After introducing the story on Lance Armstrong&#8217;s battle with the US Anti-Doping Agency, Mark presents an opinionated yet fair take on doping in cycling (and touches on other sports, too). He admits he is not an Armstrong fan, which further illustrates a balanced approach to the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://meisterblogger.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/armstrong-is-probably-guilty-but-it-is-definitely-meaningless/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12049" title="meister blogger 2" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/meister-blogger-2.png" alt="" width="620" height="378" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://joeberhardt.com/2012/08/28/authors-behaving-badly-the-seedy-underbelly-of-reviewing/">Authors Behaving Badly: The Seedy Underbelly of Reviewing</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a writer, I’m not comfortable with the idea of someone writing a review of my book if they haven’t read it. I’m not writing so people can pat me on the back, I’m writing because I have stories I want people to read.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, Jo offers her thoughts on an interesting publishing story: an entrepreneur who set up a business in which authors pay him to write a positive review. Solidly written and thorough, the post leads to a discussion for both writers and readers alike. We like how she asks questions at the end to help launch a healthy debate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://joeberhardt.com/2012/08/28/authors-behaving-badly-the-seedy-underbelly-of-reviewing/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12051" title="happy logophile" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/happy-logophile.png" alt="" width="620" height="370" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://formingthethread.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/republican-todd-akin-dont-worry-you-wont-get-pregnant-from-rape/">Republican Todd Akin: Don&#8217;t Worry, You Won&#8217;t Get Pregnant From Rape</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The point is, this is a decision that most deeply affects the victims of rape; those victims have to live with the outcomes of that decision as well as the effects of the crime itself; and those women should be allowed to make the decision that is best for them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>August saw no lull in controversy in the news, and WordPress.com bloggers confronted these issues head on. A post tackling a hot-button issue can become polarized—even angry—but this take on Todd Akin&#8217;s statement on rape is at once passionate and professional.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://formingthethread.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/republican-todd-akin-dont-worry-you-wont-get-pregnant-from-rape/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12052" title="forming the thread" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/forming-the-thread.png" alt="" width="620" height="370" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://daddy-drinks.com/2012/08/16/lie-to-me-five-lies-im-proud-of-telling-my-kids/">Lie to Me: Five Lies I&#8217;m Proud of Telling My Kids</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>“Actually, Timmy, there’s a really, really good chance that you won’t be an astronaut. Considering your complete inability to understand long division, you’re probably going to sell cars when you grow up. Now let’s talk about Santa Claus.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Readers enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek list about the lies one father tells his kids. Whether or not you are a parent, you can relate to this lighthearted post, and will likely recall your own childhood and wonder: <em>did my parents lie to me?!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://daddy-drinks.com/2012/08/16/lie-to-me-five-lies-im-proud-of-telling-my-kids/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12053" title="daddy drinks" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/daddy-drinks.png" alt="" width="620" height="375" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://emptybees.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/rethinking-sleeping-beauty/">Rethinking Sleeping Beauty</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before she pricks her finger, she hesitates, her hand outstretched, but then at Maleficent’s urging, she finally touches the spindle. I’ve always preferred to think that she did it on purpose, not just because she was under a spell. I like to see it as an act of rebellion, a refusal to go from Briar Rose to Aurora quite yet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We like how Melissa uses a childhood tale to express ideas about coming of age. Musings are particularly resonant when a writer takes something familiar—such as the story of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>—to illustrate observations on a more personal level. As a result, she engages with her readers, who have made their own connections through her insights.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://emptybees.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/rethinking-sleeping-beauty/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12054" title="empty bees" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/empty-bees.png" alt="" width="620" height="380" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://childhoodrelived.com/2012/08/21/when-saturday-mornings-meant-something/">When Saturday Mornings Meant Something</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Cartoons</em><strong><em> – </em></strong>the word, the concept, the feeling, the religion — is dead.  Dead and obsolete like the Gothic-arched mouse hole where Jerry took refuge.  Drowned in a sea of endless animation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This homage to old-school Saturday morning cartoons left readers swimming in a sea of nostalgia. <em>He-Man! Dungeons and Dragons! </em>The shows of Hanna-Barbera! The sharp and entertaining commentary and palpable passion for the subject contribute to this well-received post.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://childhoodrelived.com/2012/08/21/when-saturday-mornings-meant-something/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12055" title="childhood relived" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/childhood-relived.png" alt="" width="620" height="367" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://neilslorance.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/for-neil/">For Neil.</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rest in peace other Neil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re always on the lookout for original artwork: illustrations, paintings, sketches, and more. Shortly after learning of Neil Armstrong&#8217;s death, (another) Neil shared an illustration celebrating the famed astronaut. The piece is just as much about Armstrong as it is about the artist himself, and this makes the post timely as well as touching.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://neilslorance.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/for-neil/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-12101" title="the other neil" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/the-other-neil-full.png" alt="" width="386" height="602" /></a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)&#8221; &#8211; Walt Whitman, &#8220;Song of Myself&#8221; from Leaves of Grass</em></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure: As Jesse Pinkman might say, this writeup has mad spoilers for the half-season finale, yo. Read at your own risk.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; has made many allusions to poet Walt Whitman&#8217;s work and the show writers have connected these poems to the actions of the show&#8217;s anti-hero, the closely-named Walter White. In seasons 3 and 4, Walt&#8217;s relationship with his would-be-meth-lab-turned-murder victim Gale Boetticher is summed up in Gale&#8217;s notebook scribblings of &#8220;When I heard the learn&#8217;d astronomer.&#8221; These notes are later found by Walt&#8217;s DEA brother-in-law Hank, who wonders who the elusive &#8220;W.W.&#8221; is, and Walt quickly pins Gale&#8217;s notebook worship on the poet, and not on himself.</p>
<div id="attachment_425" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 150px"><a href="http://filmrascal.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/acf2964.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-425 " title="ACF2964" src="http://filmrascal.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/acf2964.jpg" alt="the original heisenberg?" width="140" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walt Whitman, in a hat that Heisenberg would covet.</p></div>
<p>The Whitman influence was never as potent as last night&#8217;s half-season finale, &#8220;Gliding Over All,&#8221; when Hank finds out who the real &#8220;W.W.&#8221; is after he skims an inscribed copy of  &#8221;Leaves of Grass&#8221; (once given by Gale to Walter)  that was left rather carelessly in Walter&#8217;s bathroom, presumably left there by Walt (perhaps for some late-night commode sessions). The episode was all about Walter making his family &#8220;legitimate&#8221; (Michael Corleone-style) as he &#8220;Godfather&#8221;-ed a hit on Gus&#8217; old crew in jail and made good on his promise to Skyler that their family could reap safety and security in Walt&#8217;s meth-sowing.  The episode is named for a Whitman poem, and the title seems to reference Walter&#8217;s deity-like power in creating and controlling deaths around him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GLIDING o&#8217;er all, through all,<br />
Through Nature, Time, and Space,<br />
As a ship on the waters advancing,<br />
The voyage of the soul&#8211;not life alone,<br />
Death, many deaths I&#8217;ll sing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With all of these Whitman references, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine that perhaps Walter has been taking cues from <a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/Maps/poets/s_z/whitman/song.htm">the poem &#8220;Song of Myself&#8221;</a> throughout this season and it would perhaps give better insight to his actions. &#8220;Song of Myself,&#8221; a poem found in &#8220;Leaves of Grass,&#8221; is a celebration of self &#8212; as an omniscient, universal form of self. By all means, I am no Whitman scholar or expert, but after reading this poem, it seems prescient in Walter&#8217;s actions this season. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the lines, shall we?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I CELEBRATE myself, and sing myself,<br />
And what I assume you shall assume&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread<br />
of my own body&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This entire season has been about Walter assuming his alter-ego Heisenberg fulltime in the aftermath of Gus&#8217; murder. He becomes cocksure in his words and actions with his partners Jesse and Mike. Walter lords over Skyler and keeps her captive and complicit in their marriage. He buys himself expensive cars and flaunts large purchases to  Hank. Walter&#8217;s ego has become godlike.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br />
Hoping to cease not till death.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter is 51 years old and he&#8217;s nowhere near perfect health because of his yearlong battle with cancer &#8212; this much is true. However, he finds a certain stamina from continuing to cook meth. Even when he gets out of debt to Jesse and makes thousands (and later, presumably millions as evidenced by Skyler&#8217;s mad stacks of storage unit cash), Walter finds great joy in cooking and tries to drive his partners to continue even when it becomes increasingly dangerous to stay in the business. Walter has escaped death many times on the show, and he himself has been the cause or catalyst for death. Until last night&#8217;s episode, he probably would have continued cooking until his death, if not for Skyler&#8217;s insistence to stop.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,<br />
Nature without check with original energy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter&#8217;s narcissism is out of control this season. He threatens new business associates. And when his partners are out (Mike murdered by Walter&#8217;s hand and Jesse through his own decision to get the hell out), Walter is nature without check. &#8221;"There is no &#8216;we,&#8217; Jesse,&#8221; Walter tells his former partner in the final episode. &#8220;I am the only vote left.&#8221; This is never more clear when Walter orders a massive jail hit, seemingly inspired by &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; when Michael Corleone orders the deaths of the heads of the five Mob families. He&#8217;s taken cues from gangster movies this season, and has become a don, a god, in his own mind. Walter White is a mere mortal, but Heisenberg could live forever in the &#8220;empire-making business.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,<br />
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised<br />
and naked,<br />
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,<br />
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter&#8217;s anxiety over getting caught in the meth-making business has been one of his defining characteristics on the show. He&#8217;s gone to great lengths to keep his identity secret throughout the show, including wearing masks  (perhaps most notably when he and Jesse kidnapped Saul in season 2, and in the season 5 opener during the magnets heist). But throughout most of this season, his ego has made him not only thirsty for recognition, but seemingly untouchable and reckless with his identity getting caught up in this. Walter brings the methylamine supply to the car wash. He leaves Gale&#8217;s book in his bathroom with the damning inscription. He asks for recognition from other drug lords (&#8220;Say my name,&#8221; he demands in the penultimate season 5 episode to Declan, Mike&#8217;s meth contact. &#8220;You&#8217;re Heisenberg.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re goddamn right.&#8221;). Perhaps the most symbolic imagery of Walter&#8217;s love of his alter-ego is when he chooses to wear his Heisenberg hat (once reserved only for drug deals) out in public throughout season 5.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br />
And what do you think has become of the women and children? &#8230; They are alive and well somewhere, The smallest sprout shows there is really no death &#8230; All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The drug business is a dirty one, and Walter has to make justifications throughout the series for the deaths that happen. He tells Skyler that Gus&#8217; death was necessary. He tries to comfort Jesse that the deaths they&#8217;ve caused (including a child&#8217;s) were necessary to making it in their meth empire.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am given up by traitors,<br />
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the<br />
greatest traitor,<br />
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me<br />
there&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough! enough! enough!<br />
Somehow I have been stunn&#8217;d. Stand back!<br />
Give me a little time beyond my cuff&#8217;d head, slumbers,<br />
dreams, gaping,<br />
I discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walt refuses to kowtow to anyone throughout this season &#8212; to his partners, to his lawyer, to his wife&#8217;s pleas, to the new business associates.  And when others refuse to venerate Walter, he shuts them out of his world. He sees them as enemies. He&#8217;s cold to Jesse when his partner wants out. And when Mike tries to knock Walter down  few notches for not knowing &#8220;his place.&#8221; &#8220;You owe me that much,&#8221; Walt tells Mike when he demands gratitude and the names of the Gus&#8217; prisoned men. &#8220;I don&#8217;t own you a damn thing,&#8221; Mike gristles back. Walter impulsively kills Mike, and stunned at his actions, shows some remorse for doing so (&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mike. This whole thing could have been avoided.&#8221;).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are<br />
with me,<br />
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I<br />
translate into a new tongue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This line from Whitman&#8217;s poem could very well speak to the season opener in which a flash-forward reveals Walter celebrating his 52nd birthday tearing up bacon (a Skyler birthday tradition to him) under a new alias and buying an assault rifle for some unknown reason. Walter&#8217;s birthdays have served as poignant reminders of how far he&#8217;s progressed on the show, and this vague flash-forward suggests he&#8217;s in a hell of his own making and he&#8217;s gearing up for some kind of showdown.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the<br />
teacher.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I laughed when I saw this. This recalls all of Jesse&#8217;s &#8220;Yeah, science!&#8221; moments, including the magnet heist earlier this season. In addition, this also touches on Walter&#8217;s ego. He&#8217;s always been a softy when it comes to teaching; he revels in passing along his demonstration of chemistry to Jesse, to Gale and later to Todd. He likes recognition for his intelligence, a characteristic of his ego. We see it when he accidentally pushes Hank back to working on the Heisenberg case when he asserts that Gale was not the famed meth cook. It&#8217;s apparent when Walt keeps Gale&#8217;s copy of &#8220;Leaves of Grass&#8221; because it&#8217;s a reminder of someone once worshiping Walter&#8217;s mind. This may lead to his downfall, as Hank has now discovered that inscription.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I give the sign of democracy,<br />
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their<br />
counterpart of on the same terms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter negotiates a deal with Declan in which &#8220;everybody wins,&#8221; meaning Mike gets $5 million and out of the business. In the end, no one got what they wanted except for Walt. Mike loses money and gets killed; Jesse gets out but loses his share and his relationship with Walt.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think I could turn and live with animals, they&#8217;re so placid<br />
and self-contain&#8217;d,<br />
I stand and look at them long and long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they show their relations to me and I accept them,<br />
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in<br />
their possession.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter spends a lot of time contemplating the existence of flies on this show; they&#8217;ve made appearances during key moments, like when Walter shuts down the lab in season 3 when he sees the fly as a contaminant. The fly seems to symbolize Walt&#8217;s sense of his own rottenness in being involved in the meth game. In season 5&#8242;s &#8220;Glided Over All,&#8221; he merely watches one for a few minutes after he&#8217;s killed Mike and makes no move to get rid of it this time. The fly is no longer a contaminant, but Walter is now the contaminated one and rotten.</p>
<p>And finally, there are many more lines in &#8220;Song of Myself&#8221; that could be applied here, but I will leave you with the most quoted ones:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do I contradict myself?<br />
Very well then I contradict myself,<br />
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Creator Vince Gilligan has said many times that &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; is about turning Mr. Chips into Scarface. Walter has wrestled with his identity during the entirety of the show &#8212; from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher with cancer to a meth kingpin. Now that he&#8217;s made his choice to go &#8220;legitimate&#8221; and give up the business presumably for good, it remains to be seen how his former Heisenberg identity will leave residue on Walter and his family, as Hank now knows the truth about the multitudes that Walter contains in his contradictory personality.</p>
<p><strong>What did you think of this finale, and the Walt Whitman references? What are you most looking forward to in the last half-season?</strong></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Update, 4:45pm: </strong>I wasn&#8217;t able to catch the full inscription on first watch, but <a href="http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/mid-season-finale-review-breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-the-bathroom-reader">Hitfix&#8217;s Alan Sepinwall</a> linked to a nice <a href="http://www.randomtuesday.com/archive/Breaking%20Bad/hank-finds-out.gif">gif </a>of Hank figuring out the identity of &#8220;W.W.&#8221; in the copy of &#8220;Leaves of Grass.&#8221; The inscription apparently reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;To my <em>other</em> favorite W.W.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an honour working with you.</p>
<p>Fondly</p>
<p>G.B.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wrangell St. Elias National Park is the biggest park in the U.S.  Denali National Park is 6 million acres, approximately the same size as Massachusetts -pretty big.  Wrangell, at 13.2 million acres, is well over twice as big.  As big as Vermont and Connecticut put together.  Bigger than Switzerland.  In a big state with lots of space, it&#8217;s overwhelmingly huge.</p>
<p>As is most everything in it.  The Bagley ice field is 127 miles long and 6 miles wide.  The Malaspina Glacier is bigger than Rhode Island (a tiny state, true, but still!).  Mount St. Elias at 18,008 ft is the 3rd tallest peak in North America, and is tallest coastal mountain in the world.</p>
<p>Yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>How about some pretty pictures?</p>
<p>I left after work on Wednesday night, and drove for 4 hours until I was too tired to go on.  I slept in my car on the side of the Richardson Highway.  But while I was drifting off to sleep, the aurora made a grand entrance.  For an hour I shot images, and the scene was different literally every minute.</p>
<p><a href="http://adventuresinkevinworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-aug-wrangell-trip-017-version-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1224" title="2012 Aug Wrangell Trip 017 - Version 2" src="http://adventuresinkevinworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-aug-wrangell-trip-017-version-2.jpg" alt="" width="982" height="653" /></a></p>

<p>Happy Birthday to me, indeed!  Thank you, Alaska!  That was my best northern lights show in 2 seasons here.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the morning I continued on, but not without an adventure of a different kind first.  I discovered that I had somehow missed grabbing a stuff sack with socks &amp; underwear.  Three nights of no change of underwear and socks was not an option.   The tiny town of Glenallen however saved me &#8211; I found socks at the general store, and underwear at the Napa Auto Parts store.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably best not to ask why an auto parts store carries Hanes underwear.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After stopping at the visitor center and flirting with the cute ranger there &#8211; itwasmybirthdaysoIwasallowedtoandshestarteditdammit &#8211; I continued to the park.</p>
<p>Access to the park is challenging at best.  The 52 mile main access road is surrounded by private land, which means you&#8217;re driving in a national park that you can&#8217;t explore.  The road ends at the town of McCarthy, which means you pay private citizens to park and camp IN a national park.  And they take full advantage!</p>

<p>The town of McCarthy is certainly different if nothing else.  Only about 50 people live there, and it&#8217;s fully dependent on tourists.  Two tiny hotels, two small restaurants, two flightseeing businesses, one guiding business.  That&#8217;s about it.  It&#8217;s a little bit 3rd world.  On the plus side, people there are VERY friendly.</p>

<p>I tried to get on a flightseeing tour.  No luck.  One company was booked for the night, the other didn&#8217;t have any other paying guests until the next morning.</p>
<p>Score?  Park 1.  Kevin 0.  Not a good start to the birthday!</p>
<p>I had heard about ice caves in the Root Glacier, and that sounded pretty cool.  I also know that I&#8217;m not interested in exploring a glacier on my own, so I made my way to St. Elias Guides and booked a guide for a 4 hour trip the next day.</p>
<p>Park 1.  Kevin 1.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the morning I tried again with flightseeing.  Another tourist was trying to convince them to fly, but they needed at least 2 guests to make money.  SCORE!  An hour later we were in the air.  Here&#8217;s a quick 1 minute best-of from the 90 minute flights.  Glaciers, glaciers, and more glaciers.  A fantastic flight with great scenery.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://adventuresinkevinworld.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/the-answer-to-life-the-universe-and-everything/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/zUa262kR4BY/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After the flight I immediately met the guide for my glacier adventure.  If you ever have the opportunity to check out ice caves in a glacier, DO IT!  Ridiculously beautiful, and just&#8230; cool.  Very cool (and I&#8217;m not trying to be coy with the words).</p>

<p>The next day brought rain, so I skipped a planned hike and began my 7 hour drive.  Stopping of course, for pretty pictures along the way.</p>

<p>To conclude.  Why the title, you ask?  Since I turned 42 on this trip, it was very fitting.  If you don&#8217;t get that, read the book <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide To The Galaxy</span>!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Warhol was able to change the way that society interpreted pop culture. He transformed everyday items into icons through the use of repetition and bold colors. Soon, what were once considered mere household products were now idolized as pieces of art.What if we were able to transform the way that society views nature in a similar way?  Through the use of repetition, new creative patterns would appear from the earth, making trees no longer trees, but masterpieces.  We would garner a new-found respect for Mother Earth as we viewed her as a work of art, one not to be touched or disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Thought blossom for the day:</strong> <em>Pop art isn&#8217;t bounded solely to the material world; get inspired and make your landscape into a piece of art by taking an innovative approach with your eyes or your lens.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old friend who is a serious comic book collector flattered me recently by likening me to the character <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Gordon">Oracle</a>. For those of you, like me, who aren&#8217;t intimately familiar with the DC universe, Oracle is the <em>nom de guerre</em> of Barbara Gordon, librarian, Commissioner Gordon&#8217;s daughter, and the former Batgirl.</p>
<p>I will pardon if you haven&#8217;t quite seen the likeness yet. And I promise I have a reason besides my own vanity for relating this.</p>
<p><a href="http://nopostergirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/oracle2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1417" title="Oracle" src="http://nopostergirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/oracle2.jpg?w=267&h=300" alt="" width="267" height="300" /></a>As Commissioner Gordon&#8217;s daughter, she is shot through the spinal cord by the Joker. Paralyzed from the waist down, she is relegated to a wheelchair, and retreats from her crime-fighting past. Eventually, though, in response to her straitened physical circumstances, she emerges from the shell the wounding has put her in and turns her prodigious intellect, remarkable memory, research abilities, and knowledge of computers to a <a href="http://www.oocities.org/batgirls_gotham/barbara_gordon2.html" target="_blank">new role as an information broker</a>, backing Batman, Nightwing (the former Robin), and the Birds of Prey and helping them succeed in fighting crime from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>While I feel like I&#8217;ve lost a fair number of IQ points and I&#8217;m not the hacker that Oracle is portrayed as, I do have pretty good Google-fu, a detail orientation, a gift for finding connections, a severely <a href="http://nopostergirl.com/2011/06/02/cheating-in-chase-community-giving-the-end/">overdeveloped sense of justice</a>, and a whole heck of a lot of time on my hands, being mostly bedridden. And as my energy level has improved a little in the last year, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to help the above-mentioned friend with some computer- and web-based tasks, and that&#8217;s led me to take on some other low-stress outside projects.</p>
<p>Not for Batman. At least not yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Next year will be my high school graduating class&#8217;s mumbly-mumpth reunion. Earlier in the summer, our class president re-activated a facebook group for us, and I asked him if I could help us start to prepare by looking people up on facebook. Barring a miracle, I won&#8217;t be able to go, of course, but I thought it would be nice to feel as if I contributed to helping others to enjoy the event.</p>
<div id="attachment_1418" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://nopostergirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reunion.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1418" title="reunion" src="http://nopostergirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/reunion.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Theatre &amp; visual art folk at the last reunion. That&#8217;s me on the right. It&#8217;s sort of weird to me at this point to see pictures of myself well and standing up.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I won&#8217;t get a chance to go to the party, because I had a great time at the last one in 2003, dancing with the theatre/visual art/mod crowd to all our shared subcultures&#8217; alterna-hits, and at one point, one of the former art types, wearing a hot pink paisley shift and big stompy boots up to her knees, yelled over a Violent Femmes song into my ear, &#8220;ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MADE FUN OF ME FOR WEARING BLACK ALL THE TIME ARE WEARING BLACK TONIGHT!&#8221;</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t buy irony like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;d done something like this previously, looking 120 people up for my high school theatre&#8217;s facebook page, and it wasn&#8217;t difficult &#8211; a bit tedious, but it is fun to see what people have done with their lives. Okay, yes, it&#8217;s also fun because I&#8217;m a total creeper.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been spending a chunk of my time doing of late, kicking up the old tendinitis in my hands in the process, which has kept me away from writing here. One of the things that&#8217;s hardest about being this sick is how utterly useless it makes you feel, so I love that I&#8217;m actually accomplishing something useful &#8211; something more than posting weird links and cat videos to my old friends on facebook.</p>
<p>I knew off the top of my head how big my graduating class was &#8211; 580+ people (I went to what was at the time the second-largest secondary school in Virginia). When I started typing the names into the spreadsheet from the yearbook, I figured it was going to be a big task, but I guess I didn&#8217;t figure on the difference in importance I&#8217;d internalize between looking up people to invite to a facebook page that there&#8217;s no real deadline on and the higher-stakes game of  tracking people down for A Big Reunion. And this task is a little tougher, because I have fewer mutual friends to help things along than I did with the theatre crowd.</p>
<p>Looking at profile after profile has been interesting &#8211; and has made me feel unexpectedly wistful. I&#8217;m not the kind of person for whom high school was the high point of my life, but because I was well then and I&#8217;m sick now, I think I probably look back on it with more nostalgia than I used to. It&#8217;s easier now to look past how much I resented the regimentation we were forced into and the depression I suffered at the time and just remember all the things my former vitality made possible.</p>
<p>And there is something about the fact that these are the people with whom our topics of conversation and shared experiences were the milestones of adolescence, what were to that point big events in our lives: our crazy driver&#8217;s ed road instructors, how long until the date we could get our licenses, how many times to take the SATs, if and where we&#8217;d managed to land summer jobs, surviving AP classes, pulling our hair out over college applications, anticipating prom, and the great launching and subsequent diaspora that was graduation.</p>
<p>Now, trying to pick out my classmates from the sometimes-sea of similar names on facebook, I find that we&#8217;re still living our lives in a similar kind of sync; the signs of being same-age peers from a shared hometown are good tells. I often bet right by choosing the profile that pictures one or sometimes two beaming children&#8217;s faces below a certain age, notes a government or defense career path, or shows allegiance to a Virginia university. I&#8217;ve been struck, too, by the progress many others have made in their careers. I guess it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising, as we&#8217;re all edging into our late 30s, but people are well into leadership in a lot of cases. And:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy voted &#8220;Most Likely to Succeed&#8221; indeed has his own law practice.</li>
<li>&#8220;Most Eccentric&#8221; no longer has green hair and also works in law.</li>
<li>&#8220;Prettiest Eyes&#8221; is a newscaster, and in Googling her I discovered that there are whole websites devoted to saying offensive and degrading things about female newscasters, worse than you&#8217;d ever hear whispered behind the cover of a locker door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Never let it be said that creeping never taught anyone anything.</p>
<p>Yes, I know I&#8217;m getting a biased sample &#8211; people are probably not going to crow about their non-accomplishments, unhappy relationships, and mid-life crises on facebook, but it&#8217;s a cross-section of my peers, and for me personally, one of the things that <em>that</em> is another a reminder of a couple kinds of life progress that the disease slowed and then totally stymied. September always makes me feel a little wistful anyhow, because it&#8217;s been a transition point in my life so many times. This is just amplifying it.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not dwell on all that too long, right? I have <del>crime to fight</del> a spreadsheet to finish.</p>

<p>Having just finished Cheryl Strayed&#8217;s excellent memoir <em>Wild</em> (Knopf 2012), I&#8217;ve been thinking about all the great memoirs I&#8217;ve read in the past five years, since I started reading personal narrative accounts in earnest. It&#8217;s not news that in the past ten years or so memoirs have made a huge surge in popularity. What was once a genre of dry, summarized accounts of the lives of famous people or family members has become a juicy canon of life stories that often follow novel-style trajectories. Memoirs have become so ubiquitous it&#8217;s impossible not to wonder why we&#8217;re drawn to these personal accounts, most with intimate details we once might have blushed to read about. Is this another sign of our penchant for oversharing (via Facebook, Twitter, etc.)? Maybe. But I&#8217;m less cynical about it: I think we love memoirs because our understanding of humanity is enhanced by personal accounts of hardship, failure, tragedy, love, and success. Maybe true stories hold the most weight and teach us the most about who we are.</p>
<p>I know that&#8217;s true for me. Since a writing teacher a few years back suggested I start reading as many memoirs as I could, I&#8217;ve had one on my shelf at all times. Here are a few of the ones that stayed with me the most, my list of &#8220;must-reads&#8221; (in no particular order).</p>
<p>1. <em><strong>Angela&#8217;s Ashes,</strong></em><strong> by Frank McCourt.</strong> Maybe someone has done a better job writing about coming of age in extreme poverty in Ireland in the mid 1900s, but not that I&#8217;m aware of. A beautiful, beautiful book.</p>
<p>2. <em><strong>Lucky,</strong></em><strong> by Alice Sebold.</strong> Once you read <em>Lucky</em> you learn the source of all of Sebold&#8217;s demons. A graphic violent event in the first few pages might hold you to your chair; I believe I started to sob, threw the book across the floor, then went and picked it up and finished reading.</p>
<p>3. <em><strong>Eat, Pray, Love,</strong></em><strong> by Elizabeth Gilbert.</strong> Hugely best-selling, this memoir has of course also been raked over the coals by many (<em>Eat, Pray, Shit</em> I heard someone call it the other day). I put this book on my list because I think Gilbert manages to capture the very real societal pressures that thirty-something American women feel to conform to marriage, child-rearing, and a certain life path. I think of it as a quiet memoir of rebellion—and she&#8217;s funny, too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://susiemeserve.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsci0438.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-759 aligncenter" title="DSCI0438" src="http://susiemeserve.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsci0438.jpg?w=512&h=384" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>4. <em><strong>The Glass Castle,</strong></em><strong> by Jeanette Walls.</strong> Just great. It details a childhood so shocking, at times you just have to shake your head.</p>
<p>5. <em><strong>This Boy&#8217;s Life,</strong></em><strong> by Tobias Wolff.</strong> Wolff may be the most controlled prose writer I have read. This is an example of a memoir that&#8217;s nothing but the facts. And the facts are intense.</p>
<p>6. <em><strong>The Burn Journals,</strong></em><strong> by Brent Runyon.</strong> I loved this memoir about a troubled kid trying to clown his way through a disfiguring depression. I first heard part of this memoir on <em>This American Life.</em></p>
<p>7.<em><strong>Truth &amp; Beauty,</strong></em><strong> by Ann Patchett.</strong> An interesting memoir because it isn’t about the author as much as it is about her dear friendship with the late writer Lucy Grealy. Incidentally, Grealy’s own memoir, <em>Autobiography of a Face,</em> is on my to-read list.</p>
<div id="attachment_760" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 522px"><a href="http://susiemeserve.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsci0448.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-760 " title="DSCI0448" src="http://susiemeserve.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsci0448.jpg?w=512&h=384" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some memoirs I have known</p></div>
<p>8. <em><strong>The Year of Magical Thinking,</strong></em><strong> by Joan Didion.</strong> Inimitably Didion, this memoir is one of the quintessential memoirs of grief and death. Her sequel, <em>Blue Nights,</em> was for me (and for many critics) much less successful.</p>
<p>And if you get through those, you might try <em>Poser: My Life in Twenty-Three Yoga Poses</em> by Claire Dederer; <em>Made for You and Me,</em> by Caitlin Shetterly; <em>Expecting Adam: A True Story of Birth, Rebirth, and Everyday Magic,</em> by Martha Beck; <em>The Only Girl in the Car,</em> by Kathy Dobie; <em>Stop-Time,</em> by Frank Conroy; and <em>The Bill from My Father,</em> by Bernard Cooper.</p>
<p>Does anyone else read memoir? If so, what are your favorites?</p>
