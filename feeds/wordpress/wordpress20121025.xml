				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://Africa.com" target="_blank">Africa.com</a> article <a href="http://www.africa.com/blog/blog,the_top_10_most_liveable_cities_in_africa,818.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Top 10 Most Livable Cities in Africa&#8221;</a>, I was excited to see the city that I currently reside in &#8212; Accra, Ghana &#8212; listed as the second most livable city in the continent. As you might guess, it&#8217;s many of the continent&#8217;s main attractions that find themselves on the list &#8212; both Cape Town and Johannesburg, in South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; Gaborone, Botswana; and Tunis, Tunisia are just some of the upscale cities that find themselves on the list [see the article to read the full list].</p>
<p>One of the challenges I&#8217;d like to pose is to the article&#8217;s very perspective on &#8220;livability&#8221; &#8212; and how that influences which cities end up on this list. While the editors acknowledge that they considered both quantitative and qualitative factors in their determinations &#8212;  &#8221;availability of goods and services, quality of infrastructure, and overall security (which is defined both in personal terms and in national political terms)&#8221; &#8212; they conspicuously leave out important economic (and other) factors that in my mind, play an immense role in making a city a positive, affordable, safe, and productive space to live and work in. I also am a bit uncomfortable with the distinct emphasis on these cities as travel/relocation destinations (and leaving out any emphasis of these cities&#8217; livability from the perspective of residents already living there).</p>
<div id="attachment_392" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 550px"><img class="size-full wp-image-392 " title="IMG_0070" alt="" src="http://africanurbanism.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0070.jpg" height="360" width="540" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the challenges for measuring cities&#8217; livability is that in African cities like Accra or Lagos, the very livability of a city depends on one&#8217;s socioeconomic status, which in turn determines access to transportation, services, housing &#8211; which have concrete impacts on quality of life. Photo above was taken at Makola Market, the major commercial centre located in Old Accra that attracts approximately 70 percent of the city&#8217;s traffic daily.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-391"></span></p>
<p><strong>What is &#8220;livability,&#8221; anyway?</strong><br />
Livability is a somewhat elusive term. It is also a neverending goal when it comes to urban development. In my own words: how can we make the city an enjoyable, safe, environmentally friendly, equitable, affordable, accessible and enduring space for the city&#8217;s residents (not necessarily in that order)? City planners, governments, architects, urban designers, etc, they all (should) aim to achieve livability as a goal &#8212; but even once they achieve it, they have to work to maintain it.</p>
<p>In the case study <a href="http://crcresearch.org/case-studies/case-studies-sustainable-infrastructure/land-use-planning/what-makes-a-city-liveable" target="_blank">&#8220;What Makes a City Livable?&#8221;</a> from the Canada-based research center <a href="crcresearch.org/" target="_blank">Community Research Connections</a>, the authors  acknowledge that the idea of &#8220;livability&#8221; is difficult to define, because it has so many (potential) attributes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Livability is critical to the establishment of a sustainable community, if for no other reason than if it is not present people will not stay in the community. But liveability as a term is exceedingly difficult to define. For some, it is intrinsically tied to physical amenities such as parks and green space; for others to cultural offerings, career opportunities, economic dynamism, or some degree of reasonable safety within which to raise a family. Where liveability is linked to sustainability and infrastructure issues it is normally as an alternative development model to the expansion of sprawling suburbs with low densities of both population and services and where infrastructure provision is costly to ecological, economic, and social capital&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When people speak of livability, they aren&#8217;t always on the same page. For example, in the Economist&#8217;s <a href="http://cemea.economistconferences.com/event/future-cities-africa#.UIfmC_k-t74" target="_blank">Future Cities Conference that took place in Lagos, Nigeria</a> earlier this year, <a href="http://anamcity.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/what-is-livability-by-african-standards-world-bank-and-un-talk-mobilization-future-cities/" target="_blank">Anam City blogged on the discussion of a livable African city</a>, a discussion which drew disparate responses &#8212; the World Bank representative considered transportation and power as major measurements, while the mayor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania pointed to security and community involvement. On the other hand, the United Nations Nigeria representative pointed to clean energy and the availability of social infrastructure. With not even any overlap in this discussion (at least what we can see), it highlights the need for a transparent, clear methodology set forth from organizations that aim to undertake a measurement of this fashion. It also shows that there are a wealth of factors that could, and probably should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>On measuring livability</strong></p>
<p>While the editors considered availability of goods and services, infrastructure access, and security, I&#8217;d argue that&#8217;s just the beginning in trying to measure these cities. In a city like Accra where inflation has caused dramatic increases in the prices of goods over the past year, it&#8217;s hard to believe that no economic factors were considered in Africa.com&#8217;s analysis. How affordable is to rent an apartment/house or buy a house/condo? How affordable and accessible is public transportation, or fuel for private transport? How affordable are groceries each week? How difficult is it to get a job, to see a doctor when your child is sick, how accesible are parks and community spaces? Or, environmental concerns: How clean is the air I&#8217;m breathing? How well is my city prepared against flooding (an unfortunately regular annual issue in many low-lying areas in parts of Ghana, including Accra; and in Nigeria, including Lagos, Owerri, Port Harcourt&#8230;).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_393" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 550px"><a href="http://thisbigcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Insight-Series-Livable-Cities-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-393 " title="livable city infographic" alt="" src="http://africanurbanism.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/livable-city-infographic.png" height="872" width="540" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This infographic from the Philips Center for Health and Well Being, titled &#8220;A livable and lovable city?&#8221; considers provides an interesting and visual way to consider three main themes for a city&#8217;s livability: resilience, inclusiveness, and authenticity. [Click on the image to enlarge]</p></div>In addition, what is core is that the city&#8217;s livability, whatever criteria considered, is in sufficiently considering these criteria <strong>from the point of view from the people who are living there</strong>. While the attractiveness of a city&#8217;s livability plays a huge role in pulling tourism, new business, investments and residents to a city, livability is most critical for those already present.</p>
<p>If I were to compile a list of key criteria, here&#8217;s some additional areas I would certainly tag on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment - </strong>How clean is the city, how green? What are key climate concerns and how are they being addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Socioeconomic</strong> &#8211; How equitable is the city? How do measures like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank">Gini coefficient </a>(or similar measure) demonstrate the city&#8217;s economic (in)equalities?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> &#8211; What is the level of crime, and how are things trending?</li>
<li><strong>Inclusiveness</strong> &#8211; How are marginalized populations included and responded to in their needs? From ensuring the elderly, the disabled, the poor, even the undocumented are assisted in becoming full members of society? Are there areas in the city that do a good job of bringing people together (e.g., public spaces)?</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> &#8211; how easy is it for the average person reliant on public transport to get around the city? How affordable is it? Is the city infrastructure conducive to non-motorized transit (walking, bicycling)?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In the end&#8230;?</strong></p>
<p>When we fail to consider the factors that impact daily life &#8211; for the expat, sure, but most importanly for long-term or lifelong residents at the lower, middle and upper-income class levels, we fail to paint an accurate picture of how responsive a city is to its residents&#8217; needs, and how livable it really is. Not just the tourists or the economically mobile returnees looking to capitalize on new opportunities at home, but for the very people who are living in and working to keep that city going.</p>
<p>In the end, it&#8217;s entirely possible that one could widen the lens through which we are exploring the livability of African cities, and still come up with this same list determined by Africa.com. Cause they are likely on the right track. I&#8217;d just like to see them go all the way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My 3 year old daughter loves to put on make up and have her toenails painted. She wears dresses around the house and runs for exercise with a full array of jewelry hanging from her neck and wrists. She regularly asks, &#8220;Do I look pretty?&#8221;</p>
<p>I showed up to an 80 year old client&#8217;s house last week to clean for her. She had just found out that her husband is gravely ill; she is about to lose her life partner. However, she still greeted me in a pink sweater and pink and silver hoop earrings. She had just come from the salon, and her hair was perfect. She was lovely, pretty in pink.</p>
<p>All women, from 3 to 80, want to feel pretty.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember what it&#8217;s like to feel pretty.</p>
<p>Most days I don&#8217;t even try to tame the beast of my appearance.  I wear work jeans and an old T-shirt and don&#8217;t bother to put any make up on.  I rarely do my hair but instead just let my natural curl shoot out in any direction it chooses.   I don&#8217;t see the point in bothering with the fuss.  It seems like such a waste of time in my busy day.</p>
<p>When I was young I primped and preened and loved to be looked at.  I loved to attract attention.  There were moments I looked in the mirror and thought, &#8220;Ooh, girl, you look good!&#8221;</p>
<p>My pride has now been demolished though by years of ridicule and mocking.  I&#8217;m afraid to even try.  I remember trying after one of my babies was born.  I had worked out daily and denied myself the food I love in order to get back into a special pair of pants for a special day out with my husband.  He was near the car, waiting for me.  I stepped outside, hair done, make up on, wearing a bright top and my white pants with high heels.  My white pants.  I hadn&#8217;t worn them since before the baby.  I stood in the grass, waiting for the reaction, waiting to take his breath away.  Instead, he turned and looked at me, shrugged and turned away, then looked back over his shoulder and asked, &#8220;You aren&#8217;t really gonna wear those pants out in public, are you?  They make you look fat cuz they&#8217;re still too tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the long stretch in between babies when I knew I turned heads in the grocery store.  I saw men look at me.  Yet, at home in my bikini my husband stood beside me in the pool, beer in his hand, belly protruding onto the air mattress I was lying on, rubbing the back of my thighs in an effort to &#8220;rub out the cellulite.&#8221;</p>
<p>My cellulite was always a problem.  I had been forbidden to eat or drink dairy products, even during my pregnancies, because &#8220;dairy causes cellulite, and you already have too much of a problem with cellulite.&#8221;  I craved milk to such a degree when I was pregnant that I even tried hiding it in an ice chest outside to sneak and drink while he was gone.  I was skin and bones and my baby had persistent failure to thrive, but I was still too fat.</p>
<p>Shortly before he left me he brought home a T-shirt from the company for whom he worked.  It was a junior cut, kinda cute; they&#8217;d had one done up for each of the wives.  He asked me to try it on.  We had not been intimate in over a year.  He had not seen me in any state of undress in all that time.  This was the first time in over a year that he sat and watched me as I took off my top.  I felt nervous, like a young girl.  The T-shirt fit perfectly, and I smiled at him.  He looked concerned, worried.  I didn&#8217;t know what might be going through his head.  After a moment he asked, &#8220;Do you think you might be going through menopause?  You aren&#8217;t fat anywhere else, just around the belly.  You carry a lot of fat around your belly, like women who are going through menopause.  Do you think you could be?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried once in awhile.  I&#8217;ve dressed up for church and my children&#8217;s college graduations.  But, I&#8217;ve felt like a clown with all that make up on.  I remember when I was very young people saying, &#8220;You could make a gunny sack look good.&#8221;  Now, I can put on my nicest knit maxi skirt, a tunic tank top, and a flowing short sleeved sweater, all in matching shades of amethyst, and I can make them look like a gunny sack.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m older now.  Yes, I&#8217;m heavier now.  But, I see much older women who still look incredibly sexy.  And, I see women who are more than just 15 pounds overweight who still look very beautiful.  It&#8217;s that thing on the inside that I&#8217;ve lost.  That belief that it is possible for me to look pretty with just the right dress.  That belief that some man will look at me and find everything he has ever longed for hidden in my eyes, waiting just for him.  I feel like an it.  A beast.  I feel like a brute beast feeding in a pasture.  I don&#8217;t feel feminine anymore, no matter what I wear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s how life is here. Completely, totally nuts.</p>
<p>A few brief examples: today, the day before Eid al Adha, there were probably 25 kids who showed up at school. The holiday starts tomorrow. Because there were so few of them, no classes were held. The two-day holiday is implicitly at least a three day one.</p>
<p>That said, the principal made no announcement to the faculty. In fact, I&#8217;m not sure he was even at work.</p>
<p>As a result, this was the most productive work day I&#8217;ve had in some time. I got some grading done, and planning, and I had time to get organized and get to know my fellow English teachers, too.</p>
<p>In other words, it was the best day at school of the year so far, other than the first couple of honeymoon weeks, before all the bad kids started coming to school.</p>
<p>In the course of talking with my fellow teachers, I found out that I&#8217;m not alone in having some difficulty explaining to others back home what life and work here is like. We agreed that this place is just bizarre. It almost has to be experienced in order to be understood. It&#8217;s simultaneously wonderful and horrible, beautiful and ugly, amazing and exasperating. I sometimes think of it as a third-world country in first-world clothes.</p>
<p>The example of how the school schedule works is just one of many that indicate how ridiculous some things are here. It is taken for granted that schools will ignore the actual schedule and allow everyone an extra day off (except us teachers, who they tried to get to stay until 2:50pm. When my coworkers and I left, it was not 2:00 yet, and there was not a single administrator or Arabic teacher on the grounds). It seems that the schools themselves are reflections of how society here works and doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<div id="attachment_691" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 778px"><a href="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1012.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-691" title="School yard" alt="" src="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1012.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yesterday it was decided, without ever informing the faculty, that students would be allowed to leave early. Here are some stragglers heading for the exits.</p></div>
<p>We can look around at the unchanging weather and the desert, and we can say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I see how it&#8217;s possible for a people to care very little about time schedules, because the land itself never changes. What&#8217;s it matter if you&#8217;re a day late, or a couple days late, or if you never get around to doing whatever it is anyway? Nothing really changes.&#8221; But that mindset doesn&#8217;t exactly foster a work ethic, a competitive spirit, or a forward-thinking culture.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoons (remember, the weekend here is Friday and Saturday), ADEC&#8217;s local offices close early. That is, they unofficially do, because everyone clears out as soon as they can possibly manage. It&#8217;s pretty aggravating when you&#8217;ve driven across town and then discover the people you need to see aren&#8217;t around.</p>
<p>ADEC has a wonderful curriculum in place for the public schools in Abu Dhabi. I mean it. It&#8217;s really very solid. But implementing a challenging curriculum in a place which is much more about looking good than working hard is well nigh impossible.</p>
<p>What makes it that way? Let me tell a story to present you with what I&#8217;ve observed. An exceptionally gifted student hung around the English office today, chatting with us. He asked me what I think of the UAE. I hesitated. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Really.&#8221; So, I told him what I told you, my dear reader, in my opening paragraph. He smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of the schools here?&#8221; He asked. &#8220;Are the ones in the USA better?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t try to hide my chuckle. &#8220;They are much better,&#8221; I told him. And I worked at a school that was one of the worst in the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>This student wasn&#8217;t surprised by my response.  &#8221;What do you think is the problem?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it the school system?&#8221; He seemed to think that&#8217;s what I would blame for the educational situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I think the educational system is excellent. Now, you&#8217;ve been here a lot longer than I have,&#8221; I said, &#8220;So tell me if you agree. This is what I think the problem is: lack of discipline. There&#8217;s no discipline in the schools, and there&#8217;s no discipline anywhere else. Furthermore, nobody takes responsibility for anything. So that&#8217;s what I think: lack of discipline and responsibility. What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>He agreed wholeheartedly without a moment&#8217;s pause, and even offered examples of what he thought would happen if students from the UAE were to go to other countries.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;re saying to yourself, Shon, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s nuts? You say the whole place is nuts because students don&#8217;t go to school sometimes, and because there&#8217;s a lack of discipline and responsibility?</p>
<p>Well. Mumpkin (that means &#8220;maybe&#8221; in Arabic). The thing is, the lack of discipline and responsibility is pervasive here.</p>
<p>Not at the top&#8211;obviously there has been quite a vision and stunning execution of that vision from those who are in power. In 1964 (I think that&#8217;s the right year, the early &#8217;60s anyway), there were only 1,800 people in Al Ain. Now there are 300,000. And the place is well-laid out with great roads and such. There are wonderful homes and lovely parks. There are many shopping malls and other entirely first-class accommodations in various spheres.</p>
<p>But, at the same time as there are these great roads, there are crazy drivers who make driving anywhere a stressful experience. The worst ones seem to be Emirati. They&#8217;re aggressive, rude, and downright belligerent behind the wheel. Which, you must understand, is a contradiction in itself, because Emiratis are typically rather ordinary and nice people, courteous and helpful. I&#8217;m not saying that just because I live here&#8211;it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s true. The youth are, although irresponsible and immature (think 5th graders in 12th grader bodies), actually likable and amusing. They&#8217;re happy to share about their culture and such, and entirely tolerant of divergent beliefs and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems like the vision and the motivation that comes from above breaks down along the line. Somewhere somebody shirks responsibility, and things don&#8217;t function precisely. What we&#8217;d probably designate &#8220;common sense&#8221; often gets thrown out the window. So you have a place where the technological infrastructure is so good that I can purchase automobile insurance and 30 seconds after I&#8217;ve paid for it, I receive a text message on my phone from the bank notifying me of the use of my debit card. In the space of a minute, I received another text, this one from the insurance company itself, thanking me for choosing them. And yet, this same place is where there is a crew of Pakistani men out sweeping the streets&#8211;with brooms&#8211;in the morning as I go to work. Perhaps the Pakistanis work cheaper than an actual street-sweeper vehicle. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<div id="attachment_688" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0987.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-688" title="Villa Alfalfa" alt="" src="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0987.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" height="768" width="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s illegal for people to grow crops on non-commercial property, such as the yard of this villa, where you see a crop of alfalfa in the foreground. But it&#8217;s done anyway, and evidently there is no fear whatsoever of repercussions, as there are actually hired hands harvesting away while I was there.</p></div>
<p>To return to my school as an example, this is a place where I punch a code and have my fingerprint scanned every day when I arrive to work and leave. Yet classes are overloaded with 30+ students of all ability levels, and there are computers so old they&#8217;re barely able to run the Toshiba smart projectors that are in the classrooms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a place where the legal driving age is 18, but my 10th graders who are 15 years old are driving, unaccompanied, in Toyota Land Cruisers and Nissan Patrols and nobody bats an eye. It&#8217;s a place where yesterday I saw a bright blue Lamborghini Murcielago&#8211;that&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s most expensive and desirable supercars, in case you didn&#8217;t know&#8211;piloted by a man in a kandora, with a woman wearing her abaya in the passenger seat. And a child standing over the shifter in the middle of the console.  And yeah, there are seat belt laws.</p>
<p>Where is the common sense, discipline, or responsibility in any of this? Why create laws and not enforce them?</p>
<div id="attachment_689" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 778px"><a href="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1006.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-689" title="Lambo " alt="" src="http://therands.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1006.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Because of the reflection in the windows, it&#8217;s hard to discern who is where in the 2-seat sports car next to mine. But there&#8217;s a little kid in there in the middle.</p></div>
<p>The Lambo and the kid riding so unsafely in it brings to mind another thing that I find irreconcilable. Family. Here it is incredibly important. Families are large. It helps that men can marry up to four women simultaneously, so he can really spread his seed around in a hurry. The family structure is important&#8211;the men do their macho things in the desert with camels (see my earlier post), the women do their things in the towns with the kids. And the maids. But that&#8217;s another story. Children are valued, and by looking at a person&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s easy to track a good part of their family history. I gather that family history is much more important to these people than it is to my countrymen back home. Here it&#8217;s taken for granted that you know a lot of genealogy. Anyway, to make my point: how does it make sense that you value your family so much, yet you simultaneously value your children so little that you&#8217;re zooming through town without even making your kid sit down (never mind putting him in a child seat or even a seat belt)?  And, if you&#8217;re saying, well, Shon, that&#8217;s an isolated incident, I can tell you more about the times that I&#8217;ve seen 7 and 8 year-olds riding around gleefully in their parents Mercedes, torsos protruding from the open sunroofs. It happens so frequently that I don&#8217;t even give it more than passing notice anymore.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t wrap my head around the way things are here. I&#8217;m starting to adjust to it being the way it is, though, and that&#8217;s making it easier to reside where I am.  Anyway, it&#8217;s nuts.</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>Addendum: don&#8217;t take me to be biting the hand that feeds me.  I don&#8217;t have anything against ADEC.  In fact, I admire what they&#8217;re trying to do, and I&#8217;m cerebrally quite pleased to be part of it.  I&#8217;m simply still struggling to understand how things work here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_433" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://citizenfable.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/opulence.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-433" title="Opulence" alt="Opulence, via DirectTV commercials" src="http://citizenfable.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/opulence.jpg" height="272" width="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Opulence, From Russia With Love</p></div>
<p>Very recently, I saw &#8216;the Opulence Guy&#8217; of the famous Direct TV meme on an episode of Sons of Anarchy as an Irish Arms Dealer. This inspired an entire conversation about wealth and its manifestation in our culture.</p>
<p>Capitalism in its current form is a breeding ground for insatiable desire. It is as if desire has become our sixth sense. Stephen Colbert recently interviewed Chrystia Freeland, author of the recent <em>Plutocrats </em>and Global Editor-at-Large at<em> Reuters. </em>This report highlights the ultra-elite and their going global in today&#8217;s world. Perhaps their desire is better than the average bear&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Roth and Shapley, two Americans, were recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their research and practical applications of Matching Theory, which &#8216;has improved the performance of many markets.&#8217; Our desires are made more accessible. The current manifestation of matching theory &#8216;matches&#8217; organ donors with those that need them in the case of the New England Kidney Exchange. Or doctors to hospitals that need their specific qualifications in their first year of employment. I can only imagine what the next application of this currently helpful and constructive theory might be. Especially when even the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences uses the term &#8216;economic engineering&#8217; loosely in its praise of these theories.</p>
<p>Recently, I was struck when a colleague and I were discussing the applications of the now popular Raspberry Pi. Its intent of spreading knowledge and stimulating the teaching of basic computer science in schools makes the technology of computers as well as their applications possible even to countries that are developing. The first use my colleague could come up with was using it to upgrade his television into a computer. Opulence.</p>
<p>I am struck by commercials for companies that feed desire with the promise of instant cash. What they do not tell you is that this cash comes with a four year repayment plan for the instant gratification received. These commercials often air right after the commercials for Las Vegas. Followed by the ones for ETrade. Followed by some insurance company telling us how to save money. And another insurance company. And a bank called Ally, your friend that isn&#8217;t new, it&#8217;s your old friend GE again.  The gilt must be laid on our chairs. The chains must be made longer.</p>
<p>Since much of our manufacturing and industry has moved to China, it seems advertising emphasizes ideas more so even than product. Let&#8217;s push the idea of wealth and luxury and opulence further. Produce a tourism commercial. Let&#8217;s make the carrot just a little closer to the horse, but let&#8217;s make the wire holding it just a little longer behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Design a website for Sallie Mae. Check the latest statistics on the average college graduate&#8217;s student loan debt. Make the loan company&#8217;s logo friendly and welcoming.</p>
<p>Listen to the radio for news on Congress and its handling of our budget. Let&#8217;s produce a film for <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> in two parts. Make sure the stay in theaters maximizes profit, but increase the speed by which it reaches the general public via NetFlix and DVD.</p>
<p>Watch the History Channel&#8217;s series <em>The Men Who Built America</em>. Learn how a few men built an entire nation on the backs, blood, and sweat of thousands of their &#8216;ordinary&#8217; brethren. Learn how to make heroes of these men once viewed as crooks. I doubt these shows will cover the meeting at Jekyll Island, or even Woodrow Wilson&#8217;s own views on the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Listen to the debates. Watch two elite men discuss finance and money as if it were a regular everyday thing to spend billions, even trillions of dollars. Talk about jet lag. (Don&#8217;t forget to increase the cost of an average plane ticket either). Are these men even capable of understanding the average American&#8217;s &#8216;real-life&#8217; any longer? Forget the debt of the country. How about the debt in our homes? The chains we drag with us like some <em>Ghost of Wealth Gone Past</em>.</p>
<p>How many zeroes does a trillion dollars have anyway? It seems the more our culture emphasizes wealth and the channels by which we acquire it, it simultaneously decreases the capability by which the average person may actually understand in a realistic way <em>how money works</em>. Palahniuk&#8217;s violent solution of erasing the debt record in <em>Fight Club</em> comes to mind, a Great Flood of understanding and an encompassing simplification that functions to physically limit the playing field of humanity once again.</p>
<p>In the grand meaning of life and death, the economy is a system of exchange of energies and resources. To create false hope of opulence while simultaneously decreasing its likelihood is perhaps the greatest lie capitalism ever told. In our creative fields, it may perhaps become the foremost question of ethics that will dominate the future of our work. Is it moral to continue to propagate the impractical and overbearing liability of the American Dream for millions and our country and abroad?</p>
<p>I for one, vote for a redesign of the system to emphasize the energy and exchange more so than the booty. The rewards of the few in the large markets of the world could be changed with a change in general consciousness. Perhaps the favoring of life with all its simple riches over a dream and its imagined luxuries is just what America needs. The favoring once again of the people over their &#8216;kings.&#8217;</p>

<p>So the word ‘Raj’ translates as King and ‘Ma’ as Mother. But, Rajma somehow translates to the rather more humble Kidney Bean.</p>
<p>However, there is something of the &#8216;Mother of all Beans&#8217; in this north Indian signature dish. It’s a staple, but definately one that’s drooled over when it’s served up. It has the X factor.</p>
<p><a href="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma4b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-712" title="Rajma" alt="Easy Indian Food" src="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma4b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=589" height="589" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Rajma reminds me of Kashmir where kidney beans are grown and traded.</p>
<p>When I was lucky enough to find a lull in the troubles of this region about 8 years ago I visited Dal Lake in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>
<p>What can I tell you of Dal Lake and Srinagar?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It was rich in colour, culture, music, crafts, art, dried fruit, flowers, saffron, houseboats and just plain gorgeous.</p>
<p>The people were bewitchingly beautiful, with their green-grey eyes, dark hair and fair skin. In another world they would have been signed up by modelling agencies selling mundane objects like toothpaste or shampoo.</p>

<p>Kashmiri&#8217;s certainly don&#8217;t strut around like they know they are the peacocks of this world. They just get one with their every day lives trying to make a living in a dramatically stunning place with the usual theatre of life; it just so happened to be in a divided  - heavily armed &#8211; state as the backdrop.</p>
<p>It was deeply sad to see what the troubles there had done to people desperate to have their lives and livelihoods restored with a return to tourism and trade.</p>

<p>The one thing, (apart from Kashmir shawls, walnuts, dates etc.,) that everyone asked me to come back with was hessian sack loads of Kidney Beans for them.</p>
<p>Saffron is easier to carry.</p>

<p>If I had the chance, I would go there again in a heartbeat. In the winter this time &#8211; to see the snow capped mountains that enveloped the Lake.</p>

<p>My love.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I cook Rajma in my Punjabi kitchen in the UK, thinking of Kashmir:</p>
<p>This is very <a title="Channa Massala recipe" href="http://kiranscookingclub.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/cookie-monster-and-tummy-trances-channa-massala/">similar to my Channa Massala recipe</a>. So, often I will cook a bulk load of the onion-ginger paste, keep in the fridge and use when I need it.</p>
<p>First a quick completely unrelated aside -</p>
<p><a title="Foodista Featured Food Blog of the Day" href="http://www.foodista.com/fbod#s.acojpvazqbaaa" target="_blank">My Garam Massala Recipe is the FOODISTA Recipe Blog of the day!</a></p>
<p>How very exciting!!</p>
<div><a href="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-706" title="Rajma " alt="Easy Indian Food" src="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma-3.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=597" height="597" width="1024" /></a></div>
<p><strong>You need this:</strong></p>
<p>1 cup dried kidney beans</p>
<p>1 medium onion</p>
<p>1/2 &#8211; 1 inch piece of fresh ginger</p>
<p>4-5 tbs oil (veg, olive or ghee &#8211; whatever you have)</p>
<p>1 1/4 tsp salt (to taste)</p>
<p>1/4 tsp chilli powder (to taste)</p>
<p>1/4 tsp haldi (turmeric powder)</p>
<p>1 tsp dunia powder (coriander powder)</p>
<p>1 tsp paprika powder</p>
<p>1 fresh tomato &#8211; blended</p>
<p><strong>Optional Extras: (often I use the below for special occasions &#8211; while the above simple ingredients will do for every day Rajma!)</strong></p>
<p>*  Pinch of Hing (asafoetida powder) &#8211; this is <a title="Indian Digestifs" href="http://kiranscookingclub.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/digest-this-my-everyday-chai-recipe/" target="_blank">great for digestion as Kidney Beans can be difficult for some people!</a><br />
*  1/2 tsp Garam Massala<br />
*  1 tsp Amchoor powder (dried mango powder)</p>
<p><a href="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/asafoetida.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-742" title="Asafoetida" alt="Easy Indian Food" src="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/asafoetida.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" height="768" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Just like the Chickpeas, Kidney Beans need to be soaked to help them cook.</p>
<p>NB: This is really important for kidney beans, because if they are eaten even a little bit hard, they can give you tummy pain!</p>
<p>1. Sift and wash Kidney Beans: make sure there are none with holes, or that there any stones in the mix. Wash thoroughly.</p>
<p>2. Soak in 5- 6 cups of cold water, overnight if you can. They will swell to double in size. You need to soak them for at least 4-5 hours. If you add them to boiled water you can get soaking time down to 3-4 hours. Soak them in the pan you will be cooking in.</p>
<p>3. Keep the water the beans have been soaked in. The water always needs to be 1 inch above the swollen kidney beans throughout the cooking process. If you need to top up, do so now with hot water, and keep it topped up throughout the cooking process. Cook for around 30 -40 minutes until the kidney beans are tender and soft.</p>
<p>Do this on a medium heat, in a pan with a lid.</p>
<p>4. While the kidney beans are cooking you can get on with the massala.</p>
<p>Blend onion and fresh ginger to a paste in an electric mixer. If you do not have one you can chop very finely, or go all traditional and blend in a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p>5. Heat oil in a pan or wok.</p>
<p>6. Add the onion ginger paste. For this small amount of paste, cook for around 10 minutes on a slow – medium heat, with the lid on the pan.</p>
<p>The steam generated will &#8216;slow cook&#8217; the onions.</p>
<p>The onions need to turn a golden colour brown.</p>
<p>You know when the paste is cooked when the oil is released or ‘separated’ from the onion mix. (There will be a tiny edge of oil around the paste).</p>
<p><a href="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-708" title="Rajma" alt="Easy Indian Food" src="http://kiranscookingclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rajma1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=585" height="585" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>7. Add all of the spices and salt apart from the amchoor, and ½ the quantity of the garam masala. Allow to cook on a medium heat without the lid on the pan for a few minutes. Add a little water if it sticks to the pan.</p>
<p>8. Add the blended tomato and cook for 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>9. Once the kidney beans  have cooked, drain them, keeping the cooking water to one side. Add the tender chickpeas to the massala. Adding a little of the cooking water at a time – depending on how runny or soupy you want the final mix. I usually add all of the water. Rajma is classically eaten with rice which soaks up the juices. Allow the rajma to cook for at least 5 minutes to let the water thicken with the paste.</p>
<p>10. After 5 minutes, add the amchoor powder and <a href="http://kiranscookingclub.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/i-can-make-it-at-home-for-nothing-garam-massala/">home made garam massala</a> (if you have it) and cook for another 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>11. Garnish with chopped chilli, chopped tomatoes or fresh coriander if you have it.</p>
<p>12. Serve with Steam Cooked Basmati Rice, flavoured with Cumin Seeds. Recipe to follow soon!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight&#8217;s final presidential debate was only about foreign policy only so much as &#8220;foreign&#8221; is defined as<em> </em>&#8220;a handful of countries in the Middle East . . . and maybe China.&#8221; The headline of a Josh Barro headline at Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/foreign-policy-debate-omits-most-of-the-globe.html">sums it up</a>: &#8220;Foreign Policy Debate Omits Most of Globe.&#8221; Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/22/we-shouldnt-have-a-foreign-policy-debate/?wprss=rss_business">noted</a> prior to the debate that the foreign/domestic policy divide breaks down in an interconnected world, leaving the term (and the topic) with an anachronistic specificity: &#8220;‘Foreign policy’ means, broadly speaking, our policy towards the countries we are already at war with, or are considered likely to eventually go to war with.&#8221; Writing for the Times, former State Department official and <em>Atlantic</em> publicity-monger Anne-Marie Slaughter <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/debating-points-global-edition/#Slaughter">observes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This really wasn’t a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio.</p></blockquote>
<p>Slaughter runs through the (long) list of topics unmentioned by either candidate, and it reads like a seventh-grade tour of world geography: NATO, Europe, Asia, India (&#8220;a mere billion people,&#8221; snarks Slaughter). Climate change and the continuing economic meltdown in the Eurozone received zero airtime, and issues that would top the agenda for most countries &#8212; poverty, hunger, energy &#8212; didn&#8217;t even warrant a throwaway line from the men contending to lead the world&#8217;s richest nation. Among the many perks of superpower status, it seems, is the ability to ignore the pressing concerns of 90% of the &#8220;foreign&#8221; world that the &#8220;policy&#8221; portion of the debate was meant to address. The debate, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/the-least-enlightening-debate.html">scolds</a> the editors at Bloomberg News, &#8220;left five of the seven continents &#8212; most of them populated, and at least one in dire crisis &#8212; barely mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/23/the-third-presidential-debate-in-graphs/">provides</a> this infographic on how the conversation stacked up:</p>
<p><a href="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/places-mentioned.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1857" title="places-mentioned" alt="" src="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/places-mentioned.jpg?w=354&#038;h=202" height="202" width="354" /></a></p>
<p>At Slate, Matt Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/22/map_of_the_2012_foreign_policy_debate.html">publishes</a> a hastily Photoshopped map that reminds me of the classic New Yorker &#8220;Flyover Country&#8221; cartoon. His caption: &#8220;Those are all the countries out there, as I understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/yglesiasmap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1847" title="yglesiasmap" alt="" src="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/yglesiasmap.jpg?w=300&#038;h=182" height="182" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The Internet has unfortunately swallowed up the aforementioned New Yorker (at least I think it&#8217;s from the New Yorker) cartoon of a map of America, as seen from the East Coast: blue regions, like New York and the west coast (Los Angeles, San Francisco), are sharply delineated, while the vast middle of the country is shrunken to an empty red strip in the center of the country. The closest I can find is this 1976 New Yorker cover:</p>
<p><a href="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/newyorker2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1848" title="newyorker2" alt="" src="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/newyorker2.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300" height="300" width="222" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not nearly as funny, but it&#8217;s close. The debate&#8217;s geography also brought to mind <a href="http://artofmapping.blogspot.com/2011/09/world-according-to-dubya.html">this 2006 map</a>, attributed only to &#8220;grog,&#8221; from the liberal website DailyKos:</p>
<p><a href="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dubya.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1849" title="dubya" alt="" src="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dubya.jpg?w=300&#038;h=231" height="231" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>George W. Bush may no longer be in the Oval Office, but the American worldview is hardly more complex than that Dubya-era stereotype. There&#8217;s the U.S., and then there&#8217;s everyone else. If we want to get more specific, &#8220;everyone else&#8221; can be divided into the good guys who are &#8220;with us&#8221; and the bad guys (think Axis of Evil) who are &#8220;against us.&#8221; The trope still holds today, as Romney in particular classifies mildly hostile countries like Russia as &#8220;our number-one geopolitical foe&#8221; and lumps even ostensibly copacetic nations like the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated Egypt together with the Islamist radicals of Iran.</p>
<p>Riffing on Romney&#8217;s geographically challenged remark that Syria provides Iran with &#8220;a route to the sea,&#8221; New York Magazine&#8217;s Dan Amira <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/romney-iran-syria-route-sea-map.html">offers</a> his own poke at the Republican:</p>
<p><a href="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/iran.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1850" title="iran" alt="" src="http://sowellread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/iran.png?w=300&#038;h=200" height="200" width="300" /></a>Iran, of course, has 1,500 miles of its own coastline, so it&#8217;s hardly dependent on Syria for beach access. Alec MacGillis <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/260588769168736256">tweeted</a>: &#8220;Let&#8217;s just agree on the good news that the night brought: Iran lacks a route to the sea. We can stop worrying about the Straits of Hormuz.&#8221; The Washington Post&#8217;s fact-checker <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/22/fact-check-irans-route-to-the-sea/?wprss=rss_politics">calls</a> the claim &#8220;puzzling,&#8221; observing that &#8220;a puzzling claim, considering that Syria shares no border with Iran — Iraq and Turkey are in the way.&#8221; Romney has made this Iran-Syria link before, and to be fair, his campaign <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/romney-and-irans-route-to-the-sea/2012/04/18/gIQAgTbXRT_blog.html">notes</a> that it&#8217;s not as outlandish as it seems: &#8220;It is generally recognized that Syria offers Iran strategic basing/staging access to the Mediterranean.&#8221; However, despite knowing little about the Middle East, I would wager that the ties between Iran and Syria likely rely less on any oceanfront property than on the two nations&#8217; shared support of terrorists, common Shiite heritage (Syria&#8217;s Bashar Assad is a member of the Alawite heterodox Shiite sect), and mutual hostility toward Sunni-majority countries like Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Besides, as Amira writes, &#8220;Americans are bad enough at geography already; they don&#8217;t need a presidential candidate confusing them even more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again, if you were hoping for any level of clarity, the third presidential debate was surely the wrong place to look. Matt Yglesias bluntly <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/22/_2012_foreign_policy_debate_five_misguided_economic_themes.html">laments</a> the myopic perspective: &#8220;Foreign policy is all about angry Muslims.&#8221; He goes on to say that &#8220;these days, the various conflicts in the Middle East often seem to have eaten the entire field of vision of American foreign policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the encounter, the president accused Romney of being &#8220;all over the map&#8221; on foreign policy. Actually, the one thing the debate was <em>not</em> was &#8220;all over the map.&#8221; Romney&#8217;s positions may be Etch-a-Sketchy, as Joe Biden would say, but the larger problem with last night is that neither Obama nor his opponent expanded the map beyond Israel, Iran and Libya. To the rest of the world, the message was plain: Wait your turn.</p>
<p>Someday, the rest of the world will get tired of waiting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the economy, stupid. &#8221; Bill Clinton&#8217;s campaign <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/us/1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-bush-compete-be-champion-change-democrat-fights.html">coined the phrase</a> back in 1992 and successfully defeated Bush 1 by focusing on economic issues. And judging by the 2012 presidential debates, American political players are still narrowed in on the economy. One <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2012/10/the-foreign-policy-presidential-debate-china-trade-and-human-rights.html">blames China</a> for a lagging economy, the other agrees; one <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/08/658741/nuns-challenge-romney/?mobile=nc">blames the poor</a>, nobody blames the mega-rich money hoarders.</p>
<p>All the attention paid to &#8220;economic recovery&#8221; this and &#8220;recession&#8221; that fails to consider a few things. Humans, more and more, are creating our own economies based not on how much money we can stockpile in the bank or how many 2-story houses and SUVs we can buy, but on how our earning and buying align with our morals. Humans don&#8217;t do things just to make money, like so many businessfolk and politicians seem to believe and would have us believe. There is a renewed interest amongst us human beings in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption.html">bartering</a>, <a href="http://lunapads.com/why-switch">reusing</a>, <a href="http://knittaporfavor.wordpress.com/">DIY</a>, repurposing, and recycling products that doesn&#8217;t give 2 shits who is or isn&#8217;t POTUS.</p>
<p>My friends and fellow humans truly interested in progress are going back to small-scale, in-house production for a variety of reasons, most of which have nothing to do with earning a buck. We are growing our own food when possible, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Lose-a-lawn-gain-a-front-yard-bounty-2355069.php">turning our yard space into garden space</a>, and brewing our own beer because it makes us happy. And then we share with our friends because that also makes us happy. We are repurposing grandma&#8217;s old dress into new baby clothes and pillows and stuffed toys because handmade is better than store bought. Always. Objects with a creation story last beyond the material expiration date and have value beyond a number.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more is that humans care about the Earth. Because of our increased awareness of unresolved environmental problems, we are cutting our purchases of disposable crap. We are choosing, instead, to buy lasting or buy used, and we are returning to systems of trading and bartering. We are also buying local, so that we don&#8217;t use as much gas \ spend as much money on gas. We are looking up videos on how to fix stuff on our own or with our children, and we are helping other friends in our community with services they might need FOR FREE.</p>
<p>This black market economy has not been an accident. While we humans &#8211; my generation especially &#8211; were accused of being <a href="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2012/October/Generation-Apathy-Millennial-Vote-Up-in-the-Air/">apathetic</a>, <a href="http://current.com/community/93846925_uninformed-gen-x-unconcerned-about-climate-change.htm">uninformed</a> and <a href="http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/1752">lazy</a>, we were actually re-wiring an old economy to work better for us. And we&#8217;re not just employed\ unemployed workers or confident\ unconfident consumers because democracy is not a business. After all, this is ours. Call me idealistic but my vote isn&#8217;t about the economy, and I don&#8217;t even like the word &#8216;stupid.&#8217;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made my way to Joyland, again. This time their were no rambunctious teenagers nor police men! Yay. It was a last minute decision and I&#8217;m glad that I did go. It&#8217;s such a wonderful place to visit, even in its dilapidated state. </p>
<p>I only ever went to Joyland twice, while it was still an open theme park. I had fun and was pretty bummed that it was closed down, especially since it was one less thing to do in the already sparse list of things to do in Wichita. </p>

Walking through it is eerie. The first time, of course, was a little more haunting than the second time &#8212; especially since one of the doors slammed close while were midway through the ride. Not a great thing to experience when you&#8217;re standing in pitch black darkness. Fun times though! <a href="http://ramblesaboutrambling.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_01281.jpg"><img id="i-323" alt="Image"

<p>One of the other things the War of 1812 created was the Canada/United States border – the longest undefended border in the world. In many ways this border bonds us together far more than it separates us.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve crossed this border. I was born and raised in Niagara Falls, Ontario. There are <a title="Niagara Falls Bridge Commission" href="http://niagarafallsbridges.com/which_bridge.php3" target="_blank">four bridges</a> that cross over the Niagara River linking our two countries – The Peace Bridge, The Rainbow Bridge, The Whirlpool (Lower) Bridge and the Queenston/Lewiston Bridge. I’m a “border kid”. This means I have spent my entire life crossing the border to the US, back and forth. Border kids have the distinction of being dragged half-naked “o<em>ver the river</em>” by their mothers since birth, then returning home wearing so many clothes we could play Ralphie&#8217;s little brother Randy in <em>A Christmas Story. </em>He was the kid who couldn’t put his arms down or get up when he fell, because his mom had him dressed like the Michelin Man. Yes, we were born and raised smugglers!</p>
<div id="attachment_305" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 323px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/randy_card-christmas-story.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-305" title="randy_card-christmas-story" alt="randy_card-christmas-story" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/randy_card-christmas-story.jpg" height="500" width="313" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Do not fall down when dressed like this!</p></div>
<p>By the time I was in high school I was a pro. No, NOT a professional smuggler! But, by then it was second nature to cross over to the US on my own. I didn’t drive. I walked. In fact, it was a favourite activity for kids my age to skip school and take off over the river. They had really cool stores and the chances of getting caught by our parents were pretty much slim to none. We were always polite and never lied to the border guards, (Our parents were another story.) After all, the border guards had no sense of humour and carried guns. On one particular excursion we walked across the bridge, arm and arm and singing, “We’re off to see the wizard …” We were asked to stop singing but they let us continue into the US.</p>
<div id="attachment_308" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/the-yellow-brick-road-for-canadica.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-308" title="THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD for Canadica" alt="THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD for Canadica" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/the-yellow-brick-road-for-canadica.jpg" height="288" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me (2nd from the left) and my buddies headed &#8220;Over the River&#8221;</p></div>
<p>On our way back to Canada, when they asked if we had anything to declare, I held my bag up and said, “just this pot”. We were immediately surrounded and I was relieved of my purchase. It was a little ceramic pot I had bought for 50¢ at a thrift store and still have to this day. I’m not sure who was more embarrassed, the Border Patrol or me.</p>
<div id="attachment_310" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/my-wee-pot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-310" title="My Wee Pot" alt="My Wee Pot" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/my-wee-pot.jpg" height="576" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My wee pot – 40 years later.</p></div>
<p>As a young adult, going over the river was a must. In the 70’s, the drinking age was 21 in Ontario and the bars closed at midnight or 1:00 am. Over the river, the drinking age was 18 and the bars were open until 2:00 am in one county and 4:00 am in another just minutes away. At some point the rules changed. Now, the drinking age in Ontario is 19 and the drinking age over the river is 21 – so the drinking crossovers have changed direction.</p>
<div id="attachment_321" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rainbow-bridge-for-canadica.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-321" title="RAINBOW BRIDGE for Canadica" alt="Rainbow Bridge" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rainbow-bridge-for-canadica.jpg" height="233" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes, it is that close.</p></div>
<p>There was also a time when I had a business In Niagara Falls, New York and crossed back and forth over the border every day. In the summer the lineups on the bridge could be brutal and it was difficult to keep to a schedule. So, I hooked a crate to the back of my bicycle, loaded it with my briefcase, purse and heels, and rode to and from work every day. One day, one of the Customs Officials shared a story with me (one I am sure is an urban legend).</p>
<blockquote><p>There was this fellow who crossed the bridge each day on a bicycle. He made the trip every day for many, many years. All the Customs Officials were sure he was smuggling something but never found anything on him. The man grew old and it came time for him to retire. He told the Customs Officials it was his last day, said good-bye and wished them well. One of the officials asked, &#8220;Please tell us before you go? &#8220;You&#8217;re free and clear now. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always suspected that you were smuggling something. &#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled and simply stated, “the bicycles.”</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_323" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/the-border.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-323" title="The Border" alt="THE BORDER" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/the-border.jpg" height="438" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Almost there.</p></div>
<p>We shared a piece of history that brought us together for a while. For 79 days during the 444 days of the Iran Hostage Crisis, former Canadian Ambassador, Ken Taylor and other Canadian Embassy staff, hid, protected and arranged for the escape of five Americans who had escaped from their Embassy when it was overrun. <a title="President Reagan's Account" href="http://www.rescueattempt.com/id7.html" target="_blank">(President Reagan&#8217;s account of what happened.)</a><br />
When it was finally made known to the public that the Americans were safely out of the country and that the Canadians were responsible, there appeared on the front page of our local paper a picture looking out across the Niagara Gorge to the escarpment on the other side. There was a giant banner hanging on the American side that was big enough you could read it while standing in Canada. It simply said, “THANK YOU CANADA”. I will never forget that sight. It could be because it appeared over night, or just knowing the manpower it would have taken to do such a thing. Or, could it be that it was the last time I remember an American saying “thank you”?</p>
<div id="attachment_311" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/thank-you-canada.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-311" title="Thank You Canada" alt="Thank You Canada" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/thank-you-canada.jpg" height="438" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It was like this only really, really, really big.</p></div>
<p>There was a Canadian movie made in 1981 about this called<a title="Escape From Iran:The Canadian Caper" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082339/" target="_blank"> <em>Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper</em></a> starring our very own Gordon Pinsent.<br />
You won’t remember it. I’m sure it never even played in the US.  You may, however, be aware of a little film called <a title="Argo" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/" target="_blank"><em>Argo</em></a> that&#8217;s making the rounds right now. This version of the story, directed by Ben Affleck, stars Affleck and is a dramatization of the joint CIA-Canadian secret operation. Of course the emphasis is on the CIA’s part in it. I suppose we should be grateful that Canadians were even acknowledged.</p>
<p><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/argo2012poster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313" title="Argo2012Poster" alt="Argo Movie" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/argo2012poster.jpg" height="325" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>The big attraction for people visiting Niagara Falls is, of course, the Falls. There are actually two sets of falls. The Canadian falls are called the Horseshoe Falls and are conveniently located in all their splendor to be enjoyed by anyone who comes to Niagara Falls, Ontario.</p>
<div id="attachment_316" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/niagara-falls.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-316" title="NIAGARA FALLS" alt="Canadian Horseshoe Falls" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/niagara-falls.jpg" height="349" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canadian Horseshoe Falls</p></div>
<p>The American falls are called the American Falls (clever). Right beside it is a smaller waterfall called the Bridal Veil Falls. Both of these are also conveniently located in all their glory to be enjoyed by anyone who comes to Niagara Falls, Ontario. That’s right! You have to leave Niagara Falls, New York and cross over to Niagara Falls, Ontario to see the American Falls. I think this is where someone says “location, location, location”.</p>
<div id="attachment_315" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/american-falls.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-315" title="AMERICAN FALLS" alt="American Falls" src="http://canadica.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/american-falls.jpg" height="308" width="584" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">American Falls &amp; Bridal Veil Falls<br />(Maybe I should have stopped my car to take this one.)</p></div>
<p>I still head over the river on a regular basis, even though these days I live much further away. No, there is no smuggling involved. You can’t live that close to the border and not have someone in the family marry the opposition. Now my sister lives there, my niece lives there and my grandniece lives there. That little girl is worth a trip over the river .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://einkeread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/apple-ipad-mini-new-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-527" title="apple-ipad-mini-new-2" alt="" src="http://einkeread.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/apple-ipad-mini-new-2.jpg" height="433" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>The iPad Mini (Apple&#8217;s first foray into the 7&#8243; tablet market) was announced today. Woooooo . . . I guess after hearing <a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2012/10/12/new-rumor-puts-ipad-mini-launch-event-on-23-october/#.UIckaYUbLy8" target="_blank">rumors</a> and <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/ipad-mini-now-rumored-to-look-like-ipod-touch-not-ipad_b25611" target="_blank">speculations</a> about this device for over a year, I am a little underwhelmed.</p>
<p>My lack of excitement turned into shock when I heard that the Mini&#8217;s screen resolution would be 1024 x 768 with just 162 pixels per inch. That same resolution was featured all of last year&#8217;s 7&#8243; tablets. The Kindle Fire, the Nook Tablet, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 all used this display, and I can tell you that none of them were a joy to read on. In my experience, text looks blurry or pixelated at this resolution, and when you compare it to the iPad 3&#8242;s amazing 2048 x 1536 display (264 ppi), it looks downright awful. Pictures and videos look fine, but long-form reading on a screen of this resolution can be straining on the eyes. This is a major downgrade for what is supposed to be a &#8216;new&#8217; 7&#8243; tablet product.</p>
<p>When Apple put out the retina display earlier this year, customers came to expect that all of their future iDevices would feature spectacular screen resolutions. Apple seems to be bucking against this expectation in order to save costs; although, I&#8217;m not sure that their $329 entry-level price point will win them many Kindle Fire customers. Or maybe they are worried that a retina iPad Mini would harm their iPad 3 sales? The Kindle Fire HD, that was just released last month, features a 1280 x 800 display with 216 pixels per inch (16Gb model for $199). The display on the forthcoming Nook HD 7&#8243; tablet will go all the way up to a 1440 x 900 pixel resolution (16GB model for $229). It seems that Apple is levying a $100 extra fee just for access to the Apple ecosystem, without the perk of a beautiful, high-definition display. The reduced price iPad 2, which features the same A2 processor and screen resolution, is only $399. In essence, you are buying a no-frills, 7.9&#8243; version of the iPad 2.</p>
<p>All of this is bad news for your wallet and for a key demographic the iPad Mini should have been focused on: eReaders. People who are looking for a reading and web browsing device will be less likely to purchase the iPad Mini. With all of the other incredible options that will be around this holiday season, I would find it hard to pay $329 for a tablet that might as well have been released last fall. Sony just made a <a title="The Failure: Sony’s new PRS-T2" href="http://einkeread.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/the-failure-sonys-new-prs-t2/" target="_blank">similar blunder</a> with their <a title="Sony PRS-T2 epic fail . . ." href="http://einkeread.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/sony-prs-t2-epic-fail/" target="_blank">PRS-T2 </a>eReader. Taking last year&#8217;s technology and polishing it up for the holiday season might fool some consumers, but anyone who pays attention to what is available on the market today won&#8217;t be so easily misled. The Nook HD+ will have a 9&#8243;, 1920 x 1280 display (near retina quality), and the 16GB version will cost only $269. There is a good chance that developers will quickly figure out a way to root the device, giving tech-savvy users access to its open Android 4.0 operating system and the Google Play Store. On a high-definition display, text looks sharp and defined; small fonts appear vivid and easily readable, something that is essential for web browsing. Readers will need to go elsewhere to get this type of experience.</p>
<p>Will the iPad Mini be a major failure? Probably not. I&#8217;m not sure how many people pay attention to pixel resolutions or product specifications. But they should. In all of the promotional videos I have seen for the Mini, every Apple exec claims that it &#8220;isn&#8217;t just a shrunken-down version of the iPad,&#8221; but that is exactly what it is. After making this point, they immediately pivot to the stylish design and frame of the Mini, <em>not</em> the hardware or software.</p>
<p>When deciding on which tablet to buy myself for Christmas this year, the iPad Mini definitely will not make my Santa list.</p>
