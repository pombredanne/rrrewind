			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_pony_express_run_004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="Near Ceadar Fort" src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_pony_express_run_004.jpg?w=900&#038;h=605" alt="" width="900" height="605" /></a></p>
<p>This past February 18th I joined up with the <a href="http://www.uxoc.com/" target="_blank">Utah Xterra Owners Club</a> for their annual Pony Express run. Since moving to Utah this past summer and acquiring a 2006 Nissan Xterra I have been keen to get out and explore many of the canyons around Cache Valley. This past summer and fall the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Benchmark-Utah-Road-Recreation-Atlas/dp/0929591739" target="_blank">Utah Road and Recreation Atlas (Benchmark Maps)</a> has been top on my reading list for finding new places to explore. One place I have been really interested in is the west desert area of Tooele, Juab and Millard counties. The area is also called the Great Salt Lake Desert and includes the Dugway Proving Grounds (no public access), The Pony Express Trail and a portion of the Historic Lincoln Highway. Plus it&#8217;s a really big wide open place with small mountains that look like islands and has tons of potential for photography. If that wasn’t enough my long standing project about looking at the west has up to this point primarily consisted of images showing how we experience the west through visiting National Parks. Joining up with an automobile club would be both fun and new way to think about how we experience the western landscape and meet some fellow Xterra owners.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_pony_express_run_005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397" title="Airing down tires." src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_pony_express_run_005.jpg?w=900&#038;h=605" alt="" width="900" height="605" /></a></p>
<p>We planned to meet at 9 AM in at a gas station in Lehi. This was my first time here and I have to say I was impressed with the town’s old commercial district and the grain silo. It was a perfect sunny morning with lots of activity going on. When the group of Xterra’s I was in pulled up to the gas station there were about 20 Land Rovers leaving on some adventure. Then I saw a group of road cyclists (about 30 strong) heading up the road. This must be a popular place. After everyone in our group of 11 vehicles had fueled up and did whatever we needed to do at the gas station we headed out taking 73 west toward Cedar Fort for about 30 miles then hit gravel road at Five Mile Pass and kept going west. After a short distance we stopped as a group to take the opportunity to air down our tires. This was something I was initially wary of doing since I did not have a way to air them back up. Talking to a few drivers I learned that by deflating the tires it would provide better grip and also absorb some of the road vibrations. With over 100 miles to go I decided to air down slightly and see if I noticed any difference. It was hard to tell how much difference it was making for my ride as I only aired down about 7 pounds. I’ll have to experiment with this more on future runs.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218-16243.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-398" title="Pet Graveyard near Lookout Pass on the Pony Express Rd." src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218-16243.jpg?w=900&#038;h=605" alt="" width="900" height="605" /></a></p>
<p>Our next stop was Lookout Pass Station. We climbed a small hill had a look around, snapped some pictures of our vehicles with their first mud of the day then headed down to the walled off pet cemetery at the base of the hill. We attempted to drive up Little Valley Rd. on our way to Simpson Springs but due to bad road conditions we decided to head back to the main Pony Express Road. Being new to 4-wheeling it was one of the muddiest sections of road I have been on. I think it was a good decision to turn back and try it again when it has dried out.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_simpson_springs_station_030.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-399" title="Lot full of Nissan Xterra's at Simpson Springs" src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_simpson_springs_station_030.jpg?w=900&#038;h=450" alt="" width="900" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Soon after we arrived at Simpson Springs Pony Express Station and stopped for lunch, conversation and picture taking. The highlight of the stop was watching a helicopter rounding up what I assumed to be wild horses. After some time the horses actually ran pretty close to where we were parked and everyone tried their hand at photographing the action. I got a couple of shots off before my camera battery mysteriously died. After some time we geared up and headed west toward Dugway Pass. Between Simpson Springs and Dugway Pass it’s about 20 miles of straight and flat road. Leave plenty of distance between vehicles (dust and visibility) and watch your speed. It’s easy to start going fast and you have to remind yourself that gravel roads handle very differently from highways. A hole in the road or dip could put you in a bad situation a long way from help.</p>

<p>After a restroom break at Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge we stopped at Wilson Hot Spring. This was where my Xterra got muddy. The drive out to the spring was a sticky mix of mud, sand and salt. At one point I was sliding toward a very wet patch that had boards across it; some kind of sign not to go that way. Luckily I stopped before sliding into it and was able to back out and take the little bypass. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Roads-Visionaries-Trailblazers-Superhighways/dp/0618812415/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331156739&amp;sr=1-1">The sticky mud reminded me of a passage in Earl Swift’s book The Big Roads</a>,  “a truck convoy finding the Siberling Cutoff impassable, set off across the salt. This would have been a risky move in a light runabout. In a giant cargo hauler the results were inevitable. every truck that ventured onto the flats broke through and became hopelessly mired; even a Caterpillar tractor failed to achieve any traction in the stinking goop that lurked beneath the surface.” (page 68). The story ends with the trucks being carried out by hand. I’m glad to be living in a time of better roads and capable vehicles. The story is a good reminder of the dangers of traveling in the west desert of Utah.</p>

<p>A little farther down the road on the other side of the Fish Springs Range we took a side road at the Utah and Emma Mines. It was a nice climb up to the top. I waited on the main road until the end of our convoy as I wanted to get a shot of all the Xterras going up the road before I joined the party. The drive up the old mining road ended with everyone parking in a row with a spectacular view of the Deep Creek Range and Snake Valley. In low range and third gear I only had to tap the brakes on a few sharp bends in the road on our way back down. At this point we would be heading in generally North West and would go through the very small town of Callao.</p>

<p>About 5 miles out of Callao we turned onto a section of road that is marked both as the Pony Express Rd. and the Old Lincoln Highway. Except for one spot the road was dry but it was slow going as the road wound through many washes and small hills. This was the only part of the trip where we had traffic coming from the other direction. I can only imagine what it must have been like traveling in this area with a 1930’s or 40’s era vehicle (loose steering, breaks that lock up, no seat belts) and then coming around a curve to find another car headed your way. After 25 miles we were back on asphalt. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Hill,_Utah">Realizing we had missed the turnoff to take us to Gold Hill</a>; members of our group talked via radio to see who wanted to go to Gold Hill and who wanted to just head to Wendover. Most of us decided to go to Gold Hill and arrived around 5 PM the place was literally a ghost town. I now understood why there were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=gold+hill+utah">so many photos on the web of this old store front</a>. It’s about the only thing there. I joined in and shot about 30 frames of the building from a few angles so I could stitch together a panoramic image of the place.</p>

<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_gold_hill_026.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-409" title="UXOC at Gold Hill" src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_gold_hill_026.jpg?w=900&#038;h=450" alt="" width="900" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_wendover_area_002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-410" title="Looking toward Bonniville" src="http://lookingatthewest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/20120218_wendover_area_002.jpg?w=900&#038;h=450" alt="" width="900" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Next stop Wendover. A quick dinner and then the trek back to Logan. Since a winter storm was hitting the Wasatch Front I opted to take a northern route back to Cache Valley via the Old Midland Trail (Utah 30) and hopefully avoid traffic and snow. As it turns out it was the best option. In two and a half hours I made it to Tremonton and entered Cache Valley via Riverside. At Beaver Dam the snow had started and the road conditions deteriorated rapidly. Crossing the valley the snow just kept coming and traffic slowed to a crawl. My journey that had started at 7 AM that morning was completed 17 hours later at 11 PM. The only trouble I had was getting up my steep and snow-covered driveway. But I made it.</p>

<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/butch_cassidy_and_the_sundance_kid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1701" title="Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/butch_cassidy_and_the_sundance_kid.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>When we talk about large or small movies today, it&#8217;s usually a clear-cut no-fuss discussion. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217613/" target="_blank">Battle of Los Angeles</a></em>: big. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0842926/" target="_blank">The Kids Are All Right</a></em>: small. But it wasn&#8217;t always this way. Take, for your consideration, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/" target="_blank">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></em>. This film was both broad (in the good, non-<em>Whitne</em>y way) and detail-oriented. Oh, and that soundtrack. It gets me every time. Runner-ups: <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056923/" target="_blank">Charade</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057413/" target="_blank">The Pink Panther</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062136/" target="_blank">Playtime</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059793/" target="_blank">That Darn Cat!</a></em>.</p>
<h3>9. The Birds</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1702" title="The Birds" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/imgthe-birds3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="517" /></a></p>
<p>And the madness begins. Long ago, on a <a href="http://themovieblog8.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/reqview-the-birds/" target="_blank">now-defunct feature called &#8220;Required Viewing,&#8221;</a> I called <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/" target="_blank">The Birds</a> </em>&#8220;truly terrifying&#8221; and I said that all Hitchcock&#8217;s best films rely on a &#8220;degree of coincidence.&#8221; I don&#8217;t usually like coincidence, but I never seemed to mind it when Hitch did it. Just look at <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/" target="_blank">North by Northwest</a></em>, a film that even I think is as flimsy as <a href="http://www.castleofspirits.com/threemenbaby.html" target="_blank">a cardboard cutout of Ted Danson</a>. Somehow, though, that film works. And while the birds the movie was named after might not be as real as the character Jessica Tandy lays down here, the coincidence factor and the film itself both work too.</p>
<h3>8. A Shot in the Dark</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/poster-a-shot-in-the-dark-1964_07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1704" title="A Shot in the Dark" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/poster-a-shot-in-the-dark-1964_07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="385" /></a></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058586/" target="_blank">A Shot in the Dark</a></em> is the best (and probably my favorite) Clouseau/Pink Panther film. You&#8217;ve got &#8220;sex&#8221; scenes with bombs in them, nudist colonies with too few guitars, and hilarious murders galore in this 1964 comedy classic. When and if I ever make a top comedies list, <em>A Shot in the Dark</em> will be high on it.</p>
<h3>7. Planet of the Apes</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/zaius_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1705" title="Planet of the Apes" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/zaius_1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>An oldie but an iconic goodie. 1968&#8242;s <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/" target="_blank">Planet</a></em> and 2011&#8242;s <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/" target="_blank">Rise</a></em> are two very different films in tone, but suspiciously follow basically the same plot arc.</p>
<h3>6. 2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2001_460.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706" title="2001: A Space Odyssey" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2001_460.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>An interesting comparison for <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/" target="_blank">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> is <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/" target="_blank">The Tree of Life</a></em>. I wasn&#8217;t sure what was going on 100% of the time in either movie, but I&#8217;m so very glad I sat and watched them all the way through. What happened to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001158/" target="_blank">Keir Dullea</a>, though? Did he not ever have a career?</p>
<h3>5. The Manchurian Candidate</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/the-manchurian-candidate.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1707" title="The Manchurian Candidate" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/the-manchurian-candidate.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of interesting comparisons, I think <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056218/" target="_blank">The Manchurian Candidate</a></em> makes an incredible companion piece with one of the following picks. If you&#8217;ve seen both the films, you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<h3>4. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/b1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1708" title="The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/b1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>A classic. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/" target="_blank">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</a></em> is the best western of all-time (no, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1518812/" target="_blank">Meek&#8217;s Cutoff</a></em> is <strong>not</strong> an appropriate selection). I have never seen it all the way through until last year, despite having seen certain parts more than 10 times each. Clint Eastwood does more with silence than anyone, and his silences are on display here.</p>
<h3>3. The Apartment</h3>
<div id="attachment_1709" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/apartmentthe.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1709" title="The Apartment" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lemmon37408710main-420x0.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="308" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The second best final line in a Wilder film</p></div>
<p>Yes, another Billy Wilder. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/" target="_blank">The Apartment</a></em> is one of his best two films, and it goes from wildly satirical to beautifully dark in an instant, then switches back and forth as it pleases. Baxter&#8217;s &#8220;friends&#8221; at work are great, but the neighbors are the best.</p>
<h3>2. Psycho</h3>
<div id="attachment_1710" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/psycho.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1710" title="Psycho" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/psycho-prequel.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="273" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;I'm so glad Community is back.&quot;</p></div>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/" target="_blank">Psycho</a></em> was my favorite film before I discovered <em>Some Like it Hot</em>, and I still really love it. But, I must admit, there is one sixties film that is better. And that film is&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. A Hard Day&#8217;s Night</h3>
<p><a href="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/a-hard-days-night-19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711" title="A Hard Day's Night" src="http://themovieblog8.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/a-hard-days-night-19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>If we&#8217;re comparing these films to the film of the last calendar year, which I have already done to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (with <em>The Tree of Life</em>), then why not just say that <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/" target="_blank">A Hard Day&#8217;s Night</a></em> was the 60s&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442/" target="_blank">The Artist</a></em>? It&#8217;s black-and-white; it&#8217;s old school, but still manages to be fresh and somewhat innovative; it allows its characters to breathe and come to life on screen; and I love and will defend them both.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let the cynical person do the research, because without doubt we have nothing to question.</p>
<p>More and more people are feeling comfortable talking about their online dating experiences, or even admitting to the fact that they&#8217;ve turned to the internet in order to find a mate.  It was not long ago that most people would feel very embarrassed to say that they had a dating profile online because we once associated that with desperation.  Before &#8220;Online Dating&#8221;, these types of services were associated with those &#8220;Video Dating&#8221; services that &#8220;completely helpless&#8221; people used, or at least that&#8217;s how they were portrayed in the media.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably best described in the &#8220;Lowered Expectations&#8221; segments that were so popular in the 90&#8242;s on Mad TV.  (Hey, I remember when I was 12 and I thought Mad TV was genius!)  Those skits showed the saddest and most pathetic people on the planet making desperate pleas for love on a VHS because they were so lonely and couldn&#8217;t find a date to save their lives.  As the internet blew up (I hear it&#8217;s doing well) then so did Online Dating.  You didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere to try and find another single person in your area, now you could make a spiffy profile and hopefully, finally, someone would love you.</p>
<p><a href="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lowered-expectations.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-830" title="lowered-expectations" src="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lowered-expectations.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Just make sure to delete browsing history or cookies in case someone else uses your computer, because God forbid that anyone you knew found out that you resorted to Online Dating to look for love.</p>
<p>However, by now most people are sort of past that.  When I first signed up for Match.com in 2010, I dared not tell a soul.  I only told my roommate because it was a lot easier than making up lies for the three times I went out on a date.  In retrospect I could have easily lied, but how did I know I would only go on three Match dates in three months?  I was finally steered towards OkCupid by a friend, which not only led my to OkCupid, but &#8220;Hey! You use online dating too?!&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one, all of my friends started admitting that they were using OkCupid or some form of internet dating, including my friends that I never would have considered to &#8220;need&#8221; online dating.  These were my guy friends that always had girlfriends or were really good at picking up girls, but they <em>also</em> used Online Dating.  At this point, I let go of all my inhibitions about Online Dating completely, to the point where I was writing about it online and not anonymously.  Hey, look, you&#8217;re here and I&#8217;m saying these words right now as proof.</p>
<p>I became an advocate for Online Dating, especially the free sites like OkCupid.  Not only is OkCupid free, but I felt that they had a lot more of the kinds of girls that I would actually consider compatible and I found that Match is really for a different type of dater.  It&#8217;s the kind of place that I might go back to when I&#8217;m 40, however by the point I can&#8217;t see what kind of faith I&#8217;ll have in life or society if I&#8217;m still doing this in eleven years.</p>
<p>I told people about Online Dating, I blogged about it, and I put myself out there for dozens of girls in the last year and a half.  I&#8217;ve given it my all and yet I sit here today with more experience, yet far less faith in the format than I had six months ago.  I used to tell people that Online Dating was the way to go because at this point we spend the majority of our time online, or on our phones, and we simply don&#8217;t have the time to &#8220;meet people in real life&#8221; like we used to.  Not only that, but being able to look at Profiles and seeing our Match% right off of the bat, gives us the kind of perspective that meeting in person or being set up on a blind date simply cannot do.</p>
<p>While that may be true, I have yet to see where it has made us more successful in finding love than any other format.  Just because we spend a lot of time online and just because we can look through dozens of profiles in an instant, does that have any kind of correlation to the answer we were looking for when we started this: Can I find a girl (or guy, whatever), to get serious with?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I really want to know.  Can you find a bunch of people to<em> have sex</em> with?  Yes, absolutely.  There&#8217;s no doubt that if you just want to find a quick and easy way to hook up, then Online Dating&#8217;s success is easily verifiable.  The format is actually perfect for that.  But when people say &#8220;You can&#8217;t find a girlfriend at a bar&#8221; does that mean that you&#8217;re any more successful in a relationship if you find someone on the internet when you&#8217;re sober?</p>
<p>So far, I can&#8217;t help but say that in my time online, I haven&#8217;t found a single relationship that lasted more than a few dates.  In fact, the two most successful relationships I&#8217;ve ever had started at a bar.  But I am only a sample of one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve scoured the internet for facts and figures, because I&#8217;m a stats guy.  I want to know what the statistics tell us about Online Dating in 2012.  Are people finding their love online with any more success than they are at a bar or in the grocery store?  Is it still best to find a person through a friend or at school/work?  If it&#8217;s still best to find a girlfriend at school, then I&#8217;ve got some explaining to do to the principal and the police and all that.  This is what I&#8217;ve found:</p>
<p><strong>Online Dating Has Become Big Business</strong></p>
<p>The more comfortable we become with using the internet to find a soulmate, the more valuable the services have become.  Research shows that the Dating Service Industry is <a href="http://www.datingsitesreviews.com/article.php?story=A-Look-at-the-US-Dating-Site-Market-2012" target="_blank">worth $2.1 billion in the U.S. alone</a>, with over half of that being attributed to Online Dating.</p>
<p><a href="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/make-money-online.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-834" title="make-money-online" src="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/make-money-online.jpg?w=213&#038;h=300" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that OkCupid is mostly a free service (though they have upgrades that do come with fees, I&#8217;ve never seen any real need to pay them) it&#8217;s using the same methods that a site like Facebook uses to generate revenue: Look at how many members and site hits we have! Give us advertising money!</p>
<p>This is what makes it crazy to think that anyone would pay for a dating service and indeed, fewer and fewer people are doing so.  Though sites like Match and eHarmony will still attract users (<a href="http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/onlinedatingstatistics.html" target="_blank">they are still the top dating services</a>) based on name recognition, advertising, and appealing to a more adult market while boasting a higher success rate.  (Though not confirmed to actually be more successful.)</p>
<p>I might not think it&#8217;s worth it to pay for a dating service now, but when you get to a certain age you might hit the panic button.  I don&#8217;t think you can put a price on finding a girlfriend or a boyfriend that honestly makes you happy, but they have yet to prove to me that it actually works.</p>
<p>With big business comes big responsibility, and as Online Dating grows into this bigger and bigger monster I see positive effects (more people online dating, more choices) and negative ones (greed breeds lies, spam, and sometimes more choices is not a good thing.)  Whether or not Online Dating is successful for us is up for debate, but it&#8217;s definitely become very successful in business.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is The Online Dater?</strong></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.datingsitesreviews.com/article.php?story=Who-Uses-Online-Dating" target="_blank">2009 survey</a>, you were more likely to use Internet Dating if you were:</p>
<ul>
<li>More sociable</li>
<li>Had a high self-esteem and put value in romantic relationships</li>
<li>Had a low self-esteem but did not put value in romantic relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>But you were less likely if you were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introverted</li>
<li>Had a low self-esteem and put value in romantic relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting here is the idea that it doesn&#8217;t matter how high or low you value yourself, but how you value romantic relationships.  If you were confident in yourself, then you had no problem putting yourself out there in an online format looking for love.  If you didn&#8217;t have high self-confidence, you&#8217;ll put yourself out there, but only because your ready to get used and abused.  A person with a low self-esteem will date online but only because they think relationships are stupid anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone out with both of these types of girls and I am not turned on by anybody with a low self-esteem and then when they love ya and leave ya, it should come as no surprise.</p>
<p><strong>1 in 5 &#8220;Have Dated&#8221; Someone They Met Online, Thanks Match.com.</strong></p>
<p>Remember when Match.com started running these ads?  At the time, they did seem like mind-boggling statistics.  Until that moment, most people were still in hiding about their Online Dating experiences.  At this point, it actually seems very low.  But it was genius advertising at the time.</p>
<p>However, when I read the study (<a href="http://blog.cmbinfo.com/press-center-content/bid/46915/The-Evolution-of-Dating-Match-com-and-Chadwick-Martin-Bailey-Behavioral-Studies-Uncover-a-Fundamental-Shift" target="_blank">found here</a> by Chadwick Martin Bailey) it&#8217;s not really that impressive, based on the wording.</p>
<p>&#8220;1 in 5 &#8211; Number of current singles that have dated someone they met on an online dating site.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/match.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-835" title="match" src="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/match.png" alt="" width="280" height="290" /></a></p>
<p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;re gonna like the way you look inside this girl.  I guarantee it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Before I start hating on it, this study is two years old.  A lot has changed in two years.  They should really do a new study and re-pop those commercials with some new fangled statistics.  (Unless they can&#8217;t cause they&#8217;re not better?)   Okay, well, what do you mean by &#8220;have dated&#8221;?  Gone out once?  Gone out for a month?  Had a mutual masturbation session?  Let&#8217;s get specific here, because I&#8217;ve never been serious with anyone online but I can certainly see a scenario in which I say &#8220;Yes&#8221; to that, and I am NOT a symbol of success in terms of Online Dating.</p>
<p>These studies were conducted by Match with CMB, and therefore were biased to begin with.  Which tells me that it&#8217;s much lower than 1 in 5.  (Or was back then.)  Their final results said people most often met their spouse like this:</p>
<p>1) Through work/school                    36%</p>
<p>2) Through friend/family member       26%</p>
<p>3) Via Online Dating site                  17%</p>
<p>4) Through bars/clubs/social events   11%</p>
<p>5) Other                                         7%</p>
<p>6) Through church/places of worship   4%</p>
<p>Less than half as often as marrying a co-worker or one of your students.  (That&#8217;s what they mean by school, right?)  Still less often than meeting someone through a mutual friend, and really not that much more often that meeting someone at a bar!  Really?  It&#8217;s only six percent more likely that I&#8217;ll find my future wife online than I will at that divey pub under the bridge?!?!</p>
<p>When these results were posted on 4/20 in 2010, the results wouldn&#8217;t make it seem like they were high, but these numbers actually look pretty shitty if they were the same in 2012.  Especially when I consider the fact that over the last three years, I&#8217;ve gone on a lot more online dates than I have gone on dates with girls I&#8217;ve met socially or through other means.  So while it is true that OkCupid has given me a whole lot more to choose from, it&#8217;s also given me way more FAILS.  They&#8217;re like the shooting guard that takes 40 shots and misses most of them, compared to the efficient small forward that goes 4-for-6 and is also a lot cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re Twice As Likely To Fuck A Person On The First Date Than To Eventually Marry Them</strong></p>
<p>According <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/online-dating-statistics/" target="_blank">to Statisticsbrain.com via Rueters</a>, 33% of women have had sex on their first online date with someone, while 17% of marriages in the last year started out as an online courtship.</p>
<p>This helps back up my earlier theory that the internet is a great place to find quick and easy sex, but not to find the love of your life.  However, I won&#8217;t ignore the fact that almost 1 in 5 marriages are coming from the Online Dating world.  After all, some of them have to be successful, right?  Additionally, if you do get married after meeting online, the period between your first date and saying &#8220;I Do&#8221; is half as long as if you met her at a Carls Jr or at a Home Depot while fighting over the last pair of Truck Nuts.  (Offline, basically, is what I&#8217;m getting at.)  The courtship period for Online Daters that marry: 18.5 months.  Offliners: 42 months.  Clearly, they are still using 56k and us internet nerds are used to high-speed DSL.</p>
<p><strong>Other results from the study:</strong></p>
<p>10% of users leave within the first three months &#8211; Which is actually a potentially bad sign to me.  You don&#8217;t want to be Online Dating forever.  However, three months isn&#8217;t a long time really&#8230; But it&#8217;s not some magical solution either.  I want to know how many people have found a serious partner within one year.  I&#8217;ve been on OkCupid for over a year and I have seen a lot of the same girls over and over again in my search results during that time.</p>
<p>Number of questions to fill out on eHarmony survey is 400 &#8211; Holy Fuckballs!  I&#8217;ll top out at 100, thanks very much.</p>
<p>64% of People Say &#8220;Common Interests&#8221; are the Most Important Factors in Meeting Someone &#8211; This is fair and believable.  I mean, I want to meet somebody that has interests in writing, movies, television, and has a great sense of humor.  Somebody that I can have fun with.  It is important that you have some attraction to the person (49% say Physical Characteristics are the most important factor, blowing their math skills out of the water&#8230; uhhh.. questioning study or I&#8217;m not understanding the wording) but you&#8217;re trying to balance the looks with the common interests and come to a fair conclusion.</p>
<p>71% of People Believe in Love at First Sight &#8211; Or should I say &#8220;Love at first SITE lolololol!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Percent of Sex Offenders Who Use Online Dating To Meet People: 10%  - GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!  yikes.</p>
<p>38% of Girls Prefer Nice Guys Compared to 15% for Bad Guys, but 6% Take &#8220;Any Man They Can Get&#8221;  - I&#8217;m still looking for that six percent.</p>
<p>By 48, Men Have Twice as Many Online Pursuers As Women &#8211; I only have 19 years to go!</p>
<p><strong>Taller Guys And Shorter Women Get More Action</strong></p>
<p>According <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/" target="_blank">to OkCupid</a>, men have more sex when they get to 6&#8217;4-6&#8217;5, but then it drops again when they become freakishly tall.  I am actually 6&#8217;5-6&#8217;6, but maybe I should reduce my listed height to 6&#8217;5&#8243;!  On the other side, shorter women get more messages than taller ones.</p>
<p><a href="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tall_man.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-832" title="tall_man" src="http://kennethauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tall_man.jpg?w=215&#038;h=300" alt="" width="215" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that I always lacked confidence because of my weight, but that&#8217;s nothing compared to being a guy that&#8217;s 5&#8217;5&#8243; or shorter.  A guy that&#8217;s 6&#8217;8&#8243; will get twice as many messages as a guy that is 5&#8217;0&#8243;.  How many 5 foot guys are out there though I wonder, not counting A-list Hollywood actors, that all seem to look like jockeys in real life?</p>
<p>Other findings in that study include a really interesting look at Income and Age for Men and how it attracts unsolicited messages.  I&#8217;ve never listed my income on my profile, mostly because I don&#8217;t see the point.  What does it really matter? If you make a lot of money, you&#8217;re bragging.  If you don&#8217;t make a lot of money, you&#8217;re pathetic.  I make decent money, nothing I&#8217;m ashamed of, but I don&#8217;t really see the point in listing it because I don&#8217;t see how my income should affect how dateable I am and if it does, fuck you.</p>
<p>So did I arrive at any answers?  Yes, I think so. I think that I&#8217;ve found that Online Dating, while being more successful than it appeared to be three years ago, is still not that much more successful than meeting someone in person.  In certain terms, one could even say that Online Dating should have a much higher rate of success based on: A.) The amount of data we have on the other person before we meet and B.) The amount of people we meet online compared to in our social lives, and yet the results aren&#8217;t that much more impressive.</p>
<p>When I started Online Dating, I had low expectations and was really nervous about it.  I was really nervous about meeting someone from the internet, much more so than meeting someone in person where I just say &#8220;Hey, how&#8217;s it going?&#8221;  Once I got over that initial nervousness, I saw it as a great way to meet people.  I had gotten way past being nervous and now I was a god Damn beast when it came to meeting girls online.  I got down the meeting place, the conversation, all that shit&#8230;</p>
<p>So I should be more successful right?</p>
<p>Well, despite my much higher confidence, I just found more and more fails.  And that&#8217;s not to say that it&#8217;s because of Online Dating.  It&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s not because I just fucking sucked, or didn&#8217;t meet the right girls, or whatever&#8230; it can all still be attributed to all of those things or none of those things.  Just like any other way to meet people.  It just means that Online Dating isn&#8217;t that much better than picking up a girl at a bar.  Not only because of MY experiences, but because of the research I found in combination with that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that I won&#8217;t meet &#8220;the one&#8221; from OkCupid.  Or that you won&#8217;t.  I have a friend that&#8217;s married to a girl from OkCupid.  It can work, it&#8217;s proven to have worked.  If 1 in 5 marriages started Online, that&#8217;s VERY significant and especially considering with how new the format is, relatively.  It could grow and grow, but only because business is booming right now.  It&#8217;s a super popular way for people to meet, and it&#8217;s only getting bigger.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think that the format has proven to be completely successful yet.  It&#8217;s got a long ways to go.  There&#8217;s a lot to be learned from it and I&#8217;m still learning from it.  However, as of now, it&#8217;s sort of just a place to meet/fuck and maybe I&#8217;ll call you tomorrow.  (Just like the bar.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 2012 and we know what that means. No, I&#8217;m not talking about leap year. No, I&#8217;m not talking about the Olympics. No&#8230; okay, let me just spell it out. Presidential Election Year (in the United States &#8211; sorry international readers). But amidst all the rampant speculation and political horse race coverage, we can often lose sight of what&#8217;s important in a Presidential candidate: the ability to deliver a kick-ass speech while we face certain death.</p>
<p><strong>1. Jack Nicholson as President James Dale (Mars Attacks)</strong></p>
<p>Admittedly, a world crazy enough to elect Jack Nicholson president deserves to be attacked by Mars. But there&#8217;s a wicked swagger to the President and, clearly, he&#8217;s got a way with words &#8211; even if it doesn&#8217;t turn out so well in the end.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://thotplaces.com/2012/03/08/the-greatest-fictional-presidents-in-film/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/MPMmC0UAnj0/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Morgan Freeman as President Beck (Deep Impact)</strong></p>
<p>Note to whoever makes these decisions at the White House: if, in the real world, you ever need to deliver REALLY bad news to the public, get Morgan Freeman to do it. His voice is so damn calming. This clip is after the threat has been mostly averted (SPOILER ALERT), but it&#8217;s still inspirational.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://thotplaces.com/2012/03/08/the-greatest-fictional-presidents-in-film/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/C0SqH_PRfGU/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Bill Pullman as President Whitmore (Independence Day)</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest and most inspiring speech that any fictional president has delivered. Although I&#8217;m generally a pacifist, I would take up prop weapons to defeat an invading computer generated alien threat for this man.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://thotplaces.com/2012/03/08/the-greatest-fictional-presidents-in-film/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/aUdB8gCMcXI/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this November, when you go to cast your vote for the next President of The United States of America, take these clips into consideration. When it comes down to it, can your candidate deliver the kind of inspiring, rousing and well-articulated speech we&#8217;re going to need when the MayanPocalypse 2012 goes down?</p>

<p>My first day out in Hong Kong Island&#8211; sun shining, blue water, energetic bustle of people.  I remembered why on my first visit five years ago, I had boldly stated that I wanted to move to Hong Kong.  Hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but maybe one day&#8230;</p>

Last month we went to a <a href="http://ashleyforrette.tumblr.com/post/18234707930">pool hall and ate greasy pub food and drank beer </a>while I kicked his ass on the pool table. This month we stuffed ourselves full of pancakes and french toast and headed up to the mountain for a snow day.</p>
<p>Mt Hood. Sunny, snowy, and completely wonderful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, whether it be relationships, family, business, sport and exercise goals, or whatever is important in one’s life &#8211; the key to success is positivity.</p>
<p>As the great Bruce Lee once said, “as you think, you shall become”.</p>
<p><a href="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bruce-lee.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-846" title="Bruce-Lee" src="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bruce-lee.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>“I got out of the wrong side of bed this morning”, “it’s just not my day”, these are comments that are self-defeating and in essence negative. If you flipped those on their heads as mere clichés and moved on with your day, I have no doubt that your day and the way you view your day will improve immensely.</p>
<p>In exercise and nutrition, as in life, it is the same. If we are in a bad state mentally, negativity and negative outcomes will undoubtedly ensue. If we start beating ourselves up every time we indulge more than normal in a restaurant or patisserie, or if we turn up to exercise in a bad mind-set, chances are we’ll continue to indulge for the rest of week or that we’ll have a below-par workout. Now and again, one of my one-to-one clients will stomp up the steps to workout. “Hi Paddy” (grumpy voice). Now and again I will turn them around and tell them to do it again. Spring up the steps, “Hi Paddy” (cheery voice) &#8211; and that workout will be great.</p>
<p>Life is too short to be negative. We only get one life and to make the most of it, we need to live it. Before you think that all I have for you today is clichés and phrases, here are my top 3 tips to being positive and living a HAPPY healthy life.</p>
<p><strong>1/ Persevere </strong></p>
<p>If you miss a workout, or take an unforeseen week off your exercise plan (as many of you have just done I think?!), then don’t dwell on this and think that it’s the end of your fitness gains and positive body composition changes as you know them. Forget it. Move on.</p>
<p>Take each day as it comes. Focus on doing your best every day. Just as I advise to my clients during their workouts; don’t focus on surviving the workout, focus instead on getting the most out of each rep. Live in the moment and then that session and your long term goals will arrive more quickly and with greater satisfaction, as you’ve enjoyed every minute. If we think about how much we have to do today, sometimes that is very daunting. Don’t. Focus on the next appointment, the next voyage, the next hour of work or training and make the most of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mark-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-849" title="Mark 3" src="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mark-3.jpg?w=480&#038;h=160" alt="" width="480" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>The legend that is Will Smith, once told of a story of being put to work by his father when he was young to build a wall of a house. He said, instead of focusing on the entire wall and being daunted by the prospect of finishing it, he and his brother focused on laying each brick in the best way possible. Soon the wall was finished.</p>
<p>It is more dangerous to fall in to a diet mentallity, than to not do a diet at all. Hence my last post about low-carb eating &#8211; and how I very much discourage dieting. For the vast majority of my clients I have instructed them incrementally how to sustain eating well, according to the tenets of my PowerPack plan. Once you personally discover a healthy way of eating that works for you, then simply don’t stop. Enjoying an indulgent meal or cheat meal is actually physiologically (and motivationally) beneficial to achieving and maintaining your shape. If you cheat more than once however, don’t let that be the signal for the dominoes to start tumbling. Stop. Reset. Keep going. Your goal in training should be steering clear of quick fixes and more on the long-term solution (through taking one day and one rep at a time). Your quest should be a lean and healthy life and to ensure you don’t fall off and get run over by the diet bandwagon.</p>
<p>It is important that you don’t strive to be ‘perfect’. That is destined for failure. Firstly, that goal will never come, as you’ll constantly be comparing yourself to what perfect ‘should’ be (friends, movie stars, etc.) Secondly, setting your goals unrealistically makes it much more likely that you’ll crash in to a cycle of helplessness (i.e. bingeing or stopping exercising for weeks on end). Thirdly, the goal of perfection is far too far away. You’ll miss what happened on the steps in between if you focus on the horizon. Focus on the now and do your best with this moment, with this day and be happy with the small, incremental achievements &#8211; such as lifting more weight or more reps than in your last session, running that run 2 seconds faster than last month, leaving that second helping of cheese fondue, when everyone else went for it! Don’t look for validation from others, do it for you.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>2/ Simplify</strong></p>
<p>Don’t overthink and don’t overcomplicate. Eating well, living healthily and exercising effectively should not be complicated. A successful workout does not have to involve 12 super-setted TRX exercises, 6 Swiss Ball exercises in tri-sets, Kettlebell-this, Bosu Ball-that. A successful session is often the simplest. It is just necessary to do the right workout at the right intensity, often with full body compound exercises (isolation is appropriate but less often than not, for a vast array of fitness goals).</p>
<p>It is very easy to fall in to paralysis by analysis. Too much information available in the media and on the internet. Too many things to do today. Which workout shall I do? What shall I eat today? It’s very easy to get overwhelmed. Seek to trim the unnecessary fat (excuse the pun). By simplifying tasks, avoiding the unnecessary and achieving one thing everyday for example (that’s 365 things a year by the way!), the weight quickly starts to lift from one’s shoulders.</p>
<p>Rather than panic on what you are going to do in the next workout and think it over for hours, only to find time has run out or you have conveniently found something else to do, get your trainers on, get your kit on and leave the house. Chances are excellent that you will then find something very simple to do, but very effective. Don’t adopt the “one day I’m going to” attitude.</p>
<div><a href="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/steps-in-sand.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-840" title="Steps in Sand" src="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/steps-in-sand.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Today, is one day. One step at a time.</p>
<p><strong>3/ Surround Yourself with Positive People</strong><br />
According to one Jim Rohn (motivational speaker and self-help guru), you are the average of the 5 people you spend most time around. If you spend all of your time around people who are quick to be critical, quick to be skeptical and are generally pessimistic individuals; this will make you that way inclined whether you like it or not. How often do I see in sport, one or two people’s attitudes become infectious (in a positive way, it’s often more obvious) to the rest of the team. Next time you give someone a call to workout with, choose someone that encourages, that laughs, that focuses on the positives.</p>
<p>Do you really need to be reading that Facebook feed that is more often than not critical. Do you really need to be reading the news every day when it’s more often than not negative. Do you really need to spend all of your time around that one person that saps your energy. Probably not. Endeavour to surround yourself with positive people, positive information and you yourself will be more positive.</p>
<p>I am lucky in the fact that the number one person I spend most time around outside of training time, is possibly the cheeriest person on earth (my wife!). This undoubtedly rubs off on me and affects my outlook for sure. I am also very lucky in the fact that I train with and coach troops of happy Campers and one-to-one clients. This makes me happy. I make them happy. It&#8217;s one big circle of happiness!!</p>
<p><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><a href="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/e-w.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-844" title="E-W" src="http://paddywarwick.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/e-w.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Likewise, you don’t have to wait and be the one to be affected by the happy-bug. You be the one who creates it and see what happens. Proact, don’t react.</p>
<p>“Smile and the whole world smiles with you”. How true this is. Spread the love.</p>
<p><strong>Take Home Message</strong></p>
<p>Live in the moment, focus on the positives and move forwards with a smile on your face. In my humble opinion, this is the underlying key to success in exercise, nutrition and life in general.</p>
