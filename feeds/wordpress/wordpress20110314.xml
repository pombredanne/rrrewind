			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Happy 3.14, fellow nerds! I learned this year that today is also Albert Einstein&#8217;s birthday. It&#8217;s a Pi Day miracle! For all you nerds &amp; non-nerds alike, here&#8217;s another tasty post from my good friend <a title="Love your heart, curry style" href="http://makemyselfathome.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/love-your-heart-curry-style/">Momo</a>. Tell me I&#8217;m not the only one drooling over these photos!</em></p>
<p>Even though I know Catherine LOVES this holiday, she was nice enough to let me share a recipe for Pi day. So here is a delicious Peanut Butter 3.14 to celebrate this fun holiday!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://makemyselfathome.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_5226.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-438 aligncenter" title="Peanut Butter Pie" src="http://makemyselfathome.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_5226.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This is a recipe I tweaked recipe from the <em>New Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook </em>to resemble the amazing Peanut Butter Torte they used to serve at the <a title="Skyroom Restaurant" href="http://dining.byu.edu/skyroom" target="_blank">Skyroom</a> when <a title="Single Serving Split Pea Soup" href="http://makemyselfathome.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/single-serving-split-pea-soup/">Lisa</a> and I worked there.</p>
<p><em> </em><br />
Start with a graham cracker pie crust, either purchased, or even better, this recipe made in a 9&#8243; springform pan:</p>
<p>1/3 cup butter</p>
<p>¼ cup sugar</p>
<p>1 ¼ cups finely crushed graham crackers</p>
<p>Melt butter, stir in sugar. Add crushed crackers, toss to mix well. Spread evenly into a 9 inch springform pan (a pie pan will also work). Press onto bottom and sides to form an even crust.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 4-5 minutes or until edge is slightly browned, and cool on wire rack before filling.</p>
<p>Then mix up this creamy filling and try not to eat it all out of the bowl:</p>
<p>One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened</p>
<p>¾ cup peanut butter</p>
<p>1 cup sifted powdered sugar</p>
<p>2 tablespoons milk</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p>1 cup whipping cream</p>
<p>2 tablespoons sifted powdered sugar</p>
<p>Chill a medium mixing bowl and beaters (I actually use my immersion blender).</p>
<p>For filling, beat cream cheese and peanut butter until smooth. Add the 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla; beat until combined.</p>
<p>In the chilled mixing bowl beat whipping cream and the 2 tablespoons powdered sugar until soft peaks form (this happens pretty quickly).</p>
<p>Gently fold about 1/3 of the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture. Fold remaining whipped cream into peanut butter mixture. Spoon into graham cracker crust.</p>
<p>Cover and chill about two hours or until set.</p>
<p>For a wonderful chocolate topping:</p>
<p>Melt ¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and a little milk (1 to 2 Tablespoons).  Spread over the top of the chilled pie and sprinkle with lightly salted, chopped peanuts.  Let chill until set.</p>
<p>Eat until you&#8217;re sick, or invite your friends!  They will love you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_4127.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_4127.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_4127" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1193" /></a></p>
<p>At the start of the year I made a quiet resolution to myself to get out for a camp at least once a month, January came and went and February was in danger of going the same way unless I got my finger out. I had been planning on going up Glen Lyon for a high camp, but the wind has been quite bad the past couple of weekends so I opted to stay low and return to Glen Feshie where I hadn&#8217;t been since November 2008. I&#8217;d had a miserable night sleep last time, but this time I was feeling better prepared. Unsure of the conditions on the ground, I&#8217;d chucked crampons and snowshoes in the car more in hope than expectation. As it turns out the snow is only on the tops at the moment, I&#8217;m still hoping for one more blizzard before Spring arrives.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/untitled-1.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/untitled-1.jpg?w=700&#038;h=393" alt="" title="Untitled-1" width="700" height="393" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1194" /></a><br />
<em>The route. Short at 5.1 miles, but it feels as remote as anywhere.</em></p>
<p>The drive up the A9 was fairly hassle free, traffic was light, so cruise control was on and I just had to remain awake in order to dodge the abundance of potholes littering the carriageway. Arriving at the car park at Auchlean I watched as two mountain bikers tried to ride about 200m into the wind, before returning to their car and packing up again. The wind was ferocious and once I set off was having difficulty walking into it, I could feel my mat, strapped to the top of the pack, acting like a sail and threatening to tip me backwards. I pressed on, hoping it would be more sheltered amongst the trees in the glen. The summits must&#8217;ve been horrendous.</p>

<em>A short video of some of the photos from this trip.</em></p>
<p>The short moor section leading into the glen was a quagmire. I was glad to be wearing my gaiters. Once through the deer fence, the pine smell, better than any Magic Tree, remained with me until I exited the enclosure the following day. Fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3802.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3802.jpg?w=700&#038;h=393" alt="" title="_MG_3802" width="700" height="393" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1196" /></a><br />
<em>The remains of the bridge at Carnachuin.</em></p>
<p>Last time I was in Glen Feshie, I&#8217;d crossed onto the west of the river by the bridge at Carnachuin, the river had been higher then, and the bridge had been a bit of a death trap for a long time before the river washed it away in September 2009, crossing wasn&#8217;t a particularly pleasant experience. I knew the bridge was no more, but made a small detour as I wanted to check out the remains. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3820.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3820.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3820" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1197" /></a><br />
<em>River Feshie and Slochd Beag at the head of the Glen.</em></p>
<p>The wind was bitter at times, but my new <a href="http://www.chocolatefishmerino.co.uk/">Chocolate Fish</a> Merino-Possum beanie stopped it dead. My new favourite bit of kit. After I&#8217;d ordered it, I tweeted that I hoped it would fit my gargantuan napper, Amanda at Chocolate Fish had seen this and offered to keep one of their last remaining double layer beanies back in case I needed it [they're more stretchy than the single layer beanie]. I didn&#8217;t, but with service like that, I&#8217;ll be definitely be shopping at Chocolate Fish again. The hat is super toasty too, I have a couple of Extremities hats, one windproof, one not. Neither come close to being as good at the Merino-Possum beanie. Buy one!</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3835.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3835.jpg" alt="" title="_MG_3835" height="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1198" /></a><br />
<em>Bonsai in the Upper Glen.</em></p>
<p>Walking through the glen, particularly in low cloud, biting wind and intermittent rain, it seems incredibly bleak. The grey blanket cloud was quite oppressive and it was quite dark even in early afternoon. Dead or weirdly misshapen trees litter both the river and surrounding hillsides, the wood has become grey and lifeless. The colour palette of the glen is almost monochrome, with a subdued hint of green, yellows and browns. However, that&#8217;s only half the story. The glen is teeming with new growth. The forest is regenerating itself and there are massive amounts of young trees throughout. I was surprised to see lots of small birds in amongst this new growth, blue tits were flitting about from sapling to sapling, I don&#8217;t recall ever having seen blue tits out in the wild before, maybe I just haven&#8217;t been looking hard enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3890.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3890.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3890" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1201" /></a><br />
<em>Pines below Creag na Caillich.</em></p>
<p>I stopped in at the bothy at Ruigh-aiteachain for some lunch, there was a couple and child in having lunch also, all dressed in Berghaus and those technicolour vomit fleeces that nobody makes any more. We exchanged pleasantries, but they seemed distracted and didn&#8217;t seem particularly interested in conversation. If they were enjoying themselves, they weren&#8217;t showing it. I pressed on down the glen, following it south-east as it narrows becomes more steep-sided. Part of the path has been obliterated by a landslip. I&#8217;m not sure how long it&#8217;s been like that, but a huge chunk of hillside is missing. It&#8217;s pretty loose, but easily passable.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3978.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3978.jpg" alt="" title="_MG_3978" height="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1207" /></a><br />
<em>What&#8217;s left of the path following a landslip.</em></p>
<p>The glen becomes more alpine further down, the pines clinging on to the steep scree slopes. The rock walls become almost vertical in places. I carried on looking for a camp site, the wind still howling through the branches. I passed a few suitable areas, but carried on for a bit until I found a stream running down from Lochan nam Bo. I filled my Platypus and returned to one of the spots I&#8217;d previously passed. I disturbed a large raptor from it&#8217;s perch, but I only caught a glimpse as it swooped down and out of sight. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m always wary about pitching under trees, particularly when it was so windy and I&#8217;d passed so many twisted branches lying on the ground throughout the glen. But this tree seemed to be sheltered, with dense lower branches giving further protection from the wind and rain. It seemed sturdy enough. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3940.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3940.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3940" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1202" /></a><br />
<em>Primus Spider Express.</em></p>
<p>In addition to my new beanie, I also had a new stove, new headtorch and new mat to test. There&#8217;s been plenty written about the Spider Express [198g], it seems everyone has bought one this winter. It was a marked improvement on my MSR Pocket Rocket, even above zero, I think it was around 3C. Inverting the canister sped up boil times considerably. When I was out with my Pocket Rocket in November it took about 15 minutes to boil, it was subzero back then though. But it&#8217;s reassuring to have confidence in your stove in winter.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3953.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3953.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3953" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1203" /></a><br />
<em>Darkness Falls.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d bought a Petzl Tikka XP2 [88g] to replace my Alpkit Gamma, which had died. It&#8217;s very bright in high power mode, but I used it most with the diffuser on, in low power mode. There&#8217;s not much else to say, it&#8217;s fairly comfy to wear, even when lying down. I may buy the rechargeable core battery at some point. I settled down to listen to some music, my new Z-lite [379g] a marked improvement on the CCF pad it replaced. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s any warmer, but it&#8217;s definitely more comfortable. Having cut off four sections to act as a back pad for my ULA CDT, I was pleased to realise the egg box shape allows the two pad sections to interlock, ensuring it stays together throughout the night, unlike my old pad, which inevitably ended up kicked out from beneath me, with me freezing on the floor of the tent.</p>
<p>I eventually switched off the iPod to listen to the wind tearing through the trees and seeming to circle between the two opposing faces of rock high above. Still, the Akto itself barely moved, with only the odd draught coming in under the fly. I&#8217;d decided to keep the inner half open in order to increase airflow and stave off any condensation. It worked well, in the morning, there was only a damp patch on my sleeping bag from my breath, the inner was still dry. I woke to pee during the night and saw light snow falling, there was only a light dusting at ground level in the morning, but the crags above looked heavily frosted. Conditions remained windy, with low cloud cloaking the summits.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3961.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3961.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3961" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205" /></a><br />
<em>Creag na Gaibhre, above the tent.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3956.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3956.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" title="_MG_3956" width="700" height="466" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1206" /></a><br />
<em>Looking out from the campsite to Creag na Caillich.</em></p>
<p>I was needing more water in the morning so headed over to the river as I wanted to gaze up at Creag na Caillich. There are a couple of tiny trees up top, clinging on in what must be poor soil, I reckon their days are numbered. Back at the tent, I breakfasted on hot chocolate and raspberry Oat-so-Simple, which cheered me up no end. I got packed up, and considered that I don&#8217;t really see any gaps in my outdoor kit these days, there&#8217;s nothing I need. I could purchase lighter gear or replace a few items, but I can make do with what I&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;m awaiting one final piece to the puzzle, a POE Elite AC, which should hopefully allow me to get rid of my Alpkit self inflating mat, or more accurately self-<em>deflating</em> mat, which is massively bulky and takes up tons of room in the pack.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3993.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mg_3993.jpg?w=700&#038;h=560" alt="" title="_MG_3993" width="700" height="560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1209" /></a><br />
<em>Lone pine near Ruigh-aiteachain.</em></p>
<p>Back on the trail, retracing my steps back to the car, I was in a good mood. The wind was at my back and I was back at the bothy in no time. I stopped to take a few photos, four horses came wandering down the path straight up to me. A pat on the nose and they were off again, galloping away and seemingly enjoying themselves. </p>

<p>The overcast and somewhat dark conditions that had been prevalent started to lift. A break in the cloud gave way to blue sky, I met some brave souls coming the other way, judging by their ice axes they were heading up, rather them than me. Next time, I&#8217;d love to venture further down glen, maybe for an extended trip. Back at the car, a quick change into dry clothes and I was off, thinking about lunch at the Loch Insh Restaurant. </p>

<em>The path through the forest at Coille an Torr.</em></p>
<p>It was good to be in the warmth, the food was good, the music less so. Some awful celtic/drum and bass fusion, presumably made by someone who doesn&#8217;t actually like music. So bland and devoid of character, as if constructed from Bontempi presets. Still, there was fine view to round off the trip with.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1820" href="http://lifeintheboomerlane.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/taxes-and-othe-communicable-diseases/villain/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1820" title="villain" src="http://lifeintheboomerlane.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/villain.jpg?w=500&#038;h=387" alt="" width="500" height="387" /></a> &#8221;She didn&#8217;t make her quarterlies on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year, I sailed breezily through tax preparation time.  No fretting, no anguish.  This is because I was entirely too busy making cute cuff bracelets to focus on doing any prep work in anticipation of visiting the tax preparer.  When, on Tuesday, I finally removed the glue that had been keeping my eyes sealed shut for several months, I was able to look at my Daytimer. I noted that my appointment with the tax preparer was scheduled for the following morning.  I immediately became hysterical.  After that, I went to the filing cabinet and pulled out all of my tax stuff.  The first thing I saw was that I had neglected to make my second and third quarterly payments. I became even more hysterical.  I tried to remember what I had been doing for the last six months that was more important than making quarterly payments.  The answer was that I was spending the money that should have gone toward the quarterly payments.</p>
<p> I’m a Realtor.  This means that for tax purposes, I’m what’s referred to as an Independent Contractor.  An Independent Contractor is neither self-employed nor employed by a company.  This puts me in the same category as military mercenaries and court jesters.  And it means, unlike a real employed person, I can’t get group health insurance.  It also means that, unlike a real self-employed person, I can’t deduct expenses for my home office, which is my place of business. And, because I’m the only one here, if I declare an annual Secret Santa Christmas gift exchange, I will most likely know who my Secret Santa is. I am stuck right in the middle of being employed and being self-employed.</p>
<p> It does mean that I must make quarterly payments, based on a wildly fluctuating income ranging from something to nothing.  The percentage of the payments is based on income from the year before which may have nothing to do with my current year’s income.  If I calculate incorrectly, I’m screwed.  If I make no quarterly payments, I’m especially screwed.  This is the year of Being Especially Screwed.</p>
<p> I called my tax accountant.  Her name is Janet.  Each year, Janet is accustomed to getting hysterical calls from me.  They include: </p>
<p>“Janet!  I can’t find my 1099!  I swear it was right here!  I didn’t move it!  I was just eating my lunch, and now it’s gone! Oh, wait.  I see it.  Under the piece of cheese. Never mind.”</p>
<p>                                                                             ***</p>
<p>“Janet!  I can’t do this!  Every time I get everything together, some stupid new piece of paper comes in the mail!  This is ridiculous! How can I keep my appointment with you if people keep sending me stuff with big words on the envelopes that say “IMPORTANT TAX DOCUMENT INSIDE?! How many IMPORTANT TAX DOCUMENTS can one very short, post-menopausal woman handle?!”</p>
<p>                                                                             ***</p>
<p>“Godammit!  I lost the f-ing phone number for that idiot woman I was supposed to call today about that stupid workshop thing!  Hello?  Hello? Who am I talking to?  Janet?  Huh?  Wha&#8211;? Oh, sorry, I thought I was calling my friend Joyce. Never mind.”</p>
<p>                                                                             ***</p>
<p>This year it was: “Janet!  I forgot to pay my quarterlies!  Can I send a check to the IRS now?  Like today?   I can be at the post office in 10 minutes!  If I drive really fast, I can make it in five minutes!  And what’s going to happen to me!?  How much of a penalty will this cost me!? I have no money!”  Janet’s answer was “Just calm down.  Don’t send a check.  It’s too late, anyway.  We’ll deal with it when you get here. Everything will be fine.”  Janet is good. She talked me down. </p>
<p>I should explain here, that I don’t normally go off the deep end about things (Note to my daughter: If you are reading this, DO NOT submit a snide comment).  It’s just that I have a long and tragic history with the IRS.  It’s even worse than my long and tragic history with Chemistry 101 and Technical Support Teams.  Plus, the IRS has been given the Right by God to keep my money unlawfully and then, when they finally see the error of their ways, to return it without so much as a limp “Oh, sorry.” So I’m not real optimistic about this. </p>
<p> I kept my appointment with Janet.  She now has every shred of my 2010 financial life and like each year, will somehow manage to make sense out of it all, even though I can’t.  Then, she will tell me if the IRS will levy a fine on me that I can’t pay and then come up with some other awful and totally legal ways to ruin my life.  At least they can’t send me to prison.  I think.  At 5’1”, horizontal stripes wouldn’t be the best fashion choice for me.</p>
<p> Those of you praying types out there, pray for me.  The rest, just send cash.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vulpeslibris.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/breakfast-by-call-it-crazy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14839" style="margin:5px;" title="Breakfast by Call It Crazy" src="http://vulpeslibris.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/breakfast-by-call-it-crazy.jpg?w=260&#038;h=194" alt="" width="260" height="194" /></a></p>
<p><em>Today we&#8217;re joined by guest writer Chris Harding, with this lovely piece about her family and their crucial influence on her lifelong relationship with books.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">~~~:o:~~~</p>
<p>I come from a bookish family.  My maternal grandmother ran away from her Norwegian home and arrived in England in 1915, accompanied only by a trunk full of books.  It must be a hereditary trait because I never travel without a book – and nor do my mother, my daughters or my brother and his family.  Other people pack clothes and suncream for their holidays: we pack books. And while on vacation we don’t buy souvenirs: we buy books.</p>
<p>I have been known to go away and buy so many books that I have jettisoned clothes to make room in my luggage on the homeward journey, while my younger daughter spent three years trekking backwards and forwards to university with cases laden with books (not just for her course, she would return one set of novels, and gather up others) &#8211; but never remembered a toothbrush, night attire or other essentials.</p>
<p>When I was young my parents read children&#8217;s books, fairytales and nursery rhymes to my brother and I, but in addition my mother used to cradle me in her arms and recite aloud from whatever she happened to be reading at the time, while my father paraphrased the histories of his socialist heroes.  Alongside the tales of Winnie the Pooh, Ratty, Mole and Jo March, we listened to Dickens, Jane Austen and Wordsworth, and heard stories about Marx, Robert Owen, the Diggers and the Tolpuddle Martyrs.</p>
<p>As we grew older we read anything and everything: stories, poems, myths, legends, books on history, geography and science, encyclopedias that were old when our father was young, newspapers, magazines, bus and train timetables, and even the backs of cereal packets and labels on sauce bottles.  We read everywhere and anywhere: walking to school, in lessons (I used to wedge a book beneath the lid of my desk), in the bath and in bed (by torchlight, under the covers when we were supposed to be asleep).  And we all read at mealtimes, elbows on the table, a book propped in front of each plate, each of us lost in another world as we munched our food. When we did speak it was only to discuss our reading matter. Since my mother, normally a stickler for polite behaviour, saw nothing wrong with this – indeed, she still reads at the table whenever she can &#8211; I was shocked when I discovered that in other households this practice was regarded as neither normal, nor polite.</p>
<p>I suspect my friends’ parents would have been even more taken aback at the sight of my mother reading while she ironed – an admirable skill which, sadly, I have been unable to acquire successfully. I have tried, but my efforts only result in burnt offerings, with disastrous consequences to book, garment and myself.</p>
<p>Our parents, keen readers themselves, with wide ranging tastes and an eclectic collection on their shelves, never set any boundaries when it came to reading, or chastised us for reading in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. They never once told us a book was too old, too young, too difficult or in any way unsuitable.  The only exception to this ‘no rules’ rule was comics, which they didn’t regard as proper books and therefore refused to buy, so we used to sneak a peek at them at them in the local newsagent’s shop, or at the homes of friends.</p>
<p>But it is thanks to their encouragement that I found the confidence to read what I wanted when I wanted, rather than doing so because it was on a school syllabus, or was popular, or because someone told me to.  They also gave me the courage to form my own opinions about books.  I didn’t have to like a volume because it was a classic, or dismiss it because it wasn’t  &#8211;  but I learned to express my thoughts and state why I felt the way I did about a particular book.</p>
<p>The lessons learned from this have stood  me in good stead over the years, not just when it comes to reading, but for life in general, and my career as a journalist in particular.  It’s taught me never to take things at face value, never be to be scared of asking questions, and never to be worried if my opinions are not those of the majority.</p>
<p>Most of all it’s shown me that there is always more than view on anything, and that rational argument and discussion can lead to understanding , even though both sides may still agree to differ.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://anirishmanabroad.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/conk.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" title="conk" src="http://anirishmanabroad.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/conk.jpg?w=400&#038;h=520" alt="" width="400" height="520" /></a></p>
<p>I have recently been watching box sets of <em>Mad Men</em> &#8211; a TV series set in the early 1960s in an advertising office on Madison Avenue, New York. It&#8217;s beautifully stylish and the drama&#8217;s not bad either, but most of all, it has begun to make me appreciate advertisements a lot more.</p>
<p>The advertising company Doyle Dale Bernbach were the ones responsible for Volkswagen&#8217;s iconic campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s. William Bernbach had realised something very important early on in his career: advertising did not sell a product. The purpose of his VW ad campaigns was not to attract the customers who had already decided they were uninterested in buying Volkswagen, but to turn the existing clients into brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>The fact that in 1960, the German motor company&#8217;s budget for advertising was a mere $800,000 meant that DDB&#8217;s creative director Helmut Krone was required to pioneer the idea of simplicity in print media advertising &#8211; going very much against the grain of advertising at the time.  His repeated use of photographs as opposed to the embellished illustrations used traditionally by competing agencies, spawned comfortably-consistent, yet unique, print ads that met DDB&#8217;s goal of making a stark departure from existing advertisement techniques.</p>
<p>It soon transpired that Volkswagen advertisements had higher readership scores than the editorials in many publications.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A distinguishing characteristic of entrepreneurs is the sheer number of great business ideas they tend to concoct.</p>
<p>A few minutes in the shower or a half-hour at the airport reading a business magazine can result in a torrent of ideas for new products, fixing production blockages, expanding distribution, and wearing down that procrastinating purchaser in Pickering.<br />
<span id="more-33627"></span><br />
The trouble is, an entrepreneur’s support system can rarely cope with many ideas at once. And frankly, many of these notions need to be better thought through before they’re worth investigating.</p>
<p>To be effective as an entrepreneur, you have to get better at editing your idea stream. The more rigorously you refine your ideas before throwing them at other people to examine or execute, the more likely those ideas are to take root and flourish.</p>
<p>Marla Tabaka is a Chicago-area business coach and consultant who specializes in helping entrepreneurs grow their revenues beyond the million-dollar level. In a recent online article for Inc. magazine, she offered five tactics for turning your idea flow into actionable opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Examine and Expand:</strong> When your ideas are a-borning, ask yourself “what if” questions. “What if this idea was in place right now, what would be different because of it?” “What if I could see this idea as something bigger than it is right now, how would it look?”</p>
<p><strong>Compare your idea to your vision and mission statements:</strong> Does it fit with your long-term goals? Does it fix problems or just confuse the picture? Avoid letting new ideas make you lose track of longer-term objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Apply SWOT analysis:</strong> Draw a quadrant on a piece of paper to assess your idea based on your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. List all the factors you can think of in each area. Ask yourself questions such as “Can this weakness be minimized or eliminated?” and “How can we convert this threat into an opportunity?”</p>
<p><strong>Analyze the latest trends:</strong> If you are looking at a new product or service, does it meet your clients’ needs in new, creative ways? Will it stand out or get lost in the chaos? Explore your idea to see how you can make it different and/or better from the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorm with friends and peers:</strong> Ask friends, business colleagues and other creative and strategic people to work with you assessing new ideas. Welcome feedback. Make it fun.</p>
<p>Naked ideas perish fast. The more you can nurture and develop your ideas, the greater chance you’ll see them grow to fruition.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://francopolis.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/beav20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-291 alignleft" title="Beav20" src="http://francopolis.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/beav20.jpg?w=145&#038;h=125" alt="" width="145" height="125" /></a></p>
<p><em><a href="http://francopolis.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/facebook_accept_reject_v1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-292 alignleft" title="facebook_accept_reject_v1" src="http://francopolis.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/facebook_accept_reject_v1.jpg?w=254&#038;h=250" alt="" width="254" height="250" /></a>When I received a friend request from my dad, I was, frankly, weirded out.  But the inherent distance of online communication somehow allowed us to express affection in ways that are too awkward in person.</em></p>
<p>My dad and I are Facebook friends.  That sounds like a completely ridiculous thing to say.  I mean, we’re friends in the real world, so why wouldn’t we be Facebook friends?  But that’s not the reason it sounds ridiculous.  No, it sounds ridiculous because I see my dad practically every single day of my life, but I’m closer to the virtual him than the actual him.  Strange, right?  How is that even possible?</p>
<p>My father, you see, comes from a generation of men &#8212; perhaps the last &#8212; for whom expressing affection towards their children can be awkward, particularly children of the same sex.  This, I&#8217;m sure, has something to do with evolving gender roles and what it means to &#8220;be a man&#8221;.  For my dad&#8217;s generation &#8212; the early baby boomers &#8212; being a man meant providing a family with essentials, not emoting all over the place.  Men were to be sturdy and stoic, not soft and sensitive.</p>
<p>I also get the impression that my dad wasn’t too close with his parents.  His mother seemed distant; his father eccentric – neither the personification of affection.  When I think back to my father’s interactions with his parents before they passed, words like “cordial” and “businesslike” come to mind.  He was kind to them because he’s a kind person, but I never got the impression that he was maintaining fulfilling relationships.  In light of that, I’m surprised he even knew how to express affection to my brother and me.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean my dad never showed his love for us when we were growing up.  I can recall countless acts he performed to express his affection.  When he would take a day off from work, for example, he would spend it ironing our clothes and cooking dinner.  My brother and I didn&#8217;t even care if our clothes were ironed, but I knew that was my dad&#8217;s way of saying that he loved us.  Who, after all, takes off from work to iron Nike t-shirts and prepare roast chicken in garlic gravy?</p>
<p>But I could probably count the number of times my father has told me he loves me on my twenty digits, and that&#8217;s simply no big deal to me.  I&#8217;ve never once thought that he doesn&#8217;t; I&#8217;ve just always known that some things are easy to feel but harder to say.  There have been many times, in fact, when I have wanted to tell my dad I love him but have felt that it would be too awkward to do so.  Guys can be funny that way.</p>
<p>So when I received a Facebook friend request from my dad, I was, frankly, weirded out.  I&#8217;ve been accustomed to keeping my dad close, but not too close.  Sunday night dinner?  Sure.  Friday night pub crawl?  No thanks.  In accepting his request, I would give my dad insight into my entire life: my interactions with friends, my comings and goings, my random thoughts, my likes, my dislikes, what I &#8220;like&#8221; and &#8220;unlike&#8221;, the random compliments I give my girlfriend (who, ironically, doesn&#8217;t even have a Facebook account)&#8230; This simple request felt more like an invasion.</p>
<p>And yet, I knew I had no option but to “friend” my dad.  What conceivable excuse could I have to not?  Before I clicked on “Accept”, though, I took the time to review my past posts and photos to “clean up” my profile.  I even thought about starting a whole new profile for friends and keeping the one I had for people like my dad and my boss – people for whom I reserve the persona that, otherwise, only gets used when I attend Mass every few years.</p>
<p>In the end, though, I decided to let my dad simply be like any other Facebook friend because, well, he’s my dad.  At first, however, I wasn’t sure how to virtually interact with him.  I was even scared to look at his profile.  Would he post creepy photos of him and my mom drinking martinis and standing too close to one another at creepy parties for creepy people of their age?  Would he have bizarre, unacceptable interests, like scrapbooking or watching <em>American Idol? </em>Would he be socially awkward, posting head-scratching comments on others’ posts?</p>
<p>All the worrying was for naught.  My dad, turns out, is completely normal.  What’s more, accepting his friend request allowed the two of us to communicate more than we ever have before.  While I have always talked to my mother on a daily basis, neither my dad nor myself have ever felt comfortable just picking up the phone and diving into conversation.  Again, the generational divides.</p>
<p>But on my Facebook page, my dad was suddenly showing interest in my life: complimenting me on accomplishments, posting comments on my posts, taking notice of the things that are my life.  Somehow, the inherent distance of online communication allowed him to express affection in ways that are too awkward in person, and that has given us things to talk about in our face-to-face interactions.</p>
<p>One day, for example, he commented about my blog, not realizing that I spend many evenings in front of the computer.  “I like your blog,” he said.  “I didn’t know you blogged.  Is there a way for me to add it to my favorites?  I really like your articles.”  And just yesterday he complimented me about a piece I wrote for an online magazine, telling me I did a good job.  No matter how old you are, hearing your father express interest in your interests is flattering, nice.  And if he weren’t my “friend”, he might never know of my writing pursuits.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned a lot about my dad because of our newfound “friendship”.  Through his Facebook page, for example, he has revealed an astute humor I never knew he possessed.  One night, my girlfriend and I couldn&#8217;t keep from cracking up at his profile picture: a shot of him sitting on a toilet in the middle of a driveway, scarf wrapped around his neck and stocking cap on his head, posed like Rodin&#8217;s &#8220;The Thinker&#8221;.  Why was a toilet in the middle of a driveway?  What was my dad doing sitting on it on an obviously cold day?  Most of all, why would my dad make this his profile picture, his way of greeting the online world?  It was genius, that&#8217;s why, and it turns out my dad has a genius wit.</p>
<p>The best part of having my dad as a Facebook friend, though, is that it keeps the family in constant contact with one another.  If I post a picture of my son that’s particularly funny or charming, my parents will comment on it or call to get the full story.  If I comment about an exciting happening during my day, my parents will ask me about it when I talk to them later in the day.  These moments – relatively small but meaningful nonetheless – would go by without being shared if not for Facebook.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t necessarily buy into the notion that the Internet has made the world smaller in every single circumstance, bringing everyone closer together in every conceivable way.  In many ways, it has done just the opposite, giving people the means to seclude themselves in their virtual lives rather than participating in their actual lives &#8212; as well as draw rigid ideological lines that purposely exclude large portions of the world.</p>
<p>But for all the ridiculous, overblown assertions that the Internet can erase divisions and bring people together, sometimes it actually does.  Some people, for instance, join couch surfing groups and travel around the world, staying with complete strangers with a shared love of travel.  Others join online communities and talk to people from foreign countries, learning about cultures that, without the Internet, they’d never have the chance to experience.</p>
<p>And then there’s me: I accepted my dad’s friend request and found out that in addition to being a great dad, he’s also pretty damn cool.  Maybe that Friday night pub crawl is in our future yet.  Perhaps a virtual beer first&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First- thanks to all of you for checking in to see how the Clampitts are faring in the face of this Earthquake. I&#8217;m certainly not CNN, however, here&#8217;s the situation from Shibuya-ku. Spouse is in Osaka- he&#8217;s usually gone for major snowstorms, earthquakes, pet emergencies, etc. The kids experienced this first earthquake at school and are currently en route home- a journey that has been underway for the last 4.5 hours as the highways are currently jammed.</p>
<p>For us, it started about 2:30 in the afternoon. I was at the grocery store perusing the narrow aisles, gazing absent-mindedly at syrup,&#8221; Breakfast for dinner?&#8221; when the boxes started to fall on me as if that was a such a good idea they just jumped on down of their own accord. I hurdled the next three Japanese women in my race to be the first out of the store. I heard the wine crashing to the ground on my way out. I stopped in the middle of the street as all the other people flooded out of the buildings. A man and I looked each other in the eyes as he stood holding on to a swaying telephone pole. Where were my kids? The pole covered a distance of 5 to 6 feet, back and forth. I looked up to see if it would hit me when it fell. The street was narrow- where was I safest? Under one of the building overhangs or lying buried in its rubble? I decided to run for the intersection where there was more space. The Japanese, used to earthquakes, were now starting to panic as the intensity of the earthquake grew. They began to hold each other. Some were starting to cry. The ground was swaying enough to when I moved I lost my footing. Or was it because I was still holding a death grip on my shopping cart? Good thing I brought that along- could I crawl under it? Where were my kids? It lasted forever. Plants started to fall off balconies, cars started moving, bikes fell, the vending machines were toppling over. People were frozen. All was silent except for the sounds of the buildings shaking. Creaking. Squeaking. We all stood rooted to our spot, unmoving, except for our eyes, darting quickly to each building, wondering which one was going to fall on us, all the time evaluating if we would see it in time to run. Was this our time? Where in the HELL was my family?</p>
<p>It stopped. The collection looked at each other.  We were alive and the buildings around us were standing. I walked back to the grocery store. The young grocery clerk was crying. I put my arm around her. I talked to her in English. A Japanese woman came over and took her from me. I wished she were my daughter. Broken bottles lay smashed all over the floor. A woman scrubbed tomato sauce with her hands.</p>
<p>My phone didn&#8217;t work. I tried to text. That didn&#8217;t work. It was quiet. No one was talking. Hundreds of people were lining a tiny street but no one said a word. The subways were closing. People poured out of the hole where the subway belonged.</p>
<p>An aftershock. People grabbed each other. I walked home. I didn&#8217;t know what was happening. I couldn&#8217;t understand the announcements- but- the buildings were standing. No fires. No panic. No blood. In the Ouiser hierarchy of panic situations, I chalked this all up as positive.</p>
<p>Upon entering my building, I noticed the water feature now had waves. Another aftershock.</p>
<p><a href="http://amblerangel.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2891.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2726" title="IMG_2891" src="http://amblerangel.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2891.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>I came in our door. The first signs of damage.</p>
<p><a href="http://amblerangel.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/20110311-074708.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2724" title="20110311-074708.jpg" src="http://amblerangel.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/20110311-074708.jpg?w=480&#038;h=643" alt="" width="480" height="643" /></a></p>
<p>I filled the bath tub with water in case we needed it later.</p>
<p>I opened the windows so they wouldn&#8217;t get jammed shut.</p>
<p>The kids texted me that they were on the bus. I started to feel better. Spouse checked in.</p>
<p>Now my emergency preparedness classes finally kicked in:</p>
<p>Fill the bathtub, get out the backpack with the flares, the first aid, the compass, the map, the money, the blankets, the stitch kit, the food, the gun, (just kidding, there&#8217;s no gun), cut off the gas and the electricity, make sure there&#8217;s enough food for a week, keep passports on us at all times, good thing I registered with the State Department. I actually got the email entitled, &#8220;Earthquake and Tsunami Warning from US Embassy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The computer worked. I Skyped the Nose- 2:00 AM her time- &#8220;When you wake up- you&#8217;ll see we&#8217;ve had a 8.9 earthquake- we&#8217;re all ok. Don&#8217;t worry&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ok- thanks for calling- good night&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later- the news sunk in, I got an email from her thanking me for saving her from the morning panic she would have endured trying to track us down.</p>
<p>Currently public transportation is shut down. For some reason, unless there is an alien invasion, the airports remain open. Sensei is sitting in my living room because she can&#8217;t get home. Hopefully I can talk her into spending the night because the alternative is a 4 hour walk home. She&#8217;s so polite I might have to lock her in order to make her stay.</p>
<p>Tsunamis now are wreaking havoc. The after shocks continue one after the other. Tonight I&#8217;ll feel better when the kids walk through the door. I&#8217;ll pray for those not as lucky. And give thanks for those who cared to do the same for us.</p>
