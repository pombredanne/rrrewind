				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Something went wrong.&#8221; She said. &#8220;We were supposed to be the cool kids with guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made that unconscious gesture that only people who wore glasses knew &#8212; finger darting up the bridge of the nose, a smooth quick massage of the bone. The other hand followed to steady the frames, to steady the world. Only his glasses were broken.  They were currently stomped on, and quite possibly in some zombie&#8217;s mouth. He hoped that the glass would get between their teeth, then realized his glasses were plastic and felt even more depressed than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right?&#8221; She said, and somehow she was lying down and she didn&#8217;t know why. Her shirt had ridden up, exposing the thin white flab of belly she still had. &#8220;We were the ones who read it all, right? I mean, we should kick ass.&#8221; The sudden fast climb up the vertical building had left him breathless too. He lay down next to her, but the cement did nothing to leach the heat from his body. They panted like dogs in the heat, on the hot cement, panted and panted and goddamn he hated this apocalypse. He didn&#8217;t have time to <em>train.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; He watched as one of the jocks slammed a shotgun onto the ledge. He hauled his body up with the grace of a thousand perfect rebounds and a million miles of running. He looked down at them and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, <em>nerds. </em>Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other jock &#8212; this one a girl with track team muscles and volleyball height &#8212; leapt up, nimbly avoiding the moaning masses of the dead.</p>
<p>They stumbled up (heavens knew he never knew one could stumble up). Jock Girl made a motion to give him  a weapon but Jock Boy said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t. Useless nerds can&#8217;t even carry a shotgun.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the stories, nobody ever wrote about how heavy a freaking gun <em>was. </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Fucking nerds.&#8221;</p>

(AP Photo/Pool-Win McNamee)</p></div>
<p>A half century ago, the idea of televising a debate between two Presidential candidates was breakthrough thinking. Beginning in 2016, I think we can use our new and emerging media to do a better job, and, presumably, to choose our new leader with greater insight, wisdom, and knowledge.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with some pre-reading materials. During the primary process, each candidate for president should be required to complete and submit a job application. The application should require work history, evidence of compliance with laws (for example, age and place of birth), and so on. Prior to each party&#8217;s national convention, each candidate should be required to clearly present his or her platform, in detail, by category, complete with data and factual references (given the dynamic nature of our economy and such, each candidate may revise this document at pre-appointed intervals). Then, each candidate should be required to present the platform by speaking directly to the American public, on television, without interruption. If we&#8217;re clever, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with a web-based extension of the written and televised presentation. With this mechanism in place, I can easily research where each candidate stands on, say, Syria, or health care. Of course, the people ought to have some digital means of asking questions, and the candidates should provide some reasonable means of answering their questions.</p>
<p>Next up, let&#8217;s change our <a href="http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/new_rules_on_political_ads_how.php?page=all">rules regarding the use of television advertising</a>. Whether by law or by policy, candidates should be required to use their commercial airtime to explain their own views, and not to criticize or attack the other candidate (this higher standard should be applied to all elections, at least on television commercials where stations often set policies with regard to acceptable material).</p>
<p>With all of that in place, let&#8217;s rethink the debate. Running a grudge match is a waste of everybody&#8217;s time, and so is allowing candidates to drift from the questions to their own message points. Candidates are welcome to speechify, but that&#8217;s not the purpose of the debates. Instead, I would either eliminate the debates and replace them with one-on-one conversations with everyday people and vetted journalists, or reformat them entirely. Last night&#8217;s Bob Schieffer format stopped the candidates from moving around and nearly slugging one another. That&#8217;s a start. A quiet, reasoned conversation; mostly, closeups of each candidate so we can study their faces; a journalist who asks the questions and is not overwhelmed by the power of candidates to disobey the rules&#8211;this format provides a better opportunity to study the candidates and their presentations. And let&#8217;s not call it a debate, or think of it as debate, because we should discourage the unseemly role modeling by potential leaders of the free world. There should be no winner or loser. Instead, the debate ought to be a skillfully moderated conversation by people, each of who believes that he or she can successfully lead the nation and play a very significant role on the world stage. That&#8217;s enough for me.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a piece missing: <a href="http://www.factcheck.org">verification of facts</a>. I&#8217;m not very interested in what the network&#8217;s commentators have to say about who &#8220;won&#8221; because the debate should not be reduced to such simple-minded thinking. Instead, immediately following the debate, I&#8217;d like to see an intelligent, compelling presentation of what each candidate said, and whether it was factually correct, kinda hazy, or utter nonsense. If the candidates understood that they would be immediately followed by an independent fact-check seen on TV, they would be more likely to curb their fanciful interpretations of fact.</p>
<p>Do we need to see two presidential candidates &#8220;go at it&#8221; as if they were wrestlers? I think we can do a lot better, and I know we possess the tools and the need to approach the whole intersection between presidential candidates and media. But do we possess the will to shift the entire election process into the 21st century?</p>

<p>The surge of Social Media has led to an oft-joked-about side-effect. In addition to aggravating Nomophobia (the fear of being without one&#8217;s cellphone) and a general fear of being disconnected, Social Media has led to a rise in an unhealthy obsession with seeking validation. Sure, in theory, it&#8217;s great to have constructive feedback and it&#8217;s great to know your opinions matter, and that you do influence people around you. But aren&#8217;t we taking ourselves a little too seriously when we decide to keep measuring how much &#8220;influence&#8221; we have, just so our need for attention and self-importance is fulfilled? This is my primary pet peeve about Klout, and the narcissistic &#8216;Klout score&#8217; metric.</p>
<p>I do get the relevance of such a metric and the need to measure social media influence for Brands and people whose livelihood depends on promoting themselves on social media. And I have to admit, as a marketer, Klout did pique my curiosity and I set about exploring its in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s with a lot of gusto. But I was quite disappointed when I realized there wasn&#8217;t too much science (or logic!) behind the metric, and that Klout can&#8217;t really be classified as a legit Validation metric. It&#8217;s really only a <strong><span style="color:#99cc00;"><em>Vanity metric</em> </span></strong>and an inaccurate one at that.</p>
<p>Klout has always relied on hazy parameters to measure influence, and their definition of Influence is, well, debatable, to say the least. They have a profound-ish explanation of what they mean by Influence on the site, and this little graphic below they&#8217;ve featured there is supposed to cover what Influence entails.</p>
<div id="attachment_183" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/stats.png"><img class=" wp-image-183  " title="Klout &quot;Influence&quot; components" alt="" src="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/stats.png?w=300&#038;h=169" height="169" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Klout &#8220;Influence&#8221; components<br />(Image source: http://klout.com/#/corp/what_is_klout)</p></div>
<p>As is obvious, this implied scope is completely partial to Twitter as Followers, Retweets etc are relevant to only Twitter. Question is, what happens then, to the content we share on other social media platforms? Shouldn&#8217;t there ideally be a way to take into account influence and interactions across all social platforms (including Pinterest) accurately? Also, going back to the image alongside, how do &#8216;Lists&#8217; play a role in one&#8217;s Social Media Influence?? &#8216;Lists&#8217; are just a convenient way for Twitter users to sort their feed. If I have 1,000 Lists on Twitter, how does it indicate my social influence? If anything, it indicates a degree of OCD in me, but I fail to see how having more Lists makes <strong>me</strong> more influential. Am I missing something here? If anyone knows of an actual relevance of &#8216;Lists&#8217; to one&#8217;s Klout score, please feel free to leave a comment! (UPDATE: Vielen Dank to my fellow-blogger <a id="commentauthor-280" href="http://michelelegrand.wordpress.com/">ladyfromhamburg</a> for sharing some great information on this: The &#8216;Lists&#8217; component of Klout&#8217;s definition of Influence shows the number of Lists one is a part of on Twitter. That sure makes more sense, and puts my Lists-related confusion to rest! Now if only Klout would take some inspiration and start decoding all these parameters and more on their site. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>
<div id="attachment_187" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/klout-cartoon-419x236.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187" title="klout-cartoon-419x236" alt="" src="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/klout-cartoon-419x236.png?w=300&#038;h=168" height="168" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Image source: www.colleendilen.com)</p></div>
<p>What further blurs the already fuzzy scheme of things, is the relative weightages assigned to the parameters used to define &#8216;Influence&#8217;. Shouldn&#8217;t Klout be a little more transparent about this, especially since it claims to be the &#8220;Standard of Influence&#8221; that is supposedly meant to empower people who share content online? Does the Klout score include sharing and amplification of content only? Then what is the relative importance of those respectively? For instance, basis what I noticed on my own Klout dashboard &#8211; Retweets and Replies seem to have a higher weightage than Mentions. Let me attempt decoding what that effectively means: Only if what you&#8217;re saying is being passed on, do you have influence. Okay, this could be partly true &#8211; but what about the other part of it where you also need to be <strong>listened to</strong>, to consider yourself as having some influence? What about all the new followers/subscribers/visits you add with every new piece of content you share? And what about the followers/subscribers you have retained over a period of time? Those people have chosen to stay connected with you as they see some value in it, and find your content interesting. Shouldn&#8217;t that account for something?</p>
<div id="attachment_188" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/jclittle_the-devils-klout.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188" title="JCLittle_the-devils-klout" alt="" src="http://insightswise.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/jclittle_the-devils-klout.jpg?w=300&#038;h=180" height="180" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Image source: www.theanimatedwoman.com)</p></div>
<p>And what about all the metrics that tell you how many people actually click on the links you share to read your content? Shouldn&#8217;t those influence your Klout score as well? As an apparent disclaimer, Klout says in its FAQs: <em><strong><span style="color:#99cc00;">&#8220;The Klout score is a reflection of Influence, not activity.&#8221;</span></strong> </em>Err, this doesn&#8217;t help their case, does it?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all the anti-Klout sentiment aside &#8211; there are a couple of things about Klout that I do find pretty interesting. First, their <strong><span style="color:#99cc00;">Brand Squad</span></strong> feature. This basically helps brands identify their influencers and evangelists. This has SO much potential; and if they are able to throw in Sentiment Analysis and Blog-searching capabilities in here, this could potentially be a great one-stop shop social media measurement tool for Brands &#8211; one that Klout can actually hope to make some revenues off of.</p>
<p>The second feature that shows promise is &#8211; the <strong><span style="color:#99cc00;">Perks</span></strong> tool. Of course, in its current form and with its current targeting algorithm (or maybe the lack thereof), it&#8217;s fairly useless. But think about the tremendous potential Klout&#8217;s &#8216;Perks&#8217; has: It could serve as Klouts&#8217;s very own advertising model to serve targeted offers based on content, influencers and influential topics; as well as retargeted promotions/offers from Brands.</p>
<p>Even so, all the potential genius behind these tools notwithstanding, the fact that remains is &#8211; Klout still has a long way to go. Sure, a handful of Social Media mavens may already be judging us on the basis of our Klout score, but it&#8217;s going to take Klout a lot many enhancements before it can be taken seriously as an accurate social media metric and a reliable measure of actual social CLOUT, or it won&#8217;t be soon before long that Klout has to bow out! <em>(Just couldn&#8217;t resist that cheesy rhyme!)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not what you think it&#8217;s going to be about.</p>
<p>This weekend, I read an article about San Fransisco considering a drop in the minimum square footage for apartment units to 220.  No, not a drop *of* 220 square feet.  <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/24/local/la-me-micro-apartments-20120924">A drop *to* 220 square feet</a>.</p>
<p>Now, most of you here have no idea that I had my blossoming architecture career smashed under the housing market crash.  Alas, I had to move on, but my love of house design never left me.  Going nostalgic for a moment, I knew I was in the right line of work when after an 8 hour day at the office drawing house plans, I&#8217;d come home and play Sims.  Only I wouldn&#8217;t actually <em>play</em> the Sims, I just designed neighborhoods of houses.  Yep, I&#8217;d design houses at work, then come home and design them for fun.  Some people called me sick, but I just liked to think of myself in my perfect career.</p>
<p>Okay so obviously I&#8217;m not getting paid for it anymore, but I still love designing houses!  (and ooh look, I have AutoCAD on my computer now. mwahaha!)</p>
<p>One thing I love about small house designs (or apartment, or whatever.  Small *living* space designs) is it requires so much more <a href="http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/space-saving-apartment-walk-thru-shower-fridge-in-drawer/"><em>creative</em> use of space</a>.  The article shows a very narrow apartment with a wall bed that converts to the dining area when not being slept in.</p>
<p>It also makes me think about my mom who, to this day, insists she loves Japanese design.  Because it&#8217;s so uncluttered.  (Mom, it&#8217;s uncluttered because they have *less stuff* not because they were just *that good* at design.)  But it is interesting how much even house designs can vary between cultures, and what&#8217;s considered normal.</p>
<p>I saw another house design where the bedroom was really just an enclosed bed with a sliding door.  There wasn&#8217;t any &#8216;floor&#8217; area, just the bed (looked to be on a platform but not what you&#8217;d consider a typical western bed frame).</p>
<p>Got me really thinking about small house plans and reduced floor spaces.  There have been many <a href="http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/pages/books">books written about small houses</a>, lots of people <a href="http://www.verysmallhouse.com/">blogging about small houses</a>, much <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128109273">building of small houses</a>, and now <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kirsten-dirksen/watch-matchbox-microapart_b_1676167.html">tiny apartments</a> are the latest place we&#8217;re cutting space and living smaller here in the US.</p>
<p>My house is 1,800 square feet, if memory serves.  That means if we&#8217;re talking about apartments being 220 sf, I could fit just over 8 apartments in my house.  Since my house is 4 bedroom, and if you assume parents and three children, my house could (and has) uncomfortably fit 5 people (the discomfort chiefly caused by there being but a single bathroom).  Compare that with the same square footage could comfortably fit 8 people, even if in a very tiny space.</p>
<p>It also made me realize there was no way I could ever fit all my &#8216;stuff&#8217; into 220 square feet.  I probably couldn&#8217;t fit it into 440 square feet.  I might have a hard time squeezing down into 900 square feet &#8211; half the size of my house.</p>
<p>Maybe this shouldn&#8217;t bug me, but it does.  Terribly.  Welcome to America: our people are fat, our houses are fat, our closets are fat, our heads are empty, and our wallets are dry.</p>
<p>Yes, I have my crafts and fabric and paints and the like, but really, even with hobbies, I shouldn&#8217;t be incapable of living at half my square footage if people can live in 1/8th of it.</p>
<p>So part of the weekend was spent on thinking about the fact I need to do a major &#8216;stuff&#8217; purge in my life, both for my sanity and for the general tidiness of my house, but part of the weekend was also spent on designing very small houses.</p>
<div id="attachment_607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 177px"><a href="http://creativemetaphor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/220sqft.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-607" title="220SQFT" alt="" src="http://creativemetaphor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/220sqft.jpg?w=167&#038;h=300" height="300" width="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">220 sq. ft. single bedroom floor plan by Eliza Murdock</p></div>
<div id="attachment_608" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://creativemetaphor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/440sqft.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-608" title="440SQFT" alt="" src="http://creativemetaphor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/440sqft.jpg?w=300&#038;h=264" height="264" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">440 sq. ft. two bedroom floor plan by Eliza Murdock</p></div>
<p>I remember several  years ago sitting down to design 1,000 sq. ft. houses and thinking how difficult it was.  I don&#8217;t deny these plans offer very little in the way of indoor space, but that will hopefully help get people outdoors more often.</p>
<p>Now, if I was a college student or recent grad and was looking to move into my own place, I&#8217;d have been delighted with either of these options (especially since I&#8217;d have turned the second bedroom into an office or craft room).  However, being well established in my house, I think I&#8217;d find it very hard to squeeze back into such a small floor plan.</p>
<p>But I am going to embark onto an epic purge and get rid of all the stuff I haven&#8217;t seen for years, clothes I haven&#8217;t worn for years, furniture whose only use is to hold stuff I don&#8217;t use&#8230; it&#8217;s time to lose weight! &#8211; haul it to Goodwill, maybe hold a big garage sale, or throw stuff on ebay and see what happens.  Maybe I can purge my life and grow my wallet a tad?</p>
<p>Also, if anyone wants a very small house designed for them&#8230; <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our front porch is falling apart.  Floor boards are rotten.   Railings are either loose or long gone.  Paint is peeling.</p>
<div id="attachment_12857" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/porch-shabby-porch.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12857" title="porch Shabby Porch" alt="" src="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/porch-shabby-porch.jpg?w=500&#038;h=444" height="444" width="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our front porch (Sara&#8217;s photo)</p></div>
<p>To even call it a porch might be to unduly dignify the failing structure now only semi-attached to the front of our equally falling down house.  It’s a sad architectural decay, a century in the making.</p>
<p>Sometimes my partner Sara and I joke about purposefully keeping the <a title="Out Front/Sara's blipfoto site" href="http://www.blipfoto.com/entry/2211336" target="_blank">porch</a> in pathetic shape, so when we’re out of the country for months at a time, no one would imagine there&#8217;s anything worth stealing on the inside.</p>
<p>Yet theft or no theft, for two centuries, front porches have been an important part of our country’s <a title="NPR story about porches in America" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5589974" target="_blank">popular imagination</a>.  In fact, front porches are a distinct architectural features of American homes—almost as popular in the US as baseball and apple pie.</p>
<p>Originally important as cool, shaded spaces for families to gather, <a title="The Evolution of the American Front Porch" href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/am483_97/projects/cook/first.htm" target="_blank">front porches</a> became  common-place by the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century, peaking in popularity into the earlier 20<sup>th</sup>.  Only after World War II and the movement of American families to the suburbs did back yards replace front porches as a primary outdoor place for children to play and parents to socialize.  Slightly more removed from the public eye than the front porch, back yards insulated families from their neighbors, as, in recent years, television and the internet, in moving America almost entirely indoors, have reinvented the notion of neighborhood altogether.</p>
<p>But I didn’t grow up in the suburbs, virtual or otherwise, so during my childhood front porches figured prominently.  Where we lived, within the city limits of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, people still gathered on porches.  This was especially true for elderly folks who had grown up during the front-porch hay-day of the early 1900s.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that my grandmother introduced me to porch occupation.  My father’s mother, <a title="Don't Run, you'll Make Dust" href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/dont-run-youll-make-dust-a-grandmothers-warning/" target="_blank">Kimmy</a>, as we called her, took to the front porch especially on summer evenings, often with a white handkerchief, slathered in Ben-Gay, tied around her head, the menthol meant to treat her almost perpetual headache.  It’s virtually impossible for me to remember Kimmy without that white bandana, worn rather than waved, in near surrender to migraine pain—what she referred to as &#8220;having [her] head tied up.”</p>
<div id="attachment_12859" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0001.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12859" title="IMG_0001" alt="" src="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0001.jpg?w=500&#038;h=398" height="398" width="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kimmy (heachache-free) on our front porch in Pittsburgh.</p></div>
<p>Headache or not, however, since our house was on the flight path of planes approaching the Pittsburgh airport, Kimmy and I spent many evenings on the porch counting jets as they roared by.  Oh, what an exciting life we led, that this was considered sport.  Seriously, talk about hard up!  No wonder Kimmy had a head ache.  Bless her heart, not to mention her neck!</p>
<p>My <a title="On Marrying a Mafia Man: Narrative Edition" href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.wordpress.com/2012/06/11/on-marrying-a-mafia-man-narrative-edition/" target="_blank">maternal grandmother</a>, who lived in a small town east of Pittsburgh also loved sitting on her front porch on summer evenings.  However, Nana didn’t count planes.  Her concerns were more down-to-earth.  Nana had neighbors to talk to.</p>
<div id="attachment_12863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0003-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-12863" title="IMG_0003 (2)" alt="" src="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0003-2.jpg" height="385" width="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nana (center), seated just below her front porch, with her 5 daughters&#8211;around 1970.</p></div>
<p>While Kimmy sat on the porch passively watching the world fly by, Nana engaged with friends and strangers, alike.  Kimmy didn’t use the porch as a place to reach out from, and rather than counting her blessings, as Nana did, Kimmy, not knowing how to be thankful, counted that which was above and beyond her.  Gratitude eluded her.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that, although I loved Kimmy dearly, Nana, I adored.  For Nana the porch was a place of action&#8211;for Kimmy, a place she occupied only passively.   Though Nana used  a walker in later years and couldn’t venture into the street, neighbors came and went from Nana’s porch.  It was not a static place.  It was a space for love and faith in action.</p>
<p>No one had the time to count anything from Nana’s porch.  Rather, Nana’s neighbors counted on her.  She cared for them.  She prayed with them.  When she could barely stand, she still baked pies for them.</p>
<p>So, perhaps, it’s appropriate that the front porch on this house I share with Sara is imperfect.  Though we’ve been home from Haiti for more than a year, we too are women of action.  We’ve gone out into the world&#8211;literally.</p>
<p><a title="Once in a Blue Swoon" href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/once-in-a-blue-swoon/" target="_blank">Sara</a>, during her twenty years with an international housing NGO, has helped folks build homes of their own.  Homes with porches.</p>
<p>And those porches are places from which they, too, can <a title="Heifer 12 x 12" href="http://heifer12x12.com/the-journey/" target="_blank">reach out</a>, <a title="Comments for a Cause" href="http://bethannchiles.com/category/comments-for-a-cause/" target="_blank">give back</a>, care more.</p>
<p>Perhaps this blog, as well, is a front porch, of sorts—a place from which virtual neighbors come and go.  When we leave <a title="When Blogrolls Evolve into Friendships and Comments Morph into Hugs" href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/when-blogrolls-evolve-into-friendships-and-comments-morph-into-hugs/" target="_blank">comments</a>, we take the time to stay and &#8220;set a spell&#8221; (as they say here in Kentucky).</p>
<p>Blogs, like porches, transition us from private to public space and back again.  They link us to something larger, something outside ourselves, something more meaningful than counting planes, or page hits, for that matter.  Blogs are open doors.  They create a shared space, become a place where <a title="Top 10 Reasons to Join the Bloggy Blast" href="http://reinventingtheeventhorizon.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/top-10-reasons-to-join-the-bloggy-blast/" target="_blank">friendships</a> form and lives change.  Blogs encourage dialogue, deepen connections, create an experience that is richer than any single post in and of itself.</p>
<p>Blogs are <a title="Front Porch Blog" href="http://appvoices.org/frontporchblog/" target="_blank">front porches</a> reinvented for a digital age, perhaps—platforms that take the inside out and bring the outside in, corridors of courtesy in a digital and fast-paced world.</p>
<p>Bloggers, such as you and I, are the architects of new neighborhoods, not only in America, but beyond, as well.  We offer a wider welcome, with new notions of proximity, new notions of inclucivity and love.</p>
<p>Blog on, my friends, blog on.</p>
<p><b>What role have porches played in your life?  What else do blogs and porches have in common?  How has blogging opened you to wider world?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the nineties, I was in a two-person writers&#8217; group with another would-be novelist. M had a master&#8217;s degree in English and considerably better writing skills than I had. I learned a lot from her. She had agreed to judge the fiction-writing contest for high school students in the city where we lived. Our metropolitan area had a population of over a million, and she found herself buried under submissions. I offered to help.</p>
<p>We split the pile of manuscripts. I was to read the submissions in my half and look for stories that I thought were worth a second look by M, who would make the final decision.</p>
<p>All the submissions were read to the last word by at least one of us. You won&#8217;t find such courtesy in a commercial publishing house.</p>
<p>Some of the pieces were very good. One or two could have passed for the work of an adult professional writer. A few were incredibly bad, as in “aren&#8217;t you too young to be drinking heavily while you write?” kind of bad. </p>
<p>The bulk of them showed an honest effort to write a good short story, but unfortunately the kids didn&#8217;t have a notion of what good fictional technique even looks like. </p>
<p>Before there were authors of how-to-write-fiction books to swindle people out of their money, people who wanted to write fiction usually taught themselves. The classic route was to begin by reading a large stack of fiction. Once you had done that, you would select an author you admired and closely imitate that author until you developed a style of your own. This system of learning through imitation works, and not only in writing. Early Beethoven sounds eerily like Haydn. Van Gogh spent days at a time staring at a single painting in a museum, studying the brush strokes of Rembrandt.</p>
<p>The kids, I soon decided, hadn&#8217;t read very much. Some of that was their age. They hadn&#8217;t had time to read and digest a bookcase of fine writing. Some of the problem, though, was what they <em>had</em> read. I suspected that they had mostly read  badly written cotton-candy fiction, such as cheesy romance novels or clumsy science fiction and horror tales.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s true that you are what you eat, it&#8217;s true that how you write is largely a product of what you&#8217;ve read.  Garbage in, garbage out. </p>
<p>At the time, I wished I had a way to give the honest-but-erring kids some feedback. Twenty years too late, here it is:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created the beginning of a terminally-ill short story:</p>
<p>         <em>      “Don&#8217;t look now,” handsome, tall, dark-curly-haired John said to his lovely wife Laura, blond, blue eyed, C-cup, sexy in her low-cut, eggshell-blue top with matching skirt, shoes, and jewelry, “But there are a couple of old ladies sitting two tables away who are staring at me as if they want to hypnotize me.”</p>
<p>               John and Laura were happy that night. Very happy. Happy, happy, happy. Theirs was a happy marriage. And playful, too. They liked playing games in restaurants and making things up. You could just tell they were playful. They played happily a lot.</p>
<p>               Laura pretended to yawn and turned around and looked up into the sky as if the were looking for airplanes the way her father, whom she had never gotten along with and who disliked her husband, their cats, and her favorite ketchup, and who never liked the way her hair looked even after Margaret, her favorite hairdresser, who was getting a divorce from her husband because he liked beans, had it just the way John liked it when he got all excited, but no, this was never good enough for Daddy, and it made her cry sometimes when he looked for airplanes that weren&#8217;t there, even though he lived near mountains as beautiful as those inhabited by elves from mythical realms, and where if you wished really hard wishes would come true, and bluebirds danced like fireflies over an azure sea.</em></p>
<p>People who submit stuff like this have no idea what good writing looks like. They think they are writing fiction because what they produce isn&#8217;t much worse than the junk they read. It&#8217;s like believing that a Styrofoam sandwich with rubber-band filling is food. </p>
<p>If you forget everything else I say here, remember this: <em>make a daily habit of reading the work of people who write a lot better than you do.</em></p>
<p>The is the opening of the short story “Don&#8217;t Look Now” by Daphne du Maurier:</p>
<p>       <em>        “Don&#8217;t look now,” John said to his wife, “but there are a couple of old girls two tables away who are trying to hypnotize me.”</p>
<p>               Laura, quick on cue, made an elaborate pretense of yawning, then tilted her head as though searching the skies for non-existent airplanes.</em></p>
<p><em>That</em> is a pro at work. I am envious. Using just forty-eight words she has told us—mostly indirectly—that these are married people sitting in a cafe or restaurant, that they are in good moods, that at least Laura is rather playful, and that something odd is going on at a nearby table occupied by a couple of older women. There is not a single wasted word.</p>
<p>Authors who insist on telling you, frequently, how characters are feeling, instead of showing you, are telling you something else as well: they are telling you they are amateurs. (Okay, even pros occasionally tell readers how a character is feeling, but in most cases it&#8217;s a bad idea, like spitting chewing tobacco on the carpet when you&#8217;re visiting your clean-freak grandmother who has a severe heart condition.)</p>
<p>Also, Ms du Maurier didn&#8217;t start off with a detailed physical description of the characters. The reader doesn&#8217;t need that to begin the story, so she left it out when she set up the initial situation.  (However, if the character just woke up as a giant cockroach, and that isn&#8217;t his normal look, go ahead and begin the first paragraph with a description that explains why sales clerks won&#8217;t accept his old photo I.D. when he tries to buy beer.)</p>
<p>I swear that the very worst writing I saw during my stint as a contest filter—bad for many other reasons besides excessive description of looks—contained the most detailed and lengthy and irrelevant physical descriptions of the characters no later than the middle of the first page. </p>
<p>I suppose that if you have mostly read cheesy romance novels sold for the purpose of, well, lets call it &#8220;private self-enjoyment&#8221; to keep this post G-rated, you&#8217;re used to enough physical description of impossibly gorgeous and sexy humans to complete a missing person&#8217;s report, and think that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done in good fiction. </p>
<p>Think again. Many great novels and short stories lack a full description of the main characters. We don&#8217;t even know what color Elizabeth Bennet&#8217;s hair was in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and Jane Austen had an entire novel to get around to mentioning it. (She did make it clear that Lizzy was not a “handsome” woman, so forget about the pretty actresses who play the character in films.)</p>
<p>I also loaded my dying story with a ton of irrelevant garbage that has no bearing whatsoever on the story. Details are fine, even desirable, if they matter, but bad fiction is crawling with the irrelevant and swimming with red herrings.  </p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time to edit, put every detail and every sentence you toss in during the white heat of writing the first draft on trial for its life. Does it reveal something important about the characters? Does it advance the plot? Does it help to sustain or enrich the fictional dream by making a real contribution to the description of the scene? No? Off with its head!</p>
<p>Overblown description, a common disease of amateurs, usually occurs when a writer tries on a narrative voice that is too big for him. (Bad imitations of William Faulkner come to mind.) I admire good lyrical prose, but it&#8217;s a high-wire act few of us can pull off. If you don&#8217;t have a real gift for it, please tell your story in simple declarative sentences. Some great fiction has been written in bare, minimalist language.</p>
<p>As a final test, kids, read your dialogue aloud. If it sounds stupid, it probably is. Fix it so an actor could read the lines without snickering.  Keep writing, and good luck! </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eureka!  I found it!  By a stroke of good luck I chanced upon a group of kids hunched over the sidewalk playing marbles!</p>
<p><a href="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2231.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2841" title="playing marbles" alt="boys playing marbles" src="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2231.jpg" height="683" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>I played with marbles during my elementary school days, and so did most of my schoolmates.  Stomping the glass marble on the soft ground, five holes are made and the object of the game is to sink a marble into one of those holes.</p>
<p><a href="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2239.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2842" title="boys playing marbles 2" alt="boys playing marbles" src="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2239.jpg" height="683" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Here, the player tries to hit the target marble.  It is not easy as the marbles are now only half the size of what they used to be.  If the player hits the target, he wins all the marbles that are in play.  The same is true if he holes a marble at the start of his turn.</p>
<p>We used to go to school with a pocketful of marbles to play during recess and after class dismissal.  On a good day it becomes 2 pocketful of marbles.  Bad days are when we had to skip our snacks and use the money to buy marbles instead.  The worst is when our teachers find out we&#8217;ve been playing marbles and confiscates the whole lot.  I wonder why teachers would want to confiscate our marbles &#8211; I haven&#8217;t seen them play at the school yard.  Not even once!</p>
<p><a href="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2227.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2840" title="birthday girl" alt="" src="http://afternoonwalks.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2227.jpg" height="683" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>So once again I visited Gwynneth.  She just turned 4 last October 19.  I came by to drop off her birthday gifts sent from across the globe, from a wonderful person whom I met through this blog, and who was featured in October 2011.  <a href="http://afternoonwalks.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/meeting-ms-leila/" target="_blank">Ms Leila</a>, thank you for making this little girl very happy.  You are a blessing to the people around you.</p>
