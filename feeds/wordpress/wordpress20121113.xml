				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m tired tonight. I&#8217;ve had a busy day and there&#8217;s a lot of stuff whirring around in my head and begging for space on my to-do list. I could quite happily sink into bed. I could very easily give up on this daily blogging for a month. Who would ever miss my posts?</p>
<p>Probably no-one. Apart from me. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that my productivity and positivity levels have shot up since I started this exercise. My God, I even completed a task today that I was 3 years behind on &#8211; you know, the kind of thing you wake to worry about at 2am. So yes, I&#8217;m pretty pleased.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s just a blogging placebo effect (blogbo?) but whatever, it&#8217;s definitely working for me. If white sugar pills to pop can do it for subjects in medical trials I don&#8217;t see why white screens to write on can&#8217;t do it for me and my mildly tortured brain on the hunt for an outlet.</p>
<p>I have always found the practice of journal writing, I was going to say therapeutic but it&#8217;s less that, less remedial and more positive and forward thrusting for me. Anyway, you get the idea. I like keeping a journal. BUT, and here&#8217;s the kicker, despite liking it, despite getting a lot from it, despite all of the positive effects I recognise, I still have a tendency to let it slide. What&#8217;s that all about? (Idiocy, laziness, self-sabotage? Delete as you deem appropriate.)</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where blogging differs from keeping a musty old journal under my bed. It&#8217;s a dynamic, interactive, social process. Even here, on a new, low-key blog with barely any readers, each time I press publish it&#8217;s like sprinkling a little bit of fairy dust on my thoughts and writings. Who knows where they might end up or lead, who they might touch or affect?</p>
<p>It may seem a little far-fetched to think this way but I guess that all I&#8217;m really saying is that the act of making public my private thoughts (even though in a paradoxically very private manner) is both liberating and empowering. And that, to me, is magical.</p>
<p>So no. I&#8217;m not giving up on NaBloPoMo. Instead I&#8217;m thankful for the opportunity and motivation it has given me to keep turning up at the page and pressing publish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-298" title="None of these are diet, but all of them are good." alt="" src="http://sortaginger.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ice-drinks-soda-bottle-caps-new-hd-wallpaper1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" height="640" width="1024" />Tomorrow, I start the steps to say goodbye to a long-time companion.  After 30 years of being my go-to beverage, I will be cutting out diet soda from my life.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My motivation for this is simple: water is free and soft drinks are expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Of course, there are health benefits involved with this change, even if they aren&#8217;t visible to me.  But to be honest, even though I hate Splenda and HFCS, Nutrasweet/aspartame is one of those food chemicals that  I paid little attention to.  Sure, I could read the warnings on the drinks, but after starting out in my life with an occasional drink up to my  current several-a-day habit, I figured I would keep taking my chances on the lab rat-carcinogen that gave me fizzy taste with no calories.  It had to be better than smoking, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">********************</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It started out innocently enough.  If you had a parent in the house that was on a diet, it was expected they may have bought diet cola as an occasional treat for themselves and you could have one.  When there was a field trip and you were told to bring two drinks wrapped in foil, that is what you got.  Or, if your grandfather had diabetes, all sodas at his house were diet, from cola to ginger ale to expand your horizons some.  I got used to drinking the artificially sweetened stuff, but I also drank my milk like a good kid was supposed to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As I got older, I started to prefer to drink only the diet sodas when we could get them.  Milk was now disgusting and I had always hated  our nasty well water.  I would use my lunch money to buy diet cola instead of actual food.  Other than preferring the taste, the soda can itself became a way to announce &#8220;Hey!  I&#8217;m on a diet!&#8221;.  You know, just in case anyone thought I should be watching my weight besides me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Over the years, I have tried to quit this habit.  The cost alone of these drinks is phenomenal.  I would alternate brands to match what was on the best sale that week.  I would switch to store brands to try to wean off the taste and save a few bucks.  But none of this really worked.  It is my caffeine source, helping me wake up since I have never liked coffee or tea, and my replacement for sweets when I have a sugar craving.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">*******************</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a lot of tips and tricks out there on how to cut sodas out of your life in general.  Here are the ones that I have tried and the results:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Try seltzer water with a splash of fruit juice</strong>&#8211;This one I have seen before in health and diet articles, but my darling son brought this suggestion to my attention during one of my times trying to quit before.  Sounds yummy, right?  Blech.  Instant cotton mouth, with a fruity aftertaste.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Slice up fruits and put the pieces in ice cubes/into your water</strong>&#8211;Now, this option sounds nicer than the one above, but one little issue.  I do not care too much for fruit, but I especially hate fruit flavored drinks.  Unless they contain alcohol, but that doesn&#8217;t help this habit and unfortunately encourages a different habit instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Use Crystal Light, GatorAde, KoolAid, etc. drink &#8220;straws&#8221;</strong>&#8211;You know what these are, right?  They are little thin packets of powdered drink mixes fine enough to mix into a bottle of water without having to use a spoon to make sure they are all dissolved?   They come in everything from a Tang-creatiion, flavored teas, energy drinks or other flavors.  Now they even have them in &#8220;drop&#8221; form so you don&#8217;t have to use your keys or pen to open the package of powder.  Yummy, right?  Nah.  When I said I hate fruit flavored drinks, that wasn&#8217;t limited to natural fruit.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Drink water at room temperature/lukewarm</strong>&#8211;I can drink sodas at room temperature, water is another story.  And that story is &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">********************</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, what does work?  I have actually done this before for months at a time, only to back slide when faced with illness or stress.  Here&#8217;s my plan so far:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Baby steps</strong>&#8211;I will finish the few sodas I have left in the house, and I will not buy any more bottles of soda when I go out.  If I go to eat at an actual restaurant, I will allow myself one diet drink but no refills except for water.  Hold the lemon, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Some water with my ice, please</strong>&#8211;I have discovered that the more ice I have in my cup to make the water as cold as possible, the easier it is for me to drink it.   My last diet soda fast, I ended up buying bags of ice to keep up with the demand that I needed to keep everything as cold as possible.  I could not keep the trays filled fast enough to meet my demand.  I would spend $2 a week on a bag of ice from Sonic (the best ice ever!) vs. a lot more than that each day for enough of the fizzy stuff to get me through.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Find the right container</strong>&#8211;Since I am an ice-queen in this respect, it is also important that whatever I use as my beverage container hold a bunch of frozen water and keep it cold.  Right now, I have two &#8220;mega cups&#8221; that you see at the convenience stores.  Yes, the ones that are $5 or more, look like a keg or have FIZZINATOR or QUAD GULP on them,  and offer the owner 99 cent refills on soft drinks for life.  Not the prettiest things, but they work at insulation and don&#8217;t puddle all over my desk.  I would love to find a cup that is a little more &#8220;me&#8221; that insulates worth a darn, but for now I will work with what I have.  The bonus for these is that I can go back to the store that I got the cup, get free ice and take a few of the extra long straws to use with it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Water, water everywhere</strong>&#8211;This also ties into my search for the perfect beverage container.  If I wake up and my water from the night before isn&#8217;t icy, I am not going to want to drink it because it won&#8217;t be cold enough, and  I will be cranky.  And if I am cranky, I will likely hit up the Hardee&#8217;s on the way to work for my morning diet drink in their super large cups.   Giving up soda in the winter is probably not a bad thing since it is more likely the water won&#8217;t be hot in the morning after sitting bedside overnight, but I still like to hear that clink of the ice shifting when I go to get a drink.  Silly, but true.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">********************</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, that is my plan for this week.  Start out with the baby steps.  During work, I am sure I can stick to the water plan without a problem.  It is the making excuses for trying to get moving in the morning or treating myself at the end of the day that I will have to really change in order to make this stick.  I should keep track of how much money I save this week and in the coming weeks to see what the true impact is on my bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Unless, of course, I can figure out a way to like and get addicted to coffee instead.   Coffee with lots and lots of  artificial flavoring.</p>

<p>It’s not easy.</p>
<p>Moving to a new place of any kind can be a daunting task. Across country away from family and friends? Definitely not easy.</p>
<p>I have always been one for dreaming about the adventure, of meeting new people and experiencing new things. Anticipating the newness has always been preferable to the actual event.</p>
<p>Before hitting the road to New York City in the U-Haul, I had my hand pressed against the windowpane as I watched my parents wave back at me. I knew then and there, this was going to be harder than I had previously thought.</p>
<p>After arriving at the apartment building with all of our earthly possessions, we knew with the unloading process that our work was cut out for us. I stepped out of the truck and immediately, this small little black cat greeted us with a cute meow. He was skinny, definitely a stray, but was curious about what we were up to. While we were drenched in sweat, furiously unpacking the trailer in the August heat, he sat on a perch, occasionally angling his head this way and that. I hesitantly gave him a scratch on the head, afraid of fleas or a surprise bite or scratch. He brushed against me to show mutual affection.</p>
<p>The day after, he sat on our steps waiting for our emergence. He again rubbed up against my skin and smelled my hand. He looked so malnourished. I gave him bits of tuna and salmon from our canned goods.</p>
<p>A week went by and we found out a bit about his back story. Finn was a two-year-old black cat that had previously worn a collar around the neighborhood. Up until March, he was someone’s pet — that collar was unceremoniously taken off and he was left on his own. I have no respect for people who do that, absolutely none. Finn had to learn to fend for himself, which he took to begging off people and catching birds. Luckily, our neighborhood cared for him, as several people started feeding him from their pantries.</p>
<p>Being an animal lover, I went to the pet store and bought him some treats, a bag of dry food, and a bowl. Finn instantly became acclimated to my morning feedings outside of the apartment building. Dry food changed to wet food as I fell more in love with my feline friend.</p>
<p>A month had gone by. While I looked for jobs, Finn continued to sit on our top step or sleep in the flower garden nearby. He would peer into our windows from time to time, just to see if we were inside. When I needed a break from the computer, I came out and petted the loving creature. While his claws were ferocious looking, I would let him settle into my lap for a nap while I used my phone or read a book. He was always exhausted from only getting short bits of sleep outdoors.</p>
<p>The weather started getting colder and we became more worried about Finn’s well being. He had no place to go. He would sit and cry and cry outside the building, it was so hard to hear. One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I made a makeshift litter box and bed for him in the living room and let Finn in. As hard as it sounds from a cat, he showed me more gratitude than most humans would. While I was afraid of fleas and mites, I was more afraid of my friend getting sick.</p>
<p>After that night, I tried to contact every animal organization and shelter in the area. No response. We wrote an e-mail to our apartment manager and were told, no, we could not keep a cat.</p>
<p>Through Finn, we started meeting our neighbors and really liking them. We started learning of all the good deeds our neighbors had been doing for the little guy. They were all worried about Finn. During Hurricane Sandy, one neighbor kept him in their garage with all that a cat could possibly need. Other people brought him in for a night or two from the cold. Finally, one neighbor had a friend that wanted Finn as a pet in his Manhattan apartment. Unfortunately, a nor’easter came through our area and we had another week of worrying about our neighborhood cat.</p>
<p>He secretly came and stayed in our apartment building, sleeping in our apartment at night. Finn went to the vet where we all learned that he was disease-, mite- and flea-free. He became used to being a house cat, while occasionally slipping out to hunt birds (he was quite good at that.) On the last night of his stay with us, he brought a dead bird to our doorstep. I truly believe the bloody mess was his way of giving us a gift. He was absolutely beaming standing next to his prey.</p>
<p>Finn left on Saturday morning, and while I know he is in a good home and luckier than most strays, I’m still pretty sad. He was my first new friend in this lonely city. Finn was there for me when I was the most homesick. And while I am sad to see him go, I am forever thankful for this little angel that stepped into my life during a time of great transition. I desperately needed a friend and Finn desperately needed me. I am getting used to this strange place, meeting new people, and New York City isn’t as daunting as it first was. Finn is now getting used to being a big city kitty, and I’m getting settled in as well. I will not forget his friendship and as sappy as it might sound, that little guy will forever be in my heart. Thanks, Finn.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 247px"><a href="http://www.stockvault.net/photo/135694/sleeping-cat"><img alt="" src="http://www.stockvault.net/data/s/135694.jpg" height="279" width="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Sleeping Cat&#8221;<br />2happy → in Cats and dogs</p></div>
<p>Each night before I fall asleep I will myself to dream. If I’m lucky the next morning, I’ll remember them and record the details in a journal. Then, I’ll dissect what I wrote and analyze each symbol separately.<a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/" target="_blank"> Dreammoods.com </a>is my savior. It’s more complex than that of course; dream interpretation remains a mystery, even today.  Nonetheless, I love dreaming. I love talking about my dreams. And I’m probably alone in this, but I love <i>hearing</i> about <i>other people’s</i> dreams.</p>
<p>That being said, in literature, when characters dream, it’s a sublime reading experience.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly my main character dreams throughout my novel-in-progress.  I don’t overdo it; he only has maybe two or three noteworthy dreams in the story. These nightly visions aren’t longwinded three page descriptions of unconscious rigmarole. A good dream sequence should probably last five to seven sentences at the most. And, let me say, the weirder the better.</p>
<p>After examining both my own writing and that of others, I can relate three simple rules-of-thumb when it comes to a character’s <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/sleep-101" target="_blank">REM cycle:</a></p>
<p>1. Like I mentioned before, keep it short. The general public tends to get bored while listening to a friend, relative, or co-worker’s nighttime adventures (I’m the exception), so assume that they’ll get “sleepy” while reading about a protagonist’s overactive subconscious.</p>
<p>2. It should reflect what real dreams are like: ethereal, nonsensical, and at times, jarring. Taking this a step further, it works best when the underlying meaning of the dream is more obvious to the reader than the character him or herself.</p>
<p>3. It can’t be random. It must, in some ways, reflect the bigger picture of the story.</p>
<p>Expanding on number three, I’ve broken the concept down into the three categories:</p>
<p>1. <b>Distorted Foreshadowing:</b>A character dreams of walking through an unfamiliar rose garden. All flowers are flourishing, except for one brownish, wilting bush at the perimeter’s edge. Two weeks later a phone call comes: the character’s estranged mother has passed. At the wake, the funeral home is decked out in roses—the once vibrant mother’s favorite flower.</p>
<p>2. <b>Jumbled Reflection of a Character’s True Feelings</b>: A female protagonist has a recurring dream where she is stuck inside an old haunted hotel. There are ghosts in each room, and she fears they will come out and get her. There seems to be no exit to the terrifying building, each door she tries is jammed, the phones don’t work, and even if they did, it wouldn’t matter because when she tries to speak, no words come out.</p>
<p>In this character’s real life situation, she is invested in an abusive marriage, and despite the warnings she receives from her friends and family members, she feels too weak to break free. There are many, many truths she has not acknowledged about her life and situation. However, at least in the early parts of the story, she is utterly confused as to the meaning of the ominous dream.</p>
<p>3. <b>Mish-mashed Symbolism:</b>A wronged male character dreams he is on the beach when a giant wave crashed over him. Later, when he finds shelter in an abandoned house, he can barely step inside because the entire place is flooded. In dreams, water is reflective of emotions, particularly emotions which have gotten out of control; hence, the man’s anger over his past is actually “leaking out” and “overwhelming” him. The water symbolizes his torrid emotional state.</p>
<p>Each story will lend itself to a different kind of dreamer.  As the sole creators of our stories, we understand our characters better than they understand themselves. Their dreams are simply attempting to clue them in.</p>
<p>Some tips? Check out dreammoods.com <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> It has a comprehensive dream dictionary, as well as simplified theories from renowned theorists like <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/sigmundfreud/p/sigmund_freud.htm" target="_blank">Sigmund Freud</a> and <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/jungprofile.htm" target="_blank">Carl Jung. </a>Understanding the basic nature of dreams will aid you in your writing.</p>
<p>How about you? Do your characters dream? Excited to hear your comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1543" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 605px"><a href="http://nervouscitizen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wilw-spinoff.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1543" title="wilw spinoff" alt="Sean Sandulak Verbatim Gibberish Wil Wheaton Big Bang Theory vomit spin-off" src="http://nervouscitizen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wilw-spinoff.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This pretty much says it all</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">So, I just wanted to immortalize this on the blog before it disappeared forever from the twittersphere. Friday morning, on a whim, I threw together a quick caption from a behind-the-scenes photo of <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Wil Wheaton" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000696/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">Wil Wheaton</a></strong> and his wife Anne on the set of <strong><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><a class="zem_slink" title="The Big Bang Theory" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">Big Bang Theory</a></i></span></strong>. If you haven&#8217;t seen the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2462410/">episode</a>, it was taken on Wil Wheaton&#8217;s front porch (not really his, it&#8217;s just a TV set people) shortly after <a class="zem_slink" title="Jim Parsons" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1433588/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">Jim Parsons</a>&#8216;s character Sheldon (spoiler) gets drunk and throws up in the bushes.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Anyway, I thought I was being clever, so I threw it up on the twitters and mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/wilw">@wilw </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnneWheaton">@AnneWheaton</a>, because I thought they might get a kick out of it.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">And I guess he did because he retweeted it. To over two million people. Granted, it is twitter, so half of those are probably spambots, but still THAT&#8217;S A LOT OF PEOPLE! (I may have just moved up from Z-list celebrity to the Y-list. That means they won&#8217;t let you in the clubs, but you can wash famous people&#8217;s dishes. Part-time.) But what it really taught me is that you should not send funny tweets to celebrities without first turning off push notifications on your iPad. I couldn&#8217;t use it for half an hour, and finally had to unplug the wifi so I could clear the screen and reset it. I&#8217;m still getting favorites and retweets two days later. (I am officially labelling a retweet by a Wheaton as a retwheaton. And you can&#8217;t stop me.)</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">All kidding aside, that has got to be one of the greatest things about social media. Before the Internet, you might have met a celebrity at a signing or randomly on the street, but now you can follow them (in a non-stalker-y way), get insights into their characters, and even send them a message. And if they&#8217;re not a complete douche canoe, they&#8217;ll read it and maybe even give something back.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Anyone can join in and play, too. My favorite thing that happened was that some random person in Ohio forwarded that caption to <a class="zem_slink" title="Bill Prady" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0695080/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">Bill Prady</a>, the executive producer for the show. Can you imagine if he saw that and thought, &#8220;You know, maybe we could give Wil Wheaton his own show.&#8221; And he takes the idea to <a class="zem_slink" title="Chuck Lorre" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0521143/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">Chuck Lorre</a> and they shop it to the network. Those guys love it because they grew up watching <span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Next Generation</i></span> and nerds are hot property right now. (By the way, if you don&#8217;t know who Wil Wheaton is, shame on you and stop reading now.) They make a pilot and it gets picked up. The next thing you know, <span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Big Bang</i></span> is the lead-in for a new geeky sitcom, starring you-know-who, because that is how the entertainment industry actually works. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">You&#8217;re welcome.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Now that I think about it, that would be an awesome show. You could have Wil Wheaton, interacting with &#8220;fans&#8221; at conventions, all kinds of crazy costumes, and lots of guest appearances by Star Trek alumni. It would be kind of like the fifth season of <span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><a class="zem_slink" title="The Guild - Episode 1: Wake-Up Call" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grCTXGW3sxQ" target="_blank" rel="youtube">The Guild</a></i></span>, only with a budget. I would totally watch that show. Somebody start a petition. Anything would be better than <span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Two and a Half Men. </i></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;">(No offence, Mr. Lorre, sir.)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Of course I realize someone like Wil Wheaton (like Sheldon, I always have to say both names) gets thousands of mentions every day. But there are a lot of other &#8220;famous&#8221; people who only have a few thousands or tens-of-thousands of followers. It&#8217;s a fun sort of game to see who you can get to answer your tweets.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">If you want to try here are a few simple suggestions:</span></span></span></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Follow them. (Duh.) Find out if they are really the person you thought they were.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Don&#8217;t expect them to answer right away. They are busy people with fabulous lives or you wouldn&#8217;t be trying to get their attention.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Don&#8217;t overdue it. Stalkers get blocked.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Try and figure out when they are online. Do they tweet over breakfast or are they a night owl? Don&#8217;t forget they may be in a different time zone.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Talk about what interests them. It&#8217;s often their careers or current projects. Just like you, they like to talk (and complain) about their jobs. And it&#8217;s Hollywood, so many people are narcissists.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Don&#8217;t be dull.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">So what is the result of all this fuss and bother. Not much in the grand scheme of things. But I did get a few new followers, and I made a few people smile for a few seconds, so I can think of worse ways to spend your time. It&#8217;s kind of like playing the lottery. No one seriously expects to win, but every now and then you get a few bucks. It&#8217;s the possibility of a greater reward that keeps you coming back.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Also, if they really do a spin-off, I want writing royalties for the concept. That would be winning the lottery.</span></span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_268" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tracicarverdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ipad-photo1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-268" title="Ipad photo" alt="The pencil vs. the iPad" src="http://tracicarverdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ipad-photo1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" height="199" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The pencil vs. the iPad</p></div>
<p>Every generation creates its own horror stories of suffering. Consider my grandparents’ generation who truly discovered the meaning of sacrifice during the Great Depression; even they embellished tales with details of walking uphill in the snow to school both ways . . . which was impressive until I grew old enough to realize it snows about once every 57 years in South Georgia, and even then it doesn&#8217;t stick to the ground. Or how about the times I watched my grandmother swipe a piece of fat off my plate because I &#8220;was wasting good food,&#8221; leaving me covered in a thin layer of guilt for rude ungratefulness until my dad assured me that as farmers, they had plenty of food on the table and MaMa was just partial to slivers of gristle, gizzards, and chicken feet. When I discovered she ate these tidbits by choice, I almost went into a great depression myself. But times have changed, and legends of monumental suffering must transform with them. I experienced one of these generational transitions today in my classroom.</p>
<p>I have two classes preceding lunch, and my fifth period freshmen must make way for my sixth period seniors. As often happens during that five minute interval, I have students from both age brackets commingling as one group hurriedly stuffs papers into their thirty pound book bags while the other saunters in carrying only a pair of earphones and a Powerade. Today my younger scribes were gathered around the vocabulary list on the board, brandishing iPads and snapping photos with more gusto than the paparazzi. You would have thought a scantily clad British royal lurked behind those words the way they were jockeying for position and tapping the screens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you look at that?&#8221; Chase said, wagging his head in disgust. &#8220;They have no idea what real 9th grade English is like. I remember the days when we had to write down our words using wooden sticks with lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas placed a beverage the color of pureed Smurfs on his desk and join in the commiseration. &#8220;I remember those. They were called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pencils</span>, and you had to whittle away the tips with a razor blade and then press them against an absorbent tablet called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">paper</span> in order to capture the likeness of those words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You kept paper in a spiral notebook . . . &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a folder . . . &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was in a binder . . . &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you kept in a locker.&#8221; I&#8217;ll say one thing for those guys: they would have made an impressive duo in a doubles match.</p>
<p>Chase propped half a leg on the desk and polished off the sermon his 1,000 extra days of existence ordained him to deliver. &#8220;Youngsters these days just don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to rough it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; Thomas said the way a deacon offers an amen. Freshmen darted for the door, intent on making their next class under the cloak of punctuality. &#8220;These guys are living the soft life with their iPads.&#8221; As the last slender body cleared the doorway, he looked at Chase. &#8220;Hey, man, can I borrow your earphones? I left mine at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ve got an extra set. But I&#8217;m gonna need your flash drive because I left mine in the truck, and I don&#8217;t want to have to walk out to the parking lot to get it.&#8221; Chase turned to me. &#8220;Ms. Carver, do we need our laptops today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re doing something in class . . . with paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chase looked at Thomas. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna need a pen, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas reached into pockets that could have swallowed a grapefruit and pulled out a slender tube. &#8220;You&#8217;re gonna have to borrow one from Dakota. All I&#8217;ve got is a Sharpie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right now, Aaron Sorkin is cursing Nate Silver.</p>
<p>In Sorkin’s world, the 2012 election would have gone down to the wire. It wouldn’t have dragged out in manner of the Bush-Gore debacle of 2000, nor would it have been called at 11:12 pm, which is what happened this past Tuesday in a thoroughly anti-climactic event (who cares if Florida still can’t get their act together? Good night, nurse.) No, in Sorkin’s world, the election would go down</p>
<p><span id="more-408"></span></p>
<p>to the wee hours of Election Wednesday, just as dawn was breaking and none of the world had slept. Sorkin’s election would have involved drama, last minute compromises, large states too close to call.  Sorkin’s election would have been nail-biting to the end, broken down to in-fighting, tragedy, and party-hopping. Sorkin’s election would <i>reek</i> of integrity, to the point where you feel like you’re getting hit over the head with an American Flag. Sorkin’s election is the height of idealism.</p>
<p>It would not consist of a thirtysomething wunderkind—or highly logical statistician, depending on your point of view—calling the election <i>perfectly</i> weeks before, then getting praised and roasted via Twitter (#DrunkNateSilver anyone?) But before you can say five-thirty-GREAT, let’s mourn for Sorkin’s fictional election that could have been…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>and we’re done.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Which is, perhaps, what makes Sorkin’s current endeavor, <i>The Newsroom</i>, so fascinating. In all of Sorkin’s previous series—the glorious <i>The West Wing</i>, the short-lived-but-beloved <i>Sports Night</i>, the thoroughly fine <i>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</i>, and <i>The American President </i>(not a series, but thrown in for good measure)—he culled inspiration from real life events, without referring to any real-life politicians prior to Nixon. This allowed him to create a realistic universe, but an alternative one as well.</p>
<p>Thus his elections in <i>The West Wing</i> were devices to an end. The first, President Josiah Bartlet re-election, was a victory tour the entire way through. He destroyed his opponent in the last (and only) debate and gave the audience the satisfaction of enjoying Bartlet’s virtually uncontested election day, inviting us all to celebrate in our own integrity and self-satisfaction that here is a man, deserving of the presidency now and forever, who everyone agrees should be president, now and forever.</p>
<p>The second election, that of Congressman Matthew Santos against Senator Arnold Vinick, was the election of Sorkin’s dreams: a two-parter involving all the scenarios I listed earlier: a tragic death, in-fighting, and a large-scale recount. He took every possible situation that could induce anxiety for the audience (or voter, depending on your relationship with reality) and he infused the episode with them ad nauseum. Great television, in that it neatly tied up a messy, intense situation, and was able to gloss over the inevitable fall-out that would actually have occurred (see 2000 election), and kept the audience involved and engaged. He didn&#8217;t write it, of course, having left after the end of season 4, but it was still the election of his dreams.</p>
<p>This time, it’s a little different.</p>
<p><i>The Newsroom</i> follows a realistic-ish timeline.; the first episode takes place in April of 2010, the day of the Gulf Coast oil spill, and bounces between major events that occur over the next sixteen months.  The drama comes from the events themselves—he focuses on events that inspired media panic—as well as the interpersonal relationships that follow. That means he has to follow the current election timeline and outcome. In and of itself, it will be interesting to see what he does with it; he has more than enough material to work with, and, judging by his ode to debate reform in his episode “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF-BZsrtoPs">The Blackout II: Mock Debate</a>,&#8221; he has plenty to say and the tools to do it.</p>
<p>I, for one, am thankful that Sorkin gave himself these parameters. It forces him to give commentary on things that have real impact on his audience.</p>
<p>While he has, in the past, allowed his characters almost complete victory when covering these “real” events, endowing them with so much prescience that their anticipation and “correct” reactions to these events come across as holier than thou, I hope Sorkin allows McAvoy and crew to get quite a few things wrong in the election season. I hope he allows a Nate Silver-esque character to come in and show them up, rather than having one working to their advantage. I hope that Sorkin’s inevitable annoyance that he couldn’t have written that election manifests in real discourse and character development. Because in the end, no matter how much I hope that Jed Bartlet will spring to life and run for president, this is television. These are stories.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for this show to start up again. I have terrible, unrequited crushes on Will and Don (more on my feminist feelings towards both these characters and my attraction to them coming soon) and I love having Sorkin back on television. I also think he has a real chance to blend his own immense storytelling ability with the gift of reality and these real, tangible political players who influence Sorkin’s viewers every day. And yes, that gift includes Nate Silver. &#8211; <em>Hannah</em></p>

Take, for instance, the Salad Shooter. It’s sort of the culinary equivalent of a flamethrower. Really, what man doesn’t want to own a device that slices up food and literally blasts it out? It’s the closest to hunting that I’ll ever get. Likewise, The Ronco Company is a smorgasbord of cool stuff. They make super knives, the Chop-o—Matic, and a food dehydrator so I could make my own beef jerky. That’s a whole weekend of fun right there.</p>
<p>“What am I doing Saturday?” I’d say, ripping a piece of beef jerky in two with my canines. “Just hanging out in the kitchen. Cutting stuff.”</p>
<p>It would be great. And since I’ve seen the Ronco knife commercial, I wouldn’t simply contain my cutting to food. Pennies, my friend’s wedding ring, the wall between the living room and the bathroom – you name it, I’d cut it. After all of that, exhausted from the tunneling, I would make dinner on my George Foreman Grill. In only a matter of minutes, I’d have a finely cooked steak, and, because I have a bad habit of forgetting to put the little trap down, rivers of blood and lard all over the counter.</p>
<p>Yes, kitchen apparatuses are great. There is a dark side, though, which is that a person needs to have a small amount of intelligence to make these things work. Nothing in this world is moron proof, not even a urinal (ever seen the floor of the men’s bathroom?), and I, on occasion, tend to prove this.</p>
<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/green-food.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2302" title="green food" alt="" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/green-food.png?w=248&#038;h=300" height="300" width="248" /></a>Three weeks ago, I arrived back in Korea after having traveled Europe for around two months. The flight was brutal – 12 hours from Madrid to Qatar, 10 hours in the Qatar airport, and then another 12 hours back to Korea. Upon my return, I took the subway to my girlfriend’s apartment. I was starving and she wasn’t home from work yet. To keep things simple, I bought some ramen noodles from the corner store, punched in the door code, threw my things down, and settled in for a quiet first night back.</p>
<p>Noodles. One would think cooking them would be no problem. Chicken, seafood, Jello, pot brownies, crystal meth – all of these things have a higher difficulty rating than cooking noodles. My girlfriend’s apartment in Seoul is super small; she doesn’t have a stove, but instead a little stovetop burner that plugs into the wall. There it was, and sitting on top of it was a pot. I put water in the pot, turned the burner on, and walked away, waiting for the water to start boiling.</p>
<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/electric-pot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2303" title="electric pot" alt="" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/electric-pot.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" height="150" width="150" /></a>What I failed to notice was that she had placed her electric pot down on top of the burner. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a pot with a thick rubber bottom that plugs into the wall, so it can boil water on its own. In other words, I was supposed to plug the <i>pot</i> in, and <i>not</i> turn the burner on. What I did was sort of like putting burgers in a George Foreman grill, and then taking the Foreman and placing it into a big giant charcoal grill.</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds, it seemed, the apartment was engulfed in thick, toxic rubber smoke. I couldn’t breathe. Melted rubber dripped and oozed out everywhere, coating the portable stovetop. I ran over, coughing heaving, trying my best to stop cooking the electric pot any further. It was done. At the risk of sounding like I’m exaggerating, the apartment really was covered in smoke and it stunk to high hell. I have no idea what it would take to set off the fire alarm in this place; I practically had a reenactment of Waco, Texas going on and still that thing was dead silent.</p>
<p>When my girlfriend got home from work, she found her boyfriend back from his travels and her apartment in a state of chaos. Poison air filled the room, and her electric pot and stovetop were gone.</p>
<p>“Honey, I had a little accident,” I said. “I destroyed two of your appliances cooking noodles.”</p>
<p>I’d forgotten how beautiful she is. That’s what I was thinking as she looked around the place in awe, the same way I’d imagine a person looks at their body after a sex change operation. “What did you do?” she asked.</p>
<p>It felt great to be back. I’d learned so much from traveling, including how much I care about this girl. In the long run, <em>that</em> was important. Killing two nifty kitchen appliances and forgetting how to boil water was, really, just a minor price that needed to be paid.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://achievaholic.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_51152.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78" title="IMG_5115" alt="" src="http://achievaholic.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_51152.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" height="200" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The thing about the phrase &#8220;co-sleeping&#8221; is that it sounds purposeful. As though, The Husband and I at some point made a decision, or subscribed to a belief-system about parenting like &#8220;attachment parenting&#8221; that held true as a tenant that closeness at all times was valuable and should be pursued aggressively at the cost of sleep or sanity. The phrase suggests that we perhaps even had a discussion that went something like this:</p>
<p>me: I&#8217;ve been reading that distressed children have issues with brain development.</p>
<p>The Husband: And W seems awfully distressed when we try to put him in his crib, doesn&#8217;t he?</p>
<p>me: I&#8217;ve noticed the same thing! Do you think there is a way to prevent him from being damaged forever by this trauma?</p>
<p>The Husband: I know! Let&#8217;s keep him in our bed until he declares his readiness for detachment.</p>
<p>me: Agreed.</p>
<p>The truth is muddier. It&#8217;s more of a counter-narrative, really.</p>
<p>The truth is that there is something about the sincerity of toddler emotions that I wasn&#8217;t prepared for. I remember a time when I was trying to put him in his crib when he curled up his legs as though the mattress was lava and the screams emanating from his little lungs suggested the rails of the crib were in fact venomous snakes. The depth of his terror was so convincing, his screams could have been charted logarithmically with the x-axis being 1/(the distance toes were hovered over the mattress). And I bought it. I believed his fear was justified.  And frankly, the bars of the crib did evoke a sort of incarcerated-because-you-are-not-trustworthy feeling, even to me. He just likes bigger beds, I told myself. So, we transformed his crib to a toddler bed. Which is great, because now I have a spot for his stuffed animals.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m up at 5 am because he kicked me in the a face again. The severity of this injury doesn&#8217;t match the black-eye by head-butt that induced my friends to offer domestic violence interventions. But the truth is that most days I wake up convinced that The Husband signed us up for midnight midget wrestling and didn&#8217;t tell me, just as I&#8217;m being kicked or punched or even body slammed. And it does make me think sincerely that we need a plan. Forward. As Obama says. Forward.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities.</p>
<p>1. Some amazing Super-Nanny/Mary Poppins figure arrives at our door, sends us off for a nice adult dinner and has a serious talk with W about the importance of independence. Then lives with us for say, five years, until we are able to fully implement the plan.</p>
<p>2. W himself decides he needs more space.</p>
<p>Strike that. I can think of a third option. I can move to his bed.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&#8217;m up. So I think I&#8217;ll take advantage of it and make my from scratch cinnamon rolls. Yay.</p>
<p><strong>Sticky Cinnamon Rolls</strong></p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
<p>1 tsp sugar 2¼ tsp instant yeast (1 package)</p>
<p>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F)</p>
<p>½ cup milk ¼ cup heavy cream</p>
<p>¼ cup sugar</p>
<p>¼ cup unsalted butter</p>
<p>1 tsp salt</p>
<p>2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p>4 cups all purpose flour</p>
<p>¾ cup unsalted butter</p>
<p>¾ cup brown sugar, lightly packed x 2</p>
<p>2 tbsp cinnamon</p>
<p>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</p>
<p>pinch salt</p>
<p>9×13 inch baking dish, greased</p>
<p><em>Preparing Dough Directions</em></p>
<ol>
<li>In small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar. Set aside for 10 minutes, until creamy.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, warm milk and cream in small saucepan just until it bubbles, remove from heat; add in ¼ cup sugar, ¼ cup butter and salt, stirring until melted.</li>
<li>In large mixing bowl of standing mixer with paddle attachment in place, combine yeast mixture, milk mixture, and beaten eggs. Add 1½ cups of flour; mix well to combine.</li>
<li>Add in remaining 2½ cups of flour, ½ cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
<li>When dough clumps together, either  knead by hand on lightly floured board for roughly 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic; or switch mixer to the dough hook attachment if you have one and mix on a medium speed for 3 or 4 minutes until the dough is smooth, pliable and sticks on the dough hook.</li>
<li>Place dough in a lightly-oiled large bowl; turn it to coat with oil and cover with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, until doubled in volume.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Cinnamon Filling &amp; Toffee Topping Directions</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, melt ¾ cup butter in small saucepan over medium heat; stir in ¾ cup brown sugar, whisking to dissolve sugar completely.</li>
<li>Pour into prepared 9×13-inch baking dish.</li>
<li>Mix together remaining cinnamon and sugar.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Assembly Directions</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Place dough on a lightly floured board; roll into an 18×14-inch rectangle, ¼-inch thick.</li>
<li>Brush dough evenly with 2 tbsp melted butter, leaving  ½-inch bordrer unbuttered; sprinkle evenly with cinnamon-sugar mixture; using your rolling pin, gently roll over the cinnamon-sugar mixture, lightly pressing it into the dough.</li>
<li>Working at the long side of the dough rectangle, fold over only ½-inch of dough and pinch down.</li>
<li>Now begin rolling from one corner, along to the middle, to the opposite corner, and then work your way back.</li>
<li>When finished rolling, pinch the seam and brush with remaining 2 tbsp melted butter.</li>
<li>Cut roll into 16 pieces (either with a serrated knife).</li>
<li>Place rolls cut side down in prepared pan on top of toffee topping; cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in volume.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Baking Directions</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
<li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
<li>May be topped with cream cheese frosting.</li>
</ol>
