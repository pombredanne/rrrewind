			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld46.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld46.jpg?w=450&#038;h=374" alt="" title="seinfeld46" width="450" height="374" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1670" /></a></p>
<p>In my view,<strong> Seinfeld </strong>is the probably the funniest sitcom in the history of Television.</p>
<p><strong>Seinfeld</strong> aired on NBC from <strong>1990-1998</strong>.</p>
<p>The show was created by <strong>Jerry Seinfeld </strong>and <strong>Larry David</strong>. In the series, Seinfeld played a fictionalized version of himself, while the George Costanza character was modeled after many of Larry David&#8217;s &#8220;quirks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The show started out titled &#8220;The Seinfeld Chronicles&#8221;. It was later just shortened to &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld72.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld72.jpg?w=450&#038;h=463" alt="" title="seinfeld72" width="450" height="463" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1671" /></a></p>
<p>The show starred:</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Seinfeld &#8211; Jerry Seinfeld<br />
Jason Alexander &#8211; George Costanza<br />
Michael Richards &#8211; Cosmo Kramer<br />
Julia Louis-Dreyfus &#8211; Elaine Benes<br />
Wayne Knight &#8211; Newman</strong></p>
<p>The show did not even crack the Top-30 of the <strong>Nielsen Ratings </strong>until its 3rd season.</p>
<p>The Character of <strong>Newman</strong> did not appear until the 3rd season, yet as far as recurring characters, he appeared in the most episodes of the series.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/rs.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/rs.jpg?w=375&#038;h=450" alt="" title="rs" width="375" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1672" /></a></p>
<p>The show won <strong>10 Emmy Awards </strong>and had 68 Emmy Award nominations during its 9 years on the air.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Richards </strong>won <strong>3 Emmy Awards </strong>for his role as Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus </strong>won <strong>1 Emmy Award </strong>for her role as Elaine.</p>
<p>In the biggest crock of you-know-what in the history of the Emmy Awards, Jason Alexander never won an Emmy as George Costanza. What a joke! Simply put, George Costanza is one of the greatest sitcom characters in the history of Television and no one but Jason Alexander could have played him. Seinfeld ruled for years largely because of the George character. For Jason Alexander to never win an Emmy is just unbelievable! (He was nominated a bunch of times, he just never won&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/mg_georgethetimelessartofs.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/mg_georgethetimelessartofs.jpg?w=450&#038;h=300" alt="" title="mg_GeorgeTheTimelessArtOfS" width="450" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1673" /></a></p>
<p>The show won an <strong>Emmy Award for Best Comedy </strong>just one time. (What were those Emmy voters smoking?)</p>
<p>The show has had such an impact on American Culture that many of its familiar catch-phrases are now woven into our everyday lives&#8230;.</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Yada Yada Yada&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Shrinkage&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No Soup for You!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You Put the Balm On? Who told you to put the balm on?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Giddee-up&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sponge-Worthy&#8221;<br />

&#8220;The Sea was angry that day my friends&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna be a Pirate!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Boy! These Pretzels are making me thirsty!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Soup Nazi&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sorry&#8230;the correct answer was MOOPS&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I AM the Assman!&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>I could go on for hours listing the thousands more phrases that the show popularized over the years.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/fab4seinfeld.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/fab4seinfeld.jpg?w=450&#038;h=410" alt="" title="fab4seinfeld" width="450" height="410" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1674" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Seinfeld </strong>was the only cast member to appear in every episode.</p>
<p><strong>TV GUIDE </strong>voted the show the <strong>#1 series of All-Time</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Devito </strong>and <strong>Nathan Lane </strong>were among the many actors considered for the role of George Costanza.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/kramer.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/kramer.jpg?w=450&#038;h=666" alt="" title="kramer" width="450" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1675" /></a><br />
(I have a T-shirt of this painting)</p>
<p><strong>Tony Shalhoub </strong>and <strong>Larry Hankin </strong>were among those considered to play Kramer. Hankin later played the Kramer Character in the pilot that Jerry was shooting for NBC in the series. In that same pilot, <strong>Jeremy Piven </strong>(Entourage) played the George Character.</p>
<p>The Exterior shot of Jerry&#8217;s Apartment Building is actually a building in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/1125seinfeld.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/1125seinfeld.jpg?w=300&#038;h=394" alt="" title="1125seinfeld" width="300" height="394" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1676" /></a></p>
<p>The show was <strong>#1</strong> in the Nielsen Ratings during every week of its final season.</p>
<p>Among those that were considered for the role of Elaine were<strong> Rosie O&#8217;Donnell</strong>, <strong>Patricia Heaton</strong>, and <strong>Megan Mullally</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/puffyshirt.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/puffyshirt.jpg?w=400&#038;h=288" alt="" title="puffyshirt" width="400" height="288" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1680" /></a></p>
<p>The &#8220;Puffy-Shirt&#8221; from the &#8220;Puffy-Shirt&#8221; episode is on display in the <strong>Smithsonian</strong>.</p>
<p>Director <strong>Steven Spielberg </strong>said that while filming &#8220;<strong>Schindler&#8217;s List</strong>&#8221; he would get so depressed that he would pop in tapes of Seinfeld to cheer himself up.</p>
<p>The series finale in May of 1998 was one of the most-watched shows in TV History. It is also one of the most debated episodes the show ever had. Many fans hated the finale (me among them..) while others loved it. </p>
<p><a href="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld-cast-larry-david-ew.jpg"><img src="http://idiotflashback.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/seinfeld-cast-larry-david-ew.jpg?w=450&#038;h=600" alt="" title="seinfeld-cast-larry-david-ew" width="450" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1677" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Larry David </strong>sitcom <strong>&#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm</strong>&#8221; on HBO recently did a much better job of wrapping up Seinfeld. In that show, David convinces the Seinfeld cast to do a reunion show, which they all agree to do. In that show, it turns out that George had invented an Application for the IPHONE called a &#8220;<strong>IToilet</strong>&#8221; which would allow you to easily find the closest public restroom to your current location. (Great idea!) George makes Millions as a result of his invention. He was also married at the time. While going through a messy divorce, his wife ends up being awarded half of George&#8217;s Millions. No problem right? Wrong. It turns out that George had invested his half of the money with <strong>Bernie Madoff</strong>, the convicted Ponzi-scheme criminal, and George loses everything. Now&#8230;..that was a real ending!</p>
<p>I know this blog is supposedly about lost treasures of the 1970&#8242;s and 1980&#8242;s&#8230;.but <strong>Seinfeld</strong> is just too good to leave out! </p>
<p><strong>George Costanza </strong>was the self-professed &#8220;<strong>Lord of the Idiots</strong>&#8220;.  Out of reverence to George, and because I am also a proud Idiot, I have placed the word Idiot into almost every blog that I have ever created. I have had &#8220;<strong>Lord of the Idiots</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>The Idiot Speaketh</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Flashbacks of an Idiot</strong>&#8220;, and even &#8220;<strong>My Idiot Photos</strong>&#8220;. Like I said, I AM an Idiot, but my use of the term in all my blogs is totally in homage to my Idiot Idol&#8230;.<strong>George Costa</strong><strong>nza!</p>

Trips over shoes constantly, breaks anything he touches, should not be allowed around heavy machinery or anything that might put other&#8217;s lives in danger.</em> (from <a title="urban dictionary" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clutz" target="_blank">urban dictionary</a>)</p>
<p>I am a clutz. No doubt about it. From the time I was born I have been a clutz.  I could blame it on the fact that I grew to fast, I have big feet, I have depth-perception issues or on a whole host of issues. But the point is, if the floor is wet, I will fall.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I walked into a very nice resort with a beautiful slate floor. The problem is that it was raining.  I slipped and did the &#8220;running man&#8221; where you run forward, trying to catch yourself.  I caught myself, all right.  By running, face first, into a jagged rock wall.  I came to looking up at the resort manager asking me my name and if I knew where I was.  I said something about being there for a legal conference to which she responded, &#8220;You&#8217;re an attorney&#8221; and everyone around me (we were all there for the conference) said &#8220;Yes, we are all attorneys,&#8221; to which I swear she said, &#8220;Oh shit!&#8221;  One ambulance ride later I was in the ER where I found out that sadly, my nose was not broken.  I was hoping for some plastic surgery &#8211; never did like my nose. Unfortunately the doctor said it would go right back to the way it was in a few days when the swelling and black eyes faded.</p>
<p>Last night I thought the meeting started at 6:30.  Only after I had settled Bugaboo in the tub did I realize it started at 6:00 meaning that we were currently already 5 minutes late.  Toddlers don&#8217;t like being disrupted when they are in the middle of their favorite activity (bathing) and so he proceeded to throw a fit. You may recall that I have previously been taken out by Bugaboo throwing his plate of food on the floor.  Yes, that was me &#8211; the one who slipped on corn and dislocated my knee.  So this time, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be more careful. Nope &#8211; ran in the bathroom and WHOOSH!  Flat on my back on the pink tiled floor.  Today my behind provides a remarkable imprint of that tile pattern.  Luckily I escaped this time with minor bruising and a twisted ankle.  I&#8217;m not telling anyone though. I can just see the medical records&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Clutz strikes again.</p>
<p>So just call me Clumsy</p>
<p><a href="http://legallyinsanemommy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/mesmurf.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-335" title="mesmurf" src="http://legallyinsanemommy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/mesmurf.jpg?w=169&#038;h=147" alt="" width="169" height="147" /></a></p>
<p>If you are also Clumsy, let me offer this advice.  Enemies of the Clutzy include -</p>
<ul>
<li>High heeled shoes, wedges or flip-flops - you should avoid these type shoes at all costs.  Clutzes can&#8217;t just break a heel like normal people. No, your heel gets caught in the escalator while the rest of you continues moving. Your flipflop melts a bit and adheres to the hot tar of the pavement while you continue to walk. Wedges are just disastrous and not designed for those who lack balance.  Trust me.</li>
<li>Stairs, escalators and moving walkways &#8211; need I even explain why? </li>
<li>Wet surfaces &#8211; just avoid them at all costs.  I am currently working on obtaining a statement from my doctor which excuses me from mopping, bathing, washing my children or dogs, and doing laundry.  I do not do well around wet surfaces.  Perhaps it is because I like swimming so much that my behind desires to be in direct touch with the wet floor?  All I know is that clutzes need to turn and walk away (slowly and carefully) when they see the wet floor sign.</li>
<li>Round Objects &#8211; balls, beads or other round objects on the floor will inevitably end up underneath your feet.  &#8216;Nough said</li>
<li>Toddlers and pets &#8211; yes they will rush at your ankles and knees and yes, they will take you out.</li>
<li>Rushing &#8211; just when you think you have mastered the art of walking without falling, along comes a deadline.  Rushing is just a way of insuring disaster will come.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best product for a clutz</p>
<p><a href="http://legallyinsanemommy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/aflac.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-336" title="aflac" src="http://legallyinsanemommy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/aflac.jpg?w=200&#038;h=180" alt="" width="200" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Aflac &#8211; seriously.</p>
<p>Their accident policy is a blessing.  I collect on it every year (I shouldn&#8217;t brag about that probably).  It started when I fell down the stairs at my apartment 10 years ago, just 6 months after getting the policy.  Submitted the doctor&#8217;s bill for the diagnosed &#8220;Bruised buttocks &#8211; use hemoroid-like pillow for sitting&#8221; and collected $$.  Then there were the 2 car accidents (only 1 of which was my fault), followed by the run-in (literally) with the rock wall, described above.  Another fall down the stairs (this time they were not carpeted) and then the slip on corn incident.  Too bad my Aflac coverage ended with my last job.  Then again, I&#8217;m not sure they wouldn&#8217;t try to disqualify me based on my pre-existing condition as a diagnosed Clutz!</p>
<p>(are you a clutz? tell me your best story in the comment section)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Be authentic</em>. What does that even mean, anyway? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/fashion/for-only-the-authentic-cultural-studies.html">Not a whole hell of a lot</a>, according to Stephanie Rosenbloom in this Sunday&#8217;s New York Times. The word, she says, has been watered down to the point of meaninglessness, like so many white wine spritzers. Everyone from Anderson Cooper to Sarah Ferguson to Katie Couric to Michelle Bachmann to the Pope have claimed the descriptor, generally while in the service of selling themselves. (Sales. What&#8217;s more inauthentic than that?)</p>
<p>And, as Rosenbloom&#8217;s piece points out and as we&#8217;ve written before, we&#8217;re complicit in this faux-thenticity, too. Think about your <a href="http://undecidedthebook.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/facebook-face-off-doth-thou-protest-too-much/">Facebook profile</a>&#8211;and now imagine what it would look like if it were truly authentic. Take mine, for example: instead of that cute profile pic of me smiling broadly in New Orleans alongside a status update alluding to a highbrow day of writing, my pic might show me sitting at my computer, in the chair I&#8217;ve spent so much time in, I&#8217;ve literally worn the finish off of it. And if I were to be authentic about it, today&#8217;s status update&#8211;rather than being glamorous, pithy, or intelligent&#8211;might read: Unshowered. Writer&#8217;s block. Dining on a spoonful of peanut butter. Had I documented my status last night, I would have seemed the epitome of uncool, when my neighbor&#8217;s band practice inspired not my admiration of his creativity or his nascent musical skills, but a lengthy debate on whether or not to call the cops. (I didn&#8217;t. Score another one for inauthenticity. They were more terrible than they were loud&#8211;and they were window-rattlingly loud.)</p>
<p>Writing in the New York Times Magazine, Peggy Orenstein once <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/magazine/01wwln-lede-t.html">confessed</a> that, while spending some glorious time with her little girl listening to E.B. White reading <em>Trumpet of the Swan</em>, a nasty thought intruded: How will I tweet this? She admits that the tweet she decided on (“Listening to E.B. White’s <em>Trumpet of the Swan</em> with Daisy. Slow and sweet.”) was “not really about my own impressions. It was about how I imagined—and wanted—others to react to them.”</p>
<p>Marketing folks might say we’re branding ourselves in our profile pictures, our status updates, our tweets. <em>We</em> say that maybe we’re feeding <a href="http://undecidedthebook.wordpress.com/?s=iconic+self">the iconic self</a>, the self-image we’ve constructed, which, in ways big and small, is the face of our great expectations. (She’s kind of a tyrant, too.) So why do we do it? Are we so desperate for <a href="http://undecidedthebook.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/approve-this/">approval</a> that we&#8217;d rather pretend to be someone else than our, ahem, <em>authentic</em> self? Women, after all, are raised to be pleasers. Do we feel <a href="http://undecidedthebook.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/a-word-on-guilt/">guilty</a> about veering off the pre-approved path? Where did we become convinced that the faux is any more acceptable than the real? And why, oh why, do we so readily buy into the idea that the images everyone else is presenting are any more real than our own?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to embrace the idea that, a<a href="http://undecidedthebook.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/im-a-mess-youre-a-mess/">s Wavy Gravy&#8211;he of LSD and ice cream fame&#8211;put it</a>, we’re all just bozos on the bus, so we might as well sit back and enjoy the ride?</p>
<p>&#8230;which is well and good in theory, but who wants to admit to being a bozo? We have images to uphold! And whatever your role, the performance is remarkably similar. Someone asks how you’re doing; you say fine. You ask her; she says fine. Fine, then! We worry what other people think (though we’d never admit it), and, of course, we <em>want</em> to be happy, confident, competent, and successful. So we pretend we are. And, compounding the issue is the fact that the happy, confident, competent, successful self is the self everyone else shows to us, too, which compels us to keep our dirty little secret under even deeper wraps. If she (and she and she) has it together, what the hell is the matter with me??</p>
<p>It’s the open secret Rumi wrote about (and to which Elizabeth Lesser makes beautiful reference <a href="http://eomega.org/omega/faculty/viewProfile/aad2658b4a173589f57dd7f1b83e02a4/">here</a>), yet, centuries later, we still feel compelled to keep. And that’s understandable. Who wants to admit to being afraid, uncertain, overwhelmed, clumsy, neurotic, or prone to saying the wrong thing? The thing is, though, all of those things are part of the human condition–and those things and the good things aren’t mutually exclusive. And so why should claiming them be a negative? On the contrary: I think there’s a promise of something pretty awesome that comes when we’re able to own it all. The sky doesn’t fall, but, like the curtain hiding the Wizard of Oz, the blinders do.</p>
<p>And then what might we see? Well, for one thing, maybe a willingness to own our complex, dualistic, not always delightful but utterly human nature can make our choices a little bit clearer. With no one to impress, no images to uphold, we’ve got a lot less to factor in. There’s a freedom there. And power, too: because when we are willing to come out of the <em>I’m Fine!</em> closet, maybe our friends will join us. And that, I&#8217;d bet, would make for one hell of a party.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Greek philosopher <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/" target="_blank">Heraclitus</a> is credited with saying, &#8220;You could not step twice into the same river.&#8221; It&#8217;s an apt metaphor for the way that life is constantly changing, and it&#8217;s a phrase that often comes to mind when I set out in the canoe, whether tracing the familiar shoreline of my home river or paddling a challenging new route.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a simple fact when it comes to the dynamics of a river system — seemingly minor shifts in the local climate from year to year and changes in the weather from week to week can turn a placid stream into a furious force, and obscure the main landmarks, channels and routes that paddlers depend on to navigate safely. When it comes to travelling by water, no two journeys are ever quite the same.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn1945.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-64" title="Paddling the Bow-JK" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn1945.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Happy to be on the water again.</p></div>
<p>Such was the case last weekend, as I set out with my cousin and some of her friends to <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/activ28/c.aspx#sec3" target="_blank">paddle the Bow River from Banff to Canmore</a>. It&#8217;s a well-paddled route, popular with tourists and rafting companies, and considered a gentle drift with occasional patches of swift-moving water that could hardly be classified as rapids.</p>
<p>Or so I had been told, by too many locals to count — and ones who had themselves made many trips down the Bow. Having paddled a fair number of white water routes in Ontario, I felt comfortable navigating from the stern of our canoe, following the lead of one of the other guys, who had lived in the area until recently and had paddled this route many times. And, given that two of his other friends were floating along in a strange hybrid inflatable raft/sit-on-top kayak with oars, I assumed the river&#8217;s gentle reputation would hold up to experience.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2015.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-65" title="The raft-kayak" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2015.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The amazing raft-kayak-dinghy.</p></div>
<p>Never the same river twice, though.</p>
<p>As the morning progressed, it became obvious the water levels had dropped dramatically over the past few weeks, and some of the channels became less obvious, some of the rapids more challenging. At points, even those who said they knew the river seemed unsure of which direction to take. Still, most of the rapids were little more than swifts, and nothing a little cross-bow draw or quick eddy out couldn&#8217;t fix.</p>
<div id="attachment_66" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2009.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-66" title="LislontheBow" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2009.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cousin Lisl reaches out from the bow of the canoe.</p></div>
<p>That is, until we rounded a bend, having pulled ashore at a fork in the river to scout the best route, only to see the two friends who had paddled ahead — the one who knew the river, and his inexperienced friend — standing on the gnarled trunks of two downed trees straddling the shore, and waving frantically toward the far left channel.</p>
<p>We saw it at the same time as the current picked up and began pulling us inward — the crumpled hull of a yellow canoe splintered against a snarl of uprooted trees looming in the middle of the river. The water churned around both sides of the debris, the current sucking our canoe in closer to the wreckage, when we caught sight of a strip of red wrapped tight against the yellow. Suddenly we realized that the strip of red was all that was left of our friends&#8217; canoe, and we were being drawn straight toward the pileup.</p>
<div id="attachment_67" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-67" title="canoepileup" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2001.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canoe pileup on the Bow.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s strange in the re-telling, because these things happen almost instantly, a series of split-second decisions. I shouted for my cousin to paddle hard to get around the first downed tree. When instead our efforts only locked us into a collision course, she shoved her paddle into the mess of roots, pushing us back into the current while I pried hard against the rushing water to move us out of the path of the second tree and drowned canoes.</p>
<p>Within seconds it was over, and the sheepishness I&#8217;d felt at the start of the trip for packing a bag full of first aid supplies, warm clothing, extra food and water, and a canister of bear spray for a few hours&#8217; paddle disappeared. Along with the canoe, one of the guys had also been banged up, but the well-stocked first aid kit took care of that. His double-layered cotton T-shirts had gotten soaked, and since a glacier-fed river in September isn&#8217;t the ideal place for a swim, his entire body was shaking either with cold or shock or both. So with the saying &#8220;cotton kills&#8221; echoing in my head — thanks to all those lessons in how to avoid the potentially fatal impacts of stupidity or poor planning on high school camping trips — we quickly got him out of the wet clothes, wrapped in a towel, and into a warm fleece shirt.</p>
<div id="attachment_68" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2005.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-68" title="Post-crash" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2005.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Assessing the situation after the crash.</p></div>
<p>When the two boys in the inflatable raft/kayak rounded the bend and cleared the channel without impaling their own craft on the upturned trees, and when a closer inspection confirmed that the red canoe had been permanently transformed into a warning for future paddlers, we loaded the two stranded guys into our boat, instructed them to &#8220;ride princess, and don&#8217;t paddle,&#8221; and set off to finish the journey.</p>
<p>While the rest of the river was relatively calm, I can&#8217;t say my mind was, reeling with a fresh realization of the power of the river and the respect for nature that accompanies that understanding. It&#8217;s a feeling I&#8217;ve had many times paddling in whitewater — the knowledge that one false move, one shift of balance or one failed brace can lead to a swim or a scare or worse.</p>
<div id="attachment_69" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2010.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-69" title="shipwrecked" src="http://toliveinthewoods.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dscn2010.jpg?w=584&#038;h=778" alt="" width="584" height="778" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The shipwrecked paddlers cheerfully riding princess.</p></div>
<p>But there&#8217;s something both empowering and humbling about safely navigating rough waters, about learning to read the river and interpret its unique sign language, to know where the rocks lie, to understand the dynamics of the current and the changes that come with the turning of the seasons.</p>
<p>To me, any time spent in whitewater — with knees firmly planted against the walls of a canoe and hands firmly gripping the sure wood of the paddle — is time spent in a position of prayer: recognizing the indifferent power of the natural world and the fragility of human life, and honouring the deep yearning within the human spirit to connect with our environment — an eternal craving that drives some of us to study the ways of the river, to learn its language, and then to leave the safety of the shore and abandon ourselves to the flow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0858.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-670 alignleft" title="Whole Wheat Apple Cinnamon Scones" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0858.jpg?w=574&#038;h=381" alt="" width="574" height="381" /></a></div>
<div>Fall is upon us here in my part of the world. The days are becoming shorter, the leaves have started to turn, and there is an unmistakable chill in the air. While I hate to bid adieu to Summer, I can&#8217;t help but look forward to the changing of the seasons. Fall is my favorite time of year, without question. Fall is a beautiful season, with its stunning reds, oranges and yellows. If only it lasted longer than ten minutes, and wasn&#8217;t followed by&#8230;*shudder*&#8230;Winter.</div>
<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0837.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-671 alignleft" title="Whole Wheat Apple Cinnamon Scones" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0837.jpg?w=574&#038;h=396" alt="" width="574" height="396" /></a></div>
<div>Several nights ago, I had a wonderful visit with some lovely ladies, one of which mentioned that Fall has always signaled the beginning of a new year for her. And for many people, especially those in school, Fall is the start of a new year. New classes, new teachers, new school supplies, and new clothes (always my favorite part growing up). I have been out of school for a few years now, so it&#8217;s been a while since September brought with it any feelings of newness or change. This year feels a bit different though. Maybe it&#8217;s because my life is very different than it was last Fall, or maybe it&#8217;s because I hope that my life will be very different <em>next</em> Fall. It might also have something to do with the fact that I had my tea leaves, tarot cards, and palm read a few months ago. Now, before you go laughing at me, I went for kicks. I&#8217;m not sure I actually even believe in psychic abilities. But it certainly made for an interesting experience. I didn&#8217;t take much of what the psychic said to me to heart, except that a recurring theme in my tarot cards was the number 9. His interpretation of my cards was that the ninth month (September) would bring some major (and good) changes into my life.</div>
<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0845.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-672 alignleft" title="Whole Wheat Apple Cinnamon Scones" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0845.jpg?w=574&#038;h=381" alt="" width="574" height="381" /></a></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not holding my breath. I&#8217;m not the kind of person who lives their life <em>waiting</em> for things to happen. I prefer to make things happen. But it&#8217;s comforting to know that I might have some additional positive energy on my side this month.</div>
<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0851.jpg"><img title="Whole Wheat Apple Cinnamon Scones" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0851.jpg?w=574&#038;h=381" alt="" width="574" height="381" /></a></div>
<div>Fall also brings along delicious flavors. When I think of Fall, I smell cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie. I see colorful squash and cute little gourds. I taste warm soups and stews. I feel a cup of hot apple cider between my hands. I get a strong urge to walk through a corn maze and jump into a pile of just-raked leaves. I love what this season does to my senses.</div>
<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0337.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-674 alignleft" title="NY in Fall" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0337.jpg?w=574&#038;h=381" alt="" width="574" height="381" /></a></div>
<div><em>This photo was taken last Fall in Central Park in New York. It was the end of October, and the colors were finally starting to change. The trees in the park were so beautiful, and we spent such a wonderful afternoon there. Such great memories that I will hold dear forever. I won&#8217;t be making it back to NY this Fall, but I hope to get there one more time before my BFF and her husband return home next Spring. I did make a promise after all.</em></div>
<div><a href="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0853.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-675 alignleft" title="DSC_0853" src="http://onceuponarecipe.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0853.jpg?w=574&#038;h=381" alt="" width="574" height="381" /></a></div>
<div>This weekend marks the last few days of my summer vacation &#8211; the two weeks I took off from work. My &#8220;stay-cation&#8221; as I called it. I&#8217;ve spent most of my days out in the sunshine, reading good books, taking Miss Bella on long walks or to the dog park, enjoying visits with friends, and soaking up the warmth of Summer. But the last few days were cool, grey, and drizzly. So, yesterday morning I decided to bake, and I wanted something that would smell and taste like Fall. Enter these tempting little scones. I could barely wait for them to cool enough to eat after they came out of the oven &#8211; they smelled so enticing with their notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. I scarfed down the first scone, and properly enjoyed the second. I barely restrained myself from having a third.</div>
</p>
<div>
<p>Summer is taunting us again, with warm temperatures expected this long weekend. Mother Nature is a bit bipolar, at least here in Alberta. But I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; I can be patient for Fall, especially if it means a few more hot sunny days. Regardless&#8230;whether you love Fall or hate it, I can guarantee that you will enjoy these scones. And they&#8217;re made with whole wheat flour, so they&#8217;re practically a health food.</p></div>

<div><strong>Whole Wheat Apple Cinnamon Scones</strong> (adapted from Cooking Light magazine, Nov. 2006)</div>
</p>
<div>1 cup plus 2 TBSP. all-purpose flour</div>
<div>1 cup whole wheat flour</div>
<div>1/4 cup sugar</div>
<div>2 tsp. baking powder</div>
<div>1 tsp. cinnamon</div>
<div>1/2 tsp. baking soda</div>
<div>Pinch of salt</div>
<div>Dash of ground nutmeg</div>
<div>1/4 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces</div>
<div>1 medium Granny Smith apple, grated (about 1 cup)</div>
<div>1/2 cup buttermilk</div>
<div>1 tsp. vanilla</div>
<div>Topping:</div>
<div>2 TBSP. buttermilk</div>
<div>1 TBSP. sugar</div>
<div>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</div>
</p>
<div>Preheat your oven to 425°F. In a large bowl, combine the flours, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. Whisk together until well mixed. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the apple, 1/2 cup buttermilk, and vanilla, stirring just until moist (dough will be sticky).</div>
</p>
<div>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead lightly with floured hands. Shape the dough into a circle about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut into 8 wedges. Place on a lined or greased cookie sheet. Brush the tops of the wedges with 2 TBSP. buttermilk. Combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon together, and sprinkle evenly overtop of each wedge. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had one specific outing request during our vacation to Newport, and that was to visit the Aquarium. I have lived in Portland for about 8 years now and, almost everyday, have been forced to look at billboards advertising the <a href="http://aquarium.org/">Oregon Coast Aquarium</a>. It took eight years, but the advertising bombardment finally won me over and I can now happily say &#8220;been there, done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really though, it was a fun day. While this Aquarium was not the most spectacular one I&#8217;ve visited, (so far, the <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/home">Melbourne Aquarium</a> wins that prize, even if their website is a visual assault) our big group of 5 adults and three kids were completely satisfied with the variety of sea life that we were able to see and, in some cases, even touch. Of course I took enough pictures to make a book&#8230;</p>
<p>These two were too cute. My mum bought that backpack over for Karin and it barely left her back the entire time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XqQdnNeD3Cs/TmVKm7g0LII/AAAAAAAAh3o/qil2avk-2zc/s640/IMG_3775.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-D5Zy04cASNI/TmVKpVjmVYI/AAAAAAAAh3w/zEuF-qlPg1w/s640/IMG_3776.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="640" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you how long I waited to get the following picture. Not sure if it was worth it&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uRzY-4gxhZY/TmVKtFiqJfI/AAAAAAAAh34/v0G1gX1Loig/s640/IMG_3789.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>This where we were able to touch the animals. Of course my children were a little hesitant while Karin almost jumped right in.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone alignleft" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KoM-t_IxCoc/TmVK1orbukI/AAAAAAAAh4Q/C21UwnWFMU0/s640/IMG_3795.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="435" /> <img class="alignnone alignleft" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ErY75W3nwMI/TmVKwhDGi2I/AAAAAAAAh4A/IpxIqwe6-8c/s640/IMG_3790.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="435" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nMSWJNflHAs/TmVK8yN29oI/AAAAAAAAh4o/UqqBfnsIv_Q/s640/IMG_3801.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>A favourite.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XDoivAElXug/TmVK-Bg_K2I/AAAAAAAAh4w/qu1tZAX1ctw/s640/IMG_3816.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>And, of course, despite the many amazing things that we were surrounded by, it was the playhouse by the bathrooms that they were most excited about.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s8tyZPxeZlc/TmVLDCrHk_I/AAAAAAAAh5A/Sbs4fkRpOww/s640/IMG_3820.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-03NsCeXqFYM/TmVLKaLvsxI/AAAAAAAAh5Q/Bw22AsqMDmA/s640/IMG_3839.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gVZTZVlf_hg/TmVLN7p3ClI/AAAAAAAAh5Y/414dLFxvl2U/s640/IMG_3846.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9LnaKSbJ5ow/TmVLRCWP3OI/AAAAAAAAh5g/MPxz3vxR_ko/s640/IMG_3853.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zrIjfa9o8Xs/TmVLUs4v2KI/AAAAAAAAh5o/BFQaW8vg1vw/s640/IMG_3854.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>The first time I&#8217;ve ever seen a puffin in real life and this one came within inches as it crossed from one pool to another. Incredibly cute.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LFpyAmTHFuk/TmVLgM-d9nI/AAAAAAAAh6I/9q9y-p9hrQA/s640/IMG_3867.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a3n6KobCc_s/TmVLpst9P5I/AAAAAAAAh6g/taYGI-FA87A/s640/IMG_3884.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mlm7S_I9JV8/TmVLt0A8rAI/AAAAAAAAh6o/eXB_T7Swr5g/s640/IMG_3891.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>

<p>I won&#8217;t mention how long I waited to take this one either. Let me just say that uncooperative sting rays and glass glare make for a difficult photo subject.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dANS4Y0i4HM/TmVL2uFpdEI/AAAAAAAAh64/WQfXYsmAxLM/s640/IMG_3902.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rF4NLLE_ARc/TmVL5Z1iBLI/AAAAAAAAh7A/1d3zfGlJm1o/s640/IMG_3908.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>For some reason this next one cracks me up. I think it might be Thomas&#8217; rock and roll pose. (Note: by some miracle, we managed to leave the two stuffed sharks in the store and escape with just a souvenir penny for each child).</p>

<p>Had just enough time for a quick ride on a porpoise before we came dangerously close to a full overtired meltdown &#8211; both kids and parents.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Silly me. I thought flying on 9/11 would be easy. I figured most people would choose not to fly that day so lines would be short, planes would be lightly filled and though security might be ratcheted up, we&#8217;d all feel safer knowing we had come a long way since that dreadful Tuesday morning 10 years ago.</p>
<p>But then armed officers stormed my plane, threw me in handcuffs and locked me up.</p>
<p>My flight from Denver landed in Detroit on time. I sent a text message to my husband to let him know we had landed and I would be home by dinner. The plane stopped on the tarmac, seemingly waiting to have the gate cleared. We waited. I played on my phone, checking Facebook, scrolling through my Twitter feed. After a while of sitting there, I decided to call my husband to tell him the plane was being delayed and I would call him when I got off the plane.</p>
<p>Just as I hung up the phone, the captain came over the loudspeaker and announced that the airport authorities wanted to move the airplane to a different part of the airport. Must be a blocked gate or something, I thought. But then he said: Everyone remain in your seats or there will be consequences. Sounded serious. I looked out the window and saw a squadron of police cars following the plane, lights flashing. I turned to my neighbor, who happened to be an Indian man, in wonderment. What is going on? Others on the plane were remarking at the police as well. Getting a little uneasy, I decided the best thing for me to do was to tweet about the experience. If the plane was going to blow up, at least there&#8217;d be some record on my part.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stuck on a plane at Detroit airport&#8230;cops everywhere</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon the plane was stopping in some remote part of the airport, far from any buildings, and out the window I see more police cars coming to surround the plane. Maybe there&#8217;s a fugitive on the plane, I say to my neighbor, who is also texting and now shooting some photos of the scene outside. He asks me to take a few, as I have a better angle from my window seat. A few dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers are huddled off the side of the plane. I don&#8217;t see any guns, and it isn&#8217;t clear what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>So I continued to tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>A little concerned about this situation. Plane moved away from terminal surrounded by cops. Crew is mum. Passengers can&#8217;t get up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then what looked like the bomb squad pulled up. Two police vans and a police communication center bus parked off the road. I started to get nervous and rethink my decision to fly on 9/11.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cops in uniform and plainclothes in a huddle in rear of plane.</p></blockquote>
<p>We had been waiting on the plane for a half hour. I had to pee. I wanted to get home and see my family. And I wanted someone to tell us what was going on. In the distance, a van with stairs came closer. I sighed with relief, thinking we were going to get off the plane and get shuttled back to the terminal. I would still be able to make it home for dinner. Others on the plane also seemed happy to see those stairs coming our way.</p>
<blockquote><p>I see stairs coming our way&#8230;yay!</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I knew it, about 10 cops, some in what looked like military fatigues, were running toward the plane carrying the biggest machine guns I have ever seen&#8211;bigger than what the guards carry at French train stations.</p>
<p>My last tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Majorly armed cops coming aboard</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us, heads down. The cops ran down the aisle, stopped at my row and yelled at the three of us to get up. &#8220;Can I bring my phone?&#8221; I asked, of course. What a cliffhanger for my Twitter followers! No, one of the cops said, grabbing my arm a little harder than I would have liked. He slapped metal cuffs on my wrists and pushed me off the plane. The three of us, two Indian men living in the Detroit metro area, and me, a half-Arab, half-Jewish housewife living in suburban Ohio, were being detained.</p>
<p>The cops brought us to a parked squad car next to the plane, had us spread  our legs and arms. Mine asked me if I was wearing any explosives. &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, holding my tongue to not let out a snarky response. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I could and could not say, and all that came out was &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>No one would answer me. They  put me in the back of the car. It&#8217;s a plastic seat, for all you out there who have never been tossed into the back of a police car. It&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s hot, and it&#8217;s humiliating. The Indian man who had sat next to me on the plane was already in the backseat. I turned to him, shocked, and asked him if he knew what was going on. I asked him if he knew the other man that had been in our row, and he said he had just met him. I said, it&#8217;s because of what we look like. They&#8217;re doing this because of what we look like. And I couldn&#8217;t believe that I was being arrested and taken away.</p>
<p>When the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/usa-patriot-act" target="_blank">Patriot Act</a> was passed after 9/11 and Arabs and Arab-looking people were being harassed all over the country, my Saudi Arabian dad became nervous. A bit of a conspiracy theorist at heart, he knew the government was watching him and at any time could come and take him away. It was happening all over. <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/muslim,-arab,-south-asian-men-rounded-post-9/11-based-racial,-religious-prof">Men were being taken on suspicion of terrorist activities</a> and <a href="http://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/node/844" target="_blank">held</a> and questioned&#8211;sometimes abused&#8211;for long periods of time. Our country had a civil rights issue on its hands. And, in the name of patriotism we lost a lot of our liberty, especially those who look like me.</p>
<p>I never had any run-ins with the law. Since 9/11, though I felt a heightened sense of how my appearance would affect my travel plans, I never had any concrete reason to think I would be targeted. I passed through security without excessive searching (except that one time they thought they saw a pocket knife in my husband&#8217;s backpack, which they couldn&#8217;t find anyway even though it was there). Because I am my father&#8217;s daughter I am aware of the possibility of anti-Arab and anti-Semitic sentiments that have increased dramatically, but luckily  no members of my family nor myself have had to endure what so many others have gone through in this country and throughout the world. As Americans we are scared and horrified by acts of terror. But I am not sure that what we are doing to dissuade and protect are working.</p>
<p>We arrived at an offsite building and remained in the squad car for a few minutes. The Indian man was taken out of the car first, and an officer stood at the door to make sure I didn&#8217;t go anywhere. I asked him several times what was going on and he wouldn&#8217;t answer me. It was like I was invisible. I felt so helpless and shocked. I was being treated like a criminal.</p>
<p>Then it was my turn. I got out of the car and was led, still cuffed, to a cell. &#8220;Are you serious?&#8221; I asked the officer, and he said yes. The heavy metal door was shut and locked behind me. Again, I asked what was going on and why was I here. Finally he said, they will let you know later. They are going to ask you some questions.</p>
<p>I sat down on the metal cot that hung off the wall. It had a thin, green vinyl mattress&#8211;mattress is a generous term&#8211;that offered no comfort. It was about a 6-by-10 cell, the concrete walls were painted a light yellow but were streaked with black dirt. The floor was some sort of stainless steel, and a stainless steel toilet that has probably never seen the good side of a scrubbing brush, instructed me to keep holding my stretched bladder as long as I could. Near the ceiling above the toilet there was a video camera.</p>
<p>A plainclothes officer stood came to my door and asked me if I spoke English. Something in me snapped at that question. Of course I spoke English I&#8217;m an American citizen, you asshole! Well, I left the expletive out. &#8220;Ok,&#8221; he said and stood watch outside my door saying he wanted to make sure I didn&#8217;t &#8220;flush anything.&#8221; He also wouldn&#8217;t tell me what was going on.</p>
<p>As I sat and waited, quietly contemplating my situation, the other Indian man was getting questioned in the main room outside. I couldn&#8217;t see what was going on, but I could hear a bit. They asked him where he was from, did he have any family, where were his shoes. He talked quietly and agreeably. I wondered if he was as incensed as I was or if he had entered this country expecting harassment from the American authorities.</p>
<p>They took him to another room, and I heard an officer tell him to remove his clothes. He was going to be searched. I could not fully grasp what was happening. I stared at the yellow walls and listened to a few officers talk about the overtime they were racking up, and I decided that I hated country music. I hated speedboats and shitty beer in coozies and fat bellies and rednecks. I thought about <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/abu_ghraib/index.html" target="_blank">Abu Ghraib</a> and the horror to which those prisoners were exposed. I thought about my dad and his prescience.  I was glad he wasn&#8217;t alive to know about what was happening to me. I thought about my kids, and what would have happened if they had been there when I got taken away. I contemplated never flying again. I thought about the incredible waste of taxpayer dollars in conducting an operation like this. I wondered what my rights were, if I had any at all. Mostly, I could not believe I was sitting in some jail cell in some cold, undisclosed building surrounded by &#8220;the authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard the officers discuss my impending strip search. They needed to bring in a female officer. At least they were following protocol, or something to that nature. Still, could this really be happening?</p>
<p>Eventually a female uniformed officer came in. She looked like a fat Jada Pinkett Smith, and in a kind but firm voice explained what was going to happen. I was to stand, face the wall in a position so the camera above the toilet couldn&#8217;t see, and take off my clothes. I complied. She commented on my tattoo, saying, &#8220;Oh you have one of those things&#8211;good and evil, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yin and yang. Balance,&#8221; I said, grabbing my clothes to redress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand why we have to do this, right? It&#8217;s for our own protection,&#8221; she told me.</p>
<p>Because I am so violent. And pulling me off an airplane, handcuffing me and patting me down against a squad car didn&#8217;t offer enough protection. They also needed to make sure all my orifices were free and clear.</p>
<p>She apologized for having to do the strip search, and I asked her to tell me what was going on. She said she didn&#8217;t know but someone would come and talk to me. She put my handcuffs back on and left. The other officer stood guard outside. I told him I needed to call my husband. He said I could use the phone later.</p>
<p>As I sat in my cell trying not to think about my full bladder, they brought another man in. I wondered if he had been on the plane as well. Were they going to bring everyone in or had they just singled us out? He spoke belligerently, and I couldn&#8217;t understand much of what he was saying. But I did hear two officers talking about the man who stole a $3,000 watch at the security checkpoint. Now there&#8217;s a real crime. What was <em>I</em> doing here?</p>
<p>I had no idea how much time had passed. It was about 4:00 when I sent my last tweet on the plane. I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was day or night. I was tired, confused, angry and bored. I wanted my phone. I wanted to call my husband so he could come to Detroit and rescue me. I wanted to update my status so my friends weren&#8217;t freaking out. Did I also want a lawyer?</p>
<p>Another female officer, this one in jeans and a t-shirt came to visit me. She introduced herself as an agent&#8211;Homeland Security. She removed my handcuffs and had me follow her to a different room down a long hall and through a few doors. As we walked, I got a glimpse of the watch-stealer, a chubby middle-aged white guy with a buzz cut. He didn&#8217;t look too different from some of the officers.</p>
<p>She led me to a small, white room where a man who introduced himself as an FBI agent was waiting for me. I sat on one of three chairs at a small metal table, and the female agent sat across from me. They both offered me their badges for inspection, not that I would have known the difference, but they were calm and not pushy. I appreciated that. The male agent proceeded to ask me a series of questions about where I had been, where I was going, about my family, if I had noticed any suspicious behavior on the plane. The other agent took notes while I talked. They asked if I knew the two men sitting next to me, and if I noticed them getting up during the flight or doing anything I would consider suspicious.</p>
<p>I told them no, and couldn&#8217;t remember how many times the men had gotten up, though I was sure they had both gone to the bathroom in succession at some point during the flight.</p>
<p>They had done some background check on me already because they knew I had been to Venezuela in 2001. They asked about my brother and sister and asked about my foreign travel. They asked what I did during the flight. I told them I didn&#8217;t get up at all, read, slept and played on my phone (in airplane mode, don&#8217;t worry). They asked about my education and wanted my address, Social Security, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much my whole life story.</p>
<p>Again, I asked what was going on, and the man said judging from their line of questioning that I could probably guess, but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity. What is the likelihood that two Indian men who didn&#8217;t know each other and a dark-skinned woman of Arab/Jewish heritage would be on the same flight from Denver to Detroit? Was that suspicion enough? Even considering that we didn&#8217;t say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane? Perhaps it was two Indian man going to the bathroom in succession?</p>
<p>He warned me that the last time an incident like this happened back in December, they had to interview everyone on the plane and no one got to go home for six hours. It was going to be a long haul.</p>
<p>They asked me if I wanted to add anything that they hadn&#8217;t asked. I said no. Then they asked if I needed anything. I said I needed a real bathroom, and the female officer, saying she didn&#8217;t blame me, offered to take me to the officers&#8217; bathroom. I must have peed straight for five minutes.</p>
<p>She walked me back to my cell, telling me it was for my own protection as they had brought in the rest of the passengers for questioning. They would fetch my stuff from the plane and allow me to call my husband. My cell had been occupied by the Indian man I had sat next to on the plane and in the squad car. So I waited for them to move him to the second cell that was holding the watch stealer. As I passed by the small window in that room I could see the watch stealer splayed out on the cot. He appeared to be asleep. I wondered where the Indian man would sit.</p>
<p>After fingerprinting me and asking me about my height/weight/place and date of birth and so on, a middle-aged white cop with a beer belly and a flat top returned me&#8211;without handcuffs&#8211;to the cell. I waited, wondering if I would be spending the night locked up. I thought about the last words my husband said to me while I was still on the plane waiting on the tarmac, &#8220;They must have found out there was a Hebshi on the plane.&#8221; We joke about this at times, that because of my ethnicity I am being scrutinized but I had no intention of putting that out to the universe and making it happen.</p>
<p>I thought about Malcom X and how bravely and fastidiously he studied and wrote while he was in prison, how his solitude enabled him to transform his anger into social change and personal betterment. That&#8217;s when I decided to write this post. I needed to explain what had happened&#8211;was happening&#8211;to me. I was not going to be silent. Still, I wondered what my rights were, and though I felt violated and scared I wasn&#8217;t sure that our new laws protected me from this treatment.</p>
<p>The female agent returned to my cell with my cell phone. She wanted me to show her my tweets&#8211;that were simultaneously posted onto Facebook&#8211;I had composed while on the plane. She joked that she didn&#8217;t even have a Facebook account. She left for a few minutes then returned and allowed me to call my husband. She said I would be released in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The sound of his voice brought me to tears, but I tried to remain calm. I gave him a one-minute recap of my situation, which only left him confused. I told him I would call him when I got to my car, which was parked in an airport lot.</p>
<p>I hung up the phone and followed the officer out of the cell and into another small room where the male FBI agent was waiting accompanied by another FBI agent&#8211;possibly the head honcho on duty. He said the three of us were being released and there was nothing suspicious found on the plane. He apologized for what had happened and thanked me for understanding and cooperating. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s 9/11 and people are seeing ghosts. They are seeing things that aren&#8217;t there.&#8221; He said they had to act on a report of suspicious behavior, and this is what the reaction looks like.</p>
<p>He said there had been 50 other similar incidents across the country that day.</p>
<p>I was led out another door and down a long hall where I gathered my bags, which had been removed from the plane and searched. In the hallway I saw the other two men who had also been detained. They seemed happy to be being released as well. It felt strange to smile at them, and I didn&#8217;t know what to say, so I said nothing.</p>
<p>We walked outside of the building, and for the first time I saw that we were at the airport police station, which also doubled as the spot for the local Homeland Security office to reside&#8211;an office that didn&#8217;t exist 10 years ago. It was starting to get dark. But I still didn&#8217;t know what time it was.</p>
<p>Another officer drove me to my car in the airport parking lot. As he plopped into the drivers seat and me into the passenger&#8217;s seat of the unmarked sedan, he apologized for not having air conditioning, but being a descendant of desert people I obviously didn&#8217;t mind the heat. He asked me if I was OK to drive back to my home in Ohio, and I said I was, though I wasn&#8217;t sure I was. I wasn&#8217;t sure how this would affect me. I am still not sure.</p>
<p>All I know, is I probably won&#8217;t be flying again on Sept. 11.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of <em>my</em> events on Sept. 11, 2011, I feel violated, humiliated and sure that I was taken from the plane simply because of my appearance. Though I never left my seat, spoke to anyone on the flight or tinkered with any &#8220;suspicious&#8221; device, I was forced into a situation where I was stripped of my freedom and liberty that so many of my fellow Americans purport are the foundations of this country and should be protected at any cost.</p>
<p>I believe in national security, but I also believe in peace and justice. I believe in tolerance, acceptance and trying&#8211;as hard as it sometimes may be&#8211;not to judge a person by the color of their skin or the way they dress. I admit to have fallen to the traps of convention and have made judgments about people that are unfounded. We live in a complicated world that, to me, seems to have reached a breaking point. The real test will be if we decide to break free from our fears and hatred and truly try to be good people who practice compassion&#8211;even toward those who hate.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate to have friends and family members who are sick over what happened to me. I share their disgust. But there was someone on that plane who felt threatened enough to alert the authorities. This country has operated for the last 10 years through fear. We&#8217;ve been a country at war and going bankrupt for much of this time. What is the next step?</p>
