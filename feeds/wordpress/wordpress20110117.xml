<p>Today we celebrate the life &amp; legacy of <strong>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-52187"></span></p>
<p>At age 35, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>On August 28,1963 from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his 17 minute public speech in which he called for racial equality to an end to discrimination.</p>
<p>On April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The transmission went out on my car yesterday (which is partly to blame for the lack of post here yesterday). The car broke down at 7:45am, just as I was leaving physical therapy, and after much ballyhoo I finally got to over work seven hours later, at 3:00pm. Long, long day. But all of that waiting and driving around gave me a lot of time to think and during that time I decided I need to set some guidelines to help me become a better presentation designer this year. It occurs to me that these ideas could be adapted a bit to help anyone become better at what they do. So ask yourself as you read this if any of these ideas might be adapted to whatever it is you hope to become better at.</p>
<h2>Give More Speeches</h2>
<p>I joined Toastmasters a few years ago as a way to keep my public speaking skills fresh, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed the consistency of having to give a new presentation every couple weeks. However, after a while anything can become rote and I find myself phoning it in, not really putting in the effort I should. This is my fault more than it is Toastmasters, but I&#8217;ve decided I need to find other, more formal ways of giving speeches that have more riding on them. In addition to my weekly TM meetings, I&#8217;m going to try to find ways to give free public lectures, teach classes, and maybe post some videos of myself here on the blog. The idea is that by going through the process of preparing for and delivering more presentations my skills will improve more quickly.</p>
<h2>Post More Of My Work Publicly</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been designing presentations for a few years now but the majority of my work has been for the company I work for and its clients. The experience has been very beneficial to me in terms of learning how to be a designer, but since most of the work is proprietary I don&#8217;t have permission to post the slides I create for public viewing. When I recently attempted to put together an online portfolio, I suddenly became aware of just how little material I had that I was allowed to share. So in the next few months I plan to create a few presentations as show pieces, and to complete some work from clients who will agree to allow me to display the slides I create for them. I want to do this mainly to be able to show potential clients what kind of products they can expect me to produce, and to get feedback from the general public about what works and what I could be doing better.</p>
<h2>Meet More Presenters/Presentation Designers in Person</h2>
<p>Twitter is interesting in that it gives you the opportunity to develop something similar to a relationship with people all over the world. But despite these online interactions, it&#8217;s still nothing close to the feeling you have after having met someone face to face. Although I&#8217;ve been connecting with bloggers and presentation designers online for years now, I&#8217;ve met very few of them in person. I want to make an effort to meet more of them in person in order to see what kind of culture exists in the presentation world and to develop friendships that go beyond what cordial online interactions can offer. My company has agreed to send me to <a title="Hook Conference" href="http://presentationconference.com/" target="_blank">Hook Conference</a> in March which will I hope be a big, first step toward achieving this goal. (Are you going to Hook? I&#8217;d love to say &#8216;hello&#8217;.)</p>
<h2>Read (At Least) One Design Book Per Month</h2>
<p>I have a degree in liberal studies which is like getting four minors (mine were in Communications, English Literature, Great Books, and Biblical Studies). I don&#8217;t have any formal design training, so in that respect I&#8217;m completely self-taught. In the past few years I have read dozens of design books, and have purchased even more, but I find it easy to leave them on the shelf unread unless I make a conscious effort not to. My goal for this year is going to be to complete at least one design-related book every month, in addition to my more typical recreational reading. I&#8217;ve come a long way in this area, but I&#8217;ve got a long way to go and realize that I&#8217;ll probably never know as much as I could. I&#8217;m always looking for more to add to my list, by the way. Can you recommend any that I shouldn&#8217;t miss?</p>
<h2>Create Something Daily</h2>
<p>This last point is something that sounds easy but has turned out to be quite difficult. Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been trying to write a new blog post every weekday. It&#8217;s been quite a challenge and I&#8217;ve missed a day here or there, but I&#8217;ve found that just going through the process of sitting down to write everyday has helped my writing skills improve significantly. I may or may not share what I create, but I hope that just doing some kind of creative work everyday will be like exercise for my design muscles.</p>
<p>What do you think? Do any of these sound good to you? Could your painting or photography or knitting or cooking benefit from some of the same commitments (with slight changes, of course)? If so, I hope you&#8217;ll share which ones you want to commit to, too, in the comments below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a great book recently called &#8220;<a title="World Cafe Book" href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/book.htm" target="_blank">The World Cafe; Shaping The Future Through Conversations That Matter</a>&#8221; (by Brown and Isaacs). It&#8217;s all about a new form of dialogue that allows people to access a group&#8217;s collective intelligence, and was a fascinating read. If it all sounds a bit woolly, the principles are all heavily grounded in research and case studies, and I plan to try the approach out soon, and will let you know how I get on.</p>
<div id="attachment_401" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 235px"><img class="size-full wp-image-401" title="Andrew smiled over a cappuccino at the World Cafe, safe in the knowledge he was absolutely, hundred percent, right" src="http://intelligentchallenge.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/1287009_coffee_smile.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Andrew smiled at the World Cafe, safe in the knowledge he was absolutely, hundred percent, right</p></div>
<p>Anyway, one of the points that really made me stop and think was a passage around people fighting to prove they are right, and in particular pointing out that you may well win the argument, but in doing so, what has been the cost?</p>
<p>This seemed to resonate with me in my capacity as (former!) lawyer. It might be a stereotype, but lord knows lawyers do like to prove themselves right. Maybe it&#8217;s the type of people who are attracted to the law, maybe it&#8217;s the training and experiences that lawyers have, but if you put five lawyers in a room, I bet at least two of the five would argue black was white if the other three had already asserted that white was, in fact, white.</p>
<p>I started to think about this from two different angles. Firstly, developing the ideas in the book around the impact on relationships and individuals resulting from a dogmatic and &#8220;robust&#8221; approach to an argument. How many people have notionally &#8220;lost&#8221; an argument, and then (a) sat and simmered, wishing ill on the victor; and (b) not been convinced that they were in fact wrong anyway?</p>
<p>Given the turbulent nature of the legal market today, there are of course an increasing number of challenges that law firms and lawyers face, and if many of these end up in arguments and disagreements, what does this do to the web of relationships that underpins the organisation (which are of course critical in a knowledge-based organisation), as well as the morale and energy of those working there?</p>
<p>Often when a person expresses a point of view, if it is attacked, they will dig their heels in and defend their position more passionately, rather than take on board an alternative perspective.</p>
<p>Many of the classic negotiating texts (like &#8220;<a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" class="zem_slink" title="Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0140157352">Getting to Yes</a>&#8220;) are based on ways round this problem, and there is a heap of  research from the psychology of influence that can help explain this (<a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" title="Influence, science and practice" href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Practice-Robert-B-Cialdini/dp/0205609996" target="_blank">Cialdini</a> is one of my favourite authors here) &#8211; in essence society likes people to behave predictably. As a result many countries encourage people to behave consistently, and consequently once a point of view is stated, people will fight to defend it (and appear consistent) rather than change their mind.</p>
<p>This brings me on to my second stream of consciousness, which is based on a lot of Edward De Bono&#8217;s work around how people think in Western society. He aims a lot of criticism around our preference for &#8220;socratic argument&#8221;, where a selection between two competing ideas is made through knocking down the opposing viewpoint, rather than constructively exploring the issue and looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>In a law firm, where colleagues are often competing for resources, would it be possible to examine these challenges more collaboratively, or is that niave?</p>
<p>What if the disagreement is with a client? Or another team? Is the issue resolved with one party &#8220;right&#8221; and the other &#8220;wrong&#8221;? The dynamic is undoubtedly different from being across a negotiating table, but often the behaviour is very similar, and not everyone is a collaborative negotiator.</p>
<p>When working as an in-house counsel, when problems arose I was much less interested in pointing fingers, and more interested in sorting out the consequences quickly and effectively, working out how the problem arose (the framework in the book &#8220;<a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" class="zem_slink" title="Difficult Conversations" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Douglas-Stone/dp/0553456121%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0553456121">Difficult Conversations</a>&#8221; calls this assessing &#8220;contribution&#8221;) and then making sure we (collectively) avoided a re-run. I found this productive, and the external counsel took a similar problem-solving approach to drive a deeper relationship and more effective service delivery. I don&#8217;t pretend it was perfect, but I do believe it was an improvement on the blame game, even though I didn&#8217;t get as many opportunities to demonstrate I was right (which of course I was!).</p>
<p>I hope that has provoked some thinking and would be interested in any comments you may have. Please note however, that if you express a different opinion to me, you will be wrong and I will be right&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.mozartforum.com/images/Autograph_String_Quartet_in_Bflat_K589.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="389" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/arts/music/16string.html?pagewanted=all">A recent <em>New York Times</em> story</a> looks at the efforts of the Borromeo String Quartet* to incorporate more technology into their music making, including playing from full scores displayed on MacBooks controlled by foot pedals. One thing that I thought was really interesting, and was a good example of the give and take that comes with any changes in tradition or practice, was this little discussion of the costs and benefits associated with switching from parts (each musician only has the music for their instrument) to score (all musicians see all four parts):</p>
<blockquote><p>Having the whole score in front of them is an immense help in playing  new works. Complicated passages are immediately comprehensible. There  are no long discussions in rehearsal that start, “What do you have  there?”</p>
<p>Seeing the score as they play also deepens understanding of composers’  intentions. “The parts are our convenience,” Ms. Motobuchi said. The  score “is exactly the direct picture they had in their mind.”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Mr. Tong — at 29, the youngest and newest member of the group — resisted  the most. He still sounds not completely happy with the situation.</p>
<p>Seeing the music of his colleagues on the page can detract from the  magic of chamber-music-making, of communicating through hearing, he  said. “When first learning a piece,” Mr. Tong said, “it’s a constant  battle to open up the ears. For a long time I felt that the more I was  seeing, the less I was hearing.”</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your friend just returned from Spain and complained that Barcelona was too touristy, that the food was terrible in Madrid.  He received poor service everywhere he went and didn’t understand a word anybody said.<br />
Currently planning your own trip to Spain, you’re worried you might run into the same problems or have the same complaints.</p>
<p>Follow these easy tips to ensure you get the best possible cultural experience out of your travels:</p>
<p><strong>Eat local</strong><br />
Do try the street food as it is often better than that at low-medium scale restaurants, and cheaper too.  You’ll be supporting the core of the local economy, and will most likely meet some characters along the way.  Lane from ‘Lane’s Chicken Wagon’ may have the inside scoop on all the local shop owners, while Jin from the fruit stand could tap into his connections and work some great travel deals for you.  Don’t eat at chain restaurants, as they rob you of an authentic experience.  Rather, always look for the busy hole-in-the-wall ones that locals flock to.  If it’s packed, it’s probably for a reason, and most likely worth the wait.  Enjoy real, local food with real, local people.  It’ll make for some great memories.</p>
<p><strong>Learn the lingo</strong><br />
Locals love it when you take the time to learn a phrase or two in their language.  You might even receive better service from smiling faces for your efforts.  Start out by learning “Thank you” and simple, everyday greetings like “Hello” and “Goodbye.”  “Cheers” is helpful if you’re trying to make a good impression on new friends.  Buy yourself a lightweight pocket dictionary or phrase book and attempt to learn at least one new word a day.  You’ll be doing both yourself and your homeland a favor by acting as a respectful, well-learned, unofficial ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>Branch out</strong><br />
One of the coolest aspects of traveling is the fact that you get an inside look into how other people live their daily lives in foreign countries.  If the country’s specialty is steamed caterpillars, you should try it.  And you should probably have a cold drink in hand to wash it down with when you’re done, rather than having to “enjoy” its aftertaste the whole 30-minute ride home.  If shoes are swapped for slippers when indoors, you should follow suit.  Besides, your feet deserve a vacation too.</p>
<p><strong>Behave</strong><br />
Despite looking different and sounding different, your actions will set you apart as a foreigner.  Though you’re not expected to know all of the local customs, you are expected to watch and learn.  If you don’t see anyone else lounging at a restaurant, take your feet off the table.  If the locals don’t show much skin while out in public, dress accordingly and throw on some jeans.  By conforming to the regional standards, you’re less likely to run into trouble.  Have fun, but don’t get too crazy at the bar or club and wind up making a spectacle of yourself.  While abroad, you will constantly be asked, “Where are you from?”  And as we do here in America, foreigners will affiliate all Americans with the way you act.  You wear your flag on your shoulder, so take pride in your country.</p>
<p><strong>Take more than memories home with you</strong><br />
By rehearsing the knowledge you gained while away and teaching it to friends and family stateside, you can extend that invigorating feeling you loved having while abroad.  Cook the country’s most famous dish and invite friends over for a traditional feast.  Watch documentaries on your travel country and delve further into its history.  Just because you’re back home doesn’t mean you can’t continue your overseas experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://patkat80.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/fireworks-095.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-334" title="Fireworks 095" src="http://patkat80.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/fireworks-095.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I realized last night as I was <a class="zem_slink" title="Writing" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing">writing</a> &#8211; or struggling to write would be more honest &#8211; that I was making this a lot harder than it had to be &#8211; and a lot less fun.  So, I decided it was time to re-evaluate why I wanted to start <a class="zem_slink" title="Blog" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogging</a> in the first place and why I had joined the challenge to post daily. </p>
<p>I am still a newbie at blogging, having only started a couple of months ago.  So, I still need to learn all of the nuances and I&#8217;m intrigued by what people write about, what people don&#8217;t write about and how well some people write.  I&#8217;ve noticed there are professionals and there are people like me who just feel a need to write.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to be a writer &#8211; okay maybe not always &#8212; first I wanted to be a horse (my friends and I used to pretend we were horses and run all over the playground), then I moved on to being a nun (then I found out that they couldn&#8217;t have boyfriends and that just wasn&#8217;t going to work for me &#8211; even though I didn&#8217;t have a boyfriend at the time) and then I settled on being a doctor (an interview I did in high school and which my mother kept, quoted me as saying I wanted to go into medicine because I liked to dissect things!  Not sure that&#8217;s a good reason to become a doctor.)  I didn&#8217;t make it into medical school, so my goals changed again and now I was simply looking for a way to make money and use my math degree.  Luckily, I found work in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Insurance" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Insurance">insurance industry</a> (yes, I am one of the &#8216;evil empire&#8217; as the news agencies would have you believe).  It was during my work in compliance (reading and analyzing laws), that I realized I really liked to write &#8211; I even had a knack for it.  I could make people laugh with my articles I wrote for the company paper and soon I was writing <a class="zem_slink" title="Short story" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story">short stories</a> about my family.  But where to go from there?  I had no dreams of being a famous writer or being the author of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Great American Novel" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Novel">Great American Novel</a> &#8211; OK, I&#8217;m lying &#8212; I do want to be a syndicated humor columnist like <a class="zem_slink" title="Erma Bombeck" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erma_Bombeck">Erma Bombeck</a> &#8211; but as my mother used to say &#8216;Don&#8217;t give up your day job just yet.&#8217;    Everyone needs to have a dream and that one is mine &#8211; along with losing about 80 pounds, looking 30 years younger and winning the lottery &#8211; hey, if I&#8217;m going to dream, I&#8217;m going to make it a doozy!</p>
<p>So, back to the point &#8212; why did I start blogging?  Actually, it was a dare from a friend of mine who is a professional blogger.  She challenged me to start a blog and see where it would take me!  Again, with the challenges &#8211; can I do nothing on my own without being <em>challenged</em> to do it!  Apparently the answer to that one is NO!  We all challenge ourselves daily &#8212; to get up in the morning even though we are tired, to go to work even though we know it will be a tough day, to go home after work even though we know there is a TON of housework to do &#8212; life is full of challenges &#8211; I just decided to add one more. </p>
<p>That explains <em>why</em> I started blogging &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t explain why I thought I had anything worth blogging about.  I&#8217;m not a celebrity, I&#8217;m not famous or infamous, I&#8217;m not rich and I&#8217;m not particularly unique (I have four sisters and four children who are pretty much just like me!)  I think I started blogging as a way to preserve some of the stories I tell about my family &#8212; but also to share them with others much as I share them in conversations with others.  I am all about &#8216;over-sharing&#8217; &#8212; most of its public record any way!  And, if other people found my blogs and enjoyed them &#8211; that would be the icing on the cake!  So &#8211; blogging for me is the electronic version of my babbling, burbling self &#8211; something I already do in my everyday life.  It was a way for me to write &#8211; which I love to do &#8211; and in a way &#8216;talk&#8217; which I like to do even more!</p>
<p>So the next question becomes why did I accept the challenge to post daily &#8211; a challenge not even posed by a friend &#8211; but by <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>!  Again, I apparently have a problem saying NO.  Posting daily seemed simple at first &#8212; I have lots of stories to tell about my family (my sisters, my children, my husband) and I enjoy writing.  It seemed like a good way to focus my energy and make sure that I actually followed through with my promise to myself and to my friend, Karen, to making blogging a part of my life.</p>
<p>However, yesterday was a really tough post to write and I realized that I was making this much too hard.  I needed to go back to writing from the heart &#8211; because that&#8217;s where all my stories started.  My experiences that I treasure are part of me and my stories are an extension of my joy in life &#8211; and I can&#8217;t write about them if I&#8217;m worried about how long the post is going to be, is it going to be funny and will be people enjoy what I say.  I don&#8217;t do that when I tell stories for my friends and I shouldn&#8217;t do it when I&#8217;m writing my blog.</p>
<p>So, here is my Challenge within a Challenge &#8212; to be true to my &#8216;voice&#8217;, to perfect my <a class="zem_slink" title="Storytelling" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling">storytelling</a> - not my blogging and not my writing.  One of my gifts is that I am a storyteller who sees love, laughter and joy in everyday life and if I make just one person smile, smirk or think &#8220;I guess my life is pretty normal&#8221; &#8211; then I have used that gift to the best of my abilities and I will be happy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hebe/2217288128/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-969" style="border:1px solid black;" title="minimal" src="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/minimal.jpg?w=540&#038;h=140" alt="" width="540" height="140" /></a></p>
<p>Every Monday I will post about de-cluttering and minimalizing different areas and aspects of my life.</p>
<p>Since my &#8220;office&#8221; at home is a couch, this only applies to my work office. It&#8217;s the largest desk I&#8217;ve ever had, and it can quickly get taken hostage by lots of papers. I do a <strong>TON</strong> of projects for people that involve 11&#215;17 paper and Excel. Enough said.</p>
<p>I recently read a <a href="http://www.missminimalist.com/2010/06/10-steps-to-a-minimalist-office/">couple</a> <a href="http://unclutterer.com/2008/03/12/creating-a-minimalist-workspace/">articles</a> about office minimalizing and started to feel like I <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">wanted</span> needed to do something. I don&#8217;t have a &#8216;before&#8217; picture, but big ol&#8217; mess describes it nicely.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">My Desk</span><br />
I pared this down to the things I need everyday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors (computer is below the desk)</li>
<li>Mouse &amp; Mousepad</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>Coffee Mug and Kleen Kanteen</li>
<li>Notepad and pen</li>
<li>Phone (despite how much I want to get rid of it!)</li>
<li>Current Projects: white binders and yellow folder in the tray</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-947" style="border:3px solid black;" title="office4" src="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bookshelf</span><br />
I actually don&#8217;t use most of what is on the bookshelf very often.</p>
<ul>
<li>Binders: all of the pricing that&#8217;s been entered or changed since I started</li>
<li>Training binders and product guides</li>
<li>Plant</li>
<li>Inbox and outbox trays</li>
<li>Tape (no where else to put it)</li>
<li>Kleenex (least soft ever)</li>
<li>Picture and two little trinkets</li>
<li>Step stool: I can&#8217;t reach the top row of the file cabinets.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-946" style="border:3px solid black;" title="office1.jpg" src="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office1-e1294763362785.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Drawer #1 &#8211; Office Supplies</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Plastic tub with pens, pencils, highlighters: aka the good pens.</li>
<li>stapler</li>
<li>tackle box with dividers holding push pins, change, paper clips, etc.</li>
<li>Post-its, keys, business cards.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-949" style="border:3px solid black;" title="office2" src="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Drawer #2</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Extra notepad</li>
<li>Computer manuals</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-967" style="border:3px solid black;" title="office3" src="http://shortystylee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office3.jpg?w=288&#038;h=215" alt="" width="288" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it! I think most &#8220;minimalist&#8221; people would have a gripe with all of the papers I have tacked up on my cubicle walls, but I use the information on those multiple times per day. Having them any place else aside from right in front of my face would be inefficient.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips that Worked for Me!</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only keep items on your desk that you use everyday. </strong>Keep a mental note over a day of what you use and what you don&#8217;t. Everything you don&#8217;t use should find a new home.</li>
<li><strong>Get yourself organized at the beginning of the day and again at the end of the day.</strong> Did you finish something? File it! Still waiting on info from someone else? Keep a &#8220;in progress&#8221; tray. I have an &#8220;inbox&#8221; tray, &#8220;in progress&#8221; tray, and an &#8220;outbox&#8221; (aka &#8211; to be filed) tray.</li>
<li><strong>Do what works for you</strong>. If taking tacked up papers off your walls would make you less efficient, then don&#8217;t do it. If taking down those pictures of your kids would make your day unbearable, then don&#8217;t do it. Ultimately, you&#8217;re the one that needs to work in your space.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re in an office, like I am, <strong>keep an office supplies table for everyone to use.</strong> Ours has hole punches, a paper cutter, heavy duty staplers, scissors, etc. No need to keep these kinds of things at your cube.</li>
<li><strong>Make good use of the drawers on your desk</strong>, but they don&#8217;t need to have six month&#8217;s worth of supplies. I do have extra pens, an assortment of highlighters, paper clips, and extra staples&#8230; but how often do you <em>really</em> need those 1.5&#8243; binder clips?</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Minimalist Monday Series</span></strong></h2>
<p>Every Monday I will post about de-cluttering and minimalizing different areas and aspects of my life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took this photograph last summer, which now feels like a decade ago, as the wind whistles through the crack in my window and the rain drums upon my roof. The photograph is simple but it represents escapism to me, something we all need every now and then especially during this grim winter. </p>
<p>Ever since I was young whenever I saw planes soaring above me I’d imagine where the plane was heading. It was usually somewhere warm during England’s never-ending icy winters or somewhere cold during our weeklong tepid summers. Nowadays, however, whenever I see planes painting the sky with a white brush of vapor trails, I envisage myself on it heading to India, a country I left only two months ago but yearn to return to. </p>
<p>This yearning has been brought about because some of my friends are travelling to India in the next few weeks as well as one of my friends still in India announcing her engagement. As I lecture those about to visit incredible India about where to go and what to avoid I brim over with explorers envy, knowing that soon they will be clinging onto a rickshaw as it carves through Delhi or sipping masala chai, high in the Himalayas. So I look at this photograph and pretend, just for a moment, that I am too. </p>
