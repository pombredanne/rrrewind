				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone I dearly loved died this week.</p>
<p>After I found out she had passed, I turned invisible. Creatures around me became their own planets, rotating in separate orbits. Someone turned down the earth&#8217;s volume knob and the little pilotman in charge of keeping our world spinning slowed everything down.</p>
<p>The squirrel outside my car window acted like he couldn&#8217;t see me. I guess maybe he didn&#8217;t. But I saw him, and that made it worse because he was doing something important. It was obvious. He was focused and alive. The brown hairs on his back shivered. His tiny dark nails scratched the asphalt as he crossed in front of me.</p>
<p>Inside my car planet, I turned up the music, but familiar song lyrics took on new meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;As many times as I blink I&#8217;ll think of you&#8230;I swear I won&#8217;t forget you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything reminded me that she was gone.</p>
<p>I drove downtown, but buildings shoved memories at me. That ugly place we worked together. We&#8217;d grab coffee at that Starbucks.</p>
<p>That restaurant was where we had lunch and she said it was okay that I left my job, that I left her. She said she wanted me to be happy and that I should pursue my passions. She hugged me goodbye, like always. She was so small, but she was the biggest person I&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p>December. Her birthday month.</p>
<p>Everything becomes a reminder. Or a metaphor.</p>
<p>Christmas carols. Rain. A woman walking alone.</p>
<p>I wait for my daughter to get off the bus. A little boy and his dad are waiting, too. The little boy stares up at a tall evergreen, tilting his head back further and further. His child face smiles up. All he can possibly see is sky. The vast, clouded mystery beyond where he stands. He giggles. He looks dizzy. He leans farther.</p>
<p>When he starts to fall backward, his face doesn&#8217;t change. He keeps smiling, like maybe he doesn&#8217;t know he&#8217;s falling. Or he&#8217;s not afraid. Maybe he trusts his father will catch him. Maybe he doesn&#8217;t mind falling, or he is so pleased with his profound, incomprehensible moment that he is holding on for as long as he can. Anyway, his father does catch him.</p>
<p>The sky is too heavy for me. Too risky. I don&#8217;t even want to watch this little boy finding joy in his wonder, because I just want to be sad. And angry.</p>
<p>All that space, white clouds, full of what? Too much carbon dioxide and humanity&#8217;s eventual demise. My death. What is there beyond that stupid sky, anyway?</p>
<p>Is she up there? Is she gone?</p>
<p>I want her back, damn it. And I&#8217;m sick of the rain. Fucking sky. She was my friend, my mentor. She inspired me to live better. To live stronger. I hate You, whoever you are, for taking her. For making her suffer with cancer.</p>
<p>I am still angry when my daughter steps off the bus. The lights are blinking. But she smiles at me like I am her sky. The world speeds up. Sounds are loud again.</p>
<p>I focus on her. I become visible, alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I set out to post my top 10 photos of my recent trip to India and quickly realized I could never accomplish that. Here are my top 18 photos of places, buildings, cityscapes and landscapes from India and later I will post favorite photos of people. I hope you enjoy. It may not be a top 10 list but at least you don&#8217;t have to sit through a slideshow presentation of the 5322 photos that I took.</p>

We looked online at rates and almost made a booking, thinking it was $80 per night. We recalculated and found out it was $800 per night. Due to that pesky zero we couldn&#8217;t afford it.</p></div>

At its height, over 500 years ago, the area was home to 1/2 million people.  Now the area consists of scattered ruins and banana plantations.

I tried to take a somewhat unique photo of the church, since most of them I saw online were the basic up-close photos of the white edifice.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post will no doubt annoy a number of my closest friends, and particularly infuriate those who are the Middle Earth equivalent of the SSPX &#8211; i.e., more Tolkien-than-thou.  However my intent is not to make pleasantries, but rather to challenge perceptions and preconceptions in our culture.  To paraphrase Addison DeWitt, my native habitat is the blogosphere: in it I toil not, neither do I spin &#8211; I am simply a critic and commentator.</p>
<p>That being said, I will now freely admit that I am looking forward to catching Part One of Peter Jackson&#8217;s new film version of J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221; this weekend, if I can manage to snag a ticket at my local multiplex.  Rather than review a film which I have not yet seen, I want to address two points which all of us ought to keep in mind, and not just with respect to Jackson&#8217;s work.  The first and most important is to remind the reader of the value of variation and interpretation, in expression of the artistic imagination.  The second, which flows naturally from it, is to consider Jackson&#8217;s work within that context, as well as to judge it on its own merits.</p>
<p>Our cultural history is replete with examples of theme and repetition, not only because human beings enjoy variety, but also because the human imagination takes new pieces of insight from each reinterpretation of something which is already known to us.  We see this idea all the time, in literature, music, architecture, and so on.  If we look at art, for example, let us consider the subject of David, the shepherd boy from the Bible who became the King of Israel.</p>
<p>Were I to ask you to imagine a work of art representing David, the first image to come into your mind would likely be that of Michelangelo&#8217;s giant statue which stands in the Accademia in Florence.  This image of the shepherd-king has been famous since it was completed, an iconic and influential piece of sculpture known all over the world.  The serenity and confidence, the strong determination of this &#8220;ruddy youth&#8221;, as he is described in the Book of Samuel, who is growing into a man&#8217;s body and will soon become a great military leader, may have been intended as an allegory of Florence, but over time has come to represent the very idea of the Italian Renaissance for many.</p>
<p>Yet there are other images of David, created both before and after this particular work, which can bring about other levels of understanding.  Take Bernini&#8217;s David in the Borghese in Rome, for example, which was created during the Counter-Reformation as the Catholic Church fought back against Protestantism.  In this image, the young shepherd boy is shown about to slay Goliath with his slingshot.  He is wound up like a professional baseball pitcher, chewing on his lower lip with a look of keen concentration on his unseen target, narrowing his eyes to see exactly where to aim his weapon in order to do the most damage.</p>
<p>Whereas Michelangelo&#8217;s colossal David is rather static, Bernini&#8217;s is about action.  They are each a product of their time.  The former represents the newly-found confidence of a culture which believed that it was reviving the lost arts and knowledge of the Greeks and Romans, and expressed that confidence in the way it presented saints like King David.  The latter is that of an institution under attack from all sides, which is not going to roll over and play dead, but rather will fight back against those who would see it fail.</p>
<p>Ever since Peter Jackson released the first installment of his film version of &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; ten years ago this month, there has been a mass of criticism that he has not done proper justice to the books.  Despite the total length of the three films extending to many hours, the refrain from Tolkien fans then was that Jackson had cut too much.  While some of this is made up for in the Extended Editions of the films on DVD, which are even better than the theatrical versions, Jackson admittedly had to make editorial decisions about what to put in, what to leave out, and so on, in bringing the story to the screen.  Similarly, now it seems that a common complaint among the commentariat is that turning &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;, a much shorter book &#8211; comparatively &#8211; than the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; trilogy of novels, into three films is making it too long.  In other words, Mr. Jackson is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Let us take what we have considered above with respect to the image of David, and apply it to what we are seeing here, with these films.  What Jackson himself has said in the past about his work, and it is a point with which I wholeheartedly agree, is that we need to keep in mind that these are HIS interpretations of the stories, using his talents and the resources available to him as best he can.  Moreover, he fully anticipates that at some point, another director will come along and make his own film version of Tolkien&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>It is a bit unfair &#8211; and frankly rather illogical &#8211; to expect one artistic medium to be able to express itself in the way that another does.  King David, after all, was a real person, who lived a long time ago, and his deeds are described in the Bible.  That, in itself, is an interpretation of his life through the inspired Scriptures.  Do we complain that Michelangelo or Bernini&#8217;s statues are unfair representations of David, because they do not actually move?  Do we whine because paintings of David by artists like Castagno or Caravaggio do not speak?</p>
<p>Rather, if we are honest with ourselves, we look at these works of art, and value them based on their own merits, but also in how they bring us back to the person of David and the stories about him in the Bible.  If Mr. Jackson tells an otherwise good story in a way which is unwatchable, then his film will fail; if he tells that story in a way which draws audiences in and makes them interested, then he will succeed.  And in so doing, then perhaps his work will cause people who have never heard of Tolkien or read his work, to go read the books for themselves.</p>
<p>The value of cultural reinterpretations of our values and virtues is that they constantly remind us to reflect on great topics, which with all of our everyday cares and concerns we so often do not get to do.  Tolkien himself was a novelist, not a filmmaker &#8211; and neither were Count Leo Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, or any of the other writers whose works are coming to the big screen this season.  While some may not like Jackson&#8217;s particular interpretation of Tolkien&#8217;s writing, the real question to be asked is not whether it is a complete representation of Tolkien&#8217;s work on screen, but whether there is enough virtue in what appears in the film to reflect favorably on at least some of the author&#8217;s concerns.</p>
<p>In the spirit of cultural maturity, we need to give Mr. Jackson the chance to tell his version of Tolkien&#8217;s story, and enjoy the good parts of it even as we acknowledge those portions which we may not like.  For the next cinematic interpretation of these novels will no doubt be just as different from Jackson&#8217;s version, as Bernini&#8217;s David is from Michelangelo&#8217;s.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with Chris, another long talk with Megan, one last good hard laugh with Boyd. Life is too short to be busy,&#8221; concludes Tim Krieder in a <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/"><span style="color:#000000;">New York Times opinion piece</span></a> from last summer.</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://mindfulstew.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/exploring-busyness-are-you-too-occupied-to-notice/too-busy22/" rel="attachment wp-att-769"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-769" alt="Too-busy22" src="http://mindfulstew.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/too-busy22.jpeg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">Krieder laments that everyone seems busy&#8211;too busy to call or text back, too busy to go watch the football game and eat wings on a Sunday afternoon, too busy to exercise, date, and too busy to carve out unstructured time in any form.  I agree with his assertion, but I also recognize that he writes from a position of privilege&#8211;after all, he&#8217;s managed to make a living as a writer working 4-5 hour days.  Unemployment is an issue for millions.  Many people would love to be busy, making ends meet.  His argument seems largely targeted to career-driven, well-off individuals who don&#8217;t strive for the elusive life/work balance.  </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#800000;">So why are some people so busy? To what extent have people chosen to be and feel so busy, versus forces seemingly outside of their control?  Is it just a false perception? </span> </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">Clearly, the forces of modernity&#8211;namely digital communication&#8211;have impacted how busy we are.  For instance, at a friend&#8217;s bachelor party weekend in New Orleans last year, one of his groomsmen and hedge-fund colleagues <em>had</em> to wake up at 3:00 am on a Friday because some foreign company was releasing their quarterly earnings report.  Apparently, he had to react quickly to the news and make a decision to buy or sell.   I was dumbfounded.   What a shit job, I thought, being tethered to constant communication and time-zones.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">I feel fortunate I don&#8217;t have to be on call with my iPhone 24-7 for work.  As a teacher, there is no communication outside of the school day that is urgent, although I do have to choose to say no and stop working&#8211;there&#8217;s a constant scroll-like to-do list as an educator.  For me, busyness only feels healthy when I scale back the work demands and balance them with other pursuits.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">My version of a productive, happily busy weekday?  An exciting day in the classroom, engaging with students from roughly 7:40-2:20, perhaps a short meeting or tutoring session after school, a workout, time to browse the internet, cook a meal, hang out with my fiancee, and maybe have another hour of so in there for reading or TV.  Like Krieder, this is a privileged position.  But I&#8217;m also active in saying no to extra job requests, turning off my phone for stretches, and generally deciding that, to me, the good life isn&#8217;t taking on as much as I can.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the American economic system values productivity and growth over all else.  When people are on vacation, they still work.  When people take lunch breaks, they still check their e-mails and Twitter feeds.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/rachel-ryan/the-busy-trap_b_1649412.html?just_reloaded=1"><span style="color:#000000;">Blogger Rachel Ryan, in her response and rebuttal to Krieder</span></a>, writes, &#8220;But, even if some overarching authority mandated that all offices closed at noon for a Spanish-like siesta, people could and would still work. They could go home and work there. They could keep abreast of the news on their phones. They could, oh, I don&#8217;t know, read some infuriating article and be compelled to write something on their day off and never really &#8220;rest&#8221; (which is defined how, exactly?). What conceivable democratic authority has the capacity to institutionalize &#8220;relaxation policy?&#8221;</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">As long as the American cultural mindset is to work to consume, then work some more to buy fancier cars and more lavish homes,  she&#8217;s right: nothing will change.  We&#8217;re not about to embrace a paradigm shift, but maybe Krieder is right when he states, &#8220;But I would suggest that an ideal human life lies somewhere between my own defiant indolence and the rest of the world’s endless frenetic hustle. My role is just to be a bad influence, the kid standing outside the classroom window making faces at you at your desk, urging you to just this once make some excuse and get out of there, come outside and play.&#8221;</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">Lastly, a<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=if-we-feel-too-busy-its-probably-du-12-04-22"><span style="color:#000000;"> study reported</span></a> on in <em>Scientific American </em>provides a wrinkle to this whole notion of the busyness trap.  In one experiment, researchers interrupted subjects with tasks ranging from mindless work to writing letters to sick children.  In another study, researchers &#8220;gave&#8221; unstructured time to subjects to do whatever they wanted, while another group had to use the same time to do something for someone else.   Those who filled up time in their busy lives with selfless tasks were much more likely to feel empowered and perceived having more time on their hands.  Fascinating stuff.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">Will I regret it someday if I don&#8217;t pick up the pace and write one more blog post a week?  Or chair the English Department at school?  Or write more e-mails?  Or grade more papers?  Not a chance.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#800000;">Where do you stand?  Do you feel too busy?  Do you have any anecdotal evidence to support the aforementioned study?  Does your job or personal habits impose this feeling on you?  Would you embrace a more relaxed American economic culture?  </span></h3>
<h3></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/800px-Hurricane_Sandy_New_Jersey_Pier.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="800px-Hurricane_Sandy_New_Jersey_Pier" alt="" src="http://nypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/800px-Hurricane_Sandy_New_Jersey_Pier-300x200.jpg" height="200" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>By Alissa Fleck </em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s well-known news by now &#8212; the New York-based political advisor who spread false rumors about storm-related damage throughout Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s rampage. The fallout resulted in calls by some officials for legal action.</p>
<p>Yet a similar, albeit less threatening, trend related to social media and natural disaster extends much further. All over the Northeast, users took to Twitter &#8212; and other social media &#8212; the Monday evening of Hurricane Sandy’s East Coast landfall to lament what a “disappointment” Sandy had turned out to be.</p>
<p>By 8:30 p.m. on Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office had announced five hurricane-related fatalities in New York, raising the overall death toll to more than 70 in a storm far from finished wreaking havoc, yet some individuals were notably dismayed. They had not even lost power.</p>
<p>Thousands of homes up and down the coast were underwater and millions more were without electricity. For days and possibly even weeks to come, some would be unable to make it to jobs upon which they depended to eke out a living, yet people took to very public forums that Monday night to call Sandy nothing more than a “joke.”</p>
<p>They claimed all the hype had set them up for disappointment. Others pointed to Hurricane Irene which hit the East Coast earlier in the year and had similarly failed to live up to their expectations. Some talked about how the media had glorified Hurricane Sandy, how surely live news crews would be disheartened if the storm didn’t meet its predicted level of terror.</p>
<p>And while media coverage focused heavily on officials’ remarks to evacuate in a timely fashion or stay indoors, decrying the selfishness of those who put first responders at risk, they also took the time to interview the man risking life and limb jet-skiing in the Hudson River, and children in flooded New Jersey streets playing with downed street signs.</p>
<p>They reported from the edge of whipping, white-capped waters, breaking in and out with added effect, as reporters are wont to do. This sort of coverage is a trademark of contemporary news media, but are reporters under pressure to find the big, hard-hitting story at the risk of magnifying &#8212; or skewing &#8212; disaster? In the case of Sandy, no, we understand with the advantage of hindsight.</p>
<p>It’s true some people will say anything for a moment in the spotlight and perhaps we should not judge them too harshly for the seemingly cruel nonchalance flooding social networking platforms, but we do have to wonder about the origin of this larger instinct rampant in so many of us. Why do we pore over the news coverage, glued to the next apocalyptic event, seemingly continually (perhaps quietly) let down? Why are we almost sadistically drawn to disaster? Is this the very epitome of schadenfreude?</p>
<p>And what exactly would it take for Sandy<em> not </em>to disappoint some of us &#8212; how much destruction? How many brutal, graphic deaths? How close to home?</p>
<p>It seems there is something about the chaos and utter lack of control that thrills us humans &#8212; all the excitement of a disaster movie, enhanced, so long as it does not impact us too directly. Surely, if asked, most of these Tweeters would agree they do not explicitly want to see others suffer. Maybe they’d even be ashamed to concede to the thrill they register.</p>
<p>And, in the end, can we blame them for their honesty? Are the rest of us just holding back what we all collectively feel? Stuart Fischoff of the “Journal of Media Psychology” once explained many humans need a certain safe amount of terror for stimulation and excitement in otherwise typically calm lifestyles. This &#8212; in the form of horror movies and haunted houses, and potentially devastating natural disasters &#8212; provides a safe, electrifying break from the mundane, before we are permitted to scurry back. To run for the emergency exit, to push the stop button, to yell the safe word.</p>
<p>It seems safe to say our fascination is not only mildly sadistic then, but a touch masochistic as well.</p>
<p>Possibly it’s not excitement we feel in our traditional understanding of the word, but excitement more as a fight-or-flight type response, a defense mechanism, the difficult-to-pinpoint emotion that manifests when our nervous systems are in overdrive. Maybe it’s misguided pride or denial in the face of nature’s fearful omnipotence. Perhaps it’s just the <em>I survived </em>factor.</p>
<p>Then there is the well-tread territory of disaster fatigue &#8212; with the media playing an integral role &#8212; wherein we can only feel so bad for so long, before we are emotionally drained and must defend ourselves. Maybe we are more careless than ever and, given the outlet, more quick to express this carelessness (this, its own form of denial).</p>
<p>Maybe the reaction witnessed here is in part the simple ignorance of youth, the utterances of those unable to see too far behind their own narrow contexts.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps some element of the human psyche is bound up in something slightly more sinister, something we may not want to address, something just beyond our reach, something lurking even between the lines of that Tweeter&#8217;s false rumors. Most likely, it’s a little bit of all of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me name for you some of my contradictions. It’ll be fun. And then it will be your turn.</p>
<p>I’m a lazy&#8230; activist.</p>
<p>I smoke cigarettes after yoga. (Only sometimes!)</p>
<p>I teach reasoning skills to high school students. My psychic supports this.</p>
<p>I am the straight girl co-founder of a queer rights/ feminist/ group for equality, but I have a pretty singular attraction to rich white men whose debonair style and nice hair conceal an undercurrent of (blech) misogyny.</p>
<p>You felt the need to bring me down because sometimes too much joy is just too much and I still love your stupid face.</p>
<p>Enough about that, I’m reading Nietzche and a self-help book called The Happiness Makeover at the same time &#8211; it&#8217;s a race!</p>
<p>I’m the wisest person I know and also the most naive, the brightest and the dullest, so beautiful sweet and such a cold-ass bitch. Depends on which superlative you seek.</p>
<p>All we need is balance, balance, balance, I battle cry on my turbo dive directly into the <i>deeeeeep</i> end. Oh, the deep end, my bitter friend.</p>
<p>If I had a resume of ailments I’ve diagnosed myself with it would include, but not limited to: urgently exploding appendicitis, recurring anorexia and simultaneously a propensity for obesity, bipolar disorder, high-functioning autism, gluten allergies, a thyroid imbalance, schizophrenia, paranoia, clinical depression, neuroticism and hypochondriacism. Those last two are probably correct.</p>
<p>I lament that in all that, I’m not a little more OCD. My room would probably be cleaner.</p>
<p>I’m a messy perfectionist. An embracing critic.</p>
<p>I will cry with my whole body, quietly but deep breathingly, sometimes at things happening on television. And I will laugh until I shake, until tears squirt out of my eyes and I grab onto someone just to remember where I am, sometimes because of things happening on the television. Oh wait, laughing and crying ain&#8217;t a contradiction – but my ex-manfriends will tell you it is.</p>
<p>They just get angry. Human evolutionary biology is some kind of crackpot joke in itself, but that&#8217;s altogether another story.</p>
<p>Paradoxes can get tiring, but what other kinds of truths have we got? I&#8217;m no painter but I&#8217;d like to paint a pair of docks shackled to each other. Somewhere deeply inland. With a tagline that reads, &#8220;Enough metanarratives already!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway. I’m a writer who usually prefers a meaty conversation to flashy devices.</p>
<p>All I want to do is leave my ego at the door and help people genuinely, authentically, the way my soul begs of me to do in the ways that I know how. I want to reach people who think they don’t deserve to be reached. I want to pull them out of the muck and laugh about how funny it is that once you thought that&#8217;s where you belonged. But then I doubt myself and become one of those people who needs some rope myself. Stuck in the muck. And maybe that’s why I do the pulling. Plus, that&#8217;s where most of the funny weird things are born. What would I do without those swampy friends?</p>
<p>I think there are too many people on the planet and too many dumb words already been said, but I want to nurse my own children eventually, and see my name in print again and again and again.</p>
<p>I love to backpack &#8211; up and down streams, boots soaking wet and tired and sore. The best meal of my life occurred out in the foothills – tuna fish on crackers. But I will binge on five star hotels that serve you oysters with lemon wrapped in meshy plastic whenever I can, oh honey, take me down to never never land.</p>
<p>I will compost my veggies like a mountain hermit and wipe worm poop all over my pants, then don an evening sparkle dress and throw cocktails down my throat like I’m a hotshot on some Real World trash.</p>
<p>I strive to live richly, richly, richly poor!  But I&#8217;d also kind of like regular sushi lunches and new things someday, maybe, finally.</p>
<p>My city friends think I’m a well-adjusted hippie. My hippie friends wonder how the city doesn’t kill me.</p>
<p>I have social anxiety so bad sometimes I don’t leave my house for days. But when you meet me at a party, I will radiate. It won’t be fake. It’s in me.</p>
<p>I want to express in wordy colors all my blah blah, sing out on the walls all my yeah yeah, spin and dance around all my hee hee, and also guard it up, not for the world to see. How much energy for you and how much love for me?</p>
<p>I’m an overgiver who doesn’t quite know yet how to fully receive.</p>
<p>“For such a colorful personality, you sure wear a lot of black.” Has been said about me.</p>
<p>I’d like to not care what you think of me. I’d like to stop saying me, me, me. I’d also like to stop this rhyming spree. But what other vehicle do I have to express what funny weird backward beauties I and you and everyone are, all the time, concurrently?</p>
<p>I want more than anything to feel life coursing through my body full and rich and light and true. But I am attached to the darkness like a shadow I can’t shake. I’m afraid if I shook it, I’d be floating, and floating and floating, but somewhere out there all alone. No safety rope. Misery loves company and maybe there&#8217;s another way to be, but I need dark company; it&#8217;s dangerous to be so light.</p>
<p>You can absolutely be too free. But rebirth is your right. As many times as you want it. And integration is the key. You can have your own language and speak another tongue, too. You just have to want to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m telling myself, you can fall for the stars and still live a little large.</p>
<p>You can drown science in formulas, then close your eyes and rocket off to Jupiter.</p>
<p>You can wear your contradictions like a robe entitling you to be whatever you feel today. Right now. Not yesterday and not tomorrow.</p>
<p>And hey, news flash, you there swimming in TV ads and fake boob pornos and consciousness raising questions and comparisons with your peers, and all your wonderful, titillating confusion: you don’t have to be perfect. That’d be nonsense. And actually really boring. But you do have to try. To figure it out. You will have to work to let the old goo morph into newness or else what is it worth?</p>
<p>You can be as genuine as you are pretending and I know you’re good at pretending. Just take the real stuff, take the other stuff, take the inner and the outer stuff, take the messy stuff, and the gorgeous stuff, mix them all together and shake.</p>
<p>Look at me. Identity crisis ice cream sundae.</p>
<p>I’m a writer who has a history of avoiding conflict like fire, but I’ve made hesitant friends with my shadow side. I’ve named her Rikoklyn; she’s snide and has mean teeth. Sometimes I like her. Just for something different. Capiche?</p>
<p>So it’s pretty much guaranteed – your multiple heads with all their silly hats will fight and fight and fight. But don’t fight the fight. There is no should, no supposed to be. Just you, some different outfits, and how every different day you choose to be.</p>
<p>So that’s it. How I let Hegel dialecticize me toward synthesis. Every idea gives rise to its opposite, and something new is born. Train yourself to let things die when they need to die. It’s simple but hard. Sometimes it takes a while before the birth. Survival is a spiral, adaptation on a level you can see. Slowly winding forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our family of four lives in a three-bedroom apartment in New York City. The kids share a bedroom and the “third bedroom” is a dining room that has been transformed into a playroom (a rare luxury in these parts). I am engaged in a perpetual war against Addy and Zack’s toys, trying to contain them in these two rooms in a configuration that doesn’t resemble a garbage dump.  See exhibit A for evidence of my failure:</p>
<p><a href="http://momamorphosis.com/2012/12/12/thanks-for-the-train-table-but-my-kid-lives-in-an-apartment/playroom/" rel="attachment wp-att-170"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-170" alt="Playroom" src="http://momamorphosisdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/playroom.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, both my mother and my sister-in-law called me while holiday shopping. “Do you think Zack wants Legos?”, “How about a real workbench with a full set of tools and screws?” I had to veto it all. &#8220;Nothing big.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing that comes with a million pieces, nothing that resembles anything they already have.&#8221; I needed to defend the small amount of grown up space we still have in our home. More importantly, the more puzzles, pegs, beads, squinkies, legos and 50-piece wooden food sets that accumulate, the closer I get to seeking professional help for the undiagnosed OCD that keeps me up until 1:00 AM organizing it all. The bottom line is that until we live in a house in the suburbs with a hoarders-inspired, kids-only basement, I will be the Grinch who stole Hanukkah. Accordingly, I have developed a list of a few of the top holiday gifts for preschoolers who live in apartments. Grandmas and Grandpas, take note.</p>
<p><b>Real Deal Gift Ideas…</b></p>
<p><i>Tickets to the Fresh Beat Band Concert</i></p>
<p>They’re small. We throw them in the garbage when we’re done with them. Most important, I can never figure out when they go on sale until I’m a month too late and only the crappy seats are left, so I need someone else to take over this job anyway.</p>
<p><i>Disney DVDs</i></p>
<p>They’re easy to store and they double as a free two-hour babysitter when I want to take a nap.</p>
<p><b>Gifts for Those on a Budget…</b></p>
<p><i>A Box of Cookies</i></p>
<p>There’s nothing that gets little kids more excited than giving them a box of cookies. What’s great is that they are perfectly satisfied when you give them just one. What’s even better is that they believe you when you tell them there are no cookies left in the box the next day because <i>they</i> finished them all.</p>
<p><i>Bubble Wrap</i></p>
<p>Bubble wrap is like the supporting actress who steals the show from the leading lady, the bread that you fill up on at a restaurant and then have no room left for dinner. No matter what amazing toy is protected by its cushy little buttons, kids always just want to play with the bubble wrap. It provides hours of entertainment and can be dumped with a clean conscience once it’s deflated. What more could a little apartment dweller’s mom ask for?</p>
<p><b>Gifts I Can Only Dream About…</b></p>
<p><i>Live-in Housekeeper</i></p>
<p>A perfect gift for a toddler, a live-in housekeeper will provide one more adult in the apartment who will bend to their every whiny command. As an added bonus, when grandma inevitably ignores your request to nix the fifty-piece puzzle books that constantly spill out all over the floor, a live-in housekeeper will help keep your sanity better than lithium. Where’s she going to sleep? Hell, if she really cleans up every day, she can take my side of the bed and I’ll sleep standing up in the closet.</p>
<p><i>A Storage Unit</i></p>
<p>For a mere $100/month, you can bring joy to the heart of a little one by bringing the coveted basement full of toys to the NYC apartment. So what if it’s just a 3’ x 3’ x 3’ metal cage? Who cares if I stuff it so full of exersaucers, baby swings and singing puppy dogs that if a kid actually took anything out of it, it would trigger a deadly avalanche? Big deal if the sub cellar where it’s located is also a rat tenement? I could get rid of TWENTY SEVEN CUBIC FEET of toys! Definitely worth the risks.</p>
<p><i>Ambien-Laced Brownies</i></p>
<p>Total non-sequitur. It’s 10:41 PM right now. Why the hell is Zack still up in his bed whispering to his team of stuffed animals? Either this kid needs some Ambien-laced brownies for Hanukkah or I do so I can go to sleep and stop staring at his beady, glowing eyes in the damn monitor.</p>
<p><b>Be Warned…</b></p>
<p>Ignore the aforementioned banned gift characteristics and your present will land on the re-gift shelf. The re-gift shelf is a thing of beauty. It emits rays of sunshine every time I crack open the closet door as if it was a direct invention of God him(her?it?)self. Entry to the re-gift shelf means there is one less toy messing up my living room and there is one less gift I have to buy for someone else. So actually, I beg you, please forget everything I said in this post and just give my kids something I can guiltlessly pass on to someone else.</p>
<p>Share your ideas!  What are some serious or funny ideal gifts for the space challenged?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 11:22. So far this weekend I&#8217;ve easily spent five hours on school stuff &#8211; by the standard of most weekends, a light load.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have a light load, but a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Lunchtime on Friday was when I heard about Sandy Hook. We teachers talked about the events at the table and taught our afternoon classes, still somewhat numb. We walked all of the students outside at the end of the day. I know it choked me up to see all of the parents hugging their children extra tight.</p>
<p>All weekend, I&#8217;ve been trying to comprehend it. I can&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t imagine the terror of those ten minutes. I can&#8217;t fully understand the turmoil those families are enduring. I cannot fathom how the Sandy Hook School community could possibly get through its first day back when it is time. I can&#8217;t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Well, let me correct that. Because I&#8217;ll tell you what I can understand. I can understand the determination with which those teachers tried to protect their kids. Because my kids? They&#8217;re MY kids. Yes, every bright and smiling face I see in the hallway, each eager learner who walks in my door is officially a lovey of mine. And as I&#8217;ve often said: once a lovey, always a lovey. My students are my children forever. Just ask the twenty-somethings I still keep in touch with. I want to know how their lives are, what they&#8217;re doing, whether or not they are safe and happy. Because they matter to me as much as my own children do. I hope some of my former students are reading this blog, and that they hear from me how incredibly important each one of them has been in my life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.</p>
<p>I have nine different preps for tomorrow, some of which I&#8217;ve planned more than others. But I still can&#8217;t shake the feeling that right now, in light of the last few days, so much of that really doesn&#8217;t matter. It doesn&#8217;t matter how good my spelling packets look. It doesn&#8217;t matter how well I&#8217;ve organized the sample graphs for the math lesson, whether or not I&#8217;ve put smiley stickers on the kids&#8217; homework, or whether or not I have all of my copies ready.</p>
<p>What matters to me is what has always mattered to me:</p>
<p>Every child in my care is worthy of respect, of dignity, of love. Every child needs to learn, to laugh, to play, to work through frustrations, to make mistakes, to fail sometimes. Every child needs an environment that is safe physically and emotionally. Every child in my care deserves to know that learning is important, but being a decent human being is paramount.</p>
<p>And I have always been &#8211; and still am &#8211; willing to do anything to make that happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had half a dozen interesting posts ready to go out today, but I decided it was inappropriate to return to business as usual after the tragedy at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>
<p>I postponed them. So you won&#8217;t be getting another post today.</p>
<p>This is a time to mourn, to reflect, to be still.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a time to think about the heroic staff at the school who reacted immediately to protect their students.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a time to think about the principal Dawn Hochsprung and the school psychologist Mary Sherlach. When the trouble started, they ran to the shooter instead of hiding.</p>
<p>I saw an interview with a teacher who was distraught. A reader saw the same interview and said this: &#8220;Did you happen to catch the interview with the one teacher (one amazing wonderful woman) who shepherded her class into a bathroom and kept them all assured that they would be ok? She told them, &#8220;i want you all to know I love you.&#8221; She expressed to the interviewer that her thinking was that she was afraid they would die and she wanted to make sure that if they were that the last thing they would remember hearing was not the gunshots, but the sound of someone telling them that they were loved. &#8220;This&#8221; in this era of teacher bashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night I got an email informing me, &#8220;you lost a follower.&#8221; That&#8217;s when I found out that Dawn Hochsprung followed me on Twitter; she followed only 70 people. I was shaken.</p>
<p>Mostly what I thought about was the parents. I have a six-year-old grandson, and I was heartsick for those who lost their babies. Many years ago, one of my children died of leukemia, which was horrible, but how much worse to think that your precious son or daughter was murdered. What unfathomable madness. I don&#8217;t know how you live with that terrible knowledge. The pain is unbearable.</p>
<p>There is no way to make sense of what happened. I ask myself why anyone is allowed to have an assault weapon. I don&#8217;t know why. I ask why and how our society has become so desensitized to violence and at the same time so addicted to it.</p>
<p>I think of the violent video games, the violent movies, the violent conflicts in which we engage around the world. And I think about how many seriously disturbed people see violence as a route to infamy or attention or some fantasy in which they are a super-hero/villain.</p>
<p>We have a lot of thinking to do.</p>
<p>About violence. About our reckless media. About the true heroism of our educators. About how we change our ways of thinking and acting. About how we protect our children. About why we are obsessed about being number 1 instead of spending more time repairing the serious ills of our society.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers.</p>
<p>I just think it&#8217;s time to start asking the right questions.</p>
<p>Please feel free to leave a comment.</p>
