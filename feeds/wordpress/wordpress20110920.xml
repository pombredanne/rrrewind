			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in the back row when Jeff Bezos told the audience, &#8220;There are two ways to build a product. The first: a company starts with their strengths and builds to the needs of the consumer. The second: a company starts with the needs of the consumer and builds (into) the strengths of the company.&#8221; </p>
<p>Bezos continued. Amazon.com is an example of the first. Amazon built logistical strength and educated the customer on the benefits of ecommerce. The Kindle is an example of the second. Kindle started with the consumers need for faster delivery in a digital format and built the infrastructure of the company to satisfy that need.</p>
<div style="float:left;padding:15px;"><img src="http://www.lookingattheleft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/TWO-BRIDGES-C.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Every startup needs to determine which path to pursue from the very beginning. It&#8217;s as true for Amazon&#8217;s Kindle team as it is for any 2 person company. </p>
<p>Each path implies different product development goals and go-to-market strategies. Each path requires different skills and different kinds of team members. Most importantly, each requires a different management style: either one of customer education or one of building a product to meet a vision.</p>
<p>Most of the time, market conditions determine the product development path. </p>
<p>If the market is nascent, like ecommerce in the mid-90s, customer education will be a large part of the go-to-market strategy, in which case, follow Amazon&#8217;s model. In such a market, a startup must iterate the product to determine the resonant customer value proposition. This is a huge task because it is a moving target! As consumers become more educated about a product, their needs and wants will change.  </p>
<p>On the other hand if a market is established, to win market share startups must differentiate their products by better serving the customer. Clay Christensen&#8217;s Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma is the best argument that iterative product development strategies won&#8217;t win large market share in an established market.  Rather, startups must find a disruptive angle, a new way of serving the customer, a unique point of differentiation that provides some barrier to competition from the incumbents. </p>
<p>Be aware of the market type when starting your company. Your product development and go-to-market strategies should reflect the realities of your market. Paraphrasing Shakespeare: &#8220;This above all: to thine own market be true&#8221;. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The bad news:</strong> I dropped my Kindle this morning.</p>
<p><strong>The good news:</strong> I caught it before it hit the floor.</p>
<p><strong>The even worse news:</strong> In so doing, I slammed it against the corner of my desk, smashing the e-ink screen into a starburst of gray, black, and white-plaid shards:</p>
<p><a href="http://kenhinckley.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/kindle-smashed.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1234" title="Kindle-Smashed" src="http://kenhinckley.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/kindle-smashed.jpg?w=500&#038;h=746" alt="The newly fractured landscape of my kindle screen." width="500" height="746" /></a>The man pictured in the screen saver offers his disapproval with a withering half-frown, a <em>my-oh-my-what-have-thee done</em> expression as he finds himself trapped forever in this doomed terrain of shattered e-ink.</p>
<p>So, I guess it&#8217;s back to paper for me until my new Kindle arrives.</p>
<p>For a long time I never thought I would have any use for a Kindle. After all, who wants to read on a computer? And what about marking up the text, dogearing pages, or having more than one book open on my desk at a time?</p>
<p>Well, those behaviors are mostly my self-fueled obsessions when authoring original works of nonfiction. For recreational reading, the mechanisms for highlighting passages and bookmarking pages on the Kindle are, while somewhat clumsy and indirect, still good enough to get the job done.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the instant gratification aspect.</p>
<p>This weekend up I was up at my cabin, at 3000&#8242; elevation and nestled deep in the alpine pinnacles of the Cascade Crest, and I decided that I wanted to read another one of the mystery anthologies edited by Ed Gorman and Martin H. Greenberg because I recently read <a title="By Hook or By Crook" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hook-Crook-Crime-Mystery-Stories/dp/1935562320" target="_blank">By Hook or By Crook </a>on the recommendation of <a title="Kristine Kathryn Rusch recommended reading May 2011" href="http://kriswrites.com/2011/07/16/recommended-reading-list-may-2011/" target="_blank">Kristine Kathryn Rusch </a>and it was fantastic.</p>
<p>So I just brought up the book in the Kindle store, paged through the related reads, and within sixty seconds of the impulse I was reading <a title="Between the Dark and the Daylight" href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Dark-Daylight-Mystery-Stories/dp/B004KAB636" target="_blank">Between the Dark and the Daylight</a>.</p>
<p>But now I have to read the bloody thing on my smartphone until my new Kindle arrives.</p>
<p>And while I wait, it occured to me that the fractured Kindle screen pictured above strikes a perfect image of the publishing industry and the entire state of reading these days. The old world has been shattered by feedback loops in technology and ongoing market forces that just keep reinforcing one another. Paper books ain&#8217;t going away soon, but I&#8217;ll probably live to see the day where they are uncommon for most titles. Bookstores will be relegated to specialty boutique status, like the camera and stationery stores populating the deserted shoals of strip-malls.</p>
<p>And you know what that smells like to me?</p>
<p>Opportunity.</p>
<p>The Courier was one example of how these shifts might spawn whole new experiences or categories of devices. The Amazon Tablet might well be another. But whatever the next hot gadget or gizmo is, rest assured, I feel like a technological wolf, scenting a long series of innovations-to-come in the shifting winds, and I&#8217;ll be looking to make a killing. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  What of tablets with pen and multi-touch? What of <a title="Nicholas Chen's Multi-Slate Reading System" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/14/microsoft-research-backed-e-reader-prototype-cant-keep-its-text/" target="_blank">Nicholas Chen&#8217;s Multi-Slate Reading System</a>, a federation of cheap slates that you can scatter about your office like the glossy marketing brochures you get in the mail, tossed aside for the day where you may or may not read them? What of flexible, paper-like displays?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in the stone age here, folks, as far as e-readers are concerned. We&#8217;ll look back fondly on the Kindle and its ilk as the quaint auto-buggies that presaged a sleek, sophisticated, and nearly unrecognizable future.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I want to be, even if I have to cobble it together with <a title="The Codex Prototype" href="http://kenhinckley.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/classic-microsoft-research-codex/">clunky prototypes</a>, Frankenstein monsters of acrylic and delrin etched out by the laser cutter of my dreams.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you could do a lot worse than to follow <a title="The Business Rusch" href="http://kriswrites.com/business-rusch-table-of-contents/" target="_blank">Kristine Kathryn Rusch</a> and her husband, <a title="Dean Wesley Smith's blog" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/" target="_blank">Dean Wesley Smith</a>, as they talk about what this means for readers and writers and the publishing industry writ large.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">~ Patti Sue Plumer,<br />
American long-distance runner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running is an effective weight-management tool, and it smooths the rough edges on my stress profile, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://minnesotatransplant.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/running-shoes-tight.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3482" title="running shoes tight" src="http://minnesotatransplant.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/running-shoes-tight.jpg?w=278&#038;h=224" alt="" width="278" height="224" /></a>I know for a fact I am bitchier on days I don&#8217;t get exercise. When I need quiet time, I put on my Asics and dash out the door. I often run with my iPod, but when I&#8217;m in a pickle, I leave it behind and just pound the pavement while I think about my breathing.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember a 6-mile run on a summer day five years ago. The day before, I had to lay off two staff members, and it felt like choosing which toes I wanted to have removed. I have no doubt that black day was more awful for the two women I laid off, and I don&#8217;t mean to minimize their experiences as I lament my role in middle-management. But (yes, but!) unless you&#8217;re Cruella DeVille, telling people you&#8217;ve hired and mentored that their contributions are no longer necessary to the company&#8217;s continued success is difficult. Unable to sleep, I got up at 5 a.m. and just ran. It helped me cope with the pit in my stomach.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when I was trying to figure out my place in my new community in Illinois and before I found the great group of friends in my book club, I reveled in the solitude of a run. The little village where I live doesn&#8217;t have culture, shopping or a night life to speak of, but it offers miles of quiet, crime-free roads on which to run.</p>
<p>Last summer, in the midst of an excruciatingly painful custody battle that interfered with my ability to eat (oh, to have such problems), I still ran, albeit more slowly, but I ran. That trial passed, too, but at the time, running was like pounding a pillow for me (and legal, considering the alternatives that crossed my mind).</p>
<p>This week, I am in Minnesota, and my stress is at an all-time low. No employer is placing unreasonable demands on me, and even my unemployment is nothing special in light of the millions of Americans in the same boat. I am surrounded, literally and figuratively, with wonderful friends. My familial relationships are copacetic.</p>
<p>And still, a nice quiet run keeps the peace for me. The volume control on my iPod is acting up (who knows why technology can be so impertinent &#8212; again, to have such problems) so yesterday as I ran around the campground, Hall &amp; Oates&#8217; &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Go For That&#8221; faded away to nothing. I removed my ear buds and listened to the wind in the trees and counted my blessings.</p>

They were licking the salts and minerals from the rock beside the road, they were getting competitive at it by fighting off others. Their fur coats glistened in the sunlight so brightly it was blinding.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&amp;blog=256907&amp;post=1101&amp;subd=freshlypressed&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://alternatetakesblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/beats-rhymes-and-life-and-jazz/beat-rymes-life/" rel="attachment wp-att-1132"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1132" title="Beat-Rymes-Life" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/beat-rymes-life.jpg?w=189&#038;h=300" alt="" width="189" height="300" /></a>When I first heard that there would be a documentary about <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/beatsrhymesandlife/">A Tribe Called Quest</a>, I was completely psyched.  Tribe, as I affectionately call them, has literally been one of the most important parts of the soundtrack to my life &#8212; period.  As paramount as that sounds, scaling it back even one iota would be a crime.  They were just that influential, and impressionable on your girl.  I like Michael Rapaport (though I have some issues with him every now and then) and was interested to find out that this was his project.  I wanted to see where this would go.  Then some months ago, I started hearing mumblings about the documentary having a great deal to do with the public and private turmoil between the group&#8217;s members.  Sure enough, quite a bit of the documentary is dedicated to the frustrations and personal relationships within the group.  The audience learns about the genesis of the group and the dynamic between its members, with Q-Tip being the extrovert perfectionist and motivator (at times to a fault), Phife Dawg being the uniquely talented, but admittedly often distracted artist, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the group&#8217;s centered DJ, whose quiet but introspective demeanor created an air of a role of confidant and often backbone of the group.  But let&#8217;s not let it be more than it actually is; the dynamic between Q-Tip and Phife Dawg being no more than the story of what comes with being friends since the age of 2, and being in a group &#8220;all of your adult life,&#8221; as Phife puts it.  It&#8217;s bound to get to some level of ugly.  But I&#8217;m happy to report that what I saw was ultimately a story about love.</p>
<p>How well was that story told?  Pretty well, in my opinion.  Mainly because the band largely spoke for themselves.  There was little room for opinion from outside sources, which was great on the personal side.  On the musical side, I would have LOVED to see more interviews from those oh-so-relevant perspectives of people like Busta Rhymes.  The main &#8220;outside&#8221; musical perspectives came from Pharrell, Common, The Beastie Boys and Pete Rock; the latter being the one with the most perspective, but probably the least camera and talk time.  No disrespect to any of the other cats mentioned, but when it comes to Tribe, I think what people are most intrigued by is their music, and how they came to that aesthetic.  So I think interviews from other producers of that era would have been really valuable.  Further, to interview some of the artists that Tribe so brilliantly sampled would have added an immense value and appreciation from the fans.  But let&#8217;s move on.</p>
<div id="attachment_1133" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://alternatetakesblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/beats-rhymes-and-life-and-jazz/stalbans_jazz_mural/" rel="attachment wp-att-1133"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1133 " title="stalbans_jazz_mural" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stalbans_jazz_mural.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">St. Albans, Queens New York was home to some of the most important figures in jazz.</p></div>
<p>What was so enjoyable for me was seeing a documentary about hip-hop that talked so much about jazz.  But we <em>are</em> talking about Tribe, here.  And again, since it&#8217;s basically a story told by the group in their own words, and not some other unfortunate style of storytelling that happens so much with music documentaries, the truth was evident and really beautiful to witness.  From the outset of the movie, I automatically felt jazz.  The opening credits were underscored by what sounded like some dope re-harm of &#8220;Scenario&#8221;.  I knew I was in for something special.  Within the first ten minutes of the movie, Jarobi White (an original member of ATCQ, who left the group after their first album) takes the audience on a tour of St. Albans, Queens, and its famous jazz mural.  St. Albans, where Q-Tip and Phife grew up, was at some point, home to John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Illinois Jacquet, and Count Basie &#8212; just to name a few.  For Tribe, the mural was a symbol of the influence that jazz would have on the group, and the affluence that they hoped to attain, moving up in the world both artistically and socially.  As the story unfolds, we learn about how the group developed musical and personal relationships with The Jungle Brothers, and De La Soul, and how they would get their first big break through the iconic New York-based DJ Red Alert (who happened to be the uncle of Jungle Brother member Mike Gee).  A Tribe Called Quest also subsequently received the largest recording advance ever given to a hip-hop group at that time.</p>
<p>Above anything else, in this documentary, you see how much Black culture influenced this ground-breaking group, with Q-Tip drawing consistent parallels to jazz, soul and even comedy.  You get to really see first-hand how ingrained their culture is, as even in casual conversation, Tip references Stevie Wonder or Duke Ellington to illustrate his points.  He divulges the back story behind the curious &#8220;El Segundo&#8221; explaining that it was a part of a phrase Redd Foxx often said on the sitcom <em>Sanford and Son</em>.  The Roots&#8217; Black Thought called Tribe the &#8220;Miles Davis of their time,&#8221; when discussing their seemingly odd and Afro-Centric attire saying of that time &#8220;..they just know about some shit we&#8217;re obviously not up on.&#8221;</p>
<p>This point can also be applied to their signature sampling style.  A Tribe Called Quest brilliantly ushered in a huge wave of jazz lovers, who may or may not know that they&#8217;ve become indoctrinated.  Songs like &#8220;Bonita Applebum,&#8221; &#8220;Check the Rhyme,&#8221; and &#8220;Electric Relaxation&#8221; are loved equally (if not more) for the musical as well as lyrical content.  Q-Tip discloses a few of his samples, and credits his father as one of his earliest influences:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Back in the day when I was a teenager<br />
Before I had status and before I had a pager</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>You could find the Abstract listening to hip-hop</em><br />
<em> My pops used to say it reminded him of be-bop</em><br />
<em> &#8211; Q-Tip on &#8220;Excursions&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://alternatetakesblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/beats-rhymes-and-life-and-jazz/l_smith_drives/" rel="attachment wp-att-1136"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1136" title="L_Smith_Drives" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/l_smith_drives.jpeg?w=298&#038;h=300" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a>Q-Tip, who was the groups most prominent producer, shows a glimpse of his inner music junkie as he sits in a chair with a single turntable, and holds up a Lonnie Smith album that he sampled for &#8220;Check the Rhyme.&#8221;  He talks about buying the album for five dollars from a record store called Jazz Record Center.  The film also follows the group venturing to a record store, walking past posters from John Coltrane, Lee Morgan, and Grant Green, as they flip through albums, and scratch and cut on the stores set-up turntable.  It was this type of visual insight that made this film so remarkable.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It&#8217;s not all fun and games, as the documentary chronicles Phife Dawg&#8217;s long-time bout with diabetes, and show&#8217;s how it affected his family, and the group.  They discuss the ultimate falling out between he and Q-Tip at the 2008 Rock the Bells tour, and Phife&#8217;s need for a kidney transplant soon after.  But it also shows the redemption of friendship, when he receives a text from Q-Tip that read &#8220;Godspeed&#8221; before Phife&#8217;s kidney transplant surgery (his wife was his donor).  It ends pulling on the heart strings of its audience, as Ali Shaheed spins &#8220;The Chase Part II&#8221; while Q-Tip and Phife practice dance moves for the song.  The innocence in that boyish moment seemingly makes it all worthwhile. The documentary closes with a little known tease-fact which stated that the group still has one more album on their original 1989 contract with Jive Records.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hmmm&#8230;..</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All in all, I thought that this was a job really well done.  Rappaport seemed to have taken more than a few pointers from his former employer Spike Lee, and it paid off.  For the oober Tribe fan, who is probably the largest audience this film will garner, it was a film with enough little-known-facts, as well as all of the reverie and sentimentality that we all wanted to experience.  Two thumbs up.♦</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>For all the jazz hip-hop junkies, if you&#8217;re interested in the jazz samples of Tribe and others during this  era in hip-hop, I recommend an album from Blue Note Records called Droppin&#8217; Science.  You will hear many of your favorite hip-hop samples in a new light.  For example:</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thefrailestthing.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/why_dont_students_like_school1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2890" title="why_dont_students_like_school1" src="http://thefrailestthing.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/why_dont_students_like_school1.jpg?w=240&#038;h=362" alt="" width="240" height="362" /></a>Google may or may not being making us stupid, but it does appear to render human memory obsolete. By now most of us have probably heard someone suggest that with Google functioning as our reliable and ubiuqitous <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/07/14/the-extended-mind-–-how-google-affects-our-memories/">prosthetic memory</a>, it is no longer necessary to waste time or mental effort memorizing facts. This is usually taken to be a positive development since our brains are now assumed to be free from the menial work of remembering to do the more serious work of creative and critical thinking.</p>
<p>This sounds plausible enough and gains a certain credence from our own experience. Some time ago we began noticing that we no longer know anyone&#8217;s phone number. We&#8217;re doing well if we can remember our own. Ever since cell phones started storing numbers, we stopped remembering them. And for the most part we&#8217;re no worse for it, except, of course, for those instances when we need someone&#8217;s number but we can&#8217;t access our phones for whatever reason. But those situations tend to be few and far between and on the whole we have little reason to begin memorizing all the numbers in our directories.</p>
<p>We should, however, think twice about extending that line of reasoning much beyond phone numbers. In his 2009 book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047059196X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thefrathi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=047059196X">Why Don&#8217;t Students Like School</a></em>, <a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/about.html">Daniel Willingham</a>, a cognitive scientist at the University of Virginia challenges this popular line of reasoning and argues instead for the importance of storing factual knowledge in our long term memory.</p>
<p>Willingham notes that disparaging the need to memorize facts has a long and distinguished history in American education that predates the emergence of the Internet and of Google as a verb form. He cites, for example, J. D. Everett who in 1873 warned that,</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a great danger in the present day lest science-teaching should degenerate into the accumulation of disconnected facts and unexplained formulae, which burden the memory without cultivating the understanding.</p></blockquote>
<p>The modern day version of this concern leads to the notion that &#8220;instead of learning facts, it&#8217;s better to practice critical thinking, to have students work at evaluating all the information available on the Internet rather than trying to commit some small part of it to memory.&#8221; Contrary to this fashionable assumption, Willingham argues that that &#8220;very processes that teachers care about most &#8212; critical thinking processes such as reasoning and problem solving &#8212; are intimately intertwined with factual knowledge that is stored in long-term memory (not just found in the environment).&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that we tend to conceive of thinking analogously to how we imagine a computer works and we abstract processes from data. We treat &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; as a <em>process</em> that can be taught independently of any specific data or information. On the contrary, according to Willingham, the findings of cognitive science suggest that &#8220;[c]ritical thinking processes are tied to background knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;we must ensure that students acquire background knowledge parallel with practicing critical thinking skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Willingham offers three main points in support of his claim listed here with a few explanatory excerpts:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Background knowledge stored in long term memory is essential to reading comprehension</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">a. it provides vocabulary</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">b. it allows you to bridge logical gaps that writers leave</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">c. it allows chunking, which increases room in working memory and thereby makes it easier to tie ideas together</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">d. it guides the interpretation of ambiguous sentences</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Background knowledge is necessary for cognitive skills</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">a. &#8220;Memory is the cognitive process of first resort. When faced with a problem, you will first search for a solution in memory &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">b. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">Chunking</a> facilitated by available knowledge in long term memory enhances reasoning as well as reading comprehension.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">c. &#8220;Much of what experts tell us they do in the course of thinking about their field requires background knowledge, even if it&#8217;s not described that way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Factual knowledge improves your memory</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">a. &#8220;when you have background knowledge your mind connects the material you&#8217;re reading with what you already know about the topic, even if you&#8217;re not aware that it&#8217;s happening&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">b. &#8220;having factual knowledge in long-term memory makes it easier to acquire still more factual knowledge&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the implications for the classroom that Willingham explores, the following are worth mentioning:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. &#8220;Shallow knowledge is better than no knowledge&#8221;: You can&#8217;t have deep knowledge about everything, but shallow knowledge of some areas, while not ideal, is better than nothing. It&#8217;s at least something to build on and work with.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. &#8220;Do whatever you can to get kids to read&#8221;: In Willingham&#8217;s view, nothing helps build a wide knowledge base  better than reading and lots of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. &#8220;Knowledge must be meaningful&#8221;: Memorizing random lists of disconnected facts is not only harder, but ultimately less helpful.</p>
<p>That last point acknowledges that mere rote memorization and incessant drilling can be fruitless and counterproductive. Of course, that much should be obvious. What is no longer obvious, and what Willingham compellingly demonstrates, is that storing up factual knowledge in long term memory is not the enemy of thought, but rather its necessary precondition.</p>
<p>It would appear that the rhetoric of offloaded memory ignores the findings of cognitive science and leads to ineffective educational practice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer &#8220;vacation&#8221; in Korea isn&#8217;t quite the same as most students and teachers have it back in the US &#8211; for most Korean students, it means just as much studying at private schools, and for me and other EPIK teachers it means extra teaching at special English camps. So while Korean schools don&#8217;t officially run year-round, students never really get a break from studying &#8211; ever (at least until they graduate high school).</p>
<p>Over July and August, I spent three weeks at a school in a remote location in Ulsan and 1 week at my school. Teaching for 6-10 hours a day can be quite stressful, but it&#8217;s not all bad. Really, it can be quite a bit better than regular school teaching. At camps, I&#8217;ve gotten to plan and teach a lot of my own lessons, and the students are generally much more motivated to learn English. After my overnight 5th grade English camp last winter, I saw my students&#8217; levels transform, as well as their enthusiasm for learning which they still have months later. So when the option came up to teach another three-week overnight camp for summer, I didn&#8217;t hesitate to sign up. Although I did try my best not to get assigned teaching grammar this time&#8230;which I found to be a rather unfortunate subject to be stuck with for 7 hours a day last camp.</p>
<p>A bit of background on these English camps &#8211; 5th and 6th grade students are shipped off to a secluded campus for three weeks (with breaks on the weekends) of intensive English studying with lots of foreign teachers. The camps are organized by the public system, and in Ulsan it&#8217;s done by the MOE (Metropolitan Office of Education). They have classes from 9 in the morning to 9 at night or later, only breaking for meals and perhaps a bit of PE time. To me it seems a bit ridiculous to have 10 and 11 year-olds in classes for 10 hours a day, but that&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m not Korean.</p>
<p>For summer camp, I was working with all 6th grade students off in the very southern corner of Ulsan at Seosaeng Middle School, on a tiny peninsula sticking out into the East Sea. Based on my two camp experiences and anecdotal evidence, the first day of camp generally goes like this: get picked up by a bus carrying a bunch of students. Meet the frazzled Korean teacher in charge of your bus. Make the ~1 hour drive to camp, receive some vague instructions about what to do upon arrival. Arrive at camp, find your room, try to follow vague instructions previously given. Receive different instructions several times while students and teachers wander aimlessly. Wait. Be prepared to be in a classroom of 16-60 tired, shy students eager to be entertained with no planned activities or help from a Korean co-teacher for 1-4 hours. Stay positive! After the first day, everything should settle down into a relatively set schedule.</p>
<p>Our dorm situation at camp brought with it some more interesting problems the first day: all of the foreign teachers were in one wing of the building, with one bathroom to share and no where to shower. Eventually, they told us there was one shower room for boys and one for girls, which was an open room to be shared with all of the students! The school dorm management didn&#8217;t seem to understand that this was not &#8220;OK.&#8221; But by the end of the day, they had it sorted out so we wouldn&#8217;t have to shower with the students, and we had a &#8220;sink shower&#8221; room for female staff with some semi-private shower curtains. Having living in Korea for a while and beet to the jimjilbang/public spas has made me a bit more immune to nudity, but I&#8217;m not quite ready to shower with all of my students&#8230;</p>
<p>Living in a dirty middle school dorm room for 3 weeks was a bit less than ideal, but it did have a very nice view:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158356146/" title="DSC06025 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6158356146_fa7d29dc41.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSC06025"></a></p>
<p>Every day the class schedule was two hours of grammar, reading and vocabulary, an hour of speaking and an hour of &#8220;song&#8221;. That left two hours for &#8220;special activities&#8221;. I lucked out in getting a pretty laid back arts &amp; crafts activity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158353266/" title="DSC06022 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6158353266_6c37086ab1_z.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="DSC06022"></a></p>
<p>Little paper dragonflies that balance on their nose. It was a pretty simple idea suggested by my co-teacher, and the kids were totally into it! 아싸!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158354652/" title="DSC06023 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6158354652_2c06024c5c_z.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="DSC06023"></a></p>
<p>The biggest obstacle of camp was preparing a song and dance for the Song Festival. Aiiigo, aiiiiiigo. I felt like it was a bit much to expect us to choreograph a dance and teach it and a song to our students within the little spare time afforded by the camp schedule, but the results were actually pretty great. Upon arriving to camp, we were told that the song we selected to teach each night would be our song for the festival. I had &#8220;Another Brick in the Wall,&#8221; which was quickly vetoed by my class as too slow and boring. They instead chose a song by some awful British pop act McFly, which had been in some Korean drama. It was beyond awful, but absolutely adored by the students. And it&#8217;s all for them anyway.</p>
<p>Teaching &#8220;Another Brick in the Wall&#8221; was an interesting failure&#8230; I thought something in it might resonate with the students, who are studying all day and at 12 are starting to feel the seeds of rebellious teenage angst. But it didn&#8217;t quite work out. Most students couldn&#8217;t have cared less, no matter what I tried. I think I reached about 10 students out of the 100-200 I had, and only had a couple of classes that I felt good about. Eventually I gave up and switched to James Brown &#8220;I Feel Good,&#8221; because at least it would make me happy and let me get totally goofy. And it actually got an entire class up and dancing! My best 20 minutes of camp.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6157814293/" title="DSC06030 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6183/6157814293_6048e8cb8e_z.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSC06030"></a><br />
One of the highlights was &#8220;Octopus&#8217;s Garden&#8221; by the Beatles. So cute! Next time, I&#8217;m choosing a song with an animal theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158358598/" title="DSC06031 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6158358598_b3a86cd6dd_z.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="DSC06031"></a><br />
The boys from my homeroom class.</p>
<p>So camp was a big difficult, particularly aapting to the schedule hearing &#8220;Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!&#8221; &#8220;Teacher! Teacher!&#8221; non-stop all day, every day except for the hours you&#8217;re sleeping. But then after 3 weeks, it&#8217;s over!! And you get all these letters:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6157820789/" title="DSC06433 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6157820789_919a389ed3_z.jpg" width="473" height="640" alt="DSC06433"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158360896/" title="DSC06428 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6158360896_2dcbb5d770_z.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="DSC06428"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6157819739/" title="DSC06429 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6157819739_b88b413be9_z.jpg" width="500" height="415" alt="DSC06429"></a></p>
<p>And they overwhelm all of the bad memories of camp and you wonder&#8230;maybe I <em>could</em> do it again next time!</p>
<p>But apparently that won&#8217;t be a question to consider because the camps are no more! Or so I heard. I guess they&#8217;re too expensive. Ah well. They were &#8230;interesting while they lasted.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>A week later, I had my school&#8217;s camp. Which was 6 hours a day of whatever I wanted to do with a group of 4th-6th graders. I was pretty excited about this never-before-had freedom, and got to work in a lot of group projects and non-English subjects. Each day had a theme: The World, Animals, Science, Fairy Tales, and Superheroes.</p>
<p>Animal Day:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158364730/" title="DSC06440 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6180/6158364730_bdf4fb3068_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC06440"></a><br />
I ripped off this mask design from something I found online but thought it looked pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6159231060/" title="Summer English Camp by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6159231060_072cd2d144.jpg" width="500" height="328" alt="Summer English Camp"></a><br />
This is from &#8220;Oktapodi: the sequel&#8221; inspired from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=badHUNl2HXU" title="this" target="_blank">this</a> great animated short.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6159231864/" title="Summer English Camp by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6085/6159231864_997da18005.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="Summer English Camp"></a><br />
There&#8217;s an alien fishing with a big worm. She sees the octopi and says, &#8220;Lets go with the cosmos.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also redid my dragonfly craft, which was great once again! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158367474/" title="DSC06445 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6081/6158367474_7fd6d38e32.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSC06445"></a></p>
<p>And I was really excited to do a reading and writing activity based around superhero comics. First we read a bunch of comics that I had made. Then we discussed how to make a comic, and the students had to make their own&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158372666/" title="DSC06456 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6153/6158372666_8c313554cb.jpg" width="500" height="365" alt="DSC06456"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6158373894/" title="DSC06457 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6158373894_ff1dc0c11a.jpg" width="500" height="371" alt="DSC06457"></a><br />
It looks like there&#8217;s something inappropriate happening between Superman and Wonder Woman. And perhaps Catwoman is having a wardrobe malfunction?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6157832741/" title="DSC06458 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6079/6157832741_abb95b44b3.jpg" width="500" height="379" alt="DSC06458"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annieminna/6157834389/" title="DSC06459 by annieminna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6066/6157834389_efa0b11b19.jpg" width="500" height="402" alt="DSC06459"></a><br />
I like this a lot.</p>
<p>The comic book activity ended up being a bit too much about coloring, and a bit too little about English. But I think it could be modified into something really great. I was quite pleased with the results.</p>
<p>Looking back on summer camps after having started regular classes again, they look <em>good</em>. Even with all the work. And I&#8217;m happy that the last thing I do before I leave Korea for good in February will be my school&#8217;s winter camp. Oh, the possibilities&#8230;</p>

<p>I have become <strong>THAT girl</strong> that will ask you&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my god, do you watch Mad Men?&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you love Don Draper?&#8221; &#8220;Could I work in advertising?&#8221; &#8220;How do I dress like Joan?&#8221; &#8220;Have you been to Banana Republic lately to see the collection?&#8221; <strong>&#8220;Mad Men Mad Men Mad Men blah blah blah&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The love has been <strong>sudden and swift</strong>, and all thanks to Netflix streaming. Last night Mad Men won the <strong>Emmy for best drama series</strong>. Not only does it bring some validity to my love of this  show, but it also gives me an excuse to blog about Don &amp; the gang.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Four reasons YOU should love Mad Men&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Don Draper</strong></p>
<p>He&#8217;s dapper and super attractive, a <strong>real man&#8217;s man</strong> in the 1960&#8242;s. As the main character, the life of Don (played by John Hamm) is in a <strong>constant upheaval</strong> which makes for great television. He is a smooth talker and is able to <strong>charm you</strong> from the screen (don&#8217;t even get me started on his many romantic conquests) <strong>Don would my perfect guy</strong>, if he wasn&#8217;t so conniving, didn&#8217;t cheat, and hasn&#8217;t lied about basically everything&#8230;You love him, adore him, and hate him at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>2. The setting</strong></p>
<p>1960&#8242;s, New York, Advertising Agency. It&#8217;s a whole other world, with <strong>endless cigarettes and drinks in hand.</strong> The production design and script really brings you to the <strong>heart of this time</strong> period. Themes addressed, include feminism, sexism, and homophobia.<strong> It&#8217;s real, gritty, and also glamorized</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3. The fashion</strong></p>
<p>They certainly knew how to dress in the early 1960&#8242;s. Mad Men has sparked a <strong>whole new interest</strong> in traditional men&#8217;s suits, full skirts, and patterns. It&#8217;s hard not to love the<strong> glamour, sophistication, and sex appeal</strong> of Mad Men fashion. My favorite style from Mad Men is of the character <strong>Joan Holloway</strong>, who dresses her hour-glass silhouette in <strong>office to night attire</strong>. The intense office manager of the agency, Joan is always impeccably dressed in <strong>curve-hugging pencil skirts, bright, jewel-toned colors, and shift dresses</strong>. It&#8217;s vintage fashion in it&#8217;s element, and I can&#8217;t get enough of it.</p>
<p><strong>4. The characters</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have a great television series without <strong>memorable characters with a compelling story-lines</strong>. Mad Men not only follows Don around, but includes us in the life of his co-workers. Notable characters include <strong>Joan</strong>, who has multiple sides to her, from tough-talking manager to a woman trying to find her place in the office. You have the the ambitious ad executive <strong>Peter Campbell</strong> with his annoying, over the top housewife Trudy. The cut-throat, senior partner <strong>Roger Sterling</strong>, who is manages to get everything he wants (including women) without lifting a finger. My hands down favorite character has to be the wholesome, go-getter <strong>Peggy Olson</strong>. In a nod to the sexism of the time, Peggy is the secretary who is trying to work her way up in the agency. She is<strong> smart, confident, and the character I most relate to in the show.</strong> You can&#8217;t help but root for Peggy in this 1960&#8242;s man&#8217;s world.</p>
