			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Had I known what the weather would be like for the next eight days, I might have acted more promptly. I had come to Darjeeling not only to see the marvellous hill-town, but also for its famous views of the Himalayas. It never occurred to me that seeing them would prove so difficult.</p>
<p>The first morning I awoke in Darjeeling the horizon was shrouded in a veil of haze. The room was cold with the seeping air outside and for the first time since arriving in India, I nestled under the blankets, feeling deliciously comfortable. The last two days had been exhausting days of travel – from Rishikesh to Delhi, across to Siliguri courtesy of Kingfisher Air, then up to Darjeeling by jeep – and I was happy to take it easy. I sat on my bed and snacked on biscuits, reading about the town.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3392-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1444" title=" Darjeeling flats" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3392-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="742" /></a></p>
<p>Darjeeling had only come into prominence in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. The locale first came to the attention of the British East India Company (BEIC) in 1828, when a delegation of company officials stayed in the town and realised how suitable the site would be for a military sanatorium. In 1835, the company leased the area west of the Mahananda River from the Chogyal of Sikkim, traditional rulers of the region. Over the next fifteen years, the population of Darjeeling grew one-hundredfold, thanks to the company’s policy of attracting workers to the region, mostly of Nepalese origin.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4644-darjeeling-bearers-bw.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1453" title="Darjeeling Bearers BW" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4644-darjeeling-bearers-bw.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="361" /></a></p>
<p>When, in 1849, the British East India Company Director Arthur Campbell was imprisoned by the Sikkim Chogyal, the BEIC sent a force to free him, resulting in the annexation of 1700 square kilometres of territory. In the following decades, the BEIC strengthened its grip on the region, gaining control of the passes through the hills, the town of Kalimpong and the area east of the Teesta river, from the Sikkim. In 1864 the town became the official summer capital of the Bengal presidency and by 1866 the district had assumed its current shape and size.</p>
<p>Commercial tea cultivation began in the region in the 1850s and many schools were set up missionaries. In 1881 the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was opened, connecting the town with the plains far below and further increasing the pace of the town’s development.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4583-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1452" title="The so-called Toy Train, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4583-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>When, after independence in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with West Bengal, tensions began to increase between the largely Nepalese population of the hill towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong, and the Bengali population of the plains below. The Nepalese population agitated for an autonomous state and the recognition of the Nepali language as the official language of the region. The latter request was granted in 1961. When, in 1975, Sikkim was recognised as an independent state, it again brought calls from the people of the mountains for a separate state of Gorkhaland, with occasional eruptions of violence. In 1988 an agreement between the government and the Gorkha National Liberation Front resulted in the creation of the Darjeeling Hill Council. This, however, did not quell calls for a separate state, and agitation and protest continue to this day. In 2011 the government granted further concessions, with the creation of a new and autonomous elected body called the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, which, whilst not governing a separate state, has more powers than its predecessor.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4983-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1457" title="Darjeeling, misty houses" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4983-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="767" /></a></p>
<p>I found myself quite fascinated by the town’s history and was keen to explore further. Not only did Darjeeling offer exciting views, amazing geography, fascinating architecture, great tea and an interesting ethnic blend, but, perhaps most importantly, the large Nepali population guaranteed one thing: momos – and I love eating good momos.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3417-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1445" title="The school run, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3417-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="744" /></a></p>
<p>At half past nine I found the housekeeper in the corridor outside my room. As soon as she saw me, she said:</p>
<p>“Your room is ready.”</p>
<p>“Great. Can I move now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Come, I’ll show you. It’s here.”</p>
<p>The room was diagonally opposite, across the hall – a mere ten feet away. She opened the door and presented it to me. It was smaller than the previous room, but with a double bed, coffee table and chairs, wall-mounted television, a bedside dresser and a stunning, wide-angle view of the drop into the valley below and across the foothills. At four hundred rupees, a mere ten dollars Australian, it also came with a large en suite. I stood by the windows and thought of the views I might expect when the sky cleared. For now, the horizon was covered in cloud and haze, and I could barely see into the floor of the valley below; the mist rested like hands upon the hilltops, fingers stretching down the wooded slopes.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3624-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1446" title="Darjeeling, heavy clouds" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3624-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>It took two minutes to shift my few belongings and, at ten o’clock I set off in search of breakfast.</p>
<p>I followed the road down the hill, past the little restaurant and shop in which I’d dined the night before. After a steep and winding leg the street levelled out at what appeared to be another informal jeep-stop. Here the road split into two tiers and, at this junction of climbing streets, stood a triangular building with a rounded prow: Keventer’s restaurant. I’d seen the name in the guide book and knew it to be rather famous, as a shop, in the downstairs section, but primarily for its café / restaurant upstairs. What made this Raj-era throwback popular, apart from its relative antiquity, was the amount of meat on its menu.</p>
<p>Since arriving in India, I hadn’t eaten any meat whatsoever – this despite ordering a mutton biriani in Rajasthan, which contained two large pieces of gristle that I promptly discarded. Here at Keventer’s they offered a variety of meat products, almost all made from chicken and pork: meatballs, sausages, bacon and the like. I sat right near the kitchen – a counter behind which men cooked methodically – in the run-down old interior. Around the walls hung pictures of the views across to the mountains, which only served to whet my appetite for the peaks I’d come to see.</p>
<p>I ordered pork meatballs and bacon and eggs, drawn wholly in by the old world atmosphere. The view offered a splendid fore and mid-ground of rusted, corrugated rooves and wonky wooden frames stacked down the forested hillsides.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5103-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1458" title="Darjeeling - not actually the view from Keventer's!" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5103-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The coffee was not great, but passable, and I soon fell to chatting with two young Indian guys; students up from Calcutta. They were friendly and charming and curious about the photos I ’d been taking. After a while they invited me to drinks that evening, and I said I’d certainly consider it, though I knew somehow that I wouldn’t go and felt an early regret at this. Having spent most days walking and taking photographs through the daylight hours, I was almost always too tired to be sociable at the end of the day. I was also enjoying staying completely off the booze on this journey.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I took a long walk around town; down to the bottom of the town, where I’d arrived the night before.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4993-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1450" title="Schoolkids, Chowrasta, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4993-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>I wandered through the back streets, up and down long flights of steps; found a lane with closely packed stalls behind which men and women worked with old Singer sewing machines. I shook hands with locals, answered their friendly inquiries as to where I was from, and eventually wandered into the meat market. There, in this dirty old shed hung with carcasses, I chatted with several of the butchers and asked them about their work.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3656-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1447" title="Butcher, Darjeeling - Not the mince man!" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3656-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="765" /></a></p>
<p>One man approached me and said:</p>
<p>“Come with me. I’ll show you how I make mince.”</p>
<p>He led me to a corner of the shed, where, on a heavy, round wooden chopping block, using only a machete, he threw down pieces of meat and hacked them into mince with swift, strong blows.</p>
<p>“How long have you been doing this for?” I asked; a little squeamish from the proximity of his fingers to the blade.</p>
<p>“For twenty years,” he replied. “I am the mince man!”</p>
<p>I watched him hack away at the mince for a couple of minutes; lifting the blade just a short distance and bringing it down with surprising force and accuracy. I took out my video camera to film his impressive action, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he had turned the large chunks of fatty meat into finely chopped mince.</p>
<p>“There,” he said. “Mince!”</p>
<p>“Bravo!”</p>
<p>I thanked him for showing me his trade and farewelled him.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3658-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1448" title="Cured goat's head, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3658-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>I continued my wandering about town, plunging into the tight alleyways of shops and stalls. As with so many places in Asia, the businesses tended to group together according to what they sold: spices, shoes, tea, vegetables. I drifted in and out of the lanes, taking photographs here and there. Most people were friendly and generous with their smiles. Unlike other places I&#8217;d been in India, rather than trying to sell me things, they seemed merely to want to be acknowledged.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3661-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1470" title="Fish vendor, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3661-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>I took a walk around the circuit of Observatory Hill, then returned to Chowrasta, the main piazza next to Observatory Hill at the top of the town. The horizon remained shrouded and I could see only the foothills. These, however, were beautiful in the dull light; wet and fecund, cool and, here and there, dressed with tea.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4504-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1455" title="Tea plantations, Darjeeling" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4504-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Three o’clock found me sitting in another Raj-era café, Glenary’s bakery and restaurant, situated just a little up the hill from Keventer’s. The pale mint walls, white wooden beams, wicker chairs and corrugated iron roof gave it a classically colonial appearance. I sat in the back section, like a wide, closed-in verandah, where a bay of windows faced the valley and the still-obscured mountains. I surfed the internet, ate pastries and drank two rather disappointing cups of tea. As the afternoon had progressed, the air had become increasingly damp with pending fog, until finally, at around a quarter past three, it began to rain.</p>
<p>Having been in India a month during the dry season and having seen no rain for some time, the idea of rain had hardly occurred to me. Perhaps some uprush of humid air from the Sundarbarns had met with the chill mountain breath and dropped its bucket, but whatever the case, once the rain began, it came down hard as hell. It poured for two hours, with little let up, striking hard on the iron roof. It was as beautiful as it was surprising, and for a long while I sat and watched figures darting through the wet below, with torrents in the gutters and cascades from the rooves. The pigeons opposite, huddled under the eaves, were positively ruffled on their multi-generational pile of droppings.</p>
<p>When the rain did finally stop, something extraordinary happened. I was sitting, face pressed close to the glass, watching the play of mist and light across the valley, when suddenly the clouds parted and opened a clear view to the horizon. All the haze had been washed from the sky, which was transformed to a pale blue, dotted with cotton wool clouds. I tried to shoot through the window but the curve of the hill blocked the bulk of the view. I wanted a clear line of sight, for I was dying to see Mount Kangchenjunga, the third highest peak in the world at nearly 8600 metres tall.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3593-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1454" title="When the mist briefly cleared - dim view from Glenary's restaurant" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3593-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I stood up, stuffed my lap top into my bag, sorted myself out and hurried off. It was still drizzling a little, and, worried about my camera, instead of going straight to find a vantage point, I decided to head back to the Hotel Tranquillity (sic) to pick up the small but sturdy umbrella I’d packed in a moment of boy-scout foresight. I raced back to the hotel, which took a good ten minutes, grabbed my umbrella and was about to head off, when I heard voices from the roof, just up the next flight from my room. I walked up the stairs where a door opened out on a flat concrete roof, flooded with rain. Here I found Tenzing, the hotel’s owner, talking with two other guests.</p>
<p>“Hello!” said Tenzing. “Come to see the mountains?”</p>
<p>“I hope so!”</p>
<p>The two other guests were also Australian and we smiled and nodded at each other. Their attention, however, as mine was soon to be, was rooted in the distance. And there, sure enough, was Mount Kangchenjunga. I gasped when first I saw it, amazed by its sheer size. How high up it seemed to go into the sky! It had an almost unnatural quality to it, as though its extension from the Earth was somehow impossible. How could anything be so big? The towering peaks of stone and snow were nothing short of fantastical. The only problem was that much of the view was blocked by an inconveniently placed radio antenna, a hill and trees. I could see roughly half of the mountain, and that through a tilting of the head and shifting of angles.</p>
<p>I looked as well as I could, but the lack of a clear line of sight was simply too frustrating. I needed a new vantage point, for now clearly was the time to go shoot the mountain. I took a few snaps, made some cheery remarks, then fled down the stairs and out onto Dr Zakir Hussain Street, figuring I should make for the road that circumnavigated Observatory Hill. I scurried down the street towards Chowrasta, past all the stalls, butchers, fishmongers, bakers, fruit and vegetable sellers, chicken and egg sellers; many of them seated up on the boards of their wooden stalls.</p>
<p><a href="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4650-darjeeling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1449" title="Entrance to Chowrasta" src="http://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4650-darjeeling.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>When I reached Chowrasta, however, I could see already that I was too late. The sky in the distance was thickening again with white mist and soon everything would be hidden. I broke into a run, down along the side of this hill with its famous monastery and tall Japanese cedars. Yet, by the time I reached the far end of the road, the mountains had once again vanished behind haze and cloud. I stood cursing, deeply regretting having gone back to get my umbrella, and shook a fist at the sky. I wasn’t sure quite how long I was planning to stay in Darjeeling, but figured that some time in the next couple of days I ought to see clear skies. The rain began to come down again and I popped up my umbrella. Stuff, it, I thought, there’s always tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear man sitting opposite me on the train</p>
<p>Why do you look so sad? Do you secretly yearn to be a circus acrobat, resplendent in your sequinned leotard and cape? Me too! We have so much in common. We should start a club! Do you have a leotard? Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t either, so we&#8217;ll go shopping at the weekend.<br />
I bet you’re also dealing with the fact that you’ll never ride a motorbike across America, stopping off in small towns and defeating local baddies who make everyone’s lives miserable and who have moustaches. It’s amazing how similar we are. Should we invite the lady sitting on your right? On second thoughts, she looks like she probably did that already. She can&#8217;t join our club.<br />
Anyway. I’ll make some special membership hats. Ideally, they should be made from raccoons, but I don’t know where to get raccoons. Do you have any ideas? Actually, never mind. You just focus on the leotards.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I understand that this is a bold statement and that many of you out there love Web MD, myself included. However, time and again, I have gone to the site only to feel panicked and worried by my visit. It has a way of feeding my hypochondria that the medical dictionary my mother keeps in a kitchen cabinet does not.</p>
<p>The first time that Web MD led me astray was when I had mono during my sophomore year of college. They call mono the “kissing disease” because it is supposedly transferred through saliva, however it is also an airborne illness. The “kissing disease” moniker attracted a lot of unnecessary questions regarding who I had been kissing. If you knew me, you knew it was no one because of my relative lack of a social life, as aforementioned in the last blog titled, “It’s Not Me, It’s You.”</p>
<p>My doctor at the time had not treated many people with mono, as it is usually a childhood disease (cooties and all). After receiving my tests back, he panicked in reaction to my “alarmingly low” white blood cell count. He called my mother and told her to take me to Children’s Hospital immediately because they have a better handle on childhood diseases, even though he feared that I may have something more sinister like Lupus or Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. My mother proceeded to have a melt down before she called me to tell me the news. At 20 years old, I had very little idea what either of these things were, so I hit up Web MD. After reading a few articles, I had myself convinced that I had one of these ill fated diseases and was subsequently on my death bed.</p>
<p>So, before heading to the hospital I began making a mental note of my will. I would donate all of my books to the library, my brother could have my room (if my parents hadn’t decided to make it into a shrine), my clothes were a wash and were also to be donated, my movies would go to my friend Rachel because she is the only other person I know that likes “The Skeleton Key“, and my friend Nicole could have whatever CD’s I had accumulated that were not Elton John or Billy Joel.</p>
<p>While waiting in the hospital waiting room, I was forced to wear a surgical mask over my mouth so as not to spread any contagions to the children. Needless to say people couldn’t help but stare and sneakily point at me. Not only was I 20 years old and at Children’s Hospital, but I was wearing a mask. I may as well have had a neon sign over top of me saying something like, “I have the bird flu,” or “This is the beginning of the pandemic of your nightmares, where everyone turns into a zombie.” Five hours later, when I was finally seen by a doctor, they were perplexed as to why I was there. Apparently mono and low white blood cell counts are synonymous.</p>
<p>The second time Web MD led me to believe that I may need to fear for my life was recently. I had been dealing with a pretty nasty sinus infection for a few weeks. I just could not knock it. I heard about a surgery where you could have your sinuses drained and alleviate some of the sinus pressure, gross I know.  So, I decided to look up my symptoms on Web MD to see what the possible cures for a sinus infection were. After typing in the symptoms, a few different ailments came up on the screen. Listed as the top possibility for the symptoms I was having was cyanide poisoning.</p>
<p>I felt fairly certain that no one in my house was trying to poison me, but I have always had a sneaking suspicion that my beagle would like to off me and take my position in the family. Just in case her evil plan was being put into action, I checked the history on both computers in our house. To my relief, no one had searched cyanide poisoning. Touché Web MD, you fooled me again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other failed diagnoses from Web MD:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>- Fatigue, weight gain, hair growth, nail growth, and feeling of nausea at the smell of things that you used to like.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>- You are a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>- Ask someone to shoot you with a silver bullet or have someone shoot the werewolf who bit you with a silver bullet. Those are your only two options.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>- Loss of appetite, weight loss, irritability, and fever.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>- You have scurvy.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>- Drink some orange juice or buy an eye patch and set sea with the pirates. ARR!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc437/kendallamsterdam/51fd5022.jpg" alt="Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App" width="490" height="490" border="0" /></p>
<p>Seattle experienced a Snowpocalypse a couple weeks ago, and after seeing all of my friends from home post seemingly endless photos of the buckets of snow and all the fun they were having playing in it, I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit that I was experiencing some snow-envy. Snow is such a rare occurrence in Seattle, so to miss out on it, especially when there was not a snowflake in sight here in Holland, was more than enough to put me in a sour mood.</p>
<p>Until today! It began snowing sometime around 8:30am, very lightly, and all morning I watched it snow more and more intensely out my window. By noon, the sidewalks and streets were completely white and Junior Mint-sized clumps of snow were falling steadily from the heavens.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc437/kendallamsterdam/320233a9.jpg" alt="Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App" width="499" height="374" border="0" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc437/kendallamsterdam/4cc46cdd.jpg" alt="Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App" width="490" height="490" border="0" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc437/kendallamsterdam/25f785b2.jpg" alt="Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App" width="499" height="374" border="0" /></p>
<p>I took a two-minute jaunt to the grocery store and it was like walking through a low-grade blizzard, flakes swirling all around, getting caught in my eyelashes and forming nice little piles on my shoulders and the top of my hat. I haven&#8217;t seen snow like this in quite a while, and I discovered today that in this context, absence makes the heart forget how magical snow is. It&#8217;s one of the lovelier meteorological phenomena, and I&#8217;m glad that I experience it so seldom that I continue to be enchanted by it whenever I <em>do</em> experience it.</p>
<p>But now that I&#8217;ve shaken all of the snow off me, I&#8217;m going to curl up under a blanket next to the heater with a cup of tea and watch a couple episodes of <em>Twin Peaks</em>. The lazy weekend is starting early. Happy Friday, peeps!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why I will never be popular.</p>
<p><a href="http://nevercontrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/popular-kids-arent-the-meanest-450-thumb-450x328-809673.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518" title="popular-kids-arent-the-meanest-450-thumb-450x328-809673" src="http://nevercontrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/popular-kids-arent-the-meanest-450-thumb-450x328-809673.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>1. I am too sarcastic. Sure certain men enjoy a sarcastic woman. The same kind of man that gets turned on by a girl being mean as hell to them. You know who you are. But everyone else, they find it funny if they understand it. Don&#8217;t under any circumstances be sarcastic with someone who is stupid. They get super angry and bitter.</p>
<p>2. I am confrontational. If someone hurts my feelings, or says something that is simply hateful I just can&#8217;t not say anything. Yes I am that person that says what everyone is thinking but won&#8217;t say it. Especially in those awful work meetings. Yes I have made presenters cry. She had it coming.</p>
<p>3. I am too blunt. This goes hand in hand with number two. I simply do not understand why people are not simply honest all of the time. What is the point of lying, and making things up? I will never understand why someone would ever lie about anything ever.</p>
<p>4. I am an introvert. Now introverts are largely misunderstood group of people. It does not mean I do not enjoy the company of others, it simply means social occasions drain me emotionally and physically. I can only handle so much before I hit empty and need to recharge.</p>
<p>5. My awesomeness. I am so awesome it is threatening to many people. My awesomeness fills up a room. How do I know I am that awesome? Ask around. Everyone says so.</p>

<h3 class="sub" style="font-size:10px;">Lion Dance, 2012 Chinese New Year Celebration &#8211; Austin, Texas</h3>
</div>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.atmtxphoto.com/2012/01/23/a-trip-to-the-supermarket-can-be-exotic/">last week&#8217;s blog post</a>, I wrote about how I made a mistake and went to a photo event on the wrong day.  I made the best of this by getting some interesting and possibly exotic images at a local Asian supermarket. I was also in search for my <a href="http://www.mostlyfotos.com/2012/01/dragon-statue-chinatown-center-austin.html">dragon image</a> that I wanted to post on the Chinese New Year.  I headed up to the Chinatown Center again, yesterday, in north Austin for the Chinese New Year&#8217;s day festivities.  This time, I definitely had the correct day and place.  Even at 10:30am the place was jam-packed with cars.  I brought the same camera and lens setup as last week, the Canon 7D with the 70-200 F4 and my trusty Olympus E-PL1 with the 20mm lens.  If you account for the various crop factors, I had a setup that covered 112mm to 320mm with my Canon and 40mm on the Olympus.  Turns out the combo worked out great.  From behind the ropes surrounding the performance area, I was able to get closeups with my zoom and use my E-PL1 as a wide-angle.  Later on, I also used my Olympus exclusively when I was able to walk up close to the action.</p>

<p>The festivities started at 10:45 am with some traditional Chinese music.  The two stringed instruments set the mood and the pace and action continued to increase from the opening performance.  The music was followed by dancing and then drumming.  Of course, there were the usual martial arts demonstrations.  </p>

<p>I  haven&#8217;t been to one of these events in a while. Interestingly, many of the performers seem to be from the Austin area, including a large contingent from <a href="http://powerofusinaustinisd.blogspot.com/2012/01/summitt-elementary-celebrates-year-of.html">Summitt Elementary School</a> which is part of the Austin public school system.  Back 5 years ago, the performers came in from Houston so it definitely seems like the Asian population is Austin is growing. The dragon and lion dances were the main attractions of the Chinese New Year celebration.  After a bit of research I discovered that the participants parade the dragon around on poles.   The multicolored costumes worn by two people are the lions.  </p>

<p>Lee Leffingwell, Austin&#8217;s mayor came out as the guest of honor, lighting the fireworks for the finale.   The action shifted away from the makeshift stage to the back.  The crowds at this point were 5 &#8211; 6 levels deep in most places.  I somehow was able to escape from the stage and moved over the the backside where the firecrackers were in full force.  The smoke and noise were so loud, it started to disperse the onlookers in the back.  The people in the know had ear plugs which really is a necessity.  Luckily for me, a blog reader suggested that I bring ear protection, something that I definitely would not have thought about &#8212; thank you, Jack.  I was easily able to slip to the front right, right on top of the small explosions.  By this time, I switched exclusively to my Olympus Pen camera.  The 40mm lens was perfect for catching the up close action.  I probably would have gotten even closer but the lack of eye protection made me hesitate.  </p>

<p>After the main firecracker lion dance, the performers shifted to several locations around the shopping center.  A large firecracker performance occurred in front of the Asian supermarket that I visited last week, intimidating some of the customers.  After that, smaller firecracker lion dances erupted in front of the various smaller stores throughout the complex.  Between the smoke and fast action, it was a bit of crap shoot to get great images.  With all the mini-explosions near me, I didn&#8217;t have my usual time to compose the shot. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the performance of the cameras.  The lenses I used worked great for me and by having two cameras I didn&#8217;t have to change lenses. Certainly a plus in this very smokey environment.  Incidentally, my Canon 70-200 f4L and the Panasonic Lumix 20mm f1.7 are my two favorite lenses.  It was nice to put them through their paces on the same shoot. </p>
<p>I was a bit out of practice carrying the 7D with the 70-200 and the 430EX external flash.  This is my heaviest combination and after a while my back started to feel the weight.  I guess I need to work out more since my light weight <a href="http://blog.atmtxphoto.com/2012/01/15/my-new-two-camera-olympus-pen-setup/">mirrorless setup</a> is making me soft.  I may have look a bit strange with 2 cameras, with a dramatic size difference, around my neck, but it worked for me.</p>

</div>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how this New Year&#8217;s festivity compares to the traditional celebrations in Asia but for a few hours I felt transported to another place.  I&#8217;ve talked about seeking out other <a href="http://blog.atmtxphoto.com/2011/10/25/photograph-the-world-from-your-neighborhood/">ethic celebrations in your hometown</a> before on this blog.  Whether it is the <a href="http://blog.atmtxphoto.com/2011/10/23/olympus-e-pl1-and-the-lumix-20mm-f1-7/">Dia de los Muertos</a> celebration or the Chinese New Year, it is great to be able to shoot a different and diverse slice of American life.  For the readers that have such opportunities, I encourage you to go seek out your local celebrations.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some do it with voodoo dolls, some do it with magic pills, some do it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_yoga">hot yoga</a>. All valid choices. I myself have been mulling over the hot yoga option. But, in my humble experience, nothing does the trick like a twist on the old Chicken Mushroom Fricassee in just under 40 mins. (including prep). Time-effective, you must admit. Oh, and the recipe below can be vegetarian-friendly. Just skip the chicken!</p>
<div id="attachment_1054" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://assiaskaleidoscope.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/chicken-mushroom-fricassee3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1054" title="chicken mushroom fricassee" src="http://assiaskaleidoscope.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/chicken-mushroom-fricassee3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chicken Mushroom Fricassee</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Cut 250 gr. (½ lb.) of mushrooms into slices (I used portobellini)</li>
<li>Boil mushrooms in 3 cups of salted water until they soften up</li>
<li>Take mushrooms out, save the mushroom broth</li>
<li>Lightly sauté 1 onion and 5-6 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped in 1 soup spoonful of vegetable oil</li>
<li>In a separate non-stick pan, melt 50 gr. (about 2 oz.) of butter</li>
<li>In it, sauté 3 heaped spoonfuls of regular flour</li>
<li>Once the flour is golden brown, add 3-4 soup spoonfuls of semi-skimmed milk</li>
<li>Add the mushroom broth, and the mushrooms, mix well</li>
<li>Add the sauteed onion and garlic</li>
<li>If you have any left-over roasted/boiled chicken, add it to the pan, in small pieces</li>
<li>(If you do not have left-over roasted chicken, pre-boil 250 gr. (½ lb.) of chicken breast in salt water and add it to the fricassee, when indicated above)</li>
<li>Add black pepper, allow everything to blend well while mixing</li>
<li>Allow for any extra liquid to evaporate until you get a white creamy sauce</li>
<li>5 mins. before you remove it from the heat, add 125gr. (1/4 lb.) of baby spinach and stir</li>
<li>Remove from the heat and sprinkle with fresh parsley or coriander</li>
<li>I&#8217;d say, another success of Bulgarian culinary fusion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> for fresh herbs at all times. I know most of you love to use fresh herbs, but they get spoiled quite easily in the fridge. That&#8217;s why, when I buy a big bunch of fresh herbs, I wash, finely chop and freeze most of them in a jar, including stems, for later consumption. An old mustard jar or a tomato puree jar, for example, would do quite well. You don&#8217;t even have to defrost the herbs: just drop them into the dish you are making, and voila!</p>
