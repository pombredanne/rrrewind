<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to try macaron-making again since <a href="http://allisoneats.com/2011/07/18/demystifying-the-macaron/">the first attempt</a> back in July. So, in the spirit of the holidays and an upcoming &#8220;White Elephant Party,&#8221; I decided it was a good opportunity to give it a whirl-this time with a more festive flavor combo. I&#8217;d heard that chocolate shells are the most difficult to make, so this time I went with a basic shell that&#8217;s flavored with peppermint extract. Naturally white chocolate is a good match for this, and pretty holiday-appropriate. Since the Chocolate-Caramel macarons, I&#8217;ve learned some tips in perfecting the texture of the shells:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first time I used a coarse almond meal, which gave the shells a grainy texture. I found they came out much nicer using a fine meal. I think this had a lot to do with the ingredients being able to blend better and gave me a smoother, thinner batter.</li>
<li>Make sure you let your tray of piped batter sit for at least 15 minutes. This gives your shells and smooth and shiny top.</li>
<li>Bake one tray at a time! I learned this after an entire tray of shells cracked during my first batch. I also think a thicker tray helps a lot-I&#8217;ve read that some people stack 2-3 trays on top of one another as well.</li>
<li>Really let them cool before removing from the tray-or the soft interiors will stick to the pan and peel off.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here you go! The recipe for peppermint and white chocolate holiday macarons. Though I must forewarn you, eager bakers, this was an all-day cooking affair! Since I wanted to make a lot of cookies (I ended up with about 50),  you may prefer to halve the recipe. Or, like me, just make sure you plan something to do while you wait for your trays to dry, bake, and cool. I ended up wrapping most of my Christmas gifts! So, while a bit exhausting, the day was extremely productive and the outcome was worth the effort!</p>
<p><strong>Peppermint Macaron Shells </strong><em>adapted from </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811868710?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpalliwanti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0811868710"><em>I Love Macarons</em></a><em></em><em> </em><strong></strong></p>
<p>1 1/3 cup almond flour<br />
3 cups powdered sugar<br />
6 large egg whites, left out, uncovered overnight<br />
½ Cup + 2 TBSP granulated sugar<br />
1/4 tsp peppermint extract<br />
Red Food Coloring (optional)</p>
<p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 2 cm) ready. Using a pencil, draw 1-inch circles approximately 1-inch apart on your parchment paper.</p>
<p>In a food processor, blend the almond flour and powdered sugar until well incorporated.</p>
<p>In a stainless-steel bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs whites on high speed until they are foamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar, peppermint extract and about 20-30 drops of red food coloring to the egg whites and continue to beat until it forms a stiff meringue.</p>
<p>Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold the almond flour/powdered sugar mixture into the meringue in a couple additions. Blend by scopping batter up from the bottom and pressing it against the sides of the bowl. Do this a few times until well incorporated.</p>
<p>Fill pastry bag with the batter and carefully dispense into your drawn circles. Once the tray is filled, rap the baking sheet on the counter to help settle the batter. Let tray sit out at room temperature for 15 minutes so that a slight crust forms on each shell.</p>
<p>Bake at 375 F for 9-12 minutes, until the shells are slightly crisp on top. Allow to cool before removing from the trays. Repeat, one tray at a time until you’ve used up the batter.  Make sure you use a new piece of parchment at least every other batch to assure smooth and round shells.</p>
<p><strong>White Chocolate Ganache</strong></p>
<p>2/3 cup heavy cream<br />
10 oz good quality white chocolate, finely chopped<br />
1 ½ TBSP unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into 3 pieces</p>
<p>Put the white chocolate in a heat proof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil, then pour over the chocolate. Using a whisk or rubber spatula, stir together until smooth. Once smooth, stir in the butter. Place the bowl over a larger bowl filled with ice water, stirring constantly until ganache is thick enough to pipe cleanly.  Work quickly, as the ganache will begin to harden again. If this happens, you can set the bowl over a simmering pot of water and stir it until smooth-then repeat the cooling process.</p>
<p><strong>Peppermint Chocolate Macaron Assembly</strong></p>
<p>Pair your cooled macaron shells into like sizes; I recommend you do this before making the ganache filling. Fill a piping bag fitted with a wide, round tip with your white chocolate ganache. Carefully pipe filling onto the flat side of one shell, leaving about 3mm space from the edges. Pick up your filled shell and its empty pair, and place them together, gently twisting as you press.</p>
<p>Store your macarons in the refrigerator. This allows the filling to soak into the shells and give them that distinct chewy bite. They&#8217;re best enjoyed the following day, brought to room temperature.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started running in 2006. Want to know why? I was afraid of putting on newlywed weight! I had seen so many of my friends get married, and well gain weight. I was determined to starve off the pounds associated with newlywed bliss. There was no agenda, no plan, no time goals, I just started running. The good news was that I had some background in exercise and had gone to the gym off/on for most of college. But, running for 30 minutes became my challenge. My husband and I would go to the gym every day and run for 30 minutes. And, to be honest, that was the extent of my running. Then, something happened. I became not just a gym rat, but a runner. How did it happen? What separated me from those that trudge to the gym daily with those that gracefully prance along well worn trails and paths? Like anything meaningful in life, it was a gradual change.</p>
<p><img src="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/29417_737351863809_1816159_42950804_6128487_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We all have reasons for why we start running. But, the reasons we keep doing it are very different. For me, running became a challenge. Challenging myself is what I love most about life. I love pushing the limits. So, I started with 5k. I ran these races trying to get my time down. Then, I progressed to 10k and 1/2 marathon, never thinking a marathon was possible. But, then, there I was standing at the finish of the Boston Marathon wondering, how did this happen? If I am being honest, a lot of it happened selfishly. I wanted to be better than everyone else. I wanted to have something to brag about. But, now, with a baby on the way, my prospective is so much different. I enjoy the breeze on my face, the way my body knows what to do, the fact I can run any time in any place. What makes me a runner? The fact that I never want to stop!<br />
<img src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/162850_820316961089_1816159_45659475_5508236_n.jpg" alt="" /><br />
I want you to know that whether you run 3 miles or 33 miles, you can be a runner too. You are a runner even if your pace is more of a jogger. You are a runner even if your form needs work or you are still figuring out how to breath and talk at the same time. What makes you a  runner, is your passion for it! If you get up every day thinking about running, you are probably a runner. I promise you this is a great identity. There is a sense of commitment that our world lacks today in being a runner. And, you possess it.<br />
<img src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/206959_933175776119_1816159_46654889_7592840_n.jpg" alt="" /><br />
I would say I recently became a runner. Not after my first marathon, not after Boston. But, in the last few months. I have learned that no matter how fast, how far, how long I run, I will love every minute of it! I will run with fast runners. I will run with slow runners. I will run with just about anyone! I will run on the treadmill. I will run in the great outdoors. I will run just about anywhere. This is what makes me a runner. Not a Boston qualifying time, although it would be nice, not a contract with Asics, but rather my love for running, makes me a runner. It is no longer a way to shed pounds. But, it is a daily activity that I cherish!</p>
<p>So what makes you a runner? Tell me about it.<br />

<p><strong>How Carrie Oeding Became a Writer</strong></p>
<p>This is the next installment in the <em>How to Become a Writer</em> interview series, which will post here at Ph.D. in Creative Writing every other Sunday (er, or so) until I run out of writers to interview, or until they stop saying yes. Each writer answers the same 5 questions. Thanks to Carrie for saying yes!</p>
<p><strong>1.  Why did you want to become a writer?</strong></p>
<p>I was really in my head as a kid. Books excited me, but they excite a lot of young people, so who knows. When I grew older, I knew I wanted to make art, and I was closest with language as an outlet. When I was a junior in high school, I started telling people I was going to major in creative writing at the University of Minnesota, and then I did.</p>
<p>I was born on a small Minnesota farm, a small working farm where my dad grows corn and soybeans and sometimes raised sheep. I never write poems about where I grew up. There’s no negative or traumatic reason for this. I have, however, one piece in <a href="http://www.creativenonfiction.org/brevity/past%20issues/brev24/oeding_rural.htm" target="_blank">Brevity: A Journal of Concise Creative Nonfiction</a> that is about my relationship with growing up on a farm. I want to say &#8220;in isolation on a farm,&#8221; but I think of my husband laughing when I said we lived 5 miles from town, which was hardly isolation. But it might as well have been 50 miles, as I spent most of my life on the farm. And, anyway, the &#8220;town&#8221; was Luverne, MN&#8211;population: less than 5,000. My husband also likes to chuckle at the image of me stretched across my bed, literally waiting for something to happen, anything. People like to look back and find meaning after the fact about how they got here, some of this is true and some is storytelling. Storytelling is meaning-making, I understand, but I don&#8217;t always trust it. This distrust works well in essays as it creates a constant need for questioning and rethinking.</p>

<p><strong>2.  How did you go about becoming a writer?</strong></p>
<p>In a pretty conventional way. B.A. in English with creative writing emphasis. Attending an MFA program immediately after at the age of 22. Ph.D. in creative writing right after that. But this doesn&#8217;t necessarily explain how I became a writer. I became a writer by writing. I remember almost all of my undergraduate creative writing teachers saying, “Just write, and things will happen,” and when I began to see it was true, I never doubted this. I still don’t. Even when I’m anxious about what’s next.</p>
<p>Was I too young to leave Minneapolis after undergrad and pursue an MFA at 22? Probably. But I was right to make the decision, and I immediately had a real writing life because if it. If I hadn&#8217;t left Minnesota to get an MFA at that time, I likely would be a very unhappy person today who doesn&#8217;t write. Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to go back in time and find out.</p>
<p>I heard someone on NPR a number of years ago, a fiction writer, who said he taught himself how to write stories by retyping Grace Paley&#8217;s short stories. It was an &#8220;I had no idea what I was doing&#8221; confession, but I loved the idea of it. And Grace Paley should be retyped by all of us. I can&#8217;t remember who it was, but then I think he went on to somehow fall into some famous novelist&#8217;s lap who schooled him.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 384px"><a href="http://www.baseballreliquary.org/images/JosephCornell.jpg"><img src="http://www.baseballreliquary.org/images/JosephCornell.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Cornell</p></div>
<p><strong> 3. Who helped you along the way, and how?</strong></p>
<p>This is another interesting question, because I again want to answer it in different ways. Some of the people who helped me in the beginning of my writing life were practically strangers whom I had brief encounters with. For instance, a mysterious poet visitor was sitting in an undergraduate workshop at the U of MN. Someone said he was a famous poet from China, and honestly I don’t remember what his name was. I wouldn’t have known who was famous then. Why was he there? He came up after class once and said, “You’re going to be a good poet one day.” It kind of shook me. It didn’t stay with me, though. I just remembered this recently.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Stevie_Smith.jpg/240px-Stevie_Smith.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Stevie_Smith.jpg/240px-Stevie_Smith.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stevie Smith</p></div>
<p>The writers I read whom initially helped open up the idea of what writing could do&#8212;Stevie Smith, Amy Hempel, Mary Ruefle, Frank O’Hara, Barry Hannah, Larry Levis, Claire Bateman, Russell Edson, Lydia Davis. I feel incredibly unsatisfied stopping here, but I’m just making lists.</p>
<p>My editor, <a href="http://seventeenfingeredpoetrybird.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Dodd Lee</a>, for being such a smart reader of my first book (and of poems, period), seeing that it is doing something new, understanding its humor and seriousness, and publishing it. Publishing it in a gorgeous book that completely lives up to my in-print dreams!  Also, my husband, Kent Shaw, who is a poet, who has read more contemporary poetry than anyone I&#8217;ve met and sees the book in the same vein. His writing keeps me excited about poetry, which is funny because when we first started dating we didn&#8217;t read each other&#8217;s work. We are both very critical, and we secretly worried we wouldn&#8217;t like each other’s poems. Our writing was a huge surprise to each other. Then we got hitched.</p>
<p>Some who currently help me are the writers and artists who keep me excited about making things: <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/767" target="_blank">Alice Notley</a>, <a href="http://www.eulabiss.net/" target="_blank">Eula Biss</a>, <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/authors/62-maggie-nelson" target="_blank">Maggie Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.mattheaharvey.info/" target="_blank">Mattea Harvey</a>, <a href="http://www.wernerherzog.com/" target="_blank">Werner Herzog</a>, <a href="http://mirandajuly.com/" target="_blank">Miranda July</a>. I am absolutely on fire about artist <a href="http://www.sarahsze.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Sze</a>, but you should see the installations in person.</p>
<p>Something that has helped me from stopping writing after I completed my first book, is taking art classes during my two years in Houston. I saw a Martin Puryear show at the SFMOMA in 2009. I had finished my first book, and it was unpublished. I was alone and at god-awful MLA, and it was one of the best art experiences of my life. Something about walking closely around his sculptures made me feel like I was breathing for the first time in two years. I moved to Houston nine months later and took art classes at the Museum of Fine Art’s Glassell School. I remember the first night of just intro to drawing and how it felt electric to be sketching terribly in the humid Houston August. I think there were times I slept with my art supplies. It’s stupid, I hate these kinds of narratives, but I am going to own this one. Two years of classes weren’t enough, but having that kind of excitement about making anything recharged my writing.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 257px"><a href="http://www.saraayers.com/graphics/darger/blenguin.jpg"><img src="http://www.saraayers.com/graphics/darger/blenguin.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Henry Darger</p></div>
<p>Joseph Cornell and Henry Darger were easy to get obsessed with. There is no line between their artistic and personal biographies. Going back to the writer who copied lines of Grace Paley, I like the idea of trying to figure things out on your own&#8211;having a hunch of what you want to do, and like Darger, finding ways on his own to get his collages &#8220;right&#8221; for him.</p>
<p>Also Ana Mendieta, I’m fascinated with, her performance pieces, during which uses her body in ways I’m usually very cynical about.</p>
<p>Louise Bourgeois is one of my favorite artists. Her wit, side view, darkness, and play are right up my alley. And she just works in so many mediums. Never stopped exploring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be around Marianne Moore. Have her as a neighbor, but I don&#8217;t want to read her biography.</p>
<p><strong>5.  What would you say in a short letter to an aspiring writer?</strong><br />
Write and read, and things will happen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a poet, consider making something in addition to poetry. You need to be making something all of the time, whatever it is. Poems, collages, pancakes.</p>
<p>Be humble. Don&#8217;t romanticize being humble. Don&#8217;t be so easily impressed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amylleblanc.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/sam_1480ee.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916" title="SAM_1480ee" src="http://amylleblanc.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/sam_1480ee.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a>Movies, TV shows, songs, plays, even commercials are all selling love. Actually, &#8220;selling&#8221; is kind of a soft word, it&#8217;s more like they&#8217;re pushing it on us. They&#8217;re like drug pushers &#8211; they&#8217;re love pushers! And while I&#8217;m more the cheesy action fan myself, I&#8217;ve seen enough romantic comedies to understand why so many people believe that romantic love makes the world go &#8217;round.</p>
<p>From Jerry Maguire&#8217;s &#8220;you had me at hello&#8221;, to Johnny&#8217;s &#8220;nobody puts Baby in the corner&#8221;, and Mr. Darcy&#8217;s &#8220;you&#8217;ve bewitched me body and soul&#8221; (yes, I&#8217;m aware this line would be really creepy if said in this century)&#8230; you get the point. We&#8217;ve been conditioned to believe that life and true happiness starts when your prince charming walks (or gallops) into your life. According to Hollywood, love equals happiness. And I&#8217;m not here to refute that logic, but after many a long conversation with single friends feeling the pressure, I decided to address the issue. Let&#8217;s consider for a moment that perhaps <em>romantic</em> love does not equal happiness. I&#8217;m not an expert on happiness, but if you want my opinion (and since you&#8217;re reading my blog, I&#8217;ll assume that you do), here are my tips on the subject.</p>
<p>1. Be happy with yourself. This is obvious and should be relevant whether in a relationship or not. Whether you are newly-single, looking to be in a relationship, or are intentionally single for a time, you are most likely a pretty decent human being. But since I don&#8217;t know who you are, I can&#8217;t say that for sure. Regardless, learning to be happy with who you are can be a long process and not quite as simple as it sounds, but figure it out &#8211; nothing will be worth it if you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>2. Keep active. An added bonus to being single means that you can be as selfish as you want in this regard &#8211; your time is your own so make the most of it. Take up hobbies and try new things. I like to read and write but in the past I&#8217;ve also taken up cooking, running, climbing, hot yoga, and more. I&#8217;m also a huge movie fan so going to the cinema is a regular thing for me as well. If you&#8217;re uncomfortable seeing movies alone, find another friend who loves movies as much as you, or find a small indie theatre &#8211; either no one will notice, or in my experience, there tends to be a lot of singles seeing movies on their own at these places. Which brings me to my next point&#8230;</p>
<p>3. Don&#8217;t be afraid to do things on your own. This is probably the biggest challenge for sad-singles. Fact: If you don&#8217;t do the things you want to because you don&#8217;t want to do them alone, there is a very real possibility you&#8217;ll end up on your couch every night. Which, in my opinion is a single&#8217;s guide to depression, not happiness. If you&#8217;re not sure where to start, make a list of things you might be interested in trying and then put them into action (see point two).</p>
<p>4. Make friends! Perhaps more importantly, make friend groups. This isn&#8217;t as lame as it sounds. Making friend groups is a great way to fulfill certain needs. For example, if you&#8217;re a music lover, make friends with people who like to go to concerts, or, if you&#8217;re religious, make friends at your church who you can have coffee nights with. This logic is also true of team sports and book clubs, if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>5. Have your own &#8220;go-to&#8221; places. This is easier if you&#8217;ve lived in the same place all your life, but if you&#8217;re like me and are constantly traveling, I try to find cafes, restaurants, theatres (or usually, libraries), to frequent. I try to get to know the names of the employees and before long, it feels like a home away from home. These places also come in handy for the nights you just don&#8217;t want to be alone in your apartment.</p>
<p>6. As the old song says, go find somebody to love. As much as you may want to ignore it, love is fundamental to your happiness, but this doesn&#8217;t have to be romantic love. This can be evident in your relationships with friends, family, God, or even strangers. Try spreading the love by doing some volunteer work. As silly as it may sound, on some of my lonely days in Malawi (they <em>will</em> happen), I would visit the animal shelter near my work in Blantyre and play with the dogs, they didn&#8217;t get many visitors and the puppies were just so eager to have someone around. Those little guys instantly lifted my spirits.</p>
<p>I want to make a note here that you should be fully aware of the reasons why you are committing to being single. You don&#8217;t have to justify them to anyone else but yourself, but you should know what they are. If you&#8217;ve been hurt or heartbroken, being single for a while might seem like a good idea but you shouldn&#8217;t live in the past. I encourage you to use this time to heal and move on. Whatever your reasons may be, keep them in mind for the day when they may no longer be relevant. Committing to a single life doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to turn away every Romeo. If you&#8217;re interested, don&#8217;t turn him down just on principal. Being single is meant to feel like freedom, not a prison, so learn to appreciate it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, around this time actually, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, came to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego where I was working as a Series Commander for recruit training. I was in the middle of my second cycle in that position, and I was eager to hear what our Commandant had to say about the status of our Corps, from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to personnel issues, particularly the policy known as &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell.&#8221; I had been following the news on DADT closely for a year, for what are now obvious reasons. Gen Amos had recently testified before Congress that the existing policy was working fine and he was not inclined to repeal the existing policy while Marines were engaged in combat operations on two fronts. The results of the Comprehensive Review Working Group had been compiled and released, and the Marines were clearly the most resistant to changing the 18 year-old policy.</p>
<p><span id="more-143"></span></p>
<p>The general opened the session by introducing his wife, who was traveling with him. He said that he wouldn&#8217;t be where he was today without her many years of sacrifice and support. I honestly have no idea what he said after that. I was overcome by the contradiction between that statement and his testimony on keeping DADT in place and spent the next twenty minutes alternating between finding the appropriate wording for asking the Commandant a question and convincing myself that I should just keep my mouth shut. Anyone who knows me also knows that once an idea enters my head, there&#8217;s really only one way things can go&#8211;I am, after all, a Marine.</p>
<p>I waited for the questions to begin, raised my hand, and was handed a microphone. &#8220;Good morning, General. My name is Captain Matthew Phelps, I&#8217;m a Series Commander with India Company, 3rd Recruit Training Battalion. Sir, in light of the recent issue of the proposed repeal of &#8216;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8217;, can you tell us how, as leaders, we can reconcile the conflict between stressing the importance of family support for our Marines and denying our gay and lesbian Marines even the opportunity to have a family?&#8221; He responded as one might expect a man in his position to respond: Congress had asked his opinion, he gave it, and there was nothing for us to discuss until they reached a decision. A few weeks later, Congress voted to repeal the law upon certification by the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. On September 20, 2011, the law was finally repealed.</p>
<p>The stress of living under DADT is not something I can begin to describe. Whether you&#8217;re straight or gay, there is little that comes much more naturally than who you are attracted to. Whether you want it to be true or not, you still know, and you know that there&#8217;s no changing it. Now imagine that everything you know and love could disappear if anyone found out who you&#8217;re attracted to&#8211;even if you never acted on it. Imagine you could be fired and humiliated for it, or even go to jail. Imagine that all it has to take is a rumor or suspicion, and that an accusation from anyone could be devastating to your career. How would you deal with people you work with, who stand next to you in formation? How would you approach your job knowing that saying the wrong thing to the wrong person could provoke them to taking their suspicion to your commander?</p>
<p>Even now, as I learn to live without the stress of hiding my sexuality from my fellow Marines, I am realizing the sacrifices that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Marines have made since even before DADT was enacted. At certain points, it was everything I could do to keep from going insane. When I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore, I searched for outlets to vent my frustration. Most often, these outlets came in the form of telling people what I could about what I was going through, confiding in friends and family, and trying to convey this frustration to the general public and anyone else who would listen, through carefully planned and worded essays, letters, and interviews.</p>
<p>I sent <a href="http://matthewphelps.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/repealing-dadt-op-ed.doc" target="_blank">this letter</a> to the <a href="http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/">Marine Corps Times</a> in response to a letter to the editor that appeared in the February 2, 2009 issue, but it was never published. In May 2010, I wrote <a href="http://www.sldn.org/blog/archives/stories-from-the-frontlines-an-active-duty-marine/" target="_blank">this letter</a> to President Obama as a part of the &#8220;Stories from the Frontlines&#8221; campaign by <a href="http://www.sldn.org" target="_blank">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a> but didn&#8217;t sign it, as doing so would have been a violation of DADT. I appeared as &#8220;Michael&#8221; on KABC-AM&#8217;s <a href="http://kabc.com/sectional.asp?id=38823" target="_blank">John Phillips Show</a> December 17, 2010 (just days before the vote in Congress to repeal the law) to discuss my personal experiences under DADT. I worked with SLDN on arranging interviews with other various outlets and spoke with producers of some of the shows. As repeal approached this past summer, I was interviewed by Chris Heath of GQ Magazine for &#8220;<a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201109/dont-ask-dont-tell-gay-soldiers-military" target="_blank">Tell: An Intimate History of Gay Men in the Military</a>&#8220;, where I was quoted as &#8220;Marines #2&#8243;. For the actual repeal day, I spoke to a few news outlets in San Diego and appeared again as &#8220;Michael&#8221; in interviews on the local Fox, NBC, and CBS affiliates (links <a href="http://www.fox5sandiego.com/videogallery/64876359/News/Don-t-Ask-Don-t-Tell-Policy-Runs-Out#gl-0" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.cbs8.com/story/15510096/why-a-local-gay-marine-says-he-still-wont-tell?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=6272290#.TnpbJZornQc.facebook" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/video/#!/on-air/as-seen-on/Controversial-Military-Law-Ends/130173448" target="_blank">here</a>). I returned to the John Phillips Show (this time as &#8220;Matthew&#8221;) again on October 12. While attending the <a href="http://outserve.org/summit/" target="_blank">2011 OutServe Leadership Summit</a> in Las Vegas, I did interviews for <a href="http://www.frontiersla.com/News/Context/Story.aspx?ID=1556653" target="_blank">this article in Frontiers</a> magazine and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,792134,00.html" target="_blank">this one in Der Spiegel</a>, a German news magazine. Throughout all of this I became increasingly involved with SLDN, <a href="http://www.outserve.org" target="_blank">OutServe</a>, and the <a href="http://militaryacceptanceproject.org/" target="_blank">Military Acceptance Project</a>, who awarded me one of the first <a href="http://militaryacceptanceproject.org/Salute.html" target="_blank">MAP Salute awards</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all of this work with the media, I always obscured my identity not only for the sake of anonymity under the law, but also for the sake of avoiding the attention being so vocal could have brought on me and my Marines. While there was a part of me dying to just let people know and get it over with, I didn&#8217;t want my Marines to find out I was gay from newspaper headlines, and I didn&#8217;t want to give the impression that I was seeking publicity. Speaking to the press was not about recognition for myself, it was about providing a voice to those who were most impacted by DADT but weren&#8217;t being heard in the debates. It was never about me, it was about all of us. I was in a position where I felt I could speak safely and I did. As a Marine, it is my duty to defend those who cannot defend themselves, and I therefore had no choice but to seek and seize opportunities to do so.</p>
<p>All of the work I and countless others did had paid off and the law was history, but although that chapter was closed and that most difficult time was behind us, a new chapter was beginning. I was among the many people who thought it would be easier with DADT behind us, and in many ways it has been. Whereas I used to get frustrated trying to figure out how to answer questions about my personal life without being specific in referring to dates&#8217; and boyfriends&#8217; names, or even clubs and neighborhoods, I can just be honest. [Despite repeal opponents' insistence that sexuality doesn't come up in day-to-day military life, I would invite any of them to come with me to work and see that the opposite is true. Not a day has gone by since repeal when it hasn't come up in some way or another.] My entire chain of command knows and has been supportive. Contrary to what you may be thinking, this is where things get tough.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ear-hoodie-kid2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-802" title="ear hoodie kid" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ear-hoodie-kid2.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="175" /></a>Fashion baffles me.  I don’t get it at all and I never will.  People say that fashion is a form of self-expression.  If that’s true, I’ve basically been stuck in a stutter every since my parents stopped dressing me.  I wonder what my clothes say about me?  No I don’t.  I know what they say about me.  They say, “This guy buys all his clothes at Uni Qlo.”  Or they say, “This guy doesn’t wear clothes because he enjoys them.  He wears clothes because he has to.”</p>
<p>Not that I want to be naked or anything.  I’m just saying, if society didn’t expect me to wear a shirt and jeans, as opposed to, I don’t know, some Underoos, I’d probably be at the bar looking like Shazam.</p>
<p>Here in Korea, which, I’m told, is “fashion forward,” I get to see a lot of different looks.  I won’t lie, I’m often impressed<br />
by how well the Koreans and the ex-pat teachers dress.  But once in awhile I see things and I think, “Hmm.  I couldn’t do that.”  It isn’t that these things are bad, per say, they just aren’t possibilities for me, for a variety of reasons.  So here, directly below, are four things I’ve seen recently that I don’t understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/shazam-underoos1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-803" title="shazam underoos" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/shazam-underoos1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Exhibit A: Coat with No Sleeves</p>
<p>It’s cold outside.  Real cold.  You put on your coat to warm up.  But then you realize that your coat has no sleeves.  Your <a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/coat-vest.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-804" title="coat vest" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/coat-vest.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>arms are still exposed to the bitter cold.  What kind of loopy coat is this?  Is this some sort of lame joke, like the solar powered flashlight or the book on how to read?  How can a coat have no sleeves?  That’s like buying deodorant that smells like B.O.!</p>
<p>Okay, in all seriousness, the sleeveless coat is kind of cool looking.  If I had muscles, maybe I would wear a vest coat.  Scratch that.  As cool as it looks, the practical aspect of the sleeveless coat is too much for me to handle.  A coat has a specific purpose, which is to keep me warm.  And since I don’t have muscles to help with that, I need sleeves.</p>
<p>Exhibit B: Headphones around the neck</p>
<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/headphones.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-806" title="headphones" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/headphones.jpg?w=119&#038;h=150" alt="" width="119" height="150" /></a>I like the look of the sleeveless coat (which some people might call a “vest”); on the contrary, I feel wearing headphones around your neck while in a social setting makes you look like a douche bag.  I don’t know why…they’re just headphones…but damn, man, why are they around your neck?  What are you, a DJ?  Go play some techno then, and stop hitting on the cute girls in the bar.  To me, wearing headphones around the neck is as obnoxious as some dude in a band wearing his guitar around his shoulder all night.  Listen, DJ Shadow, get your giant headphones off your neck before they give you scoliosis.  Cause you’re annoying me.</p>
<p>Exhibit C: Glasses with no lenses (or glasses with plastic lenses)</p>
<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/glasses-no-lenses.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-807" title="glasses no lenses" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/glasses-no-lenses.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" alt="" width="112" height="150" /></a>Wearing glasses with no lenses reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld where Costanza pretended he was wheelchair bound so people would be nicer to him.  Glasses make a person look smarter, and glasses can be sexy.  But the thing is, you actually have to NEED glasses for these things to be true.  Wearing glasses frames alone doesn’t cut it.  You must deserve to wear glasses.  Personally, I think it’s pretty interesting when someone has a cast on his arm.  You don’t see me walking around with some fake cast, do you?  No, that would be ridiculous.  Only people with broken bones get to wear casts.  And only people with vision problems should get to wear glasses.  That’s the way God intended it when he made vision problems and glasses.</p>
<p>Exhibit D: Ear Hoodie<br />
<a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ear-hoodie-three.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-809" title="ear hoodie three" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ear-hoodie-three.jpg?w=300&#038;h=213" alt="" width="300" height="213" /></a>Now, this isn’t something a guy would wear anyhow, although it would be hilarious if I started showing up places with the “ear hoodie” on.  The “ear hoodie” is more of a kid thing – my girl students at school wear them.  It’s not just for Halloween or something; they wear them daily.  Is it adorable?  Absolutely, 100% yes.  However, like Underoos, one can reach an age where wearing the “ear hoodie” becomes creepy.  You know how you have to be 18 to smoke?  Well, there should be a law saying only people under 14 can purchase the “ear hoodie.”  They should check IDs.  “I’m sorry, miss, but I’m going to need to see some identification.  Oh, you’re 17…under law I can’t allow you to purchase this item.”  And if you’re dating a Korean girl and she wears the “ear hoodie,” you really should be ashamed of yourself.  It’s questionable to want to dress your Korean girlfriend up in a school girl uniform; the “ear hoodie” is totally over the line.  If you want your girlfriend to have teddy bear ears on her head, you’re a disgusting Westerner.  Remember, she never would’ve dated you in the first place if you didn’t have those glasses and the headphones around your neck.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe this post is getting a bit mean.  It’s further proof that fashion brings out the worst in me.  If you wear any of these things, I still love you.  All I ask in return is that you love me, and my Uni Qlo sweater vests.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I search for getting an interesting character, a face that is usually undiscoverable. I searches face in the middle of crowd. My first prior attention is the selection of the person, choosing the right character. Before I take any portrait I try to be familiar with the person. I talk to hem and try to build a relationship with the person I will photograph. I give them time to be normal in front of my camera. I introduce myself to them. When the person gives his/her most natural expression to me I take out my camera &amp; start shooting. I believe it is the strongest factor which I practice so far to get a close snap of a human soul.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">For me light is the most important element for getting an excellent portrait. I try to use different type of light; I try to shoot in different time of the day to get different colour and mode of light. Every light has its own appeal for creating different portraits of an individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://gmbakash.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/portrait-9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429" title="portrait (9)" src="http://gmbakash.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/portrait-9.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="313" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Technically I use 35mm (f 1.4), 24-70 mm (2.8) lenses. But I take portrait with all kind of lenses I have. Truly to say I do not care about my equipments very much. For me the most important is &#8211; the person. Some times I also use very open aperture like 1.4 to get very low depth of field. So my eyes only go to my subject. As in Some cases the surrounding environment is very important, so in that time I use aperture 8 to get all the elements in focus. But I do not like using very wide angel lens and I do not like a lot of distortion on the photo. I saw many people use wide angel lens for most of their works. If you use very wide thing, the picture look interesting because of the distortion. But in my opinion the picture looks like it has taken by the wide angel lens not by a photographer. So I don’t use too much wide angle. And thus I try to make my images clean and direct.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I have strong affection for color. I am a color photographer &amp; I believe color photography is more challenging &amp; complicated. When I can meet the challenge I feel relieved. I am always very careful for using light and color. I love shooting in the early morning and late afternoon. But while I take portrait in the mid day I try to shoot them in the shadow, indoor or under flat light. It creates mystical environment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I try to use very simple background while I am taking close up portrait, so that the background might not disturb the subject and I try to use lot of &#8211; window soft light. Eyes have significance to me. One of the most important things in my images is eyes of the person. Eyes tell the story of that person. Eyes tell the unseen background of the person which I always hunt to discover.</p>

<p>- For me the most prior factor is the character of my portrait. The light, color, eyes &amp; the person must have to be blend with me. I align four factors together for taking a special portrait they are – the person, the light, eyes &amp; color.</p>
<p>- Attention is the most hidden factor to get a good portrait. The person need to be familiar with you &amp; the camera, it will be your prior duty to make the person natural as well comfortable for getting a best shot.</p>
<p>- Several rules applied by photographers for getting experimental portraits<strong>. </strong>Every photographer has his/her own style of taking portrait<strong>.</strong> Often the most remarkable portraits are those that break all the rules, so it’s important to create your own rules to get a master copy which might never done by some one before.</p>
<p>-  Expression indicating the direction of the person’s eyes which can impact an image astonishingly. For me it’s important to observe the right moment of the direction of eyes.</p>
<p>- For creating interesting images you need to give trial, for creating interesting placement of your subject. After Creative thinking, creative placement can sometimes create out of the ordinary images.</p>
<p>- There are almost unlimited possibilities when it comes to use light in portraits. Input of light could make a portrait more or less powerful, as well side lighting, back lighting, silhouetting can spot specific features.</p>
<p>- Never fail to align your mind, eyes &amp; lens together to find the inner beauty of the portrait.</p>

<p>25 Days of Christmas! Hanukkah bushes! Nissan Altima commercials galore! Their presence can only mean one thing…Chrismahanuwhatthehelliskwanza is upon us!</p>
<p>With a mere 3 weeks before Hanukkah kick starts the marathon of gift giving, eating, and looking like Saint Nick after hot boxing in his sleigh as you try to digest the mammal you just devoured, it is time to prepare your mind, body, and bank account for the upcoming festivities. Christmas carols being sung, dreidels being spun, and re-teaching yourself how to casually sip wine with your grandparents rather than binging playing Slap the Bag with your biddies are undoubtedly a part of everyone’s December jubilee. But, nothing says holiday season more than some severe emotional scarring with your extended family.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 431px"><a href="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs44/f/2009/086/1/4/The_Simpsons__Extended_Family_by_The_Purple_Airedale.jpg"><img class="    " title="extended" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs44/f/2009/086/1/4/The_Simpsons__Extended_Family_by_The_Purple_Airedale.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="323" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#039;re coming over. All of us.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-920"></span></p>
<p>We’ve all been there! Whether it’s your second cousin staring down your dress and exclaiming “look at the bosoms on this one!” in a room full of people, or your grandfather confiding in you about his decrease in sexual activity due to Granny’s recent knee replacement, some of the things that happen will make you reconsider why in the world you were looking forward to winter break. Considering both the former and the latter have happened to me, I have come to expect these kinds of shenanigans. Though I make numerous trips to the bathroom mirror to make sure my ears aren’t bleeding, these comments are relatively harmless. Plus, I tend to forgive my elderly kin when they offer me a cookie, candy, and/or a kiss that is not planted directly on my lips. At every family gathering, however, there always seems to be a black cloud, a Debbie-downer of sorts, or blatantly, someone who everyone wishes would take a hike to the Himalayas and never return.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.hungrybill.com/images/unclecover.jpg"><img title="weird" src="http://www.hungrybill.com/images/unclecover.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="197" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Self-explanatory.</p></div>
<p>Holiday season is a time of cheer and merriment, but it’s hard to enjoy some Yorkshire pudding when Aunt Sourpuss is glaring at you with intensity strong enough to burn holes through your forehead. It’s not your fault her self-diagnosed, totally false “gluten intolerance” prevents her from eating anything but string beans and water, you will enjoy your 1500 calorie snack thank you very much! Furthermore, holiday time is a season of kindred gatherings, not a cutthroat competition between family members. Yes, her child does have a nice voice for a 6 year old, but when she commands her to belt out 3 ballads mid-dinner and claim she totally beats your 4th grade rendition of “Over the Rainbow,” everyone, even her poor show-monkey children will want her to leave. Seriously, when your own kids look at you like they’re imprisoned stuffed animals at your tea party from Hell, it’s time to reevaluate yourself as a person, parent, and in the overall scheme of life.</p>
<p>Nothing lures out old insecurities like spending time with your family. Despite the tears, tension, and inevitable fights, the holiday season proves every winter to be a period of renewed bonding, a time to be happy, to laugh, and to be thankful… that it only comes once a year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A dozen movies seen at the cinema this month, but which is the movie of the month?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Contagion:</strong> a multi stranded story based around the spread of an unknown and deadly virus. The ensemble cast is fantastic and the writing and direction are sublime resulting in a perfectly paced and watchable movie.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/contagion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8847" title="Contagion" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/contagion.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In Time:</strong> Taking the idea of “time is money”, this is a high concept Sci-Fi movie, it has its problems but it also has some great ideas and an attractive and likeable young cast.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/in-time.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8848" title="In Time" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/in-time.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Help</strong>: Given the hefty subject matter of race relations in Americas at the time of the civil rights movement it is a surprisingly lightweight movie. The story is highly manipulative and contrived, however none of these things really matter as the movie is highly watchable and entertaining thanks to fantastic performances from the largely female cast.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-help.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8849" title="THE HELP" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-help.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Awakening:</strong> an old-fashioned ghost story, if you know my thoughts on horror, you will know that “old-fashioned” is a compliment not an insult. There are a few twists and turns in the plot but nothing spectacular, the real draw is Rebecca Hall who caries the movie virtually on her own proving her star credentials.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-awakening.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8850" title="THE AWAKENING" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-awakening.jpg?w=300&#038;h=151" alt="" width="300" height="151" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wuthering Heights:</strong> a dark and brooding movie that reminds us that Emily Brontë’s story is far bleaker and less romantic than popular opinion would have you believe. The photography is stunning and the acting outstanding.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/wuthering-heights.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8851" title="Wuthering Heights" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/wuthering-heights.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn &#8211; Part 1:</strong> Depending on your point of view, splitting the final twilight movie in two is either the only way to do justice to the seven hundred and something pages of the source novel or a cynical attempt to squeeze as much money as possible out of the “Twihards”. Given the way the movie drags I would suggest the latter is true.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8853" title="The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 1" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Immortals:</strong> a silly action movie that comes somewhere between Clash of the Titans and 300. Surprising entertains and with great visuals. It is a perfect example of a disposable popcorn movie, isn’t a great and I’m not rushing to see it again but enjoyed it while I was watching it.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/immortals.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8854" title="Immortals" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/immortals.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Rum Diary</strong>: A Johnny Depp movie based on a Hunter S. Thompson novel and directed by Bruce Robinson; you can’t help compare it to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Withnail &amp; I. sadly it isn’t as good as either but Depp is as brilliant as ever and I could watch Amber Heard all day long!<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-rum-diary.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8855" title="The Rum Diary" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-rum-diary.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Justice:</strong> If you have seen the trailer for the latest movie of the Nicolas Cage conveyor belt you have seen the movie, that’s all there is! Predicable and lightweight but not actually a bad film. Guy Pearce makes a great villain.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/justice.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8856" title="Justice" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/justice.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Moneyball:</strong> with a screenplay by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin you expect a compelling story and snappy dialogue, I am happy to report both are present and are helped by Brad Pitt’s second great performance of the year. Reminiscent in part to The Social Network (also written by Sorkin) and that has to be a good thing.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/moneyball.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8857" title="Moneyball" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/moneyball.jpg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="" width="300" height="161" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Take Shelter:</strong> As a regular family man starts having apocalyptic visions he prepares for the impending doom and questions his own sanity in equal measure. A haunting movie that will stay with you long after it ends, elevated by the performances of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/take-shelter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8858" title="Take Shelter" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/take-shelter.jpg?w=300&#038;h=126" alt="" width="300" height="126" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>My Week With Marilyn:</strong> The true story of 23-year-old Colin Clark’s experience on the set of The Prince And The Showgirl starring Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier (who also directed the movie). Directed with a light touch reminiscent of the best of Monroe movies but the best thing about it is the fantastic acting, Kenneth Branagh is brilliant as Olivier, Michelle Williams is even better as Monroe.<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-week-with-marilyn.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8859" title="My Week With Marilyn" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-week-with-marilyn.jpg?w=300&#038;h=142" alt="" width="300" height="142" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I was still thinking about the film I would name the movie of the month as I was putting this together, eight of the twelve movies were genuine contenders, but the movie of the month is:<a href="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/moneyball-poster1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8861" title="Moneyball poster" src="http://fandangogroovers.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/moneyball-poster1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="741" /></a></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">We debated on putting up a tree this year since we&#8217;re celebrating sans presents.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But really who were we kidding?  I am a stickler for tradition and my agitation was hitting an all time high to get this tree up and running.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Only to find out half our lights were out.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Thankfully the in-laws came to the rescue and dropped off some lights so we could finish this mini masterpiece.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now.  If we could just fast forward the next two weeks, we could really start enjoying this whole holiday thing.</p>
