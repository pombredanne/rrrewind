			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/charcutepalooza_logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982" title="charcutepalooza_Logo" src="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/charcutepalooza_logo.jpg?w=407&#038;h=277" alt="" width="407" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the 15th of February and as promised, today is the post about HOMEMADE BACON. As you all may have read in my previous post, <a href="http://viveksurti.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/charcutepalooza/" target="_blank">here</a>, I am participating in Charcutepalooza &#8211; a year long project focusing on the art of charcuterie. So far the experience has been both educational and fun. Making charcuterie is a challenge for me &#8211; a completely new field of cooking that I never knew much about. The fact that dry curing, one of the oldest methods of preservation, is rarely practiced in the home is in actuality quite stunning. What&#8217;s more is that for someone interested in food, I really knew nothing about it. Sure, I would buy bacon (and I have bought my fair share over the years), but never would I think about making it at home. This project has made me more aware of what we are capable of doing at home, while connecting us with the roots of true and authentic cooking. It&#8217;s trying something new &#8211; venturing out into unknown territory. And I&#8217;m all about jumping in head first and trying it out. To me, there&#8217;s nothing more fun than that.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s project was to make either bacon or pancetta. I chose to make bacon because the process was a shorter one than making pancetta. Since I knew I would be traveling this month, I didn&#8217;t want to over exert, especially on one of my first projects. I could not believe how EASY it is to make homemade bacon. I mean, you really work for about 15 minutes and then just wait and go about your business until it&#8217;s done curing. Once you buy fresh pork belly, all you have to do is dredge the entire belly in a dry cure that can be flavored with whatever you want &#8211; I used garlic, bay leaf, and black pepper. Although now that I&#8217;ve finished the first batch, I have all kinds of idea &#8211; spicy bacon with smoked paprika and cayenne, basil pesto bacon, sorghum syrup + vanilla bacon, and maybe an Indian spiced bacon! After seven days in the cure, you roast (or smoke) the entire pork belly for about 2 hours until it reaches a temperature of 150 degrees F. Once you remove the skin, the bacon can but sliced, used immediately, or frozen for a few months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0021.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-983" title="DSC_0021" src="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0021.jpg?w=600&#038;h=401" alt="" width="600" height="401" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0021.jpg"></a><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0025.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-987" title="DSC_0025" src="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0025.jpg?w=600&#038;h=401" alt="" width="600" height="401" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now, let me tell you about TASTE. When this beautiful, home cured bacon is cooked, its taste is UNBELIEVABLE. Because mine was roasted and not smoked, you could really taste the ingredients from the cure. The bacon was garlicky, which gave it a great savory note; it was spicy because of the black pepper and the herbaceousness of the bay leaf rounded everything out to make this the best tasting bacon that I&#8217;ve ever had. Seriously, it&#8217;s the <strong>most flavorful bacon EVER! </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And because the bacon is so easy to make (I mean, seriously, it just sits there for 7 days), I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll always have homemade bacon around my house. Who knew that making your own cured meat products would be so easy? But that&#8217;s what charcutepalooza is all about &#8211; try something new, challenge yourself to be a better cook, and you will be rewarded. This was quite the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0036.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" title="DSC_0036" src="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0036.jpg?w=600&#038;h=401" alt="" width="600" height="401" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So now that I got my own bacon, I&#8217;ve been making a lot of stuff. Of course, you gotta have a <a href="http://viveksurti.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/sunday-supper-keep-it-simple-b-l-t/" target="_blank">B.L.T.</a> If there is a better one than mine, I&#8217;ve never seen or had it. You could make my <a href="http://viveksurti.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/apple-cabbage-and-bacon-slaw/" target="_blank">Apple Cabbage &amp; Bacon slaw</a>, <a href="http://viveksurti.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/spaghetti-carbonara-my-way/" target="_blank">Spaghetti Carbonara</a>, or even <a href="http://viveksurti.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/brunch-is-our-new-sunday-tradition-huevos-rancheros/" target="_blank">Huevos Rancheros</a>! But for all you fellow Charcutepalooza-ers out there, I made a really special dish. One day, a few years ago, I went to Miami for my little sister&#8217;s graduation. While we were there, my dad and I had the pleasure of dining at Michelle Bernstein&#8217;s restaurant, <a href="http://michysmiami.com/" target="_blank">Michy&#8217;s</a>. We were even luckier because it was restaurant week, so I got to have 3 courses! My favorite course was actually the appetizer &#8211; some steamed asparagus, with a poached egg, and bacon lardons. The flavors were amazing and I couldn&#8217;t get over how a few simple ingredients really came together to produce a very tasty dish.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is my take on Michelle&#8217;s dish. I&#8217;ve grilled the asparagus to give a smoky flavor to the dish, since the bacon was not smoked. With a perfectly poached egg, parmiagiano reggiano curls, and a simple balsamic vinaigrette, this dish is just incredible, full of so many different flavors and textures. The vinaigrette in my mind is essential, as its heightened acidity cuts through the richness of all the other ingredients. At the end of the day, the bacon is the star of the plate and everything else helps to elevate the bacon.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0055.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="DSC_0055" src="http://viveksurti.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc_0055.jpg?w=600&#038;h=401" alt="" width="600" height="401" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Grilled Asparagus Salad &#8211; Bacon, Parmigiano, Poached Egg, Balsamic (serves 4)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(recipe courtesy of Vivek Surti)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Asparagus:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1 bunch of asparagus, trimmed</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">olive oil</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Toss the asparagus with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill asparagus for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until it is nicely marked and tender. Take off the grill and set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Poached eggs:</em></p>
<p>4 large eggs</p>
<p>1 teaspoon white vinegar</p>
<p>Bring a large, wide pan filled with water to a simmer. Season the water with the vinegar – this will ensure the egg whites coagulate around the yolk when you poach the eggs. Crack the eggs and put them into individual bowls (or crack one at a time). When the water returns to a simmer, use a slotted spoon and start stirring the water clockwise until there is a bit of a vortex in the middle of the pot. Drop one egg into the middle of the vortex and watch as the egg white comes to surround the yolk. Let the egg cook for about 3 minutes, and then immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. At this point, your egg is almost perfectly cooked. Repeat with remaining eggs.</p>
<p>When you are ready to serve, insert the eggs back in the poaching liquid for about 45 seconds so they warm all the way through. This will result in great, runny yolks. If you want a hard yolk, just cook it longer, for about 2 minutes.</p>
<p><em>Balsamic Vinaigrette:</em></p>
<p>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</p>
<p>1 tsp dijon mustard</p>
<p>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>Whisk together the balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard. Slowly stream in the olive oil, while whisking, to emulsify the dressing. Season the dressing with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><em>To Assemble:</em></p>
<p>8 strips of bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces or lardons</p>
<p>Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</p>
<p>Grilled Asparagus</p>
<p>Poached Eggs</p>
<p>Balsamic Vinaigrette</p>
<p>First, cook the bacon by putting it in a cold pan over medium heat. Keep turning bacon, every few minutes, so it is evenly cooked, the fat renders, and it is crispy. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p>To assemble the dish, lay a few asparagus spears on the plate. Top the asparagus with the poached egg. Scatter the bacon around the plate. Using a vegetable peeler, curl some long pieces of parmigiano cheese around the other ingredients. Spoon some of the vinaigrette over the salad and around the plate.</p>
<p>Serve. Eat. Be Merry.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait for next month&#8217;s Charcutepalooza project! Now that I&#8217;ve completed my first project, I feel much  more comfortable going forth. I&#8217;m ready to face any challenge and start making some tasty cured pork products. If this bacon was any indication, it&#8217;s going to be one tasty and exciting epicurean adventure!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4703" title="downlink" src="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink.jpg?w=360&#038;h=240" alt="" width="360" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Heather talked to the space station Friday.</p>
<p>It was cool.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, she&#8217;s been writing <a title="Taking Up Space" href="blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/takingupspace">an official NASA blog</a> for a while now.</p>
<p>So way back when, I suggested we should try to set up a downlink for her to talk to the International Space Station as material for her blog.</p>
<p>Downlinks aren&#8217;t necessarily that easy to get, but, I figured, if I could get one, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to try.</p>
<p>Our friends from the education wing of the astronaut office at Johnson Space Center in Houston delivered, big time.</p>
<p>Not only did she get a downlink, she got a downlink while the space shuttle was docked with the space station.</p>
<p>i did my downlink back in 2004. I talked to the entire crew of the space station at the time &#8212; two people. U.S. astronaut Mike Foale, who was becoming the first American to spend a year in space, and Russian cosmonaut Sasha Kaleri.</p>
<p>Heather talked to eight people &#8212; the entire crew of Discovery, and both U.S. members of the space station crew.</p>
<p><a href="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705" title="downlink2" src="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink2.jpg?w=360&#038;h=541" alt="" width="360" height="541" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not jealous. Foale and Kaleri were both very interesting, and I had a great conversation with them. Plus, coincidentally, Sasha&#8217;s in space again right now. He talked to me on my downlink. He didn&#8217;t talk to Heather. We can tell who he likes better.</p>
<p>But that meant every U.S. astronaut in orbit Friday morning was participating in the downlink. The entire focus of America&#8217;s human spaceflight program for 25 minutes last week was talking to Heather. That&#8217;s kinda cool, too.</p>
<p>(Of course, I guess that was not only true of mine, but I was the focus of all the <em>world&#8217;s</em> human space complement. It seems less impressive when it&#8217;s just two people, though.)</p>
<p>Preparing for the downlink was a lot of fun. One of the goals of the downlink was to get student involvement, which we did, peaking with having two Marshall interns each ask a question of the astronauts.</p>
<p>But we also had to write several of the questions ourselves, and that was a neat opportunity. I&#8217;ve done a downlink before, we&#8217;ve both watched several other downlinks, and we&#8217;ve done astronaut interviews. We heard all the standard questions and all the standard answers, and challenged ourselves to come up with something different, to get the crews to give us something different.</p>
<p>I think we did a good job of coming up with questions, and I think the crew did a great job of coming up with answers.</p>
<p>The downlink took place in the Payload Operations Control Center at Marshall, essentially the &#8220;mission control&#8221; for space station science. If there&#8217;s something going on with vehicle or crew operations, the astronauts talk to Houston. If they&#8217;re talking about science, they&#8217;re talking to Huntsville.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cool room, with the flags of ISS participant nations on the ceiling and patched of supported missions on the wall and console stations with easily a dozen monitors. It was a great setting for the downlink, and it was an honor to be allowed in. (I did mine in a small supply room in the building I worked in. Totally not jealous about that, either.)</p>
<p>It was rewarding seeing the flight controllers enjoying the downlink. One said that in 11 years of watching them, this was the best she&#8217;d seen.</p>
<p><a href="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4712" title="downlink4" src="http://storiesinmypocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/downlink4.jpg?w=360&#038;h=240" alt="" width="360" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Heather did a great job. She was nervous beforehand, but, of course, handled it perfectly.</p>
<p>I suggested the downlink originally in part because I thought it would make for good blog content, but mainly because I wanted Heather to have that experience. I believe firmly in the value of <em>doing</em> things; I believe that hands-on experience gives you an insight and investment that you don&#8217;t get other ways.</p>
<p>I was glad she got this opportunity, and proud of what she did with it.</p>
<p>I got to help, too. I was the coordinating line. I stayed on the phone from an hour before the downlink until after it was over, communicating with the folks in Houston that were making the connection, and letting Heather know what was going on. When the downlink was extended three minutes before it was to end, I got to let her know that. (For my downlink, I had to manage both lines myself, with Houston on my cell phone on one ear and ISS on the landline on my other ear. Still not jealous.)</p>
<p>Going to the launch last week also enhanced the experience &#8212; Heather was talking to astronauts that she had just seen blast into space in person eight days ago.</p>
<p>It also meant that Caden, who was fascinated by the launch, was sufficiently interested to spend half an hour at 6 in the morning watching astronaut talk to his mom on television. (How many kids can say that? [On a personal note, it amused me that I now can say I have the clout to arrange for the space station to call my girlfriend. How many guys can claim that?])</p>
<p>Caden knew about the downlink, but wasn&#8217;t thinking about it earlier last week when I saw an airplane contrail and said, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the space shuttle coming back to land.&#8221; I told Heather to remind him that the shuttle couldn&#8217;t come home until after they talked to her. I think he now thinks his mom has to give the shuttle permission to land. He has an interesting view of what she and I do.</p>
<p>Landing is scheduled for Wednesday. And they have Heather&#8217;s permission to come home.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1511" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 143px"><a href="http://revamy.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/books_of_the_past.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1511 " title="Books_of_the_Past" src="http://revamy.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/books_of_the_past.jpg?w=133&#038;h=180" alt="" width="133" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Lin Kristensen; used with permission (Creative Commons)</p></div>
<p>I have always been an avid rereader. My dad, who in my childhood was forever introducing me to new authors he thought I&#8217;d like (to my everlasting gratitude), would see me reading <em>Sal Fisher at Girl Scout Camp</em> yet again and give a groan of despair. It didn&#8217;t take me long to notice that he did a lot of rereading himself, though, although I admit that <em>The Tempest</em> is more likely to turn up new subtleties on the fourth reading than <em>Sal Fisher.</em></p>
<p>I do reread books to squeeze more juice out of them, though that&#8217;s not the only reason. I just like visiting with an old friend. If I liked them once, I&#8217;ll like them again, and I&#8217;ll laugh with an extra pleasure at the funny lines, as one does when reminded just how funny an old friend can be (I&#8217;m looking at you, Lawrence Block), and the sad parts have an extra poignancy when I know they&#8217;re coming but the characters don&#8217;t. The books I reread regularly tend to be the ones that had a strong effect on me the first time I read them, and also feature characters with whom I want to spend more time: <em>To Kill a Mockingbird </em>(Harper Lee), <em>Animal Dreams</em> (Barbara Kingsolver), <em>American Gods</em> (Neil Gaiman), <em>The Secret Garden </em>(Frances Hodgson Burnett)<em>, The Left Hand of Darkness </em>(Ursula K. LeGuin), and <em>The Dispossessed</em> (ditto) come to mind. Now that I&#8217;ve discovered the pleasures of Austen and Dickens, I think they&#8217;re going to become frequent rereads. But don&#8217;t be deceived by the depth of these books. I reread Terry Pratchett, not just the ones that really moved me or made me think (which tend to rise immediately to the rank of my favorites:  <em>Small Gods,</em> <em>Feet of Clay,</em> <em>Jingo,</em> <em>Reaper Man</em>), but all of them, because he makes me laugh.</p>
<p>I also reread mysteries, which may seem particularly bizarre, but as I don&#8217;t read mysteries in order to figure out the puzzle in the first place (since I never can), knowing whodunnit doesn&#8217;t diminish the enjoyability. In fact, I am particularly drawn to the ones with the unforgettable solution, such as any one of Agatha Christie&#8217;s best, because I can watch how she&#8217;s laying clues and red herrings and know that I would never, ever spot them on my own. It&#8217;s like watching a magician at work after he&#8217;s shown you how the trick is done: the magic is not diminished, but doubled.</p>
<p>Rereading is a bit of a drug. Several months after moving and unpacking most of our books, we finally got the mysteries and scifi on their shelves, and my new reading has slowed way down as I read old favorites. More challenging things stay on my &#8220;currently reading&#8221; list for a couple of weeks, even though I&#8217;m a fast reader, because on a Sunday afternoon when I want to do nothing but veg, I reread Lawrence Block&#8217;s Burglar books (and oh how I wish he would write a few more. I don&#8217;t care if the places Bernie Rhodenbarr chooses to burgle have an improbably high murder rate rivalling St. Mary Mead&#8217;s, I just want to spend another 200 pages with him). In the months when the mind candy was still in boxes, I read more new-to-me fiction than in any period of my adulthood&#8211;with the possible exception of last spring, when I also read a lot of new stuff, and for the same reason: we were living in Mexico and had no access to the hundreds of already-read books that usually line our walls, and getting a book out of the library that I own and have already read seemed silly. It has been really great to read so much new stuff, and as my mortality presses on me&#8211;my gray hairs multiply, my daughter leaps from newborn to four-year-old in a moment, people my age die&#8211;I become ever more aware of the profundity of the t-shirt slogan:  &#8220;So many books, so little time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I recently learned that some people don&#8217;t reread very often, and so I wonder: Do you reread a lot? Any books or genres in particular? What makes you pick up a book for a second, third, fourth, umpteenth time&#8211;or not? What are you reading or rereading now?</p>
<p><strong>ETA:</strong> Welcome to everyone who found their way here via Freshly Pressed, and thanks for all the comments!  I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t respond as fast as you can comment, but I&#8217;m loving hearing about what you all reread, or don&#8217;t.  And d&#8217;oh, Harry Potter is definitely on my frequently-read list.  I&#8217;ve read each one at least three times, and some many more than that, since discovering the series in 2000.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we asked you guys to tell us how your <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/postaday2011/">Post a Day</a> / <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/postaweek2011/">Post a Week</a> progress is coming along, and how it feels to have completed two months of the challenge. Your responses blew us away &#8212; you guys are really kicking butt! Congratulations and keep up the great work!</p>
<p>Here are some of the comments you shared:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have written more in two months this year than I did in six months last year.&#8221; &#8211; Jim Adcock</p>
<p>&#8220;Daily blogging has helped me go deeper into my writing and to better  connect thought dots. I sort of view it as a public journal — and it’s  helping me find my voice.&#8221; &#8211; Patbean</p>
<p>&#8220;In some of my first posts, I wrote about my reluctance to sit down and    write. That reluctance is gone and I post every day, usually 250-350    words. The writing is much faster and even more enjoyable than before.&#8221;  &#8211;   Zol H</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that other responsibilities (AKA “real life”) would prevent me  from posting daily, so I signed on for Post a Week with plans to post  more often when possible… and I’ve enjoyed it immensely.&#8221; &#8211; Margaret</p>
<p>&#8220;There are good, and there are bad days. All in all, a wonderful experience thus far. And I’ve met some really awesome bloggers who are onto this challenge as well.&#8221; &#8211; Genn</p>
<p>&#8220;I  have unintentionally started doing a post a week. I had no plans for      it, but it’s just kind of happened. The results are higher traffic   on   my  site, and more interaction with the community. It’s been lots   of   fun!&#8221; &#8211; B.C. Young</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months ago, I barely could remember how to get to my dashboard&#8230;My  teens cheer and tell me to give myself a gold star. <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8221; &#8211; Katharine  Trauger</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m having so much fun writing I’ve started a second blog just for photography.&#8221; &#8211; Alexy Saltekoff</p>
<p>&#8220;The best part of this whole thing is meeting new people. The  interaction with the other bloggers is what makes it so much fun!&#8221; &#8211;  Kattsby</p>
<p>&#8220;I am enjoying that the process gets a little easier with each passing day&#8230;I am thrilled that my readership has tripled. I am happy that I have made a commitment and I have been sticking with it, despite the hurdles.&#8221; &#8211; Masaya Mahanta<cite></cite></p>
<p>&#8220;The part that is the most fun for me is going through each day with a writer’s eye, seeking out that thing, that experience, that issue or news story that I can comment on in my own unique way.&#8221; &#8211; Andrew</p>
<p>&#8220;At first it was really hard, however after the first month or so it has simply become a habit &#8211; something I do everyday like brushing my teeth.&#8221; &#8211; Mlovergaard</p>
<p>&#8220;In January and February I’ve had more visits to my blog than I did in all of 2010! How cool is that?!&#8221; &#8211; Ken Cavanaugh</p>
<p>Read more at <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/you-made-it-through-month-two-how-does-it-feel/">You made it through month two! How does it feel?</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day 88 we got up very early to travel from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, also known as Machu Picchu town. We were happy to be on our way, since the previous days there were no trains going due to the rain.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3909.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-860" title="Train In Peru" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3909.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>We were quite surprised to find ourselves seated in a car full of Swedish tourists and with a Swedish guide, it was a tour group that were travelling in Peru for about two weeks. We were glad to talk a little Swedish for a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-878" title="Aguas Calientes" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7002.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3913.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861" title="Splurging At A Fine Restaurant" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3913.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>We spent the day in Aguas Calientes by walking along the river and taking in the humidity and sun, which was a great contrast to the weather in Cusco. After we had eaten a rather mediocre lunch we decided to splurge and had dinner at the very nice, Indio Feliz. The decor of the place was fun and very elaborate and the food was delicious.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3919.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862" title="Lots Of People" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3919.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>On day 89 we got up really early again, to avoid the crowds on the way up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>. Although, so did all these people.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-879" title="Foggy City" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7012.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>During the morning, Machu Picchu is surrounded by fog, which comes and goes every few minutes. I can only imagine how it must have felt to live in this city, walk along these streets and see this beautiful scenery everyday.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-880" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7029.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7035.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-881" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7035.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-882" title="Over The Clouds" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7041.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>We walked up the stairs, a path that was created for the sake of tourism, it is not original to the site. The view that hit us on the top was amazing. People cheered and I must say I felt a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7055.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-883" title="Gate" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7055.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7067.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-885" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7067.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7067.jpg"></a><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7071.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>During the morning the city was almost empty and we walked around as we pleased.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3930.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-863" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3930.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3937.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-864" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3937.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>As the morning progressed, the fog eased and more tourists arrived. We went back to the entrance to join a guided tour that turned out to be very interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3942.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-865" title="Temple Of The Sun" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3942.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7093.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-889" title="Orchids" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7093.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7095.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-890" title="Flower Garden" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7095.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>The city was not finished before the Incas abandoned it, the reason why they left the city is unknown, but I&#8217;m guessing it might have to do with the Spanish being on their way and destroying what they found.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3945.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3945.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3946.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" title="Three Windows Temple" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3946.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>

<p>Every corner of Machu Picchu is full of interesting details, big and small.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3953.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-871" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3953.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7121.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896" title="House" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7121.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7124.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898" title="House" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7124.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>Apparently there are 17 different architectural techniques in the city, I&#8217;m no expert but that sounds like a lot to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7122.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-897" title="Temple Of The Condor" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7122.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3955.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-872" title="Inside The Temple Of The Condor" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3955.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>The temple of the condor is where the mummies were placed so that the condor could bring them to heaven, of course, we had to take a look inside, where the mummification took place.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7140.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-900" title="Walking Up Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7140.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902" title="Walking Up Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7151.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p>There are many questions regarding the place, for example the real name of the city is unknown. Machu Picchu is the name of one of the four mountains that surround the city. Of course, we tried walking up to the top and failed, I guess that is our signature, to walk up mountains halfway. To our own defence, by then we had been walking around the place for about 4 hours already and were a bit tired.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7127.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" title="Llamas" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7127.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7158.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" title="Llama" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7158.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>Well, to tell the truth, not all creatures have fled Machu Picchu, there are still some llamas making use of its grounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3959.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-874" title="The Guard House" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3959.jpg?w=700&#038;h=525" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>The guard-house, from where one could see the 7 trails leading into the city.</p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7169.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" title="Classic" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7169.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7174.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" title="Machu Picchu" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7174.jpg?w=700&#038;h=466" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7177.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907" title="The River" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/mg_7177.jpg?w=490&#038;h=735" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3960.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" title="Inca Stairs" src="http://monotonundminimal.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3960.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>After being 7 hours there, we decided we had had enough and left Machu Picchu. It was really a fantastic experience, over our expectations, there is no doubt that this place is the place to go if you are only visiting one place in all the Americas.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One pet peeve that I share with a lot of people I know is the use of “Reply All” in email – especially when every recipient on the mailing list doesn’t need to be included in the response.</p>
<p>It’s very frustrating and such a waste of time having to click through useless back and forth email chatter when the topic doesn’t apply to me. The problem is that because I&#8217;m copied on the email chain, I falsely assume that I <em>have</em> to read all the messages and therefore I cannot just ignore them. In my previous job, this caused such a major productivity issue that the company literally removed the “Reply All” button and hid it so that employees think twice about using the feature.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the person replying back, there is only one simple, obvious rule that you need to follow: Don’t use &#8220;reply all&#8221; if only the original sender needs to read your message.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many situations where it makes sense to respond back to everyone on the list, such as for brainstorming ideas or for updating working documents. However, most cases don&#8217;t require that everyone read what you have to say, especially if it&#8217;s one of the following 5 annoying replies that frequently come up:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://prettygirlscancook.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-189" title="beignets with chocolate sauce" src="http://prettygirlscancook.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2113.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>In celebration of Mardi Gras I made these beignets. They are light fluffy pillows of fried goodness. Seriously, they are delicious! What makes them even better is the warm chocolate fudge on the side. Enjoy with a cup of Café au lait.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-188"></span><strong>Beignets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 cups warm water</li>
<li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus a pinch</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>seeds from one vanilla bean</li>
<li>3 1/2 -4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more as needed (I used bread flour)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable shortening</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>Vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
<li>powdered sugar for dusting</li>
</ul>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment add the warm water, yeast and pinch of sugar. Stir and set aside until the yeast has dissolved, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>To the bowl add the 1/4 cup of sugar, salt, egg, vanilla, vanilla bean seeds scraped from one vanilla bean, and the condensed milk. With the mixer on low, add half the flour and mix until just combined. Add the shortening, continue to add remaining flour until the dough forms into a mass. I used about 3 1/2 cups. Transfer dough to floured surface and knead until smooth. Add the dough to a large buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest 3 to 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Once rested, gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle a little more flour on top so you can work with the dough. Gently shape the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle so it can be cut into squares. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter cut into squares, (you should yield 12 large squares, depending on how thick you rolled the dough).</p>
<p>Heat about 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-based pot over medium heat, (you want to make sure there is plenty of room as the beignets will puff up when cooked) to 350 degrees. Fry the beignets in batches, about 3 minutes per batch. Turn them in the oil while they fry to brown evenly on both sides. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Transfer beignets to a serving platter and dust generously with powdered sugar.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chocolate Fudge Sauce</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/4 cups sweetened condensed milk (left over from beignets)</li>
<li>1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
<li></li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Add condensed milk, chocolate, butter, and heavy cream to a sauce pan. Heat over low heat stirring occasionally until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and add vanilla and a pinch of salt. Serve warm on the side with beignets. This sauce is so good, it&#8217;s hard not to eat all of it after its done!</p>
<p><a href="http://prettygirlscancook.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2118.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-190" title="beignets dipped in chocolate fudge" src="http://prettygirlscancook.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_2118.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>These beignets take a little bit of time to make, but trust me it is well worth it. Try them with vanilla ice cream topped with the chocolate fudge sauce.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is the 100th annual International Women&#8217;s Day.  Women have come a long way in the sciences since 1911.  When Marie Curie won her second Nobel Prize in 1911, it was extremely unusual for a woman to be involved in science.  While women are still underrepresented in STEM fields, we have come a long way since then.  I thought today I&#8217;d share some statistics to show the progress we have made in science over the last 50 years or so.</p>
<p>In 1958, women were awarded 7.9% of doctorates in all science, engineering, and health fields.  In 2006, that number was 40.2%.</p>
<p>Percentages of women earning doctorates in specific fields: (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08308/">statistics from NSF</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical sciences &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1958: 3.5%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 29.0%</span></li>
<li>Mathematics &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1958: 5.9%</span>,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2006: 29.6%</span></li>
<li>Life Sciences &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1958: 10%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 51.8%</span></li>
<li>Engineering &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1958: 0.5%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 20.2%</span></li>
<li>Computer Sciences: <span style="color:#800080;">1978: 9.1%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 21.3%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#000000;">Percentages of tenured or tenure-track female faculty:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical sciences &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1979: 3.8%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 17.0%</span></li>
<li>Mathematics &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1979: 6.2%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 17.4%</span></li>
<li>Life Sciences &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1979: 10.2%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 32.3%</span></li>
<li>Engineering &#8211; <span style="color:#800080;">1979: 0.7%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 10.8%</span></li>
<li>Computer Sciences: <span style="color:#800080;">1985: 12.6%</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;">2006: 21.2%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#000000;">We have made so much progress, but there is still significant work to be done!  That is why it&#8217;s so important to give women the encouragement they need to pursue science and to demonstrate to younger women that there are many great female scientists and that pursuing science is a career option for women too.</span><br />

<p></em></p>
<div class="mceTemp"><strong>Travels With Maggie</strong></div>
<p><strong> </strong>There&#8217;s a large Barnes and Noble located on Interstate 15 between Ogden and Salt Lake City. I drove by it frequently when I lived in Utah. Well, not exactly by it. Whatever vehicle I was driving, as if programmed, always took the turn leading into the bookstore&#8217;s parking lot.</p>
<p>Gypsy Lee, my RV, does the same thing these days for waterfalls. In fact, it will even detour many miles for a view of falling water.</p>
<p>OK! I admit it. I&#8217;m the vehicle programmer. The four-wheels moving my dog, Maggie, and I along only go where I tell them to go. But rarely do they pass up an opportunity to let me walk the aisles of a bookstore – Back of Beyond Books in Moab, Utah, is one of my favorites – or gaze at the tinkling splash of falling water, be it the thunderous Niagara Falls or the less noisy Firehole Falls in Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p>While books open up the world of reality and imagination to our minds, waterfalls unfold one&#8217;s soul to magic. While logic tells us it&#8217;s simply water falling from someplace above, it appears to be so much more. I see waterfalls as Mother Nature showing off, the equivalent of a rainbow in the sky.</p>
<p>More importantly, a waterfall&#8217;s symphony of water pinging off rocks and into a pool below never fails to calm my spirit. You should envy me if a waterfall&#8217;s wonder doesn&#8217;t touch you in a similar way, too.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s 10 of my favorite waterfalls to add to your bucket list.</p>
<p>Shoshone Falls, Twin Falls, Idaho.</p>
<p>Multnomah Falls, Highway 84, 30 minutes from Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Yellowstone Falls, Firehole Falls and Lewis Falls, Yellowstone Falls National Park, Wyoming</p>
<p>Niagara Falls, New York/Canada</p>
<p>Gorman Falls, Colorado Bend State Park, Texas</p>
<p>Upper Emerald Pools&#8217; waterfalls, Zion National Park, Utah</p>
<p>St. Mary&#8217;s Falls, Glacier National Park, Montana</p>
<p>Natural Falls, Natural Falls State Park, Oklahoma</p>
<p>Bridal Veil Falls, Provo Canyon, Utah</p>
<p>Bridal Veil Falls, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada</p>
