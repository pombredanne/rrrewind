				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://frombootlewithlove.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aubergine-and-chickpeas-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971" title="Aubergine and Chickpeas 2" src="http://frombootlewithlove.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aubergine-and-chickpeas-2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>In times of stress, <a href="http://the-flick.com/wordpress/2012/08/cakes-and-carbs-and-cheese-oh-my-in-defence-of-comfort-food/">I crave comfort food.</a>  When adrenalin courses through my veins and my heart beats a tattoo against my ribs, my stomach roars and swells at the thought of all those foods which have seen me through the most difficult periods of my life. The chicken soup with matzo balls my Bubbie made for me after I was stung by a jellyfish when I was five.  The ramen noodles with dashes of soy sauce I&#8217;d inhale when I was a student and living off 50p a day. The lamb hotpot my Dad would serve up when I was cold, lonely and depressed, and the world felt like a very cruel place indeed.  Right now, as I hurtle towards my wedding with the speed of Usain Bolt hurtling down an athletics track (only two weeks to go!)  I find myself craving the food equivalent of a bearhug &#8211; steamed puddings, pies, crumpets laden with melted cheese. Wedding diets be damned, I&#8217;d rather be curing my hen night hangover with a giant burger than a macrobiotic wholegrain salad.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s my old steadfast. Stew. I could go on at length about how much I love making stew &#8211; that relaxing art of chopping everything you can find, dumping it into a pot with some stock and tomatoes and letting it all bubble away for a few hours. Stew is the ultimate hug in a bowl, irrespective of what that chemically-laden-upstart Cup-a-Soup may tell you. And while it may not be the most seasonal of suppers considering the unexpected dose of Summer we&#8217;re experiencing at the moment,  it is one of the tastiest, simplest and most satisfying.</p>
<p>This <strong>Aubergine and Chickpea Stew </strong>sees silky, meaty aubergines paired with chickpeas, crunchy fried onions and the warming hit of cinnamon and cumin. I&#8217;d like to think that it&#8217;s influenced more by Morocco than &#8216;what I found at the back of my fridge&#8217;. It goes really well served over couscous, or just on its own with a healthy dollop of natural yoghurt on top. Best of all, it&#8217;s just the thing to chase the Summertime blues away &#8211; regardless of whether you&#8217;re getting married or not.</p>
<p><a href="http://frombootlewithlove.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aubergine-and-chickpea-stew.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970" title="Aubergine and Chickpea Stew" src="http://frombootlewithlove.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aubergine-and-chickpea-stew.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="347" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">AUBERGINE AND CHICKPEA STEW</span> (Makes three large portions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large aubergine, diced into chunks</li>
<li>3 fat cloves of garlic, crushed and chopped</li>
<li>1 tin of chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tin of chickpeas</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp cumin seeds (you can use ground cumin if you like, but I prefer the flavour you get from toasted cumin seeds)</li>
<li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>1 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
<li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper to season</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To garnish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A handful of chopped mint leaves</li>
<li>A handful of chopped coriander leaves</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced into rounds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make It!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Season your aubergines and fry them for five minutes or so. Feel free to add more olive oil if needed (the aubergines will soak it up like a sponge). Once the aubergines have turned soft, add a touch more oil, and sauté the garlic cloves until they turn brown at the edges.</li>
<li>Toast the cumin seeds in a small pan for thirty seconds until you can just begin to smell them (take care not to burn them!) Grind them to a powder in a pestle and mortar, and add them to the pan along with the cinnamon and chilli flakes. Cook your spices for 30 seconds. Add the tinned tomatoes and chickpeas, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer for twenty &#8211; twenty five minutes.</li>
<li>While the stew is simmering, fry the onions in a tablespoon of olive oil until they have turned brown, caramelised and slightly crunchy at the edges. Take the stew off the heat and serve garnished with the crispy onions, chopped mint and coriander. This goes really well with warm pitta bread, or couscous flavoured with saffron.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think one of the reasons vintage clothes are such a passion for many thrifters is because of the story. Whenever you find a piece, you can&#8217;t help but wonder about the original owner. There&#8217;s a connection between the past and the present when you discover a love for vintage, and that frequently manifests in an insatiable curiosity and desire for learning.</p>
<p>Dating vintage garments can be pretty tricky, even for expert vintage sellers! I&#8217;m a vintage newbie, so I&#8217;m still learning the ropes of how to identify clues that help you pin down a date for vintage clothes. This post kicks off a new series for Destination Thrift: Vintage Mysteries. I&#8217;ll walk you through the stories of my vintage clothes &#8211; from acquisition all the way to resources that will give me clues. Hopefully all of my &#8220;vintage mysteries&#8221; will end with a confident resolution! But even if they don&#8217;t, I think the journey will be a lot of fun. Now, on to the mystery of the navy pinstripe dress&#8230;(beware, this one&#8217;s a doozy!)</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 693px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746348592/in/set-72157630985742950/"><img title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress with Bowtie" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7746348592_41e1274bb2_b.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vintage Mystery #1: The Navy Pinstripe Dress</p></div>
<p><em>See more detail shots in the <a title="Destination Thrift on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/sets/72157630985742950/" target="_blank">Vintage Mysteries Flickr album</a>.</em></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 243px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746342812/in/set-72157630985742950/"><img class="  " title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7746342812_4bde7f606a.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Full shot of the vintage navy pinstripe dress, untied at the neckline.</p></div>
<p>I bought this particular vintage dress at a <a title="Garage Sailing:  13 Tips for shopping neighborhood sales" href="http://destinationthrift.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/garage-sailing-13-tips-for-shopping-neighborhood-sales/" target="_blank">garage sale</a> back in May. It was hanging on a rack facing outward, and I was immediately drawn to it. I had a strong feeling that it was vintage because the fabric looks old and the silhouette seemed like it might be vintage. When I glanced at the maker&#8217;s label, the typography and lack of other tags confirmed my suspicions. It looked a little big, but I had to go for it. When I asked how much it was, the seller said one dollar. Sold! I whipped out my wallet as fast as I could.</p>
<p>When I tried it on at home, my instinct proved correct &#8211; it was a little baggy on my petite frame. But I still think I can make it work with a belt. Navy pinstripes are a classic pattern. All the better if it&#8217;s true vintage!</p>
<p>Now I found myself wondering, just how old is this dress? At the earliest opportunity, I googled the maker&#8217;s name in an attempt to narrow down the search.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &#8220;Sherbet&#8221; is not a terribly original word to search by. I kept getting listings for dresses in sherbet colors. The label is so simple and minimalist &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know where else to turn.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746335884/in/set-72157630985742950/"><img class="   " title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress Sherbet Label" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7746335884_75e1ee40d0_z.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sherbet label on vintage dress</p></div>
<p>RN numbers were first used in 1952, according to my go-to girl Sammy Davis Vintage who wrote a recent article about <a title="Sammy Davis Vintage - Identifying Vintage Clothing Labels" href="http://sammydvintage.com/vintage-style/vintage-clothing-label-tags/" target="_blank">identifying vintage</a>. But this dress doesn&#8217;t list any RN number - only the maker&#8217;s tag. Could my dress have been made pre-1952? To check the maker&#8217;s name, I went to the <a title="RN Database" href="https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/textilern/wrnquery$.startup" target="_blank">RN database</a> to see if I could get any clues.</p>
<div id="attachment_566" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://destinationthrift.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/rn-information-rn17420-rn33163-rn35642-sherbet-frocks-sherbet-originals-inc.png"><img class=" wp-image-566 " title="RN-information-RN17420-RN33163-RN35642-sherbet-frocks-sherbet-originals-inc" src="http://destinationthrift.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/rn-information-rn17420-rn33163-rn35642-sherbet-frocks-sherbet-originals-inc.png?w=500&h=120" alt="RN search results for Shebet" width="500" height="120" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">RN search results for Shebet</p></div>
<p>Three results popped up in my search:  two listings for Sherbet Frocks Inc. and one for Sherbet Originals Inc. When I searched for Sherbet Originals Inc., I found a <a title="Manta listing for Sherbet Originals Inc." href="http://www.manta.com/c/mtkjhfm/sherbert-originals-inc" target="_blank">Manta listing</a> for a &#8220;Men&#8217;s &amp; Boys Clothing Merchant Wholesaler.&#8221; Not quite what I was expecting. If this dress is as old as I think (and hope!) it is, it is more likely by Sherbet Frocks.</p>
<p>I tried searching for &#8220;Sherbet Frocks Inc&#8221; in quotes, and I found only <a title="Listing for 1950s Sherbet dress" href="http://www.petpeoplesplace.com/petstore/Beautiful-blue-plaid-1950s-teen-dress-made-by-Sherbet-Frocks-size-  12_320931063146.html" target="_blank">one listing</a> from a seller. These are the details:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Beautiful vintage teen dress from the 1950&#8242;s that is new with original Belks Department Store tags. The design is Sherbet Frocks Inc. It is 100% cotton and made in the United States. The dress is a teen size 12.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps my dress is related to this dress? A search for <a title="Wikipedia - Belk's Department Store" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belk" target="_blank">Belk&#8217;s Department Store</a> did not yield any clues besides it is a popular department store chain in the South. I don&#8217;t have any evidence that my dress was definitively sold there. I have a strong feeling that my dress was made by Sherbet Frocks Inc., but I don&#8217;t have evidence for that either. Since this garment doesn&#8217;t have any identifying tags besides the maker&#8217;s label, I&#8217;m going to have to look for other <a title="Sammy Davis Vintage - Construction Clues for Dating Vintage" href="http://sammydvintage.com/vintage-style/dating-vintage-clothing-construction/" target="_blank">construction clues</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 437px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746334398/in/set-72157630985742950"><img title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress Shoulder Detail" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7746334398_9e26f14545_z.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shoulder detail</p></div>
<p>Seams can be a big indicator of a vintage date. My seams most closely match the pinked seams &#8211; but there are a couple of serged seams. Most of the seams look like they were pinked, but some of the crispness of has frayed away, leaving a sort of raggedy-looking toothy pattern. I can&#8217;t make out the stitching on the hem, but it looks invisible from the outside. The only serged seam is on the scoop part along the back of the neck, on the inside of the dress (I am not sure what this is called.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746340988/in/set-72157630985742950/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress Inner Seam Zigzag Detail" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7746340988_437b5922d4_c.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>I could try the <a title="About.com - Bakelite Test" href="http://antiques.about.com/od/bakeliteandplastics/tp/aa041506.htm" target="_blank">Bakelite test</a> on the buttons. I&#8217;ll update this post with any results I get. The dress did come with a skinny belt (not pictured &#8211; perhaps in an update) Could that give me some clues? I&#8217;m not even sure what the fabric is made of &#8211; it feels a little scratchy like it could be a lightweight wool, but I would need to do some testing for confirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/destinationthrift/7746346734/in/set-72157630985742950/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Vintage Navy Pinstripe Dress Button Detail" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7746346734_b9933e34d2_c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>I have a strong feeling that this is an early &#8217;50s dress, due to the lack of RN number or any other labels. Originally, I thought it could even be <a title="Sammy Davis Vintage - 1940s Dress Styles" href="http://sammydvintage.com/vintage-style/40s/1940s-dress-style/" target="_blank">1940s</a> but I worry that estimate might be too old. The solemn color, big shoulder silhouette, ascot neckline, conservative feel, and lack of the &#8220;New Look&#8221; full-skirted silhouettes that became popular in the &#8217;50s &#8211; that speaks 1940s to me.</p>
<p>I am completely stuck. Consider this my SOS to the vintage community: <strong>I need your help</strong> to identify this vintage piece! Do you have a clue that I missed? Please leave a comment and share your vintage knowledge (remember, it helps everyone!) or shoot an email to <a href="mailto:destinationthrift@gmail.com">destinationthrift@gmail.com</a>.</p>

I&#8217;ve posted about it before (see <a title="Still Here" href="http://ifyoucantwriteblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/still-here/" target="_blank">Still Here</a>) so I won&#8217;t go on. But here are some excerpts from a short story that give you some sense of her. The tense is a mess, and it&#8217;s a bit of a hodgepodge without the rest of the story. I have other stories and other excerpts that show a different side of her&#8211;complicated, depressed, withholding, cruel&#8211;but today this is the part of her I want to share. To remember.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><strong>SHADOW DREAMS</strong></p>
<p>Every night, my mother dreams. Sometimes it is nothing more than an abbreviated version of her daily routine. Running to Agway for mulch. Picking up milk and butterscotch cookies at Munroe Dairy. Reading the newspaper while my father nods off watching <em>Murder She Wrote</em>. Sometimes, she dreams in shadows. In these dreams there are objects floating over her that she cannot actually see. They are distinguishable only by the black shapes they cast at her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had another shadow dream last night,” she says at the breakfast table one Saturday morning. &#8220;It was an avocado‑colored Amana refrigerator. Double doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How the hell do you know all that from a shadow?&#8221; This is my father. He sounds like he is talking to a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness or a used car salesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just do,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>My father claims he has never had a dream. I tell him this is impossible and explain the four stages of sleep to him. I say, you probably just don&#8217;t remember them. But he is adamant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never dream,&#8221; he says, pulling a package of Marlboros out of the pocket of his shirt.  &#8220;Your mother&#8217;s the dreamer in this house.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">***</p>
<p>During my first year of graduate school I spend Saturday mornings with my parents.  My mother and I sleep late, but my father is up by five.  He lets the dog out, makes a pot of coffee, reads the paper, makes a grocery list, goes to the bakery.  I wander into the kitchen around ten, just as my father comes through the door with a bag of fried apple dumplings, or poppy-seed sweet bread, or sour cream blueberry crumb cake.  He smells like stale smoke and fabric softener and sweet morning air.  I make another pot of coffee and peek into the waxy bakery bag.</p>
<p>My mother joins us in the kitchen by ten thirty.  Her body is round and soft, but her legs are wiry, like a bird.  She puts a kettle of water on the stove for tea, then stands next to where my father sits, surveying this week’s bounty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at all these goodies,&#8221; she says.  &#8220;Oy, Franky, what are you trying to do to my girlish figure?&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother thinks she was Jewish in a past life, so she says &#8220;oy&#8221; a lot.  She pats her stomach fondly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t here when I married you,&#8221; says my father, but he pats her stomach fondly too and turns to cut up bite sized pieces of his breakfast to feed to the dog.</p>
<p>My mother tells us stories about her students—this one asks too many questions, that one doesn&#8217;t apply herself, another is pregnant and abandoned by some no account boyfriend.</p>
<p>My father bangs at the window to frighten squirrels away from his bird feeders.  The feeders sit high up on poles he threaded with battered garbage can tops meant to block intruders from the special sunflower seeds he buys at Agway.  He is trying to attract cardinals.  The squirrels look up at him for a minute and then continue.  They climb the pole and pull themselves onto the circular metal barriers like Olympic gymnasts.</p>
<p>My father looks at me and shakes his head.  Then he talks about my brothers—how they should or shouldn&#8217;t spend their money, what they should or shouldn&#8217;t do for work, why they never should have moved out of the house.  He asks me what&#8217;s wrong with them.  He thinks because I study psychology I can solve all the family problems.  I shrug my shoulders and reach for more pastry.</p>
<p>And then, my mother tells us her dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night I had a dream about Jim Deitrick,&#8221; she begins.  &#8220;You remember, he stood up for your father at our wedding.  Everyone thought I had a crush on Jim because I kept looking at him in Sister Jeffrey Anne&#8217;s Chemistry class.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waves her butter knife at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim was a big shot basketball player, so they assumed I liked him, but it was your father I had my eye on.  They sat right next to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you remember such crazy stuff.  I don&#8217;t remember any of this.&#8221;  My father&#8217;s thick black eyebrows arch in disbelief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind.  I remember.  Your father wouldn&#8217;t ask me out because of the rumor that I had a crush on Jim Deitrick.  After all, they were best friends.  There were rules in those days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother&#8217;s getting soft in the head,&#8221; he says, staring at her over the top of his glasses which have slid half way down his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense.  It took me three months to get your father to ask me out.  On our first date we went to Hyde&#8217;s for hot dogs and I knew he was the one for me.  So right after we graduated from St. Luke&#8217;s we were married.  Seventeen years old.  Imagine that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have stuck with Jim Deitrick,&#8221; says my father.  &#8220;He&#8217;s making six figures with Chemical Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got plenty of figure, thank you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother gets up to put her tea bag in a bowl on the counter.  She saves them for fertilizer.  They pile up for months until my father threatens to throw them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the dream?&#8221; I ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the dream.  Well, Jim Deitrick was driving down our street in one of those lawn mowers you can sit on, except it was really a Lazy Boy Chair.  Blue, I think.  And when he got to our house he waved and called out, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been to the Sistine Chapel.  Say hello to Frank.&#8217;  Isn&#8217;t that strange?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say.&#8221;  My father rolls his eyes at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I mean I&#8217;ve always wanted to see the Sistine Chapel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says my father, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be awfully slow going in a Lazy Boy chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My mother is talking about her old high school, St. Luke&#8217;s.  It is being torn down by the city because they&#8217;re building a supermarket and they need a big parking lot.  It is hard to hear her.  The wind is against us and it rattles our clothing like sails.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father brought me home two bricks from the walls of the building.  Imagine that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I do.</p>
<p>My father bends down in the rubble of the building, his glasses sliding down his nose, his knees stiff, his eyes tearing from the dust, a lit Marlboro cupped in one hand.  He picks up a brick and remembers my mother, her smooth creamy skin, her splash of red lipstick, her perfect dimpled smile.  He flicks away the half smoked Marlboro, picks up another brick with this now free hand, and in an instant, forgets.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I wrote this story years ago. It needs some attention, but unfortunately I&#8217;ve moved on to bigger more convoluted writing. A novel, that as my father might say, doesn&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s walking or riding a horse. On I go. But I miss her. More than I could ever have imagined.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I posted an article about <a title="Need to Off a Character?" href="http://wp.me/pxKqP-C4">how people died 100 years ago</a> to help those with historical novels find a way to kill a character. As I mentioned in the post, I wrote a lot of swashbuckling fantasies when I was younger. In a story I wrote in middle school, there was one particular character whom I needed to kill. He was the third wheel in a hero trio. He came in later and was a perfectly nice guy. I needed the other two characters to come together and this guy&#8217;s death seemed to be the perfect solution.</p>
<p>This guy, this poor guy. He only died once, but my, oh, my, how many times I killed him. His death was my therapy. If I was angry at school, I&#8217;d come home and make his death more violent. If I was feeling depressed, I&#8217;d rewrite the mourning scene directly after his death. It was middle school. I rewrote a lot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that the opening is the most revised piece of a story because that&#8217;s the part that the writer sees most often&#8230;for this particular story, the death scene was revised to, well, death.</p>
<p>Choosing when a character dies and which one is a tough question that Misty Massey tackles in her month-or-so old <a title="Rocks Fal, Everyone Dies blog post by Misty Massey" href="http://www.magicalwords.net/misty-massey/rocks-fall-everyone-dies/">blog here</a>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s right about killing someone who matters. At the time, I think I made the best choices I could about who and when. But if I were writing the story now, I would like to think I&#8217;d do it differently. If I couldn&#8217;t kill someone else in the trio (probably not brave enough), I would have made my guy less of a <a title="Red Shirt entry on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_%28character%29">Red Shirt</a> and more of an influential character.</p>
<p>That said, I think knowing when not to kill a character is just as important. Many stories, including the one Misty Massey references in her post, kill a character to help the main character grow. An obvious example is Obi Wan in <em>Star Wars</em>. If Obi Wan had stuck around, Luke Skywalker wouldn&#8217;t have stepped up. I&#8217;m not saying killing him was the wrong decision, only that it&#8217;s a decision that is almost too easy to make.</p>
<p>This summer my husband and I watched <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, a series I hadn&#8217;t seen in it&#8217;s an entirety until then. I love Joss Whedon, the series&#8217; creator. He&#8217;s known for taking turns that the audience hates immediately and then ends up cheering a few shows down the line. Whether it&#8217;s a killing character, or, in my case, not killing a character.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know the series, Buffy kills vampires, demons and other big bads that threaten humanity. Her mentor and teacher (the Obi Wan to her Luke) is Giles the buttoned-down, British school librarian. He becomes the father figure for the whole cast and, apparently, I grew very, very fond of him. Toward the end of the series run, instead of dying to make Buffy/Luke step up by dying, Giles left. Of his own accord. It was a hard decision on everyone, myself included (there was much rending of garments on my side of the screen). Buffy and her friends were all mad at him and sad to see him go.</p>
<p>Imagine what had happened if he had just died? They would have been sad, but then soldiered on. By having the character leave, there was mourning and sadness, yes, but also feelings of betrayal and the thought that maybe he&#8217;ll be back and they wouldn&#8217;t have to go it alone.</p>
<p>For me that was stronger, more complicated and, ultimately, more satisfying than having the mentor simply poof into thin air at light saber point.</p>
<p>How do you choose who to kill, when to kill or if to kill? Or do your stories not hinge on such life or death matters?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I was at the <a href="http://falconridgefolk.com/">Falcon Ridge Folk Festival</a> in upstate New York. During the emerging artist&#8217;s portion of the festival, a singer-songwriter sang a song about their addiction to social networks. The references to Facebook and Twitter were obviously intentional, and they were clearly to make a point, but it got me thinking about when topical and tech references work, and when they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Some references are timeless, even though they&#8217;re timely. Folk music has a lot of these, particularly in the form of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_song">topical songs.</a>&#8221; The best example I can think of is one of Bob Dylan&#8217;s early, pulled-from-the-headlines songs, &#8220;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,&#8221; which details the 1963 killing of a black barmaid by a rich, drunk, racist 24-year-old tobacco farmer. Though the story was taken from the news of the day, its rich storytelling and vivid emotion make it a song that can be listened to and empathized with even now, almost 50 years later.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the case for all the arts. Take, for example, the 2009 book <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/books/review/Christensen-t.html">The Song is You</a>. </em>It&#8217;s the story of a man &#8220;in love with his iPod,&#8221; as the book blurb tells us. I find relying on technology a huge mistake if you&#8217;re shooting for a timeless feel to your story (let&#8217;s try replacing the iPod with a Sony Walkman and see how this reads). The book goes on to talk about emails and text messages sent between the protagonist and his love interest. In my opinion, the best thing this book can ever hope for is recognition as a period piece.</p>
<p>And if novels are being written that rely on Sony Walkmans&#8212;I mean, iPods&#8212;then songs have even more throwaway references in them. <a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2011/04/meet-me-on-the-facebook-songs-about-facebook-twitter.html">Here&#8217;s</a> a great list of songs about Facebook, all of which should be obsolete in the near future. If you think Facebook is worthy subject matter, maybe we could take a trip in our time machines back to 2006 when the <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gymclassheroes/newfriendrequest.html">Gym Class Heroes</a> were composing the completely topical lines &#8220;But its hard for me to not hate/When I&#8217;m on myspace I never see my face in your &#8220;Top 8&#8243;.&#8221; Remember the Top 8 and how it was so much a part of daily life? And now is completely laughable.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not always out to create something for the ages (see <a href="http://thebaffledkingcomposing.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/song-about-santorum/">the song</a> I wrote and posted here with my partner, about when Rick Santorum was a presidential candidate), but if you&#8217;re going to create something, it seems worthwhile to at least sometimes put time and effort into it and try to touch on things that are human rather than the latest trend or tech gaget. It&#8217;s the difference between being a Bob Dylan and a Gym Class Hero. It&#8217;s the difference between a classic and a fart joke.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://derekberry.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/cat-poet.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2248" title="cat poet" src="http://derekberry.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/cat-poet.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="400" /></a>I have heard poets tend to like cats as if for a wordsmith, keeping a feline companion has become a glaring cliche.</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/244232">this perplexing article</a>, which prompted me to respond.</p>
<p>I do not particularly like cats, despite the fact one has made a home out of my room. It is not so much that I own the cat, but rather, we co-inhabit the same area, a fact she too is not at all fond of. She forces her way in each night and perches on the windowsill, unblinkingly watching me sleep. Whenever I wake up in the dead of night, she stares at me intently as if daring me to close my eyes again, to let my guard down. Most nights, I suspect she is plotting her revenge for times when I have locked her outside in a rain storm. I try to exclude her, to leave her in some other, empty room, but she has claimed my bed as hers, my desk as hers, my clothes as her personal, extra-comfy throne.</p>
<p>However &#8220;cat people&#8221; came into being is still a mystery to me. I understand why someone might love a dog, who shows owners endless, unwarranted affection. Cats, however, disdain their owners. They are lazy and as tedious as taxes. They live to spite your efforts with a critical, demon eye. There can&#8217;t be much dignity in owning a pet who, in her eyes, owns you.</p>
<p>But there has been talk from Petrarch to modern day spinners that poets prefer the company of cats, as if we share their prickly self-obsession, their self-preening, egotistical ways. They do not demand respect either, but they expect it. I would certainly not allow Blake&#8217;s Tyger to lounge in my windowsill nor would I tolerate any of Poe&#8217;s black cats worming their way across my path. If one crossed the road, I would speed up to kill it before its bad luck infected me. And if I were Alice, utterly loss in the fantastical dreamland of my own adolescence, I would never act so kindly to the Cheshire Cat who seems to take great delight in confusion and disappearance.</p>
<p>Cats are not muses, cannot properly inspire anything but mutual distrust, especially when they swat your feet with sharp claws or when you kick them sharply in the gut. So I simply do not see why writing and cats should mix. I do not keep company with Crookshanks or Fritz or even Garfield. Jerry the Mouse might as well drop anvils on all their heads as well.</p>
<p>There is not much left to say on the subject, and I&#8217;m quite unsure why I brought it up in the first place. There is a common phrase, &#8220;There is more than one way to skin a cat.&#8221; And if you don&#8217;t know why someone would want to skin a cat, you obviously have never owned one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you seen this website? <a href="https://ohlife.com/timecapsule" target="_blank">OhLife</a> is designed to help you write a letter to your future self. You write the letter, and it arrives in your InBox on the date you specify.</p>
<p>Interesting concept, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure I make a lot of meaningful statements worth reading in my future.</p>
<p>Regular readers have seen the dumb things I recorded for posterity in my junior high and high school diaries. Scintillating stuff like this from March 14, 1982:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a terrible fear that I&#8217;m gonna get my period on Tuesday, the day of my swimming lessons &#8212; it&#8217;s terrible. I&#8217;ll die. I&#8217;ll just die. But what can I do except pray?</p></blockquote>
<p>The prayers worked. Four days later, I wrote: &#8220;I got my period. Today is Thursday so it should be done by next Tuesday and I won&#8217;t have to worry about it. Yay!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have bookshelves full of photo albums of just about every mundane occurence in my life, most with photos but some without. Among the memorabilia, I found this epic account in a copy of a letter written to a friend on July 3, 1994 [Steve is my ex-husband]:</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_4609" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 223px"><a href="http://minnesotatransplant.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/sollie.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4609" title="sollie" src="http://minnesotatransplant.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/sollie.jpg?w=213&h=300" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sollie, the bird killer</p></div>
<p>Tragedy strikes! We had a sad, horrible event occur a couple days ago. Who would have thought Sollie &#8212; our clawless, gutless kitty who&#8217;s never eaten anything but cat food &#8212; would kill a bird? Not me. We&#8217;ve let him outside before, and he&#8217;s never indicated he&#8217;d be capable of killing anything &#8212; he&#8217;s too stupid. But I let him out the other day, and then went back inside to grab the paper to read while I was watching him and in the few seconds he was out of my sight, he managed to find a wren in a bush and get it in his jaws! Yuck! I heard this awful squawk! and then I saw Sollie. I totally lost it. I went into the house screaming and as you can image, Steve was livid! Wrens are his favorite birds living in our yard and he felt bad luring them here and making them feel safe, and then having Sollie go on a hunting trip. We buried the bird in Steve&#8217;s little garden by the garage.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter also included a long account of how we decorated our kitchen with a cow theme. Cow. As in bovine.</p>
<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve used this blog to record stories from my life. Some days, I think I&#8217;m brilliant. But other days &#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet from a very early post (<a href="http://minnesotatransplant.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/exercising-my-rights/" target="_blank">Nov. 4, 2008</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>On a normal day, I wake up and immediately dress for a workout. Sometimes I run. Sometimes I walk the dog. Sometimes I do yoga in front of the TV.</p>
<p>This morning, instead of getting dressed for exercise, I awakened excited. Today, I got to exercise my American rights. I got to vote for president.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I&#8217;m sort of impressed I&#8217;ve been keeping this blog active for almost four years, but I tend to get excited about mundane things (&#8220;I&#8217;ll die! I&#8217;ll just die!&#8221;).</p>
<p>Of course, my blog is out there in the world for everyone to see on the good days <em>and</em> the bad ones. You can read everything I&#8217;ve ever blogged about by clicking on a month under &#8220;Archive&#8221; over there on the right. Check out this gem from a post titled &#8220;25 random things&#8221; on <a href="http://minnesotatransplant.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/25-random-things/">Feb. 2, 2009</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> I want to be a writer. Of books. But sometimes I spend more time on Facebook and writing my blog than I do advancing the goal of writing books.</p></blockquote>
<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t be announcing to the world all the inane things I&#8217;ve ever written when I&#8217;m readying a book (a book! my first book! read more <a href="http://mindfulmonica.wordpress.com/">here</a>!) for publication, but so be it. That&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>By the way, I wrote a letter on OhLife to myself. To arrive in my InBox one year from now. Its meaning and value will be evaluated then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/haters_gonna_hate1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-552" title="haters_gonna_hate" src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/haters_gonna_hate1.jpg?w=300&h=220" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have noticed a trend lately &#8212; people hating on the &#8220;Like&#8221; button.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Like, whaaa?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What pretentious stick lodged its way so high up there that you feel the need to hate on such a sweet little fellar?</p>
<p>Look, I (pretend to) get it. Random &#8216;Like&#8217; clicks are so easy, and you want readers to work harder for your wondrous words! You want them to read a minimum of 106 of your older posts (because 106 is legit, anything less would be sacrilege), follow your blog for at least 3 months, and leave comments every other hour. Then <strong>and only then</strong> will you allow someone to hit that sacred &#8216;Like&#8217; &#8230; because it is only then that they will have a semi-understanding of the type of poet you are.</p>
<div id="attachment_569" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 256px"><a href="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/theodore_roosevelt_laughing3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-569" title="Theodore_Roosevelt_laughing" src="http://thoughtsofalunatic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/theodore_roosevelt_laughing3.jpg?w=246&h=300" alt="" width="246" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And then she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m the Stephen Hawking of bloggers!&#8221;<br />So I replied, &#8220;Yeah, and Justin Bieber is a dude!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I guess I must be too new at the whole blogging thing, because I really just <em>don&#8217;t get what the big deal is</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, people can go through and click &#8216;Like&#8217; without reading a word you wrote. And persons can click &#8216;Like&#8217; simply as a way to get more publicity. Or maybe even [insert other reason here]. But why does it matter so much??</p>
<p>Whether hurriedly or not, someone just paid your post a compliment. It&#8217;s sort of really lame to turn one of those away. Kind of makes you seem, oh I don&#8217;t know, conceited. Yeah, you worked hard putting all those words together. <em>Blogging ain&#8217;t a walk in the park! It&#8217;s a slave trade! </em>I spend quite a bit of time putting my top-o-the-line posts together &#8230; but I thoroughly enjoy it &#8212; so maybe I don&#8217;t get that dilemma.</p>
<p>Or maybe it could just be that I am a desperate attention whore. I constantly need reassurance and a pat on the head. If someone just <em>looks</em> at me while walking past, I take that as a compliment. Therefore, if someone &#8216;Likes&#8217; a post of mine, I take it as a good thing instead of spending hours wondering what their motive was.</p>
<p>People are lazy nowadays. I mean, just look at us. Sure, you may be traveling and taking pictures, and working, and living a full life &#8212; but are you not still spending hours in front of a computer screen? I don&#8217;t think its a bad thing (because then I would be bashing myself, and that is a no-no), but give people some credit! After a long exhausting day of Google-ing, rating people on HotOrNot (oh wait, what? people don&#8217;t do that anymore?), and hating Pandora for playing <em>that</em> song .. sometimes I just don&#8217;t have the energy to  write you a comment. I just want to hit the &#8216;Like&#8217; button in peace without feeling your eyes burning through my soul.</p>
<p>Point is: a &#8216;Like&#8217; means your blog got some attention, it doesn&#8217;t mean the world is crashing down on you. Just relax and drink some tea. And if nothing else, send those stragglers to me &#8230; I gladly accept chronic &#8216;Like&#8217;ers.</p>
<p>Just some newbie thoughts from someone who likes compliments &#8212; wherever she can get them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://interactblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/newspapers.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-429 aligncenter" title="newspapers" src="http://interactblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/newspapers.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally the first week of the home Olympics was a big deal in Britain, but the extensive coverage it received made it look like nothing else in the world was happening. The situation in Syria was forgotten. The on-going and ever-worsening banking scandals were forgotten. The whole world seemed to be put on hold for over a week.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conducted a study of the main British newspapers (The Times, The Guardian, The Daily Mirror, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and the Sun) to find out what their front pages looked like over the last 10 days (see Table 1). The results were shocking. Between Saturday 29<sup>th</sup> July and Sunday 5<sup>th</sup> August only one front page of one newspaper concentrated on a story that wasn’t the Olympics. Only three other pages were split between the Olympics and another story. 100% of The Times front pages during this time focussed on the Olympics only. The same is true of The Daily Mirror, The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun. A fleeting glance of the front pages as you walked through a supermarket gave the impression that the rest of the world was meandering along peacefully, not wanting to disturb the Olympics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was even a news story about the Olympics being on the news! It was reported that editors over the weekend had trouble deciding whether to put Bolt or Murray on their front pages after their successes on Sunday. It is debatable whether this story is even considered news, yet alone whether it is more important than events in Syria!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was not just the tabloids that were overtaken by Olympics fever. The BBC News website did not have a single ‘top story’ which didn’t involve the Olympics for days in a row.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Things do seem to be improving now, with news such as the Liberal Democrat ‘split’ from the Tories and the diplomatic moves in Syria slowly beginning to hit the headlines. But it still leaves many people wondering what happened last week.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maybe British people on the whole are happy hearing about nothing but the Olympics and concentrating on being patriotic for a fortnight. But even if this is the case it raises other questions. Is world news really that important at all, if for over a week we are happy to live without it? And what important political or other world stories could be slipping through the net as Olympic mania takes over and fills the headlines?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Moss Scheurkogel</h4>
<p>I like serial games, by which I mean games that have a connected arc across several playthroughs and not the games that come on the back of a corn flakes box (that joke works better when you say it aloud.)<br />
Alas, consistency between playthroughs is not something that board games are set up for. It&#8217;s simply not part of the established industry. By the end of <a href="http://www.gameshop.com.au/settlers-of-catan-board-game-new-4th-edition.html">Settlers of Catan</a>, you may control a burgeoning industrial nation undergoing a cultural renaissance, but the next time you sit down to play you&#8217;ll once again just be a silly little man in a lean-to rubbing two sheep together to stay warm. And this is how it needs to be. If one tyrant continued to rule over the other players solely on the strength of past victories, it wouldn’t be much better than the Olympics, now would it? (Ahah!) For the sake of preserving balance, most games need to reset.</p>
<p><span id="more-153"></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Risky Enterprising</strong></em><br />
Now, rare as they are, there <em>are</em> a few games that do rail against this temporal loop in an attempt to keep consistency between playthroughs. <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105134/risk-legacy">Risk Legacy</a>, also known as &#8220;Consumable Risk,&#8221; offers one <a href="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/riskcard-300x202.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="RiskCard-300x202" src="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/riskcard-300x202.jpg?w=227&h=153" alt="RiskCard-300x202" width="227" height="153" /></a><a href="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/riskcard-300x202.jpg"><br />
</a>particularly bizarre take on long-scale gaming. During each game you permanently change the board with stickers and rip up rule cards that can never be used again based on your decisions. Since most gamers don&#8217;t like to destroy the components they just purchased, Risk is taking a real&#8230; chance, here. It&#8217;s likely that most people are going to laminate the stickers, saran-wrap the board, or do something similarly obsessive in order to avoid the whole &#8220;play me 15 times and then buy a new one&#8221; business model. Although having a Christmas gift that you can <em>always</em> ask your parents for does have its merits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Homebrew Campaigning</strong></em><br />
Since games like Risk Legacy are so infrequent, most of my experience with &#8216;campaigning&#8217; have been  handcrafted, like a fine artisanal bread. I had a group of friends who committed to an <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror">Arkham Horror</a> campaign in which they kept the same characters between playthroughs and retained not just their accumulated gear from each game, but also their injuries, their shattered pelvises, stubbed toes, and rapidly progressing mental instabilities. I thought it was a commendable effort, since Arkham Horror is a scavenging game where you never really want to end it and lose the goodies you worked so hard for. The flaw with their plan is that they were <em>playing Arkham Horror</em>. At the end of each three hour session, every character is hobbling on two broken legs and entertaining a delusional fear of lemon trees. Bringing these shattered heroes back for one more round against the forces of darkness may be appealing and even a little moving, but when you want to set them up against the complete Lovecraftian pantheon it&#8217;s going to take more than a magic-Batman-leg-brace to keep them standing.</p>
<div id="attachment_155" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/arkham-horror.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-155 " title="arkham horror" src="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/arkham-horror.jpg?w=600&h=224" alt="arkham horror" width="600" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That hat is literally holding his head together at this point.</p></div>
<p>The problem with homebrew campaigning is that most games follow a method of power escalation that is aimed for one playthrough. Most games will leave you too powerful at the end to keep playing, and games like Arkham Horror balance that power creep with crippling disabilities that will severely hinder any later activity. My girlfriend and I once played a lengthy game of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-to-ride">Ticket to Ride</a> in which we each controlled two colours of train cars. By the end of the game we were just sitting there drawing train tickets since we had already encompassed the board and we wanted to see how many points we could blow through. When the deck ran out we just sort of called it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Forbidden Island</strong></em><br />
But now, the Girl and I are playing a new type of campaign that doesn&#8217;t carry the same burdens as these previous examples. It&#8217;s safe from power creep because there&#8217;s nothing to carry over from previous playthroughs. It&#8217;s <a title="Review: Forbidden Island" href="http://gameshopnews.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/review-forbidden-island/">Forbidden Island</a>, back for a second showing here on the Game Shopper, and it&#8217;s been keeping me entertained all week.<a href="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/islands-copy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-158" title="islands copy" src="http://gameshopnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/islands-copy.jpg?w=217&h=300" alt="Forbidden Island Variants" width="217" height="300" /></a><br />
When Forbidden Island was released, there were a few minor differences between the German version and the English version (as there is with many games.) Namely, the German version contained a page of variant islands that could be set up in place of the traditional board. These variants are more conceptual and less balanced, which means that the challenge flies through the roof on a few of them (the biggest decision in the Atoll is when to flip the table and go watch Mythbusters instead of playing.) Forbidden Island already has a lot of replay value with the adjustable difficulty scale, the unique character types, and the randomly created board. But these extra islands transform that replay value into something greater: the opportunity for a super-nerdy story campaign.</p>
<p>The Girl and I have been doing the following:</p>
<p>- We are playing each island in order, starting with the Island of Shadows.</p>
<p>- We use new characters each time until we have used all six, at which point we reshuffle the roles and start again with new team combinations.</p>
<p>- If we ever lose a game, those characters have drowned and cannot participate in the rest of the campaign.</p>
<p>- If all the characters drown, then we just bring them all back to life as the plucky apprentices of the late experts and keep playing. But we feel very bad about ourselves, like someone who adopts the same breed of dog after their old one dies and gives it the same name.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a campaign that doesn&#8217;t skew the balance, but does impose a glorious sense of tension onto each playthrough. Every time I draw the Explorer at the beginning of a game I cringe, because I love the Explorer so dearly and just can&#8217;t bear to lose him. Let the Diver be sacrificed to the fell gods of the sea, I proclaim, he loves it down there in the murky blackness! Just leave me my precious Explorer with his clever diagonal mechanics!</p>
<p>For anyone who is looking for a way to revitalize a game that has become stale, adding an overarching continuity between games is an interesting way to raise the stakes. Just be careful to avoid carrying too much over between runs. After all, nobody wants to face down Yog-Sothoth from a MEDIchair.</p>
