<p style="text-align:center;">It has been a long time since I blogged any of my international work. So this will be a bit of a catch up edition I guess. Some of the shooting I&#8217;ve done this last year has been very different then in previous years. I was also asked to do a lot of interviews, to get stories to go with the photos. I&#8217;d like to share some of them with you as well. This year I had the incredible fortune of working with Tearfund, an international humanitarian organization based out of London England.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">First set I would like to share are some images from some recent trips to the UK, the first was for field work. Collecting samples for my masters, the other was just for travel sake. I extended a photo trip and did some travel in North Ireland and England.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This next set is from my time in Malawi.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">9-I was on site shooting a group of kids and they sang and danced, as we were cluing up I noticed this woman passing by. Duane Codrington managed to get a shot of us. (below)<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1546" alt="Malawi 1" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-1.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">10- This incredibly strong young girl, just 15 years old, was a victim of repeated rape. She was continuously brought out to the fields by a known assailant. She is now a part of a growing support network, shown standing behind her all wearing the &#8220;silent no more&#8221; tee shirt. Silent no more is a campaign to speak out against violence against women.

<p style="text-align:center;">11- This young man prepares his food outside his house. It is very unusual to see a man preparing his own food.

<p style="text-align:center;">13- A young girl sits by her violently ill mother. Her father, who refused to take her and her mother to the hospital when they became ill, stole everything everything from the family leaving not even a bed mat for them to sleep on. Her brother Gilbert, age 12, dropped out of school to become the &#8220;man&#8221; man of the house. He does his best selling peanuts to provide whatever income he can to help his family. Mama Theresa and her organisation, Somebody Cares, after our house visit returned with some supplies and the funds needed to get Gilbert back in school. The woman in the background is a volunteer with Somebody Cares. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1550" alt="Malawi 5" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/malawi-5.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">^The young women hears good news and wipes away a tear a relief.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prior to travelling to Malawi I was working for a week in Russia. I was shooting for a program for recovering addicts. They have an intense program that begins at a farm where the addicts detox and through counselling attempting to regain control of their lives. After graduating the program their are optional follow up programs. One of which involves a work placement of sorts. One in particular is a plastic recycling plant.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">20- Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant. This man cuts up and sorts medical plastics and rubber for recycling. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1558" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-1.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">21- This vat is used to break down the plastics into small chips which are sold to factories which can use the pellets to make new products.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1559" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-2.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">22- This man, throughout my whole time in Russia, would be very helpful, and cooperative with this project. It was also great that his work station was by a big window and came complete with billowing steam. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1560" alt="Recovering addicts work in a plastic recycling plant." src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-3.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">23- Vladimir &#8211; After his new home burned down he tried to live with other people but that didn&#8217;t work out and he turned to the streets.. While homeless he struggled with alcohol. He joined the centre September 4 2011.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1561" alt="Russia 4" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-4.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">24-Nastya- She spent 6 years struggling with fast drugs/ heroin/ etc. and had several bad health issues related to that. After completing her own process, she came back as a volunteer to help other. She has been 2 years clean and in good health. <a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562" alt="Russia 5" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-5.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">25- Each person has assigned jobs at the centre. For some that involves caring for the livestock.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1563" alt="Asbest Russia, Salvation Center" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-6.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">26- The centre has a fully capable lumber mill which they use to process fell trees into lumber for their facilities.<br />
<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1564" alt="Asbest Russia, Salvation Center" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-7.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">27- A female volunteer prepares lunch for the patients and staff.<a href="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1565" alt="Asbest Russia, Salvation Center" src="http://cboydrun.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/russia-8.jpg?w=570&#038;h=855" width="570" height="855" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">28- An integral part of the program, and Russian culture as a whole, is the Banya or Sauna. My experience with the Banya, was certainly an interesting one. I should preface the story by saying, I was the only one who spoke English, so an explanation on the process, which would have been very helpful, was not given. You start in a room adjacent to the one shown below. It&#8217;s a small change room, with a kitchen table in the middle. On the table are some bottles of kvass, (a russian drink similar to root beer), tomatoes, lettuce, rolled ham and other finger foods. When I entered the building (the 3rd picture down) there were 6-8 men sitting and eating, and another just joining in. Everyone is of course naked. The few men I came in with disrobe as well exchanging pleasantries. Nothing teaches you to look a man in the eyes like a Russian Banya. After some snacks I go into the room shown below to see the small pool being filled with a hose and buckets of water laid out on the bench with ladles. When I walked into the small sauna (second image) I was assaulted by the heat. I looked at the thermometer that read 80+ degrees Celsius and then started a timer on my watch so I wouldn&#8217;t stay in any more then 5 mins. I would like to add sitting on 80 degree wood&#8230; straight up uncomfortable. After my first 5 mins I step back into the room with the pool and notice the men going up to buckets and ladling the water over their heads to cool off. So I do the same. The first was too hot, then next was a bit cooler and the next a bit cooler still. So, extrapolating, I go to the bucket and pour it over my head. I should add I was getting some odd looks whilst trying the other buckets. This is because each man took a bucket from the pile and some cold water from the tap and then warmed the water with the boiling water in the last bucket until it was a temperature they were comfortable with. Each man had a bucket to himself. I of course didn&#8217;t figure this out until after I poured the bucket of boiling water over my head. After recovering amidst the laughter I returned to the sauna for another 5 min session. Towards the end most of the men returned to the room with the snacks and took some outside where we sat to cool off while getting eaten by flies.<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">I&#8217;m brewing a blog of the effect a camera can have, how it changes things, and I don&#8217;t mean for the better. I&#8217;ve experienced it a lot in the past, people going after their photo without consideration for the effect on local peoples self worth. This can often have an ostracising effect, in particular when experienced repeatedly over a long time. I&#8217;m not sure exactly how I want to approach the issue, but hopefully it won&#8217;t be long before it&#8217;s in print form.</p>

<p><em>This opening story, like the last one I posted, is dangerous but instructive and essential. It is also, I hope, beautiful. Not beautiful in the conventional sense, but beautiful in its discord-leading-to-resolution. Before sharing, I want to explain that I’ve already passed it under the eyes of those implicated, and in their humility and loving-kindness they’re willing to have it shared publicly even if it&#8217;s not too terribly flattering at first. They want it told.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1356.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2419" alt="IMG_1356" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1356.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Two months into our new life in Munich, two months after burying our son in another country, and my parents have not contacted us yet.<br />
No phone calls. No emails. And I’m growing despondent.<br />
But do I call them?<br />
No.<br />
Why not?<br />
Because I’m overwhelmed with sadness, for one thing. I’m saturated with our three children’s sadness, with my husband’s sadness, which sad saturation is compounded, of course, by the demands of an international move managed under extreme physical and psychological impairment, and in the vacuum of no familiar support community, a vacuum that’s gaining suction with every week that passes.<br />
Why else am I not calling? As strange as it seems I am afraid.<br />
I am afraid that family and friends are now done. They’ve moved on to brighter things, lighter things.<br />
And then the trailing question to that thought strangles me: is that what they’re expecting me to do, too? Be <em>done?</em> Am I supposed to “get over it”? Get it behind me? Get to work? Get myself together, get a grip, get on with life, <em>get a life? </em><br />
I’ve never done this before, this incomprehensible and inescapable  pain, so I don&#8217;t know the rules. I do know, however, that I&#8217;m doing really well just <em>getting up. </em><br />
I’m afraid of other things, too. I’m afraid of what might happen as soon as I open my mouth, afraid of the inadequacies of language to transmit what I can barely understand myself, afraid of puncturing the thick and sacred walls I’ve built around this island of grief we’ve been shipwrecked on.<br />
Furthermore, I’m afraid that my call will be misperceived as a prompt for pity.<br />
But here’s the main thing: in spite of all of the above and far deeper than every other fear, I am afraid that if no one talks with me about my son he will begin to slip from my grasp. He will disappear into oblivion. I recoil at a quote I find from Russian author Alexander Pushkin, “Oblivion is the natural lot of anyone not present. It’s horrible, but true.”<br />
<em>So this,</em> fear instructs me, <em>is how I will lose my child a second time. </em><br />
Confused, overwhelmed and afraid, I go even deeper inside. I climb down into a crater I’ve dug with my nails in the middle of my grief island. And I crouch there. I go very, very quiet. And a wee bit crazy. Bereaved parents – even those in the very best of circumstances – often feel crazy. Just ask them. I get a bitter little swig of the crazees.<br />
I crouch. I wait. I watch. I wait. And wait.<br />
I wait more.<br />
&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1337.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2415" alt="IMG_1337" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1337.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Last week of October and a gunmetal gray day presses down on the Isar river outside our apartment window. The leaf-shedding trees I’ve been watching daily, hourly, are emaciated, stripped down to bark nakedness. I am in my robe. It is midafternoon. The phone rings. It is my parents. The call goes something like this:<br />
(They’re both addressing me on speakerphone. Their voices are slightly unnatural, and remind me of pastel taffy. Sugary softness wrapped in wax with tight twists at both ends.)<br />
“Our whole California trip was just wonderful, Melissa. Very enjoyable and relaxing.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“Yes. Mom and I thought the hotels were comfortable, and the weather, well, what did you think, Donna?”<br />
“Very comfortable. Unseasonably warm. . .even balmy. . .”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.<br />
Pause.<br />
“And then there was the hotel swimming pool. Kidney shaped. Too cold, but deep aqua tiles. Pretty to look at.”<br />
Pause.<br />
“. . .Um-huh.”<br />
And so forth.<br />
When we hang up, I drop the phone on the bed. I&#8217;m immobile with exhaustion. I can’t lift my head. From one half-opened eye I see on the bedspread that I’ve left a dark blue tear-print as big as a tile-lined kidney-shaped swimming pool.<br />
Alone in this small, dim bedroom I feel all my cells collapsing and my bones turning to syrup and my torso cramping and my neck muscles tensing. Then I hear an animal in me yowling very quietly through gritted teeth and a clenched jaw.<br />
And I fall majorly apart.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13411.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2418" alt="IMG_1341" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13411.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a><br />
Who knows how long it lasts.<br />
At some point I pull myself together, gather my wits, blow my nose, pray out loud, cry a few words to Parker, and call back my parents. That conversation goes something like this:<br />
(My voice is also slightly unnatural, like I&#8217;m just coming out from under anesthesia.)<br />
“Mom?”<br />
“Oh, it’s you again, honey. Good, good! Did we forget something?”<br />
“I. . .I need. . .” I have been lying on my side, but now I sit up to assume my erect, well-planted persona. This way I can breathe and project better. “I am going to say something now. . .”<br />
“Melissa? Did we do something? You sound. . .Wha – did we say the wrong thing?&#8230; Sweetheart?”<br />
<em>(“David, come back. Hurry. She’s on the phone.”)</em><br />
“Mom?. . .I need. . .what I want is. . .” I close my eyes. “Can we just talk. . .talk about. . . about <em>what matters?</em>”<br />
By now my dad, who’s turned off the speakerphone, has the receiver close to his lips. His voice vibrates in its lowest register. I know this voice: panic-control mode.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1340.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2417" alt="IMG_1340" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1340.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a><br />
“Melissa? Now tell us please, honey. What do you need to talk to us about?”<br />
I try to speak, but it’s too physically demanding to push words ahead of the crying that is surging, it seems, upwards from the floor of my gut, so I make some incomprehensibly muffled sounds. My parents wait patiently on their end of the line as I begin filling up that kidney-shaped pool with the tears of a child.<br />
<em>Infantilized. I’m six years old again, needing my mommy and daddy,</em> I think while I keep fighting for breath between gasps and whimpers, scrambling to find my mind, find myself. How can this be happening? I don&#8217;t know how to control any of this. This forty-something someone, the one who just a short season ago was resourceful and commanding enough to referee several major international moves, plucky and outspoken enough to lecture before hundreds, a turbo-charged<em>joie de vivre</em> Type A type. . .That someone is replaced by a mucus-drooling amoeba, a formless heap of swollen-eyed sweaty-stale bathrobeness that can’t form a single pronounceable shape in her rubber-slobbery mouth.<br />
“Melissa?” My dad’s now whispering.<br />
“Oh, Melissa, dear, what did Dad and I do? Was it the <em>pool</em>, honey? Oh, darling&#8230;” my mother’s voice is cracking. “That’s it, David. I knew it. Oh, I. . .Should we, should we not have said the word <em>pool?</em>. . .David, you see? I just knew we&#8217;d say something wrong–”<br />
“No! NO, Mom.” I drill a fist into the mattress. “No! I. . .I just – I need to talk. . .But. . .I can <em>not</em> talk about just anything. I have to talk about <em>Parker.</em> About him. I need us to talk about <em>Par&#8212;</em>”<br />
The dam ruptures. The floodgates smash. Deluge. Tides of tears. From both sides of the Atlantic.<br />
Remorse.<br />
Apologies.<br />
Love.<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1341.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2416" alt="IMG_1341" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1341.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Hurriedly, my parents explain that they’ve intentionally not called for so long to “give us room”. They didn’t want to “open any wounds”, they say. They didn’t want to “remind us of our loss.”<br />
“The longer we didn’t take contact,” my mom’s voice is twisted with pain, “the more awkward we felt about calling.”<br />
“You hadn’t been calling <em>us”</em>, my dad interjects softly, “so we reasoned that you must have been doing well. . . enough.”<br />
Which they knew was probably unlikely, they say, but they had at least hoped. . .And in the worst case scenario if in fact we weren’t doing well we probably wanted to be left alone. “Were we wrong?” my dad asks.<br />
“Besides all of that,&#8221; my mom cuts in, &#8220;we’ve been traveling, you know, and lecturing,” which I know was their way of finding a practical distraction from heavy things. My dad, during those days around the funeral, had been discreetly clenching his chest. I didn&#8217;t know how much of the weight of grief his aging heart could bear. He probably needed reprieve. &#8220;Death, like the sun,&#8221; wrote La Rochefoucauld, &#8220;are not to be looked at steadily.&#8221;<br />
They explain to me how hard it was to decide to finally call, that before they dared pick up the phone, they’d agreed on a game plan. No mention of anything even remotely associated with Parker. And by all means keep the tone upbeat and frothy – light, feathery talk – to divert attention from, you guessed it, the mammoth Isle of Grief I was sitting on, the one as big as the whole Atlantic ocean between us. The one getting bigger by the moment.<br />
I have no words. I wrap a moist, shredding tissue in and around my fingers, which are stone cold.<br />
“Melissa, sweet daughter,&#8221; my mom&#8217;s voice is loosening as if massaged with oil. &#8220;We love you, honey, and we’re so sad about Parker we can hardly. . .” There is silence. I hear the unfamiliar sound of my mom trying to talk through tears.<br />
“What your mother’s trying to say,&#8221; my dad adds, &#8220;is that we can hardly breathe.”<br />
Now it is the far more unfamiliar sound of my dad struggling through tears.<br />
“We are <em>sorry,</em> darling.” Mom has the voice of a young girl.<br />
“And,” Dad clears his throat, “we’re deeply, deeply sad. Mournful. You know,” he speaks so softly that if I close my eyes, I could swear he and my mom are sitting on the edge my bed, “this is all so new to us. We don’t know how to do this well. But let’s change this, can we? Can we change this and stay in this horrible thing together? Please?”<br />
<a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1333.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2421" alt="IMG_1333" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1333.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Every blessed day from that moment on and for months on end, at three a.m. Mountain Standard Time, my mom, unable to sleep for her own suffocating sorrow at losing her beloved oldest grandchild, called Munich.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13061.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2422" alt="IMG_1306" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_13061.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>The newly bereaved are incapable of thinking of anything else but their loss and their past. Buttoning a collar, folding gym socks, stapling homework, putting a key in the ignition, sitting and staring and feeling their own heart beat–all of it is downright freighted, barnacled, throbbing with loss. If we as co-mourners think it is our job to fill our interactions with our grieving friends with empty chatter in order to not “remind” the bereaved of their loss, or if we feel things will be better if we never say a word, we are mistaken. If we think it&#8217;s better we all pretend nothing happened, and that we as friends are safer staying far away, we are also terribly mistaken.</p>
<p>Being thus mistaken, we might find ourselves returning to our broken friends much (too much) later saying the following. (I will protect the identity of the speakers, but know that these are not fiction. They are quotes with good people&#8217;s faces behind them):</p>
<p><em>“I couldn’t speak to you. Your story kind of intimidated me.”<br />
“I just didn’t know what to say, so I said nothing. I am so sorry.”<br />
“I was afraid I’d say something that would hurt you more.”<br />
“I didn’t want to get you worked up about the past.”<br />
“I figured you wanted space.”<br />
“I’ve never known loss, so I don’t know how to do this.”<br />
“I didn’t want to impose myself.”<br />
“Your pain frightened me. You looked too sad to approach”<br />
“I felt totally helpless. I kept trying to find something original to say. But I guess I never found that thing.”<br />
“You were so sad for so long, and I was worried. I thought the gospel was supposed to fix these things.”<br />
“We didn’t know how to help you find closure.”<br />
“I’ve been an awful friend. Honestly, I’ve been so distracted with other things in my life.”<br />
“We thought we’d wait a few weeks until you looked like you were over the worst part, until you were healed. Then it seems the weeks passed so quickly and, well. . .”<br />
“I know it’s been a few months since I last checked in. Can you catch me up?”<br />
“A parent’s worst nightmare. I hope you’ll forgive me, but I just didn’t dare get close to it, to you.”<br />
</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1291.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2412" alt="IMG_1291" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1291.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>The newly bereaved can become despondent and/or angry and/or resentful if we as co-mourners choose to avoid them. If fear, discomfort , self-absorption or self-consciousness drive us to silence or to a literal detour away from them (and down another aisle in the grocery store, for instance), the bereaved will probably interpret this as a tacit disregard of their loss. We needn’t ambush them with attention or crush them with affection. But if we disassociate ourselves from them while we wait at a distance for them to “get over it” , we not only lose the great blessing – for them <em>and</em> for us – to help them in their greatest hour of need which will offer us a chance for great spiritual bonding with them <em>and</em> with heaven, but we risk disappearing from that relationship definitively. The process of mourning is by nature constant, constantly changing and communal; it is not something distanced friends can later “catch up” on.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1261.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2409" alt="IMG_1261" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1261.jpg?w=363&#038;h=545" width="363" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>So we have a challenging dynamic here. We grief-stricken have to ask ourselves: is this harmful conspiracy of silence partially our own fault? I have a hard time admitting it myself, but I’ve concluded that yes, it’s partially been my fault. This conspiracy of silence was partially my fault because, as is typical and understandable of those battling with the huge physiological and psychological demands of acute grief, I simply did not have it in me to coach others on how to reach me.</p>
<p>And, as the story of the phone call illustrates, the very idea of coaching others – even the most intimate and lifelong confidantes – on how to grieve with me was loaded with traps and cul de sacs and second-guesses and frustration.<br />
I have reason to believe that in this respect, my story is not at all unique.<br />
From all that I have gathered in five years of studying this, most bereaved generally don’t want to force on anyone a conversation about their deceased loved one <em>although a continued conversation is exactly what they want and need. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1283.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2411" alt="IMG_1283" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1283.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Why are we bereaved so tentative, then, about initiating such conversations? There are as many reasons as there are grievers. But here are just a few possibilities. What if people stare back dully (as some will), or look at their watches (as some will), or grow jittery and awkward, stuttering with no response except maybe, “So. . . is it therapeutic for you to talk about your [son, sister, wife, father] like this?” (as some will.)<br />
What if they quickly change the subject?<br />
As many (most) undoubtedly will.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_12951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2413" alt="IMG_1295" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_12951.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>Challenging dynamics, indeed.<br />
And <em>of course </em>they are challenging. They are challenging because there is little in life that is as intimate as the loss of it, little that is as delicate and multidimensional as the living&#8217;s personal response to it. And someone else&#8217;s loss puts my own mortality in boldface. And certain cultures are squeamish about touching on painful and unphotogenic issues. And, and, and. But all these And&#8217;s don&#8217;t absolve us from the charge to counter the old modes of response with something that is authentic and broken in ourselves. Because true religion (what happens between us human beings <em>in extremis</em>) is supposed to be challenging. How else are we to be brought to Christ but through challenging dynamics? Challenging relationships?</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1248.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2407" alt="IMG_1248" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1248.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>What will happen to us when we find ourselves not in a supporting role in a drama of <em>in extremis</em>, but when we are the lead figure? When the tragic loss is our own, not our neighbor&#8217;s? And then our parents don’t call and we feel the first heart-hardenings of despondency. And then church members appear incapable of engaging in our life so colored with mourning, and we feel the slightest simmer of resentment. When a sibling here or a sister-friend there disappears, it seems, from off the face of the earth, and we smell a small saucepan of outrage boiling on our frontal lobe.</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1237.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2404" alt="IMG_1237" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1237.jpg?w=363&#038;h=545" width="363" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>When our heart begins feeling a bit dried out, then brittle, then crusty from anger, curling up around the edges under a low grade fuming, toasting under the grill of judgment, blistering beneath the scorch of our own expectations?</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>We might call to mind Job, who lost livelihood and life, family and friends, all his possible supporting actors: “He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintances are verily estranged from me./ My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.” (Job 20:13,14)</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1266.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2410" alt="IMG_1266" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1266.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>And in the final chapter of his book, this man who has literally nothing left to lose, offers up a precious intangible. He offers forgiveness.</p>
<p>Upon seeing God clearly for the first time, (“I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; <em>but now my eye seeth thee</em>”), Job feels compelled to repent “in dust and ashes.” When he does, God announces that Job will be acceptable when Job “prays for his friends.”</p>
<p>Job&#8217;s trial is not complete, his refinement not perfected until he forgives and prays for and on behalf of those who have added to his misery.</p>
<p>He has seen God. Now he is being asked to <em>be as God</em>. Stripped of all former glory, ground into the dust, mocked, misjudged, condemned, abandoned.</p>
<p>And still worthy to become the High Priest <em>only on condition of mercy and forgiveness</em>:</p>
<p>“And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends.”</p>
<p>What might that prayer have been, the one Job spoke on behalf of his friends? I suspect it would have prefigured another prayer uttered by the only true and great High Priest:</p>
<p>“Father, forgive us all for we know not what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1231.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2359" alt="IMG_1231" src="http://melissadaltonbradford.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1231.jpg?w=545&#038;h=363" width="545" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>If you and I want to be free of the bitterness that estranges us from others and eats away at our own struggle to find joy again, we are going to have to forgive and pray for the friends who have let us down. They might not deserve it. In fact, they probably don’t. But then, we don’t forgive people because they deserve it; we forgive them because we’ve been forgiven so much by God and because we want to keep in close relationship with God.<br />
–Nancy Guthrie, <em>Holding on to Hope</em>, 68</p>
<p>Some say nothing because they find the topic too painful for themselves. They fear they will break down. So they put on a brave face and lid their feelings—never reflecting, I suppose, that this adds new pain to the sorrow of their suffering friends. Your tears are salve on our wound, your silence is salt.<br />
—N. Wolterstorff, <em>Lament for a Son</em>, 35</p>
<p>There’s only one thing worse than speaking ill of the dead—and that is not speaking of the dead at all.<br />
—Anonymus</p>
<p>It seems impossible to me to understand the cruelty of friends and family who desert parents at such a time. But in my research I found countless couples who had horror stories to relate, such as a brother, once close, who stopped calling his sister shortly after her child died, or friends who were never heard from again after the funeral.<br />
–H. Schiff, <em>The Bereaved Parent</em>, 102</p>
<p>Good friends are like angels. Our friends brought us God’s presence and love. They did not solve our problems, as if grief were a problem to be solved. They did not dispense pious phrases. Our closest friends allowed us to be in as much pain as we were in and did not trivialize it by trying to move us beyond it. The angel in the garden did not say to Jesus, ”There, there.” In fact, we no not know what the angel said, or if the angel said anything at all. We are quite comfortable with not having anything to say.<br />
–G. Floyd, <em>My Grief Unveiled</em></p>
<p>Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair.<br />
–Thomas Merton</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>*Note: I just lost a wisdom tooth and am quite distracted by the pain in my mouth. Perhaps some of this feels quite vague because of it.</em></p>
<p>So the intention of writing daily hasn&#8217;t worked out (as usual). Life gets in the way.</p>
<p>But damn, I learnt a thousand different things this week, and only a quarter of those were language. Here&#8217;s a few bits of particular interest linguistically or culturally:</p>
<p>1. The alphabet has three vowel sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;A&#8221; pronounced like a in &#8220;ah&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8221; pronounced like i in &#8220;sit&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;U&#8221; pronounced like u in &#8220;pull&#8221;</p>
<p>There are only 23 letters in total in Pitjantjatjara. We use the Latin alphabet to write them and some letters are doubled up for pronunciation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>A, AA, I, II, K, L, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">L</span>, LY, M, N, NG, NY, P, R, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">R</span>, T, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span>, TJ, U, UU, W, Y</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Many of our English sounds are quite difficult to pronounce because of their non-existence in Pitjantjatjara. Sh and Ch often become TJ. S disappears. B becomes P. D becomes T.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even going to try and explain how to pronounce some of the sounds. My tongue has been stretched in a variety of peculiar directions. And damn, why do I keep learning languages that need me to trill my Rs?</p>
<p>2. There&#8217;s no <a class="zem_slink" title="Passive voice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">passive voice</a> in Pitjantjatjara. This has to change the way people communicate. In English, especially in bureaucrat-speak, passive voice is so important for distancing oneself from the topic at hand, but using this kind of language with someone who has never heard of it in their own language must be highly confusing. Constant active voice must also mean that disagreements can be resolved more directly. &#8220;You have annoyed me!&#8221; rather than &#8220;I have been annoyed!&#8221; (perhaps not the best example, but hey, I&#8217;m writing under local anaesthetic).</p>
<p>Abstract nouns don&#8217;t always translate well into Pitjantjatjara. It has its own set of abstract nouns that don&#8217;t necessarily translate into English. Ironically, one of the words that is most difficult to translate is &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; &#8211; perhaps one of the most commonly used words in Aboriginal politics. So, it becomes all the more important to choose words carefully when speaking in English with native Pitjantjatjara speakers.</p>
<p>So often we make assumptions about what can be understood easily and do not consider this.</p>
<p>3. I learnt a lot more about family and culture. The below picture is of the family of one of my tutors. It&#8217;s taken not from her mother&#8217;s generation, but from her grandmother&#8217;s generation and it gives some idea of just how close A<span style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span>angu family ties are.</p>
<p><a href="http://farfromthebigsmoke.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-303" alt="Image" src="http://farfromthebigsmoke.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo.jpg?w=580" /></a></p>
<p>In the last post, I described my family. I recognised how my direct uncles were considered my fathers but also how some of my younger cousins could be considered my &#8216;elder&#8217; brother and sister. The photo above though shows how this not only stretches to my first cousins, but also my second cousins. It also demonstrates how a great grandmother becomes a &#8216;katja&#8217; daughter.</p>
<p>Along the side of the board, you&#8217;ll see the words &#8216;Ngana<span style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span>amiri&#8217; and &#8216;tjanamiltjanpa&#8217;. These relate to &#8216;skins&#8217; which determine how you relate and behave to members of your family (*and much, much more that I cannot explain). The word &#8216;moieties&#8217; was thrown around a lot during this discussion and this flew over my head. But we could see how the differences in &#8216;skins&#8217; changed the relationships between our tutors. Some tutors were able to joke and tease each other freely, while others were not able to speak in the same way to those people.</p>
<p>4. Today, Rev. Dr. Bill Edwards spoke to us about some of the history of early contact, Pukatja and the Ernabella Mission. I&#8217;ve been keen to hear Dr. Edwards speak since I read <a href="http://farfromthebigsmoke.wordpress.com/2011/11/19/winifred-hilliard-the-people-in-between-funk-wagnalls-1968/">Winifred Hilliard&#8217;s <em>The People Inbetween</em>.</a> He described how he came to work at Ernabella in the early 1950s and showed a video he&#8217;d recorded circa 1960. I was struck by his eloquence, passion and grace while talking, but most of all his humility. I purchased his essay titled &#8220;Mission in the Musgraves&#8221; and am really keen to read his other work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed this week and can&#8217;t wait for next week to start. I&#8217;m not at a conversational level of Pitjantjatjara yet (that would be a while away) but I feel pretty satisfied with my rate of progress. Plus it&#8217;s opened me up to a whole range of aspects of cultural life that effect my classroom.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>University has typically been referred to as a privilege. This is true, especially in the age where a girl can get shot for wanting to receive an education. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/us-college-students-confidence_n_2426858.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003&amp;ir=Education" target="_blank">The Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) of UCLA surveyed thousands of &#8220;college freshmen&#8221;</a> (for those who are not American, &#8220;college&#8221; refers to both university and college students) on their perception of their own abilities.</p>
<p>Many described themselves as exceptional.</p>
<p>A 2006 study from CIRP showed that modern college students are more ambitious, leading to an &#8220;ambition inflation&#8221;. This is a more eloquent way of saying &#8220;the bigger something is, the harder they&#8217;ll fall&#8221;. A quick example can be drawn from some American Idol contestants and the shock registered when a judge says that the contestant isn&#8217;t their cup of tea.</p>
<p>To be fair, going to post-secondary education (PSE) does require ambition. When I applied to university, I was ambitious to embark on a journey studying a discipline I would enjoy (and I do), and I wanted to use the knowledge I will gain to change the world for the better. However, when is it too much? When does the fire burn too hot?</p>
<p>The media tends to portray lifestyles that cannot exist for the average person, despite starring average people. Today&#8217;s youth are much more exposed to reality shows. They learn that acting stupidly can earn more money than studying for 10 years to become a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s valid thinking. Whenever money is involved, of course we need to measure the expenses and revenue. If I can earn a lot more for working less, why not?</p>
<p><em>Because this is a pipe dream for most people</em>.</p>
<p>The cult of individualism, especially in North America, is part of the blame as well. Social agents constantly feed the young with sugar-coated phrases. You may have heard them before; they appear on posters sold in stores that target teachers. &#8220;You are special&#8221;, &#8220;The world is your oyster&#8221;, &#8220;You are unique&#8221;, etc. <em>Everyone</em> is being told they are special. <i>Everyone</i> is unique.</p>
<p>Due to this mindset, it is too easy to adopt a sense of entitlement. I have noticed this in my schools as well, and particularly on social media sites such as tumblr, where people genuinely get upset over the fact that their parents bought them an iPhone 4 instead of an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Youth today have a stronger sense of entitlement, and unfortunately, we can&#8217;t really blame them for it. Society, parents, teachers, and other caregivers have fed them pretty phrases rather than saying, &#8220;You have a special ability, and you should <em>work with others to create a better future&#8221;. </em>It is unfortunate that some youth feel they can take on the world by storm, and end up being too competitive to work with their peers. Too much competition spoils any progress they make, or can potentially make, and ruins relationships.</p>
<p>Another problem with feeding pretty phrases to youth is that it is too much. Along with the sense of entitlement, youth today are believing that they are <em>innately special</em>, that they&#8217;re born with it. Some think they have this innate talent or gift that makes them stand out from the others (and most do), and they think that they don&#8217;t need to work so hard because they are entitled to benefits anyway.</p>
<p>It is a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>As educators, we need to change how we speak to students. Do not just say &#8220;You are special&#8221; or &#8220;You are unique&#8221;. Rather, comment on the ability that they have, or their behaviours, instead of targeting the person. For example, &#8220;I like that you show all your steps; it shows me clearly how you are thinking&#8221; is better than &#8220;You&#8217;re smart at math&#8221;.</p>
<p>The method of targeting behaviour rather than the person also works exceptionally well when trying to critique someone. When you target a behaviour instead of a person, you still get your message across, the receiver is able to distance themselves (and thus take in the criticism effectively) while being able to save face. It&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Bringing kids back to reality doesn&#8217;t mandate a burning crash through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. It doesn&#8217;t need to be painful. Educators (we are <em>all</em> educators, regardless if you are a teacher) need to talk in a different manner with their students. Sugar-coating under sparkly words like &#8220;you are unique&#8221; will only set them up for failure. Target the behaviour, not the person.</p>
<p>Education prepares students for the real world while equipping them with the tools for change. Having ambitious youth who refuse to do work will only cause society to spiral downward at a faster rate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hillpen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2578387623_600bdb8e85.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1217" alt="2578387623_600bdb8e85" src="http://hillpen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2578387623_600bdb8e85.jpg?w=300&#038;h=155" width="300" height="155" /></a></p>
<p>I’m not a big fan of bumper stickers.  I find it odd that people want to display their political sentiments on a used Honda for the world to see.  I find it annoying to have to stare at hateful words about our President at the stoplight in front of the grocery store.  And I’m amazed so many people put stick-figure families on their mini-vans to display how many people and pets live in their households.  <i>Yes, yes.</i> Michael plays soccer.  You have a cat.  Riveting stuff.</p>
<p>My own daughter asked that her school name be displayed on the back of our Chevy Tahoe.  But do you think given my poor driving and bad texting habit I want to announce what school we’re affiliated with and have people stare into the car from afar to see if they know me? You don’t know me.  I’m likely to run into you from the rear by accident or be smirking unpleasantly at your family of stick people.</p>
<p>So it might surprise you that I slapped a bumper sticker on the back of my car.  Yes I did. The very woman who is constantly shaking her head at the stupid Jesus Fish / Darwin Fish debacle.  It’s on there, firmly planted square in the middle.</p>
<p><i>Laugh until life makes sense</i>.</p>
<p>It’s one of my life mottos.  So when I saw this sticker a year ago, I immediately went home, created a (very often unseen) circle of clean with a paper towel and Windex, and stuck this saying on my back window.</p>
<p>Sometimes I check my rear-view mirror and see my daughter lip-syncing to Katy Perry, or notice that my son has used his squeezable yogurt to finger-paint on the back glass.  But quite often I simply catch the word – <i>laugh</i>. It’s written not only for the cars behind me, but for me to see when I need it most.  There are times I don’t feel like laughing. Times when I’m gripping the wheel in prayer that I’ll make it until lunch.  And yet somewhere in there, there’s a silver lining.</p>
<p>Given enough space and distance from pain, life can be funny.  What other attitude is really worth having? Who wants to hang out with people who scowl all day, eat fiber, and gripe about the lack of comfortable pants?  My oncologist said that people who laugh a lot really do live longer.  From one who’s made it through some rough health patches, I can use all the help I can get.</p>
<p>When my own life gets hard, I lose weight.  I end up putting the coffee creamer in the pantry and buy multiple cartons of eggs.  My dentist tells me that I might need a root canal and I realize my sobbing cry face looks like a hollowed out whale. So I go to the mall to invest in a quart of face cream but catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror.  How did a homeless woman end up at Neiman’s? Don’t they have security in this place?  Oh, wait.  That’s me, wearing a sweatshirt from high school that says <i>Coca-Cola Classic</i>.</p>
<p>And just like that, on my way to the YMCA to choke out a run on the treadmill, I smile.  It bobbles up and down into a chuckle, which erupts into a real belly shaker, and a few cackles later I’m in full-on snort mode.   Did I really go to Neiman’s wearing sweat pants with a hole in the knee?  Am I seriously going to need a root canal?  Why in the world do I have all these freaking eggs?</p>
<p>This life we live doesn’t make sense.  There is so much killing and suicide and death and mental illness.  There’s chaos and disarray and a dusty, cursed earth.  And yet we are made for more than this.  We are not in this place forever.  The righteous will not be moved, and you can only do what you can do in a day’s time.  And when the really hard stuff hits,  you&#8217;ll be prepared.  After a night of no sleep, you&#8217;ll wake up to discover you’re out of coffee, your kid&#8217;s school uniform is dirty, it&#8217;s snack day at your kid&#8217;s preschool and all you have is raisins, and some wild animal has knocked over your trash can in the night, strewing trash all over your front lawn.  You  have to fight demons and hurt with friends and heal from grief and now this? Yeah, it happens.  And it&#8217;s a tiny bit funny.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes says there is a time for everything.  A time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance.  3:4.  So mourn and sob and weep and sigh.  Take Advil and Zanax and buy more coffee.  But in the end, realize that you have enough eggs to make quiche for the tri-county area, and that’s just downright weird.</p>
<p>As for me and my Chevy Tahoe, we’re dwelling in this season of laughter as long as we both can, puffing and choking and driving toward the bitter end.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gnawingthebone.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/raud-kennedy-snake-oil.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-109" alt="Raud Kennedy - Snake Oil" src="http://gnawingthebone.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/raud-kennedy-snake-oil.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>It’s a good thing I don’t have a job or else I’d look like the Thompson cat after being chased through the brambles behind old lady Tucker’s house. You two-leggers don’t appreciate the work that goes into looking good when your entire body is covered with fur. Sure, you all have a little tuft on top of your head, but that’s nothing compared to me, a full-figured, fluffy Samoyed with my arctic white fur shining as if glistening with morning dew. And I’m beginning to wonder if that tuft of yours might be a wig, since more and more of you are going without, mostly men, and when I smell the women’s hair it smells very similar to what my two-legger uses to clean up my wee-wee. I don’t know what you use to clean a wig but you might use that. You certainly wouldn’t use wee-wee cleaner on your own hair, or maybe you all would. The odd stuff you do never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p>Sometimes after I eat and I’m feeling full and warm, I enjoy grooming my paws until I fall asleep. Now, if I had a job, I’d be so tired from schlepping all day that I’d probably fall asleep right after my last bite of supper. That’s what you all do from what I’ve observed, and I’m a keen observer. I notice everything. I can tell what kind of mood you’re in based on the pace you’re walking. I can tell if you’re hungry by the scent of your sugar levels in your sweat. I can tell if you’re old or young, a boy or a girl before I even see you. You announce your presence with the drift of the wind. And you say where you’ve gone with the skin dust you trail behind you.</p>
<p>It’s a rarity when my two-legger isn’t asleep or in a vegetative state in front of the widescreen after dinner. I don’t understand that vegetative state; reminds me of Maxwell, the cat I live with, when he stares at the fly on the wall long after the fly has come and gone. Nor do I understand the television and this compulsion to stare at it for long periods while your grooming goes to pot from continuous eating. I like to eat, too, but I stop when I’m full. The widescreen makes sudden obnoxious noises that startle me from my naps and fills the darkened room with erratic light patterns that mess with my dreams when my inner eyelid can’t shut out all the stupidity. I mean why go into a room, dim the lights as if you’re preparing to nap, and then turn on that noisy screen? You might as well empty a big basket of tomcats in a roomful of sleeping dogs.</p>
<p>All I can think of is that some of you are voyeurs while others are exhibitionists. I definitely fall into the exhibitionist camp, though you probably already figured that from my impeccably groomed paws. That is, if you noticed my paws. Many of you two-leggers aren’t very observant, which is amusing considering the endless hours you spend staring at that widescreen. Maybe instead of honing your skills of observation to razor sharpness, it dulls them with its barrage of useless images. How many times in an evening do you need to see a woman flashing a patently false smile while she holds a bottle of snake oil next to her face and tells you it has cured her of creaky joints, or settled her stomach after eating fish guts, or cleaned the birdshit off the hood of her car?</p>
<p>Now, if you’re a voyeur, I guess learning of others’ troubles and watching their demise gets you going, or watching fantasy lives so impossibly exciting that by comparison your life is dull and monotonous makes you depressed, so that all you can do when you get home from work is eat and fall asleep on the couch while being showered by the light of this tableau of lies. If you’re a voyeur, you’re screwed. It all leads to discontentment one way or another. You aren’t cool enough, thin enough, pretty enough, strong enough, studly enough, irrational enough, emotional enough, calm enough. You just can’t win. Being an exhibitionist, I don’t care about any of that. I’m too busy showing off because I <i>am</i> thin enough, <i>pretty</i> enough, <i>cool</i> enough, because I don’t pay any attention to that widescreen telling me I’m not. What does it know? It certainly doesn’t know me. And it definitely hasn’t seen my paws. If it had, some puffball image of a dog wouldn’t be pitching me snake oil for paw cleaning when I have a perfectly good tongue for that. Besides, tasting the dirt as I groom myself takes me on a trip down memory lane of where I’ve been recently. Oh, that must be one of old lady Tucker’s brambles. That cat was fast. Maybe I’ll catch it next time. See what I mean?</p>
<p>I live with a family of two-leggers, a big male, a not quite as big female, a small male and female, and an infant that smells like baby powder when it doesn’t smell like poop and I’m pretty sure it’s a male, though it’s hard to tell because it doesn’t have the scent of post-puberty hormones saturating the air around it. Go to a singles bar and that’s all there is. You all smell beer breath, cigarettes, Speed Stick and perfume, but underneath that the room is awash in hormones and pheromones. Your average family dog wouldn’t know much about singles bars, but the big male has taken me there a few times when he’s had to swing by to get something. It’s definitely a place for voyeurs and exhibitionists. Do they have to pair up in that order? Would two exhibitionists be happy together? Or would they have to mate in front of a mirror? And two voyeurs? Would they even have the initiative to mate?</p>
<p>My two-legger family is evenly split. The big male is a voyeur, the big female an exhibitionist; in fact I think the male picked her out at his bar. The little male is also an exhibitionist. He models his mother’s shoes in the mirror when no one is home and tells me how pretty he looks, but he thinks his mom has bad taste in shoes. He’d like more rhinestones. The little female is a watcher—a voyeur who doesn’t want to be seen watching. She knows about her brother and the shoes and a few other things, but keeps quiet about it, not for her brother’s sake, but because she doesn’t want people to know she sees what she sees. She is like me in that very little gets by her. And the baby? Too soon to tell. Maybe he’ll be something new—someone who doesn’t need to watch or to show off, but simply is. I feel like that sometimes, lost in the moment of just existing, but then I spot someone pointing at me and overhear them saying how beautiful I am and I’m back to prancing like a show horse and soaking up their adulation. Vanity has its costs. It pulls me out of the moment. Well, you can’t live in the moment all of the time no matter how cool they tell you it is. You’d forget to eat, and we all need to eat, even cats.</p>
<p>Cats are the ultimate voyeurs. Like two-leggers and their odd behaviors, cats take it to the extreme, where they watch you with such intensity that it becomes stalking, and they’re not watching for the sake of learning who you are and seeing what you’re like, but looking for your vulnerabilities where they can move in for the kill. They look for that brief moment when you’re distracted by that blueberry muffin crumb that got kicked under the fridge, and then they swoop in with their claws out and scratch your nose. It happens all the time, all over the world. They know your weaknesses because they stalk you. The snake oil lady on the widescreen is the same. I sometimes wonder if she can see you all in the same way you all see her, because she knows an awful lot about you, just like the cats probing for weaknesses, and for some reason you all believe what she says.</p>
<p>One evening I was happily grooming my paws on a full belly when the big female squatted down next to me like she was going to pee in the woods, grabbed one of my paws and started spraying it with the same snake oil I saw the lady on the widescreen smiling about. She was soaking my paws in shower scum remover, and being the family dog I was expected to lie there and take it, or else get pinned down by the big male, which would leave me with no recourse but to bite and that would lead down a path that would be difficult to get back from. Instead, I bade my time, and once she was done messing with my paws, I spent the extra time cleaning the scum remover off them. She tried to stop me, but nature will get what it wants eventually. Same with the family dog. You can’t watch us all the time. If you did, you’d miss your favorite shows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is it about the desire to learn, to <em>know</em>, that keeps me so scatter-brained?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asking myself this for awhile. It almost seems as if it&#8217;s very possible to be interested in <em>too many</em> things. Trying to cram reading, be it via the internet or traditional books, into our lives which tend to already be packed fat with responsibilities has the appearance of being accomplished with ease, yet we run out of time, and if we don&#8217;t, we rationalize ourselves into doing something that requires slightly less of our attention. Of course, I say &#8220;we&#8221; when I really mean &#8220;I.&#8221; Or is it &#8220;me?&#8221; Either way, I have no idea what your day is like.</p>
<p>Nobody can really say I don&#8217;t try to get my learn on as much as possible. I&#8217;m just complaining that it is more difficult than my idealist half thinks it should be. I suppose if someone were to make a webcam show out of my typical day, they would find me to be a terrible bore before the hours of 8pm or 9pm. I don&#8217;t talk much, even in the company of my grandma, unless, of course, she seems interested in a conversation. Typically she prefers to just drift in and out of a twilight sleep until it&#8217;s time to do something, like eat or exercise. Maybe about once a day, her brain is active enough to discuss something she saw on tv, or maybe a memory popped in to her head that she wants to tell me about. To be honest, I actually relish these times. I still believe that she does not have dementia, like my mother, aunt and doctors suspect. I spend four to five straight days a week with her, and I think she&#8217;s just really, really bored with <em>everything</em> because she&#8217;s too tired to keep up half the time. I suppose I would be at 91, too. We forget to adjust ourselves to the perspective of those we&#8217;re trying to truly assess.</p>
<p>Maybe I also try to tackle too much at once. In the past three days, I have taken on a book about Information Theory, another on the nitty gritty of GPS technology, and enrolled in a free video lecture class about Game Theory. I even stopped at the store on my way home from punishing my body (aka, exercising) to pick up a fresh notebook and pen to keep notes on all three things.</p>
<p>It dawned on me over my morning cigarette that perhaps I load myself up with too much at once. This whole quest to &#8220;improve&#8221; is so captivating and sexy to me that I want to gorge on it. As a result, I chose three rather heady subjects to swallow simultaneously, one of which is proving to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for me to wrap my head around (Information Theory). Out of the three, only Game Theory might hold some practical application in my life, and even that might be a stretch. One might argue that understanding GPS technology will help me use it better, but to be honest, I&#8217;m not doing anything technical with it. Nor do I plan to. It&#8217;s simply a curiosity and nothing more. When it comes to GPS technology, I do what everyone else does with it; find shit to do. Even my persistent and active interest in ham radio hasn&#8217;t really led me to what other hams are doing with GPS. My interest in it holds no quantifiable value that I can see. I just *am* interested in it, and I have no idea why. This happens a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m at least partially attributing this lust for learning to my strange, &#8220;Korsakoff&#8217;s Syndrome-like&#8221; brain. As prone as I am to self diagnosis, I don&#8217;t actually think I have Korsakoff&#8217;s, although, I spent many years of my life drinking heavily, so I suppose the chance exists. To be fair to myself, I should add that I drink significantly less than I used to these days. In one sitting I mights till put away half a bottle of whiskey, but those sittings are far less frequent than they used to be. Either way, the problem is my fault. Maybe it&#8217;s from drug abuse, and maybe it&#8217;s from trying to dive into the deep end of academia without a proper floatation device. Maybe it&#8217;s a combination of both. I can&#8217;t really be sure, now that I really think about it.</p>
<p>What I am sure of is that it&#8217;s particularly annoying. Mentally, I go off on tangents easily, I forget, or have trouble recalling with any real speed, or I jumble up various tidbits of knowledge and end up sounding like an idiot. The process I experience each time I have any sort of in-depth discussion with anyone on any subject is a kin to walking into the messiest home you can imagine and trying to find the torn corner of a piece of paper with a particular phone number scratched on it. Organizing that cacophony of information starts to look more and more like a multiple life prison sentence each day, yet I cannot stop myself from adding to the pile.</p>
<p>This is something to consider.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve determined that every Best Actor and Actress has something in common. They pick roles that will shock people. They pick roles that are challenging. They pick roles that will make people love them because, deep down, they hate themselves so much. The least we can do is award them with some kind of trophy for all their hard work on top of their enormous salaries. We’re just the little people, after all.</p>
<p>If you want to go through all of the mess of going on auditions and getting discovered, go right ahead. That’s the hard stuff. If you want to find a role that will win you an Oscar, then you’ve come to the right place. Here are some tricks of the trade I&#8217;ve picked up from being an avid movie watcher:</p>
<p><b>Make yourself fugly</b>. No one wants to be on the big screen and look awful, right? Well, if you do, The Academy will most likely consider you “brave” and nominate you for one thing or another. For example, look at Anne Hathaway’s choice this year. She could’ve opted for a different role, but she chose the shave-your-head-snot-dripping-crying role. I can’t get over her bravery.</p>
<div id="attachment_1945" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 526px"><a href="http://lilyincanada.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/anne-hathaway-les-miserables-fantine.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1945" alt="Ew ew ew." src="http://lilyincanada.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/anne-hathaway-les-miserables-fantine.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ew ew ew.</p></div>
<p>Others that have won or been nominated for awards by making themselves gross are: John Hurt (<i>The Elephant Man</i>), Mickey Rourke (<i>The Wrestler</i>), Charlize Theron (<i>Monster</i>), Gabourey Sidibe (<i>Precious</i>).</p>
<p>Side note: I realize that Mr. Rourke and Ms. Sidibe already looked like that before their roles, but still. They’re on the list.</p>
<p><b>Go insane</b>. Crazy characters are always fun to watch. There’s nothing better than a good old fashioned break-down. I believe that in order to play someone who goes off the deep end, you’ve had to have experience of it yourself. Just keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Examples of expert crazies: Vivien Leigh (<i>A Streetcar Named Desire),</i> Bette Davis (<i>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</i>), Ellen Burstyn (<i>Requiem for a Dream</i>), Natalie Portman (<i>Black Swan</i>).</p>
<p>Hey all girls! Whadda know?!</p>
<p><b>The old switcheroo</b>. To show The Academy what an amazing skill set you have, try portraying the other sex. This should prove difficult even for the best of them. If you go through with it though, you’ll no doubt be awarded for your talent. I mean, even Gwyneth Paltrow won for dressing up as a guy in <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>. Is that really Oscar quality? No. But she dressed up as a boy so it’s fine.</p>
<div id="attachment_1946" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 501px"><a href="http://lilyincanada.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/shakespeareinlove3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1946" alt="So convincing. " src="http://lilyincanada.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/shakespeareinlove3.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So convincing.</p></div>
<p>Other examples of people that can play<em></em> the opposite gender well are: Hillary Swank (<i>Boys Don’t Cry</i>), Dustin Hoffman (<i>Tootsie</i>), Jaye Davidson (<i>The Crying Game</i>).</p>
<p><b>Mental disability fall-back</b>. This type of role is tried and true. It’s basically a guarantee that you will win an award for playing someone “special”. It’s also a guarantee that someone is going to comment on this post and tell me that I’m being offensive. I’m just being brave, okay?!</p>
<p>Examples of people that were itching for an Oscar: Billy Bob Thornton (<i>Sling Blade</i>), Dustin Hoffman (<i>Rain Man</i>), Tom Hanks (<i>Forrest Gump</i>), Sean Penn (<i>I Am Sam</i>).</p>
<p>Oh look, all men. This type of role seems to come easy to them.</p>
<p><b>Holocaust roles</b>. Everyone knows how disturbing the Holocaust was, yet for some reason we like to keep reliving it by watching movies about it. For those of us who didn’t get a chance to actually be there, it’s a great way to see what really happened, right?</p>
<p>Examples of these challenging and brave roles: Roberto Benigni (<i>Life is Beautiful</i>) Liam Neeson (<i>Schindler’s List</i>), Adrien Brody (<i>The Pianist</i>).</p>
<p>If all else fails, try to morph into Daniel Day Lewis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planet Money&#8217;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/25/167976196/episode-238-making-christmas-more-joyful-and-more-efficient">Dec. 25 podcast</a> was <a href="http://mattdickenson.com/2012/11/28/the-politics-and-economics-of-drug-dealing-part-ii/">another episode</a> that was too good not to blog. They perform a classroom experiment related to gift-giving: randomly distributing ten different treats to a classroom of seventh-graders. Each student received one snack, which ranged in desirability from raisins and Fig Newtons to Three Musketeers and Sour Patch Kids.</p>
<p>Upon initially receiving their gifts, the kids gave an estimate of how much they liked what they received on a scale from 1 to 10. The total utility of the class at this stage of the experiment was 50. It took about 11.8 seconds for one of the middle schoolers to suggest that they could all be better off by trading. After one minute of swapping, the class&#8217;s utility went up to 82.</p>
<p>Economists are used to this sort of thing, but take a minute to appreciate how significant this is. The students&#8217; assessment of how well off they were went up <em>60 percent</em> in only 60 seconds. That&#8217;s without the addition of any other resources except time, and a free market. Without any more &#8220;stuff,&#8221; they still achieved more happiness.</p>
<p>This reminded me of two economics lessons related to trade. The first reminder was of R.A. Radford&#8217;s classic article, &#8220;The Economic Organization of a P.O.W. Camp.&#8221; Radford discusses how soldiers would trade items from their Red Cross packets (gifts, of a sort) to achieve greater total utility. There was so much utility left on the table in the initial allocation that a middleman&#8211;a chaplain, if I recall correctly&#8211;was able to facilitate the trades and turn his own packet into two as a reward for his efforts. (See <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2008/10/munger_on_middl.html">this podcast</a> for a discussion of the paper.)</p>
<p>The second reminder was of a very similar classroom experiment. Marc Bellemare runs a <a href="http://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/2012/09/the-trading-game/">trading game</a> at the beginning of his microeconomics course. It has the same setup as above: a random initial allocation of goods (in this case, inexpensive toys and trinkets), pre-trade measure of aggregate utility, a short trading period (five minutes), and a post-trade utility increase. Last fall his students experienced similar gains to the middle schoolers discussed above:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I ran the Trading Game last week, my class’ “aggregate welfare” went from 128 to about 180, if I recall correctly, and you could just see that it had become obvious to students that (in this context of well enforced property rights) trade not only left no one worse off, but it increased aggregate welfare.</p></blockquote>
<p>One final, interesting aspect gets brought up in the Planet Money podcast but not resolved: several of the students seem rather displeased with what they get, even though it was a <em>gift</em>. They are certainly no worse off but it does seem odd to assign a value of 0 (i.e. no different than their pre-gift utility) after receiving something that they did not have to work for. The Planet Money hosts seem to think that the kids should be happier.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the kids are grasping another subtle economic concept&#8211;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Even though they had no candy initially and had done nothing to earn it, the experiment publicly gave everyone an opportunity for a gift and they could see what their fellow students received. The kids may have assigned some value to their expected gift (the average of those around them, say) before they received anything. If what they got was worth less to them than what they expected, they were disappointed because they had lost the opportunity for something better. (Keep in mind that at that stage of the experiment they did not know that trading would occur.)
