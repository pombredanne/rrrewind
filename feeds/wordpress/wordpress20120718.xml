<p><a href="http://misanthropology101.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cats-hugging-cuddling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4303" title="cats-hugging-cuddling" src="http://misanthropology101.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cats-hugging-cuddling.jpg?w=338&h=450" alt="" width="338" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Put the Toilet Seat (and Lid) Down After Use</strong></p>
<p><em>Or we will drink out of it and then lick your face.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Vacuum at Least Once a Week</strong></p>
<p><em>Or watch your allergic friends swell and choke to an agonizing death before your eyes.</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong>3. Clean Your Dishes as Soon as You&#8217;re Done with Them</strong></p>
<p><em>Or else licking. Also, see #1 re: licking and why it should unsettle you.</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong>4. Do All Your Little Daily Chores (Like Cleaning the Cat Box)</strong></p>
<p><em>Or we will pee on everything you own.</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong>5. Close Doors to Keep AC In</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>And cats out. For a little while, at least.</em></p>
<p><strong>6. Early to Bed, Early to Rise!</strong></p>
<p><em>Whether you want to rise or not, because we will howl until you get up.</em></p>
<p>Really, they&#8217;ve been very good for my housekeeping skills. Every bachelor should have one, or a few. But possibly not more than two or three, because there comes a point in bachelorhood where too many cats starts to look a little sad, and worrisome to your family.</p>
<p>Or so I&#8217;m told. By my family.</p>
<p>Cats! I&#8217;m sure they teach other good lessons. Share a few in the comments. Or tell me why dogs are better; meaningless controversies are awesome for page hits. Whatever floats your boat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Top Ten Tuesday theme this week at <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/features.html">The Broke and the Bookish</a> is &#8220;Top Ten Books For People Who Like X Book (Pick a book and pick 10 readalikes)&#8221;. I&#8217;m having a tough time finding a book that lends itself to the challenge, so I decided to broaden it a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Top Ten Non-Fiction Books for Novel Lovers</strong></p>
<p>Until I went to college, I considered non-fiction to be insanely dull. Why would you read about history or sociology or ugh science when there are so many fantastic novels just waiting to be devoured? I never imagined that non-fiction could hold a candle to fiction when it came to characters or drama.</p>
<p>How wrong I was. The first non-fiction book I fell into was <em>The Devil in the White City</em> by Erik Larson (which I wrote about in <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/books-and-lists-top-ten-tuesdays/">this Top Ten Tuesday post</a>). Twists! Intrigue! Murder most foul! And a world&#8217;s fair! I was hooked by Larson&#8217;s gift of really exploring the drama behind historical events.</p>
<p>So here, for other doubters, is a list of ten non-fiction books that even the staunchest, most stubborn of novel readers will love.</p>
<p>(A quick note: There are some other books that I would&#8217;ve 100% included, but I&#8217;ve already written about them for other Top Ten Tuesdays, and I didn&#8217;t want to have too many repeats. In this category, I would include <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/books-and-lists-top-ten-tuesdays/"><em>Columbine</em> by Dave Cullen</a>, <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/books-and-lists-top-ten-tuesdays/"><em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em> by Joan Didion</a>, <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/books-and-lists-top-ten-tuesdays/"><em>Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea</em> by Barbara Demick</a>, <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/top-ten-books-for-people-who-like-david-sedaris/"><em>The Know-It-All: One Man’s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World</em> by A.J. Jacobs</a>, <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/top-ten-books-for-people-who-like-david-sedaris/"><em>Assassination Vacation</em> by Sarah Vowell</a>, <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/top-ten-books-for-people-who-like-david-sedaris/"><em>Music for Chameleons</em> by Truman Capote</a>, and <a href="http://ohdizzle.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/top-ten-books-for-people-who-like-david-sedaris/"><em>I&#8217;m a Stranger Here Myself</em> by Bill Bryson</a>. Also, I decided to leave out straight up biographies or memoirs, although some of these choices do have elements of those genres. Those seem to belong to their own category completely.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Isaac&#8217;s Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History</em> by Erik Larson</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/isaac-storm1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-981" style="border:0;" title="isaac storm" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/isaac-storm1.jpg?w=192&h=300" alt="" width="192" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As I have mentioned at least 635 times by now, Erik Larson is a non-fiction god. This recounting of the horrifically devastating 1900 Galveston Hurricane focuses on Isaac Cline, the meteorologist for the US Weather Bureau, who finds himself completely outdone by the monster storm, which ended up killing 6,000 people. Science, disaster, pride&#8230;perfection.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong> In Cold Blood </strong></em><strong>by Truman Capote</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168642.In_Cold_Blood"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982" style="border:0;" title="in cold blood" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/in-cold-blood.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="278" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><br />
</strong>If you&#8217;ve seen the movie <em>Capote, </em>you know the basics of this classic book. A horrific, random-seeming murder takes place in a small mid-western town, leaving the entire community, and Truman Capote, looking for answers. Capote spent a lot of time with the killers, interviewing them and really getting to know them. What came out of that experience is a gorgeous, poignant, and at times harrowing book. This is the top of true crime, in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Zeitoun</em> by Dave Eggers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168642.In_Cold_Blood"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-983" style="border:0;" title="zeitoun" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/zeitoun.jpg?w=207&h=300" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Zeitoun decides to ride Hurricane Katrina out instead of fleeing with his family. His eyewitness report of the horrors and massive government policy errors that came after the storm are shocking. This book stands as an important reminder of one of the darkest moments in American policy decisions in the past fifty years.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith </strong></em><strong>by Jon Krakauer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1894.Under_the_Banner_of_Heaven"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-984" style="border:0;" title="banner of heaven" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/banner-of-heaven.jpg?w=193&h=300" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, pretty much anything  by Jon Krakauer could be on this list. <em>Into the Wild </em>and <em>Into Thin Air</em> are both spectacular nonfiction works as well. I chose to highlight <em>Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith </em>mostly because I&#8221;m fascinated by religions, especially new ones like Mormonism. Besides just going over the basic tenets of the faith, Krakauer tells the very sad but fascinating story of a woman and her daughter murdered by religious extremists. Highly recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong>by Barbara Ehrenreich</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1869.Nickel_and_Dimed"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-985" style="border:0;" title="nickel and dimed" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/nickel-and-dimed.jpg?w=200&h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are many parts of the general population that are often ignored in mainstream media, and those that live right at or below the poverty level are often included in that. Barbara Ehrenreich decided to see for herself what it would be like to try to live on minimum wage, and she discovered just how hard it is to scrape by.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks </strong></em><strong>by Rebecca Skloot</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-986" style="border:0;" title="henrietta lacks" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/henrietta-lacks.jpg?w=207&h=300" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One of the hit books of last year, <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks </em>investigates the ethics of the medical world. Henrietta Lacks was a young woman who died of cervical cancer in the early 1950&#8242;s. Cells from her tumor were found to be immortal, instead of dying after a few days. These cells were used to do all sorts of important biological and medical research, without her family knowing about it for years. Is this ethical or fair? Would her family have been treated differently if they were white or in a different socioeconomic bracket? What is the greater good?</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Boys of Summer</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong>by Roger Kahn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137787.The_Boys_of_Summer"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-987" style="border:0;" title="boys of summer" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boys-of-summer.jpg?w=197&h=300" alt="" width="197" height="300" /></a><br />
</strong>Dodger baseball. Ah. Glorious. This classic sports book follows the Dodgers in their Brooklyn days, and then checks up with their star players to see what happened to them once they left the diamond. It&#8217;s eye-opening to see what happens to athlete heroes, once they become to old to play.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream </strong></em><strong>by H.G. Bissinger</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/927593.Friday_Night_Lights_"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-988" style="border:0;" title="friday night lights" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/friday-night-lights.jpg?w=191&h=300" alt="" width="191" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><br />
</strong>And another of my favorite sports: high school football. Before the tv show and movie, there was this fantastic recounting of one season of Odessa, Texas high school football, and what it means to the community. The pressure is intense, and the hopes are high. Brilliant and sad.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>A Moveable Feast </strong></em><strong>by Ernest Hemingway</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4631.A_Moveable_Feast"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-989" style="border:0;" title="moveable feast" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/moveable-feast.jpg?w=194&h=300" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p>I like to imagine that if I had lived in Paris in the 1920&#8242;s, I would&#8217;ve hung out with Hemingway and Fitzgerald all the time. We would&#8217;ve drank and danced and caroused. It would&#8217;ve been epic. Reading Hemingway&#8217;s recounting of that time period is the next best thing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal </strong></em><strong>by Eric Schlosser</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1097.Fast_Food_Nation"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-990" style="border:0;" title="fast food nation" src="http://ohdizzle.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/fast-food-nation.jpg?w=199&h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Want to read a million reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be eating fast food? Here you go. Your waistline will thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this most recent birthday I turned 28 years old.  2-8.  2 years from 30.</p>
<div id="attachment_275" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coffins.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-275" title="coffins" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coffins.jpg?w=300&h=189" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;We&#8217;ll go ahead and get this warmed up for you.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>And, all in all, it was a great birthday.  I spent it with a man I love.  I ate a giant fucking steak (which is now a prerequisite for all good days).  I got a hug from my mom.   I recollected on the past year and felt good about it.  I checked Facebook to see all the happy birthday messages (far less than last year and years previous &#8211; but all quality wishes).  I wondered about next year, next birthday, and then birthday after that.  I came up with a list of 5 things I&#8217;m looking forward to when it comes to getting older.</p>
<p>Thing I&#8217;m looking forward to about getting older #5 &#8211; Looking good for my age.</p>
<p>I went to dinner on Thursday night (for the aforementioned giant fucking steak) and the waitress says</p>
<div id="attachment_276" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 204px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/waitress.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-276" title="" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/waitress.jpg?w=194&h=300" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;So, do we have a special occasion?&#8221;</p></div>
<p>And my boyfriend says, &#8220;It&#8217;s her birthday today, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the waitress asks a question that never gets asked.  &#8221;How old are you today?&#8221;</p>
<p>I pause.  Did she really just ask my age?  Most southern women don&#8217;t ask that.  But I answer.  &#8221;I am 28 years old today.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 273px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/surprised-face.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-277" title="surprised-face" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/surprised-face.jpg?w=263&h=300" alt="" width="263" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Really?! You don&#8217;t look 28!&#8221; (my waitress is asian now &#8211; fuck you)</p></div>
<p>You&#8217;re goddamn right I don&#8217;t look 28.  I&#8217;ve got genetics on my side, son!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I want.  I want every woman that ever pulls the crazy stunt of asking my age to immediately regret the decision.  I want to explain that I have a Hispanic mom (ethnicity one-up), I wear sunscreen everyday, and I have a round face which always makes people look younger.  So I&#8217;m looking forward to shocking people when they ask my age the older I get, because chances are, I&#8217;ll always look younger than they expect.</p>
<div id="attachment_278" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/old_lady_laughing.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-278" title="old_lady_laughing" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/old_lady_laughing.jpg?w=300&h=186" alt="" width="300" height="186" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;You&#8217;re goddamn right I don&#8217;t look 95. Gotcha, bitch!&#8221; (yep, I&#8217;m asian and toothless now &#8211; fuck you)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing I&#8217;m looking forward to about getting older #4 &#8211; Talking about things that were around when I was &#8220;your age&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for history.  I still remember when you got charged for the internet by the minute.  I remember typing a report on a typewriter in elementary school.  Oregon Trail.  Popples.  Pee-wee&#8217;s Playhouse.  I love that shit.  And now, I can tell you how much I love that shit because I have time on my side, buddy, and you have young ears for listening.</p>
<div id="attachment_281" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/black-man-yelling-into-phone.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-281" title="black-man-yelling-into-phone" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/black-man-yelling-into-phone.jpg?w=300&h=180" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;THIS IS SOME DOPE SHIIIIIITTTTT!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I, personally, find it sometimes boring when older people tell me about things they liked or places they went because I don&#8217;t always understand the context.  But I also understand that age gives you the right to bore young people&#8230;and I&#8217;m cashing in those chips&#8230;with a vengeance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing I&#8217;m looking forward to about getting older #3 &#8211; Hating everything you like.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand a lot of what people 5 years younger than me like.  10 years younger, I&#8217;m even more lost.  And kids?  I don&#8217;t know anything about what they like.  And if getting older has taught me anything it&#8217;s that if I don&#8217;t understand it, I hate it.  I will hate it because it&#8217;s new, I will hate it because you like it, I will hate it because you&#8217;re younger than me.</p>
<div id="attachment_282" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kidzbop-13-cd-cover.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-282" title="kidzbop-13-cd-cover" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kidzbop-13-cd-cover.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Seriously, kill yourself. No, don&#8217;t ask, just do it.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m too young to be crotchety but there&#8217;s a certain anger that springs up from seeing the world liking things without you. New things happening without your input or consent.  Things changing that you liked just fine before.</p>
<div id="attachment_283" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bigstockphoto_i_do_not_want_to_sleep_1287088.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-283" title="bigstockphoto_i_do_not_want_to_sleep_1287088" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bigstockphoto_i_do_not_want_to_sleep_1287088.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Mom, you don&#8217;t understand, once I go to sleep everyone I like has a party without me. Grab my coat.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>But at least I&#8217;m old enough to hate that.  Hearing teenagers bitch about new things is like a sapling bitching about seeds &#8211; you were JUST THERE.  Give it some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing I&#8217;m looking forward to about getting older #2 &#8211; Gray hairs.</p>
<p>I have a few of these.  My brother has more than a few of these.  My dad started going gray when he was in his early 20s.  Gray hairs are fun because they embody all of what is cool about being older &#8211; with time, who you are grows into something different.  I&#8217;ve purposely stopped coloring my hair to see the grays come in and have not been disappointed.  They&#8217;re especially fun because their characteristics are completely different from your other hairs &#8211; they&#8217;re thicker like some optic cable and stick out in weird ways.  They could give a fuck what they look like and don&#8217;t care what you do&#8230;much like old people.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/old-man-kitteh31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-286" title="Old man kitteh" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/old-man-kitteh31.jpg?w=300&h=188" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing I&#8217;m looking forward to about getting older #1 &#8211; Figuring it all out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not old.  I speak of all these things like I am, but I am thankful for the youth I still have.  But I&#8217;m getting acquainted with the idea that one day I&#8217;m going to wake up and I won&#8217;t be young anymore.  I&#8217;ll have wrinkles.  My body will be less spry, less springy, less agile, less cooperative.  That doesn&#8217;t scare me as much as it used to, though it still makes me uneasy at times.</p>
<div id="attachment_284" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 211px"><a href="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/weird-fairy-grandfather.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-284" title="weird-fairy-grandfather" src="http://chrissieadamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/weird-fairy-grandfather.jpg?w=201&h=300" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Greetings, it&#8217;s the old age fairy here to bestow tidings of achy joints, saggy skin, and crippling regret. Sleep well.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>But it happens.  And while I&#8217;m getting older, I&#8217;m becoming who I&#8217;m supposed to be &#8211; the person that was behind all the youthful shenanigans, blunders, and stupidity.  The person that needed those things in order to grow.  I&#8217;m more &#8220;me&#8221; now than I&#8217;ve ever been before.  I know who and what I love, I know what I like, I know what can happen, and I&#8217;m looking forward to taking the time getting to where I ultimately need to be.  Where will I be a year from now?  Five?  10?</p>
<p>Not knowing is part of the fun.  Happy 28 years, me.  You earned them.</p>

<p><em>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes ~ Proust</em></p>
<p>We all know what happened in 1492. Some Italian dude was commissioned by the Spanish King to sail around the world until he found Asia. His name was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> and he failed miserably, missing the Asian continent by several thousand miles and landing on some random island (Haiti) in the middle of the Caribbean &#8211; not a bad trade-off, if you ask me.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama">Vasco de Gama</a> took the trophy instead, reaching India in 1512 and helping Portugal become the first European power with naval access to Asia.  This is what Charlie Sheen would refer to as &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pipTwjwrQYQ">winning</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our friend Columbus wasn&#8217;t a complete failure, though.  He still discovered <em>something</em>, and that something turned out to be pretty damn important.  Ever hear of North and South America?  What about the United States?  Those things probably wouldn&#8217;t exist the way they do today if it weren&#8217;t for old Christopher&#8217;s epic fail.  Maybe we should start waving the Spanish flag on the fourth of July.  Kidding.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard this &#8220;origins&#8221; story before, probably in a seventh-grade history class, so let&#8217;s examine what happened afterwards.  It goes without saying that the Spaniards were pretty damn bitter about Portugal making sweet commercial love to China.  They wanted a piece of the action, but all they had was this stupid continent in the middle of the Pacific with endless resources and weak, impressionable people.  <em>Wait a minute</em>.  <em>Maybe we can use this worthless landmass</em>, they said in their thick, Iberian accents.  Columbus was totally on board (pun intended), eager to make a name for himself and prove to Vasco de Gama that he wasn&#8217;t a complete moron.  He laid out his evil plans quite clearly in his <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/columbus1.asp">journal</a>, writing that &#8220;They [the indigenous] would make fine servants . . . With fifty men we could subjugate them all, and make them do whatever we want.&#8221;  Sounds kinky.</p>
<p>So for the next few decades, Columbus organized a series of expeditions to the &#8220;New World,&#8221; where he discovered new landscapes, new cultures, and new ways of life.  He brought gifts from Spain (mostly diseases) to the indigenous peoples, and returned every so often to share the bounty of the New World (mostly women) with his Spanish compatriots.  This colonization process, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas"><em>La Conquista</em></a>, lasted several hundred years and witnessed a vast expansion of Spain&#8217;s empire, which at its height stretched from the tip of Argentina to the Canadian border.   They lost it all within a few hundred years, but that&#8217;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>In between episodes of conquest, murder, rape, and pillage, those dirty Spaniards worked up a serious appetite.  They were exposed to an array of new foods and cooking techniques in the New World, many of which were exported back to Spain and western Europe.  Ever hear of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato">potato</a>?  It came from the Andes mountains and is easily one of the most important starches in European cuisine &#8211; without it there would be no french fries, &#8220;chips,&#8221; papas bravas, or gnocchi.  Other Central and South American ingredients &#8211; tomatoes, chiles, peanuts  &#8211; made their mark as well.  So from a gastronomic perspective, Spain wasn&#8217;t the only nation involved in <em>La Conquista</em>.  Many of the so-called &#8220;conquered&#8221; lands were, in fact, doing quite a bit of conquering themselves.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s recipe is a tribute to the gastronomic volley that took place between Europe and the Americas during the age of colonization.  Old World meets New World in an 8-ounce pour that combines classic ingredients from each region (orange &amp; sherry from Spain, tequila &amp; lime from Mexico).  It&#8217;s a bit of a metaphor, a symbolic harmony of two formerly disparate cultures whose histories remain intrinsically connected &#8211; not only in the culinary arts, but in everything.  The synthesis occurs in the best possible medium &#8211; a cocktail &#8211; to stoke the spirit of cultural celebration.  So raise your glasses, my friends.  Here&#8217;s to new flavors in old places (and vice versa).</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
2 oz orange juice<br />
2 oz Spanish sherry<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_52925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><img class=" wp-image-52925" src="http://africasacountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/418104_282445711825811_1256663178_n.jpg?w=550&h=366" alt="" width="550" height="366" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Mosireen Cinema</p></div>
<p>Theatrical release is the holy grail of filmmaking. Well, it was until relatively recently. But, since the internet, dvds, digital files and all the other ethereal modes of sharing and circulating became available to the masses, alternative modes of film production and distribution began to challenge the studio system, the distribution system, and perhaps even cinema itself. We’re all well aware of the nearing doomsday of celluloid, the ‘end of film’. Yet, this is only a fraction of what constitutes ‘film’.<span id="more-52922"></span></p>
<p>The challenge to the cinematic system comes, arguably, and perhaps most provocatively from the African continent, where whole industries, most notably Nollywood, have both anticipated &#8211; and eclipsed &#8211; a future of moving image circulation that Western countries are still approaching with fear, still scrabbling, prosecuting and asserting copyright, when clearly the way in which we consume images and film is changing radically.</p>
<p>In the light of these changes, I assembled five filmmaking collectives that are reinterpreting and reinvigorating notions of collaboration and distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Chop Cassava, Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>Marie Antoinette declared ‘let them eat cake!’ (apparently), thereby revealing her obliviousness to the plight of normal people in 18<sup>th</sup> century France. <a href="http://www.chopcassava.com/" target="_blank">Chop Cassava</a>, a filmmaking collective in Nigeria, attribute their name to the same sentiment; implying that the removal of fuel subsidies by Minister of Finance <a href="http://africasacountry.com/2012/03/27/the-nigerian-who-would-be-president-of-the-world-bank/" target="_blank">Okonjo-Iweala</a>, revealed a similar such obliviousness, ‘let them chop cassava!’</p>
<p>Chop Cassava was a series of web films and a blog that documented the January 2012 fuel subsidy protests in Lagos, Nigeria. Where the rest of the worlds media were either woefully ignorant, or hesitant to report on the protests, Chop Cassava documented marches and interviewed individuals, providing in-depth and consistent coverage.</p>
<p>Each day, they compiled footage from various mobile phones, video cameras, and their own film crew. Their coverage was dispersed, meandering, at times polemic and others entirely observational. They provided immediate documentation of the protests where elsewhere, this – the largest peaceful protest in Africa for many year – was ignored.</p>
<p>This powerful statement from their website captures their aims as a media collective:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It was clear that something had shifted in the Nigerian consciousness, which requires a different sort of documentation. Our challenge was, shall we just stand back and document or shall we have an opinion. Should we editorialize history as it unfolds?</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44530825" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The Mosireen Collective, Tahrir Square, Egypt</strong></p>
<p>Mosireen is <a href="http://mosireen.org/" target="_blank">a non-profit media collective</a> born out of the explosion of citizen journalism and cultural activism in Egypt during the revolution in 2011.</p>
<p>Similarly to Chop Cassava, Mosireen assembled footage from mobile phone and video cameras throughout the protests, editing short films together that documented the vast protests that were gripping Cairo, indeed the whole of the Arab world at the time. And again, where news agencies and journalists were hesitant to enter the crowds, or were offering neutered, Mosireen grouped together to produce their own documentation of events.</p>
<p>One of the key members of the media collective, filmmaker Khalid Abdalla says of the project;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The majority of the footage is amateur, but a lot of it is filmed by us or by our friends.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It’s part of the culture of creative commons, an open sourcing for film that allows us to share our stories. We did an open call for people to make films which we were planning to have screened on TV but then the sit-in started again and three days ago we decided to start screening in the square.</p>
<p>The Mosireen collective is vital for it addresses ideas and practices of archiving, open source filmmaking, collaboration and cooperation in a cinematic and political context.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">[The] archive we’ve built is not ours, it’s the Egyptian peoples; it was filmed by the Egyptian people, it’s their story and it’s our story but a lot of people haven’t seen it. This country is going to be unpacking what happened here for generations and you never know what’s important and what isn’t. There are two things happening- there’s a duty to the present and a duty to the future and we’re trying to fulfil both.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/37895234" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Slum TV, Kenya<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em></em>Slum TV are a media collective that ‘provide a means of expression to informal settlement communities in Kenya by providing the pertinent tools for this.’ They predominantly work in the Mathare slum in Nairobi, providing training and production support for residents wishing to make films. As a result, Slum TV has helped to develop a new visual culture, one that is both entertaining and educational; the narratives always feeding back into the community and offering some light and perspective on the lives lived in informal settlements like Mathare.</p>
<p>You can watch many of the films on the Slum TV website, <a href="http://slum-tv.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In August, the Slum Film Festival will run in both the Kibera and Mathare.</p>
<p>Sam Hopkins, one of Slum TV’s founding members describes the screening process:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The material is collated and screened on a monthly basis in public space in Mathare. Thus it functions like a ‘newsreel’ and affords the slum dwellers a form of local news. Having been screened locally, the content is then uploaded onto the website, which functions both as an archive of this oral history and a means to access a secondary, international audience.</p>
<p><strong>ZaLab</strong></p>
<p>ZaLab is <a href="http://www.zalab.org/newsite/en" target="_blank">a filmmaking collective</a> that &#8216;hosts participatory video and documentary workshops in intercultural contexts and situations of geographical and social marginalization.&#8217;</p>
<p>Particularly powerful is their commitment to telling the stories of migrants who cross the Mediterranean from North Africa to Italy and Spain, and their dedication to outing the horrific practices of the Libyan police when migrants are returned.</p>
<p>I initially came across ZaLab after reading <a href="http://www.granta.com/New-Writing/The-Madonna-of-the-Sea/" target="_blank">this wonderful article</a> by Maaza Mengiste, the Ethiopian writer, who published a moving article in Granta magazine about the journey of one particularly man, Dagmawi Yimer. Mengiste writes about the torturous journey that finally led to Dagmawi’s arrival to the Italian island of Lampedusa, over a year after he set out from Addis Ababa. Since settling in Italy, Dagmawi became a member of ZaLab, making documentaries collaboratively with other migrants about their experiences, to drawn attention to the journeys that are made.</p>
<p>In a year when reports of the dehydrated dead, exploited and left floating at sea have dominated headlines, the activity of ZaLab is all the more important. Their films are engaging, moving, informative and a vital resource to make known what people will endure for the hope of a better life in Europe. Dagmawi also helped to found <em>The Archive of Migrant Memories</em>, in Rome.</p>
<p><strong>The Otolith Group</strong></p>
<p>The otolith is the part of the inner ear that establishes the body’s sense of gravity, orientation and balance. Taking its name from this bodily compass, <a href="http://otolithgroup.org/" target="_blank">The Otolith Group</a> seek to use moving image to orient themselves, and us, within a wider cultural and theoretical context.</p>
<p>They want to ‘build a new film culture’. At times their films are difficult to penetrate and draped in theoretical references that escape many viewers, however their work that deals with Africa, particularly the work of John Akomfrah (formerly of the Black Audio Film Collective), militant filmmaking, ‘audio poverty’ and migration is powerful, thought provoking visual art.</p>
<p>You can see an inventory of their work <a href="http://otolithgroup.org/index.php?m=search&amp;search=africa" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only 17 of planned 56 <strong></strong>security staff turned up for work at the Olympic team hotel in Salford.</p>
<p>Only 20<strong> </strong>security staff,out of 300 planned,  turned up at Box Hill cycling site in Surrey.</p>
<p>180 security staff were due at an induction and training session at Coventry’s Ricoh Arena, but only eight turned up.</p>
<p>All these venues are now being covered by police officers who should be on the streets. Here in Ruralshire, our response teams are operating at dangerously low levels due to the <em>planned</em> Olympic deployment, let alone now, with further deployment necessary.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while politicians point to the total number of police involved compared to the total number of police in the UK, they know perfectly well that it is from the frontline uniform response and neighbourhood units that these abstractions have to be found.</p>
<p>Almost without exception, police officers below the rank of Chief Inspector I have spoken to both here in Ruralshire and in our neighbouring counties <strong>HATE</strong> the London 2012 Olympic Games, and hated it well before the current security fiasco.</p>
<p>Chief Inspectors and above <strong>like</strong> the Olympics because they do not have to go, because they have managed to get exemptions from the annual leave ban and because they have been told to like it. Most Chief Inspectors want to be Superintendents, so they tend to think what they are told to think, since they (mistakenly in my opinion) believe that this will make them more attractive at the promotion board.</p>
<p>Police officers HATE the London 2012 Olympics for three main reasons:</p>
<p>1. Summer leave has been cancelled so we can&#8217;t spend time with our children, time we don&#8217;t usually get because we work shifts.</p>
<p>2. The language and content of the training has been patronising, Orwellian and short on serious content. We have been treated like fools in the briefings, with most of the emphasis on political correctness and how to smile a lot. This pisses people off more than you can know!</p>
<p>3. The London 2012 period from 27th July to 9th Sept is being used to mess our lives about on an unprecedented scale, while senior officers and non-operational staff continue on as if nothing is happening.</p>
<p><em>* The new farce with G4S failing to turn up all over the country has further depleted our frontline teams.</em></p>
<p>The same is true for thousands of NHS staff and their families, for millions of people who couldn&#8217;t get tickets and for Londoners, who must now suffer the Zil lanes and traffic chaos. I am with Keith Allen, who recently gave a great &#8216;bah humbug&#8217; interview about how much he hates the whole thing.</p>
<p>The one great thing about London 2012, is the very public exposure of G4S. For me it is not necessarily the scheduling issue. It is the horrendous stories coming out about the training, the organisation, the quality of the staff and the general shoddy nature of whole squalid back-room deals over workfare candidates vs. profit.</p>
<p>G4S and the politicians who defend them are saying that the whole thing is so complicated, they have to be so flexible and the demands can be unexpected and sudden. We know this. We do this every day. This is why we think it is a bad idea to privatise the police.</p>
<p>The ability to adapt to these demands on a daily basis, not just once in a lifetime, is why it is a bad idea to abolish the office of Constable and turn us all in to workers who can be made redundant, have out pay cut and essentially be reduced to the level of the poor devils who work (or who don&#8217;t work!) for G4S. This is what Tom Winsor wants.</p>
<p>The job we do is simply too important to be turned over to the greed and avarice of corporate shareholders. If people outside the police couldn&#8217;t see that before, they can now.</p>
<p><strong>Gadget Note:</strong> <em>No one minds being messed about in a genuine national emergency. We joined up to do this and we are fine about it. But bailing out a company which is about to take our jobs and those of our colleagues is a bit much! From what I hear, many soldiers feel the same.</em></p>

A precocious reader? A veracious reader? Whatever.</p>
<p>But, as a writer, a teacher, and a mother, I get excited about any book that excites reluctant readers. Reading is a skill that becomes more fun as the reader improves. Improvement happens with practice. And some books make that practice irresistible. Recently, that&#8217;s the Harry Potter series, or the Hunger Games series.</p>
<p>But since the 1960s, it&#8217;s been Encyclopedia Brown. In the 1970s, my elementary school had a little row of these cool little books that made the kid reading it figure out the mystery all by themselves (you could turn to the back to find out if you were right.) I read them all in the second grade. I&#8217;m willing to bet that the Charles F. Kettering Elementary School library still has the same books, with my name written on the card. And I know for sure that over the last thirty years, lots of kids have read them and become real readers thanks to them.<a href="http://storycarnivores.com/2012/07/17/the-day-encyclopdeia-brown-cried/donald-sobol-grid-4x2/" rel="attachment wp-att-859"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-859" title="Donald Sobol.grid-4x2" src="http://storycarnivores.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/donald-sobol-grid-4x2.jpg?w=226&h=300" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Donald Sobol wrote 28 Encyclopedia Brown books. He wrote right up until a month ago. His last book will be published in October. Mr. Sobol died last Wednesday at 87. He didn&#8217;t die rich. But he left behind a rich body of work, all still in print, that I am quite sure my grandkids, and maybe even their grandkids, will read.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Sobol, I know that hard boiled eggs spin fast, and raw eggs wobble. After I read the book where Encyclopedia Brown used that bit of knowledge to solve the mystery, my mom boiled me an egg so I could try it out. It worked! That was one of the highlights of my first seven years.</p>
<p>Mr. Sobol had an enviable work ethic. He is said to have written every day, up to about a month before he died. He published 65 books, including several non-fiction titles on a wide variety of subjects. But his enduring legacy, without a doubt is Encyclopedia Brown. The first book in the series was rejected by two dozen publishers.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Pinterest. But I also hate it.

Here's why.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=1892&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The cool (terrible?) thing about being pregnant (and I mean <em>super </em><em>pregnant</em>) is that there is never a dull day because your mind takes you on such wonderful adventures! You get to go round and round in circles until you end up at the same destination at which you arrived the last time you let your mind wander &#8212; <em>the notion that you&#8217;re going to be the worst mom on the planet. </em></p>
<p>In today&#8217;s edition of<strong><em> Reasons I&#8217;m About to Fail at Motherhood</em></strong>, we explore <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/helenlindsay/" target="_blank"><strong>Pinterest</strong></a>, an online pin board designed to inspire and motivate you to do things you never thought possible. (Or help you plan a wedding when you&#8217;re not even in a relationship. That, too.)</p>
<p>To watch me flail around desperately in a sea of DIY crafts I&#8217;ll never have the time or energy or creativity for, follow me on Pinterest <a title="Lindsay Durrenberger on Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/helenlindsay/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love Pinterest. But I also hate it.</p>
<p>I love it because it is <em>literally </em>a bottomless gorge of creativity. Novice photography? There&#8217;s a pin for that. DIY crafts? There are only about a thousand boards to follow. Recipes? Oh man, don&#8217;t even get me started. (A couple weeks ago I made Nutella cookies from a recipe I found on Pinterest. Because I don&#8217;t have a hand mixer  &#8211; and why WOULD I? Anyone who knows me knows I don&#8217;t cook/bake/do anything a real wife and mom should do &#8212; the texture was a bit off. But they tasted like little chunks of Nutella and my husband was popping them like pills so I guess I succeeded.)</p>
<p>At its core, Pinterest is super helpful! Also, this is exactly what happens to everyone who signs up for Pinterest:</p>
<p><a href="http://fueledbydietcoke.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pin-all-the-things.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1898" title="pin all the things" src="http://fueledbydietcoke.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pin-all-the-things.jpg?w=222&h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>But. As a new (and undeniably uncrafty) mom, Pinterest scares the hell out of me. Just by existing, Pinterest takes everything I&#8217;m insecure about and just flaunts it in my face, like a big ol&#8217; bully wielding recipes I&#8217;ll never have the skill to perfect and projects I&#8217;ll never have time to complete.</p>
<p>And so. I hate it. I hate it so much.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal &#8212; I follow a lot of my crafty friends, both moms and otherwise, on Pinterest. They pin the darnedest things, you know. <em>Make your own X for baby! Create your own Y for the nursery! Do it yourself Z for the home!</em> Etc. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be great if that&#8217;s where it stopped. If everyone else was a &#8220;theoretical pinner&#8221; like me (that is, someone who pins things on their boards with no <em>real</em> intention of ever <em>attempting</em> the projects for a number of reasons) I wouldn&#8217;t be so bloody insecure. But that&#8217;s not the case. Oh no &#8212; when I visit these crafty friends of mine, I find that Pinterest is not only bookmarked on their laptops but has also clearly been inside their homes and left its mark via super adorable DIY things.</p>
<p>Because they&#8217;re all better crafters than me and, therefore, are better women/wives/moms/people than me.</p>
<p>You see, <em>my</em> house? Uh. Well. Last week we went to Wal-Mart and bought an already-painted canvas with already-printed-on sayings and nailed it to the wall in our dining room. Does that count? I mean I bet I could pin something that looks like that and just pretend I did it myself. Would anyone notice?</p>
<p>As I try to &#8220;nest&#8221; I&#8217;ve been scouring Pinterest for crafty DIY ideas on how to make the nursery look great and &#8220;nesty&#8221;. Because success at Pinterest = success as a mom.</p>
<p>Well, good news, readers! I&#8217;ve found something on Pinterest I&#8217;m going to DO MYSELF! I&#8217;ve resolved to buy some canvases and some pretty fabric and staple said pretty fabric to the canvases and then hang them on the wall. DIY wall art, you guys! Sounds super easy, right? (Here&#8217;s a link to the pin I, uh, pinned: <a title="DIY Wall Art" href="http://pinterest.com/pin/24980972903768403/" target="_blank">DIY wall art</a>.)</p>
<p>Seems easy enough, right? How hard could it be? I&#8217;ve done the research. I know where to buy the canvases and fabric and I know that I should probably get a staple gun to wield for this project. Looking at it, it seems like a piece of cake. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s on Pinterest, right? Because every DIY project on Pinterest is easy, right? I have two hands and eyeballs and all the time and energy and creativity in the world. If I can&#8217;t make this work then&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Oh goodness. I don&#8217;t even want to think about what it means if I can&#8217;t do this</em>.</p>
<p>Because if I fail at it, then I fail at being a good mom.</p>
<p>Well. I&#8217;m glad I consulted you, blog, before I attempted this most likely disastrous and self-esteem-crushing project. I just saved myself a lot of grief.</p>
<p>So. Let&#8217;s just stick to the already-printed stuff at Wal-Mart and call it a day so I don&#8217;t have to cry myself to sleep tonight thinking about all the money I&#8217;ll have to shell out for Dax&#8217;s therapy later on in life for being born unto such an uncrafty, unconventional, horrible mother.</p>
<p><em>While I&#8217;m at it, I should probably buy stock in Hot Pocket, Kraft, and Great Value brand hot dogs.</em></p>
