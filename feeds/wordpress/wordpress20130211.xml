				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I want to begin this post with a disclaimer and an admission. Some days, when I’m not overhearing other people’s conversations or writing inane lists, I have serious thoughts about serious things. Mostly I just add those thoughts to an inane list and ramble in person about it to anyone who foolishly gives me an opportunity to do so. Today is a little different, because today people were asking for my thoughts before I’d thought about them. As per, I’ve been out flouncing around art galleries all day, so (and here’s the first part of that disclaimer) I am writing this on my phone, on the tube, with only a cursory glance at the headlines and half an hour of BBC news videos as evidence. Next the admission: people wanted my thoughts today because as well as being a young woman, I am also a Catholic and a theologian by trade. I think that’s probably given away the news in question, but let me add the second part of my disclaimer before I begin: this is incredibly reactionary. I realise that what I have to say will cause some people to tell me I’m a bad feminist and/or a bad Catholic, but I don’t profess to be very good at either. I do try my best to be a decent human in general though, so hopefully you can cut me a little slack. I don’t have all the answers &#8211; I don’t even have all the questions &#8211; and if you ask me again tomorrow I might have changed my mind. If you are still reading at this point, I salute you. If you don’t want to hear my thoughts about the resignation of the Pope, now is your cue to leave &#8211; I’ll write you a silly list soon. For the rest of you, excuse the seriousness and let’s cue the titles</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning news broke that at 8pm on 28th February, Pope Benedict XVI will resign from his office at the head of the Roman Catholic Church. This is the first time this has happened for 600 years and, understandably, the ripple of reaction has spread around the world. This particular drop in the ocean of response is inherently personal but carries with it whatever insight is afforded by being a young catholic, a feminist and (in education at least) a theologian. It will almost certainly be at odds with the views of some Catholics, some feminists and some young people, but it is an honest attempt to provide an initial response from a personal point of view, and to answer the five questions that have been put to me repeatedly today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the practical implications:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>After 8pm on 28th February, the current Pope will no longer be referred to as His Holiness and will be known again as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. It is expected that he will take some time away at the summer residence while his successor is appointed. Though as a cardinal he ought to attend conclave, his age precludes him from voting. After this, he will live elsewhere in the Vatican. The implications of the current Pope living in close proximity to the newly elected Pope seem widely assumed to be negative. This is not necessarily the case. Cormac Murphy O’Connor commented today “<i>Who would want to be Pope?”</i> -  I wonder whether the answer might be ‘someone who has the voice of experience close at hand’ (This might be particularly relevant for one of his potential successors, as we will see).</p>
<p>There has been some debate regarding the resignation in general &#8211; given John Paul II’s stoic sense of the papacy as a life-long duty in particular, but also simply in terms of whether the office is ‘just a job’. I think the Pope has more than addressed this in his speech, which you can read <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2013/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20130211_declaratio_en.html">here</a>. ‘Resignation’ is our language, but put simply, the Pope has been entitled to renounce his office for the best part of 800 years. Our sensationalist tendencies will no doubt draw out countless dramatic comparisons with the last Pope to do so, Gregory XII, who stood down in 1415 at an incredibly difficult time in the Church’s history. I would suggest a better comparison might be with Celestine V, the Pope who passed the decree which made it possible in 1294. A Benedictine, he too was considered old at his succession, and stepped down after five months in office citing his waning physical strength amongst his reasons for doing so. At the top of Celestine V’s list, however, was the desire for humility, and I think that same humility is characteristic of  Benedict XVI’s decision too.</p>
<p>Today’s news left me sad, but also deeply encouraged &#8211; I cannot even begin to imagine the pressure that he must have felt and the personal anguish that coming to this decision must have caused. Yet it was a decision taken entirely in private, away from the external pressures that (until now) have characterised his papacy, and with a focus solely upon the best way to lead the Church in accordance with God’s will. I struggle to call to mind a better example in modern times of the courage and humility required to set aside self-interest for the sake of the Church. In purely practical terms, it is an action that is, literally, crucially Christian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the timing of the decision:</strong></p>
<p>Again, the timing of this announcement reflects a degree of humility in its Kantian disinterest (that is to say its setting aside of self-interest). The Pope understands first hand the pressure of succeeding a Pope who has died &#8211; the demands of leading the Church through their mourning, the potential for the suddenness of the transition and the uncharacteristic urgency that all of this adds to the office. The Pope is far from rude health and, to be practical rather than morbid, his increasing ailment and advancing years mean that, were he to continue in office, there would be the very real potential of that issue arising again. Though there have been many criticisms levelled at him, it is perhaps a product of my respect for him as a theologian that I would defy anyone who argued that he does not have an acute awareness of the needs of the Church. Hans Kung might be appalled to hear me describe Joseph Ratzinger as one of the greatest living theologians, but I truly believe that he is, and this insight has informed his papacy. He fully understands that this is, in many ways, a time of great vulnerability for the Church; he fully understands the need for the Church to play the game and not just watch from the touchlines. By affecting the transition of the papacy in this way, he is allowing his successor to keep a firm grip of the wheel, affording him as few complications as possible.</p>
<p>Some will argue that the Pope’s resignation heightens the urgency of this ‘crucial moment’. Perhaps so, but perhaps equally there is little point in postponing the inevitable. To labour the earlier analogy, there is no time out in this game. It seems particularly relevant that the announcement comes in the wake of the publication of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust"><i>The Pope’s Jews</i></a>. Critics love to play on Benedict XVI’s experiences in the Hitler youth, almost as much as they enjoyed criticising the apparent inertia of the Vatican at that time of crisis. The publication of this book challenges that perception, but has a wider message that is relevant: firstly, to quote the author, Gordon Thomas, <i>&#8220;The church thinks across centuries. If there&#8217;s a dispute for 50 years, so what?&#8221;</i> &#8211; the priority is upon action not upon the perception of that action; secondly, public perception of the inner workings of the Vatican is not always right. My point is this &#8211; I believe it would be incredibly naive to argue that the Pope’s decision is a reaction to scandal or contemporary issues that face the Church. This is not a cowardly man running away from the moment but an astute leader ensuring that the moment does not run away from his Church.</p>
<p>It is also no coincidence that his resignation will take effect at the heart of Lent &#8211; what better spiritual narrative to accompany a time of testing and assert the triumph of faithfulness? The appointment of his successor should take place before Easter &#8211; what better time to begin a new chapter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the theological implications:</strong></p>
<p>I doubt that there is enough ink in the world to satisfy the amount that could potentially be spilled debating the theological implications of this decision. Certainly the Pope appears to be setting a precedent for departure from expectation, but we must be careful to hold this in tension with a theology and a papacy that has been markedly conservative in nature. We might more accurately argue that this decision is a further expression of that which has underpinned his conservative stance, namely that acute awareness of the vulnerability of the Church. Once again, I think it helpful to bear in mind the idea that the Church thinks across centuries. It has not existed for thousands of years by being bowing to the pressures of modernity. That is not to say that it should be an institution immune to criticism or progression of thought, but to say that there is sound political and theological underpinning to cautious conservatism. Under the weight of that responsibility Cormac Murphy O’Connor’s words today once again loom large.</p>
<p>The Guardian today published a list of pressing issues that it believes await the new Pope when he is elected. You can read that list <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/11/next-pope-five-key-issues">here</a>. Are all of these issues immediately thrown wide open with the succession of a new Pope? In short, I think the answer is no &#8211; as we have seen, the Church’s conservative stance is the product of more than papal opinion. In theological terms, I see most scope for potential flexibility in terms of the Church’s position on contraception and homosexuality, when addressed in terms of the dignity of the person, but the repercussions of that line of reasoning leave little room for a change of perspective regarding abortion and the role of women in the clergy. I am perhaps in a minority of feminists who would not see this as a bad thing &#8211; I do not see abortion as the absolute right of a liberated woman and I do not see a male priesthood solely as an arbitrary reinforcement of the history of patriarchy. I am less clear of the extent to which I am in a minority of Catholics by seeing room for a revisitation of the former two issues. Perhaps conversely with this line of theological reasoning, I do not expect to see much engagement with the issue of equal marriage &#8211; that cautious conservatism that has preserved the Church’s longevity will presumably encourage the new Pope to watch as that issue unfolds in the Church of England first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On succession:</strong></p>
<p>On the subject of the new Pope, I am entirely in agreement with Patrick Kelly, who told a BBC reporter today that there was no point in playing a guessing game. Understandably, this will not discourage the world from speculating, presumably by the same logic that encourages people to take gambling odds from Paddy Power on Bono or Father Dougal Maguire as the next in line of apostolic succession.</p>
<p>The media will probably be excited by four or five main candidates. Peter Turkson of Ghana, Fracis Arinze of Nigeria and Leonardo Sandri of Argentina will doubtless appear at the top of many lists with good reason. As well as their individual merits, there is a real unifying value in electing a Pope who has a direct engagement with theologies of liberation, as all of these men have -  that said, we might argue that the young Joseph Ratzinger’s experiences in Germany went some way towards that. I think however, there is a particular challenge to be addressed by the Church in Africa and South America at present, which needs strong leadership in an immediate capacity. There is much ground to be covered in establishing a truly universal church and a sense in which the leadership of a ‘liberation Pope’ in Rome might still be too countercultural to be productive. Slow progress perhaps, but there is a theological argument for it yet. Similarly, timing might go against another media favourite, Timothy Dolan from New York. The presence of America in the current socio-political climate might be of detriment to the effectiveness of the papacy; as much could be said for any potential ‘super-power Pope.’</p>
<p>At present, there are three potential candidates who seem most likely. Canadian Marc Oullet has all of the cosmopolitan appeal of Timothy Dolan whilst remaining theologically close to the current Pope. On the surface he seems to fit with the potential theological trajectory outlined above, but it is difficult to tell how deeply his conservatism runs &#8211; he is best know for his strong stance on abortion, but that is hardly indicative. Age is also on his side &#8211; he is not yet 70. Another strong candidate is Angelo Bagnasco, the current Archbishop of Genoa. He is intellectually well respected, multi-lingual and has spoken prominently (and critically) of Italian culture and the negative role models provided by Silvio Berlusconi and other key figures. He is regarded as the Pope’s lieutenant in Italy, and seems to have a good sense of the interplay between secular issues and theology.</p>
<p>The most obvious candidate to me, however, is Gianfranco Ravasi who heads the Pontifical Council for Culture. As such he is acutely aware of all of the theological issues that are currently prominent, as well as of the importance of dialogue and interplay between the Church and other cultures. He is a renowned Biblical scholar based in Rome, and combines a natural charisma with a keen intellect and media awareness. His main weakness is the fact that he has never been bishop of a large archdiocese, so his pastoral credentials are somewhat unproven. However, given his strengths in all other areas, and with the unprecedented presence of a former Pope living in the Vatican, he seems the ideal candidate. As mentioned previously, this circumnavigates the potential difficulties of the presence of a ‘dowager-Pope’, who instead becomes an invaluable source of support without undermining papal authority. It is a scenario that is unprecedented, but by no means impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On conspiracy theories:</strong></p>
<p>The internet will undoubtedly explode with a wealth of conspiracy theories, including plenty which will compensate for the underwhelming Mayan Apocalypse we experienced in December. Dan Brown is unlikely to be seen for weeks. Nevertheless, there is probably enough intellectual stimulation in the facts alone to keep the rest of us from concerning ourselves with wild speculation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, today’s news will, I hope, become this Pope’s legacy for the right reasons. His approach to the gravity of the decision is a testament to his character as a man and as a Christian, and a brilliant example of his theological insight. It shows a reverence for the authority of the see prioritised above the holder, and so rightly orientated towards God, but also shows an awareness of the contemporary world and the importance of stability in transition. It is a heartbreaking decision that is incredibly brave and demonstrates both wisdom and humility. It is an example to all, and inspirationally encouraging in faith.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Mike and I spent the morning driving around the property checking the water and the stock.  We do this every second day, due to the fact that sheep are in fact very fussy water drinkers and we need to keep an eye on the feed.</p>
<p>A lot of sheep will avoid drinking water if there is dust settled on top.  It&#8217;s been very dry, and sadly not much of the feed is left, so the sandy ground has become exposed and is blowing all over the place.</p>
<p>We also spent time laying down a line of oats for the merinos who are in desperate need of energy.  You&#8217;ll see a trail of yellow in the photo below, which is scary how obvious it is when there isn&#8217;t much else around.  Our pets are free to roam around our house, driveway and shearing shed yards.  It&#8217;s safe to say they are the fattest of the 12,000 here.  They have plenty of green grass.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot about what types of grass can endure a summer here in Western Australia (cooch is one, it&#8217;s an import, and perennials are also summer hardy).  Unfortunately both are very expensive.  And while we&#8217;ve got green feed to get us through the worst of summer, it&#8217;s been a bad season for the sheep prices and we&#8217;re feeding many mouths that should have already been sold to market.</p>
<p>Farming is a lot of gambling.  Brian once said to me, he doesn&#8217;t gamble at casinos.  I asked him &#8220;Why not?&#8221; and his answer was quite simple:  &#8221;I spend every day on the farm gambling, and taking risks!&#8221;  Fair enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I&#8217;d be up all night worrying if I had such monetary and life responsibilities on my shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On that note, I&#8217;ve recently finished reading &#8220;The Grapes of Wrath&#8221; by John Stienbeck.  If you&#8217;ve not read the American classic, I recommend picking up a copy.  The novel was written over 70 years ago, and details the plight of displaced farmers travelling to California, trying to get by.  Times were hard.  The story offers a lesson to stand as one voice and be heard when there is injustice.  It&#8217;s a scary thought to realise that nothing has changed since the story was written.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Lately there has been a movement toward sustainability, small farms, locally sourced food, free range, and ethical produce.  I hope this trend continues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve just knocked down my summer garden, and am getting it ready for our winter garden.  This morning I&#8217;ve been shovelling sheep manure and transporting it to my plot.  It&#8217;s now 2x larger and I&#8217;m bursting with ideas to improve my crop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The sun is a killer here.  Nearly everything kicked the bucket early.  I&#8217;ve got to sort it out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dairyofacallcentreguy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/skeleton1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150" alt="Skeleton1" src="http://dairyofacallcentreguy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/skeleton1.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>One day, not long after my exit from the call centre, I heard that people arriving for their shift in the morning were greeted by a memo sellotaped to each computer monitor by their manager Peggy, instructing them not to take toilet breaks whilst on-shift.</p>
<p>It was just the latest act in what had been a long running battle in my call centre &#8211; A fierce fight over the very right to answer the call of nature. Previous to the sticky-taped missive a number of memos prohibiting the use of the toilet in work time &#8216;unless an emergency&#8217; had been issued, and subsequently ignored, amid much canteen and car-park whispering of  &#8217;how dare they.&#8217;  Even those among us who would usually be the most docile and compliant members of pro-management staff were up-in-arms. We were unanimously agreed; the right to go when we needed to go was an inalienable one which we would not give up easily.</p>
<p>But it seems that it is not just my call centre where the toilet issue created strong feelings; In a blog titled <a href="http://secretdiaryofacallcentreworker.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/please-miss-can-i-go-to-toilet.html"><em>The Secret Diary of a Call Centre Worker Aged 31 1/2</em></a> a Scottish Call Centre worker describes their fiery response to receiving a note telling them that they could not use the toilet on their shift:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine being 31 (and a 1/2) years old and being told you&#8217;re not allowed to vist the loo. Immature it may be, but I did infact give my &#8220;team leader&#8221; the extended middle finger after being told this. Who the hell does she think she is?!</p></blockquote>
<p>Their tone is however, ultimately one of resignation. For them being denied the right to take a toilet break when needed is all part of the call centre:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just call centre life unfortunately. We have to be available at all times other than scheduled breaks, needing to pee is apparently unimportant.</p></blockquote>
<p>And they are right. The toilet issue is not exclusive to the call centre. Check-out assistants and workers in some other industries also have a tough time, but the call-centre has been fairly notorious for waging war on the toilet break with some gusto, in cases going to extreme lengths in finding strategies to control their staff&#8217;s use of the toilet.</p>
<p>The main tool in the battle seems to be monitoring the time taken by staff in the toilet. In my call centre the layout was such that our manager would know instantly how long you were away from your desk and you&#8217;d very much feel that the clock was ticking. As far as I know however, no times were ever logged; Alan Carr on the other hand describes a  &#8217;log book&#8217; in the Barclaycard call centre where employees were instructed to record the time taken using the toilet complete with a set of guidelines &#8211; 5 mins allowed for a number two and 3 mins for a simple wee.</p>
<p>Another call centre in my town &#8211; belonging to a major utility &#8211; had more sophisticated systems which electronically logged time away from a work-station to go to the toilet, but as far as I&#8217;m aware even this system didn&#8217;t trigger an alarm with flashing lights, as is the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9051774/Norwegian-alarm-system-monitors-length-of-office-lavatory-visits.html">case of the Norweigan call centre</a> , belonging to DNB an insurance company, where managers received a notification alarm if a member of staff spent more than an allotted eight minutes a day away from their desks.</p>
<p>Whilst I myself never got more than a withering stare for abandoning my headset to rush to the toilet, others were asked to produce GP&#8217;s notes to account for the time they spent on the toilet. Its also not unheard of for workers to be pulled up on time taken in the loo; In one extreme case which was reported in the national news call centre managers were even threatening workers who spent too long on the toilet with being <a href="http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites//0-9/4health/stress/saw_callcenter.html">forced to wear a disposable nappy</a>.</p>
<p>So just why does the call-centre have such a problem with the call of nature?</p>
<p>The key reason, unsurprisingly, is that it&#8217;s all about the money. In one of her many memos on the subject our manager, Peggy, lays bare her reasoning for the war on the loo break..</p>
<blockquote><p>Every time some one leaves their desk we lose a call, whether it’s for a query, loo break or to get water. This, over a week can equate to in excess of 2000 calls lost, with a loss of revenue which we cannot afford in this difficult economic climate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fuzzy math aside (2000 calls at an average of 3.5 minutes per call &#8211; means collectively we&#8217;d be spending just shy of 120 hours a week on the loo) it speaks volumes about the priorities of the call centre.</p>
<p>Sat at their desks call centre workers are like a part of a machine. Like a piston in a machine whose movement generates money there is a loss of revenue each time the piston, and the machine stops. Call centre managers main concern is to keep the machine running and therefore there priority is to keep workers at their desks for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Viewing workers as part of a machine dehumanises them, to the point at which bodily functions are denied, or viewed as a threat to the machine and which must therefore be the subject of control.</p>
<p>Finally, as many people may ask; what is the legal position? Can an employer try to prevent workers from using the toilet during work time? Whilst legislation exists in UK law determining the rules for the provision of toilet facilities there are no specific rules about when these facilities can be accessed, apart from an employers general health &amp; safety responsibilities. The TUC who have long campaigned on the issue of a workers right to take a toilet break, arguing in their 2010 report <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/loobreaksguidance.doc">&#8216;Give us a (loo) break&#8217;</a> that  &#8221;a worker’s right to use the toilet is a human right!&#8221;, state in the the report that there is a need for further legislation to protect workers stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is also a need for a specific legal right to use toilets in the employer’s time without a deduction in pay, and without any harassment.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the meantime the battle will rage on in call-centres up and down the land.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Note: the situation I&#8217;m about to describe can also be applied to a Fleetwood Mac <em>Rumours</em> T-shirt in TopShop.)</p>
<p>I was 13 when <em>Born In The USA </em>came out. But &#8211; being 13 &#8211; I didn&#8217;t quite &#8216;get&#8217; it. In 1984, I was listening to Wham! and Duran Duran, and I didn&#8217;t understand why a sweaty, shouty man in a bandana was dancing in the dark, let alone on fire. (Mind you, I didn&#8217;t really understand Duran Duran&#8217;s lyrics, either. But then, who did?)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/600full-born-in-the-u-s-a-cover.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-271 aligncenter" alt="600full-born-in-the-u.s.a.-cover" src="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/600full-born-in-the-u-s-a-cover.jpg?w=430&#038;h=430" width="430" height="430" /></a></p>
<p>No, <em>Born In The USA </em>only came to life for me three years later, when it became the soundtrack to a school exchange trip to Germany (turns out the Germans liked Bruce Springsteen, even if I didn’t). <s>Forced to listen to</s> Immersed in tracks like <i>Glory Days,</i> <i>Downbound Train</i> and <i>Bobby Jean</i> &#8211; under the summery skies of Bavaria, and occasionally through the PA system of a coach &#8211; Bruce, and his songs, suddenly began to make sense to me. Of course, this might have been due to the fact that I was now a wiser, more musically sophisticated, hormonal 16-year-old&#8230; But whatever the reason, I grew to love what is, of course, a glorious album. Although Bruce was still a little too sweaty for my liking.</p>
<p>And then later in the same year, I gained an American pen friend &#8211; a brooding depressive type from Massachusetts &#8211; who worshipped Bruce Springsteen and sent me cassette tapes of all his earlier albums, along with an end-of-year essay he’d written about the meanings and imagery in <i>Jungleland</i>.</p>
<p>As a result, I fell hook, line and New Jersey fishing boat sinker for Springsteen. More specifically: for his music, which was unlike anything else I was listening to at the time. The energy of songs like <i>Rosalita</i> and <i>Badlands</i>, the sheer sexiness and lowdown dirtiness of tracks like <i>For You</i> and <i>The River</i>, the plaintive cries of troubled smalltown Americans who wanted to flee their small lives – whether forever or just for one night – in songs like <i>Born To Run, Hungry Heart</i> and <i>Atlantic City</i>… Springsteen’s music was exotic and familiar all at once. I too wanted to leave my small town (Wombourne, Staffordshire), although unfortunately I couldn’t drive, which all of Bruce’s protagonists seemed able to do. And while I’d never known what it was like to make love in the dirt &#8211; let alone to do so with a girl called ‘Crazy Janey’ – I dreamed of it happening some day soon. Preferably with a boy <a href="http://991.com/NewGallery/Bruce-Springsteen-Live-1975-1985---283030.jpg" target="new">wearing a denim shirt and a guitar slung over his shoulder</a>… sigh&#8230;</p>
<p>Sorry, where was I?</p>
<p>Ah, yes. Standing in H&amp;M. Looking at a Bruce Springsteen T-shirt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d owned a <em>Fame</em> T-shirt as a girl, but never a Bruce Springsteen one. So imagine my delight when, as a fortysomething, I spotted one in H&amp;M. <a href="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brucet1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-304 aligncenter" alt="bruceT" src="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brucet1.jpg?w=388&#038;h=538" width="388" height="538" /></a> As I stood there handling this cheap-yet-magnificent item of clothing, my delight turned to admiration as I realised what excellent taste the people at H&amp;M head office had. “Wow, like me, they realise how under-appreciated Bruce and <i>Born In The USA</i> are!” I thought to myself. “Good for them! They’ve made a T-shirt for people who love <i>Born In The USA</i>, like me!”.</p>
<p>And then it hit me.</p>
<p>Standing in H&amp;M, surrounded by H&amp;M’s core demographic, it hit me.</p>
<p>This T-shirt wasn’t meant for me. It was meant for girls <i>whose parents</i> owned and appreciated <em>Born In The USA</em>. It was meant for girls who probably thought that this was quite amusing. That Bruce Springsteen is cool <i>but only in an ironic, my-parents-like-him, way</i>.</p>
<p>They say that if you remember a fashion the first time around, you shouldn’t wear it the second time. Thus the resurgence of Eighties looks in the Noughties was not aimed at people like me, but at kids who found it cool and ironic to wear Eighties fashions and <i>had no idea how we suffered for our crimped hair and puffball skirts</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Likewise, this T-shirt wasn’t made for me, or any of my fellow fortysomething Springsteen fans. It was made for 21 year-old actresses:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/graphic-tee-emma-roberts.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-189 aligncenter" alt="graphic-tee-emma-roberts" src="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/graphic-tee-emma-roberts.jpg?w=720"   /></a>(That&#8217;s Emma Roberts, niece of 45 year-old Bruce Springsteen fan Julia Roberts.)</p>
<p>And 23-year-old <a href="http://lookbook.nu/look/546995-Born-in-the-USA" target="new">fashion bloggers</a>:<a href="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-14-28-31.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Screen shot 2013-02-02 at 14.28.31" src="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-14-28-31.png?w=430&#038;h=418" width="430" height="418" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For me to copy this phenomenon &#8211; ie to wear a T-shirt resplendent with the cover of an album my parents owned when I was growing up &#8211; I would have to walk around with this on my chest:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/beethoven-symphony.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-327 aligncenter" alt="Beethoven-Symphony" src="http://youknowyoureover40when.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/beethoven-symphony.jpg?w=400&#038;h=394" width="400" height="394" /></a><em><strong>Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No.6, as never seen on any T-shirt</strong></em></p>
<p>And so I left H&amp;M feeling slightly sad, and really rather old, because (a) I really wanted to wear that <em>Born In The USA</em> T-shirt, but (b) I realised that it was intended for girls young enough to be my daughter or niece. And to add insult to injury, (c) it then dawned on me that those clever people at H&amp;M&#8217;s head office who had come up with the idea <em>probably weren&#8217;t my age, either</em>. That H&amp;M&#8217;s head office is staffed by ironic twentysomethings whose parents like Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Good old &#8211; and by old, I do of course mean young &#8211; H&amp;M.</p>
<p>Oh, and that&#8217;s the other thing. You know you&#8217;re over 40 when it&#8217;s something of a struggle to call it H&amp;M. Because in your heart, it was, is, and always will be: Hennes.</p>

<p>In this week&#8217;s WordPress <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/photo-challenge-home/" target="_blank">Weekly Photo Challenge</a> we are invited to show what &#8216;Home&#8217; means to us.  It means differently to everyone whether a physical structure of a house to go home to and relax, or a place in the heart to return to.  The photos I chose to include for this challenge were not of the castles and palaces I&#8217;ve seen during my travels, but of what some may call, hopefully temporary, home&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">When my husband (Dean) was living, he had two loves:  Boy and his longhorns.  He got his first two bulls from a friend who maintains a herd of them here and one in Tennessee.  He&#8217;s the same eccentric, mountain-man friend of the <a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/muffler-morgue/">Muffler Morgue</a> post.  The two babies, whom Dean christened &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221;, were sickly little critters.  Dean had them delivered to our vet, Tom Moscatelli, who kept them for weeks while he nursed them back to health and turned them into steers.  Longhorns are &#8216;good-fer-nuthin&#8217; cattle who are kept nostalgically to look at, I suppose.  Tom and Jerry were not much to look at.  Dean built a corral and a fence around the back acres of our plant property for his new herd of two stringy little steers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/tom-and-jerry-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-5382"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5382" alt="Tom and Jerry" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tom-and-jerry.jpg?w=855&#038;h=806" width="855" height="806" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">He fed them the best food including <em>Bull Builder </em>that was supposed to transform them into mighty steers.  He sat for hours on his golf cart admiring them.  He kept them in the corral where they would be safe.  They were born in a herd at pasture and never approached by humans so they were a bit skittish.  Never mind.  He adored them and devoted considerable time toward their taming.  At that point in Dean&#8217;s career, Kelli and Jeremy had assumed the lion&#8217;s share of running the business leaving Dean the luxury to do as he pleased, and he did.   The steers were an integral part of that plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/dean-taming-jerry/" rel="attachment wp-att-5386"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5386" alt="Dean taming Jerry" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dean-taming-jerry.jpg?w=855&#038;h=671" width="855" height="671" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Each had his own feed bucket.  Sometimes they agreed to eat together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/tom-and-jerry-at-trough-eating/" rel="attachment wp-att-5403"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5403" alt="Tom and Jerry at trough eating" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tom-and-jerry-at-trough-eating.jpg?w=855&#038;h=584" width="855" height="584" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sometimes they argued about whose food looked better, and ended up squeezing their heads into the same bucket to eat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/food-argument/" rel="attachment wp-att-5388"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5388" alt="Food argument" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/food-argument1.jpg?w=855&#038;h=567" width="855" height="567" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tom was more reserved than Jerry.  When the boys saw Dean drive into the pasture in his golf cart, Jerry always came running to drink iced tea from the big cup that he knew Dean kept in a cup holder on the cart.  Dean said that Jerry would have climbed into the cart with him if he had been small enough to fit.  One day when I drove the cart into the pasture, a young Jerry came to investigate.  When he discovered that I had no iced tea, he lost interest and ambled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/jerry-at-golf-cart/" rel="attachment wp-att-5402"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5402" alt="Jerry at golf cart" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jerry-at-golf-cart.jpg?w=855&#038;h=567" width="855" height="567" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tom and Jerry grew into big, healthy steers.  But, Tom got his horns trapped in a round hay rack and in his struggle to free himself, he slid into the pond and drowned one weekend when nobody was at the plant to help him.  It was a sad time.  Nobody imagined that a commonly used hay rack could be a death trap.  Round bales of hay are a pretty, benign-looking sight in fields all over Texas.  These old bales sit abandoned near the corral.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/hay-bales/" rel="attachment wp-att-5393"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5393" alt="Hay Bales" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hay-bales.jpg?w=855&#038;h=566" width="855" height="566" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">When Tom and Jerry were older, Dean turned them out of the corral to eat grass and live like longhorns.  Two more babies arrived from their old herd.  Prissy Missy (left) and Fat Butt (right).  Fat Butt was not his original name, but when he grew into a gigantic bull with a huge set of horns and big, muscular haunches, Kelli renamed him.  Tom and Jerry were relegated to supervisory roles outside the corral.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/four-babies/" rel="attachment wp-att-5356"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5356" alt="Four Babies" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/four-babies.jpg?w=855&#038;h=592" width="855" height="592" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prissy Missy was calm and sweet from the beginning.  Fat Butt was just full of himself.  Here he is putting on his big-boy act for effect.  If anybody had said &#8220;boo&#8221;,  he would have high-tailed it out of there.  His was a convincing act, however, and won him a reputation as the bad boy of the little herd.  He seemed to know that he would be the sire of many sons if he established his dominance early on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/pawing-longhorn-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5358"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5358" alt="Pawing longhorn 1" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/pawing-longhorn-1.jpg?w=855&#038;h=676" width="855" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Eventually, Dean turned the new babies out to pasture with Tom and Jerry to learn how to be longhorns.  In this photo (taken by <a href="http://texasjcphotography.wordpress.com/">my son-in-law</a>) Tom and Jerry, who were still young steers themselves, were mentoring little Fat Butt.  I don&#8217;t have a photograph of Fat Butt as a full-grown bull.  He was a handsome fellow, and he was protective of the ladies in his own herd.  A rivalry arose between him and a Black Angus bull from the adjoining pasture.  Black Angus bulls are notorious agitators, and Fat Butt was itching for a fight.  Eventually, he&#8217;d had enough of the interloper, and simply broke through the fence and whipped up on the Black Angus something awful.  After three days of persuasion, the guys were able to corral him and load him in the trailer for the livestock sale.  I was sorry to see him leave us.  He was just too big and too rowdy for us to manage, and Dean was no longer there to intervene on his behalf.   I hoped he would have many ladies to court and many handsome sons in his new herd.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/longhorn-mentoring/" rel="attachment wp-att-5395"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5395" alt="Longhorn mentoring" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/longhorn-mentoring.jpg?w=823&#038;h=484" width="823" height="484" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Prissy Missy grew into a sweet mama.  To date, she&#8217;s had three or four babies.  This is her latest offspring.  She looks a little tired and a bit thin.  Babies are notoriously greedy little critters for their milk.  One day, she will stop feeding this baby.  For now, he is glued to her side wherever she goes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/missy-prissy-and-baby/" rel="attachment wp-att-5345"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5345" alt="Missy Prissy and Baby" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/missy-prissy-and-baby.jpg?w=950&#038;h=678" width="950" height="678" /></a>Tinkerbell and her young son, Hershey Kisses, and another youngster, whose name I don&#8217;t know, came up from the pasture to see if anybody had brought sweet feed.  They didn&#8217;t join in, but  they stayed at a distance watching.  Tinkerbell is the daughter of Fat Butt and Prissy Missy.  I never knew her, but I remember that her birth was cause for celebration since she was Prissy Missy&#8217;s first baby.  Prissy was very young and there was some concern about her welfare, but she fared just fine and was a good mother from the start.  I suspect that the Interloper sired Hershey Kisses (on Tinkerbell&#8217;s right).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/curious/" rel="attachment wp-att-5363"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5363" alt="Curious" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/curious.jpg?w=855&#038;h=665" width="855" height="665" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dean would be happy to know that Jerry is still here watching over the herd.  He is a steer so none of the babies are his offspring.  I suppose he is the patriarch of the family, however, since he can claim original longhorn status.  On this day, he was happy to accommodate my camera as he chewed on his hay and watched Jeremy and Boy shoot targets beside him.  He&#8217;s accustomed to noise as are all of the longhorns.  A train roared along the track beside the pasture, and the boys were shooting a rifle.  The little herd seemed oblivious to the commotion.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://georgeweaver.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/the-little-longhorn-herd/eating-hay/" rel="attachment wp-att-5398"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5398" alt="Eating Hay" src="http://georgeweaver.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/eating-hay.jpg?w=855&#038;h=661" width="855" height="661" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I left the pasture, I looked back to find that a somber Jerry had followed me part of the way to my car.  He was staring at me as if to say, &#8220;I remember you, but where is Deano and his golf cart?&#8221;.  Or, more likely, he hoped I&#8217;d return with sweet feed.  Prissy Missy was still standing with the herd watching me as I left.  I don&#8217;t visit the longhorns often, but I have fond memories of these first members of the little family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pathways were lined by legions of slender towering cypress trees, dark green tips meeting the deep blue sky in stark contrast. The hedges, so neatly trimmed, sharp edges lining the gardens. Orange trees, with bright citrus orbs peeping out from so many green leaves. A magnificent view of the city showcasing tiny buildings lining the hillside. Opaque white fluffy clouds floating against a deep blue sky. Beautifully patterned stone paths greeted our feet. We wandered in and out of shaded gardens, relishing spots of direct sunlight, then slowly meandering on. At every turn there was a gentle trickle of water, making me suddenly feel calmer, more serene. We oohed and aahed at courtyards, at arches, at views. We stopped for long moments, staring at the views before us.</p>
<p>Our ticket for the main palace had a time stamped entry for 16:30. We got to the line at 16:15. There was no one in line, no other tourists in sight. We approached the ticket taker. &#8220;No. Not time.&#8221; We shrugged, then sat down on a bench nearby, basking in the sunshine. I was drifting into sleep when the others said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221; and we re-entered the line.</p>
<p>The palace, so unassuming on the outside, was magnificent on the inside. Glazed tile in deep blues, greens, and yellows lined the walls. Faded blue tile peeked up from the floor. Ceilings offered intricate wood carvings. Views of the city appeared through intricately carved windows. Fountains met us at every turn.</p>

<p>Each time we entered a new part of the palace we stopped in our tracks, amazed by the beauty before us. How did they make such incredible architecture? How did they carve such intricate designs? How did they coordinate work teams with no smart phones?</p>

<p>We walked back to the city, quietly reflecting on all the beauty we had seen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://undeaddad.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snow-shoveling.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-387" alt="snow-shoveling" src="http://undeaddad.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snow-shoveling.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>Some of you may have noticed that parts of the East Coast are getting a bit of snow today, as a blizzard is forecast to hit the Northeast.  As much as 30&#8243; of snow is expected and, unlike my neighbors, I&#8217;ve got my shovels ready.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before that my family inhabits the smallest house on the block, a tiny cape home overshadowed by the McMansions down the street.  It seems as though each of these mini-fortresses is served by an army of service industry people: house cleaners, landscapers, contractors, handy-men. They even have their groceries and dry cleaning delivered.  I have only seen one other person in a couple block radius mowing his or her own lawn in the summer, which I&#8217;m sure will launch another post come June.</p>
<p>The same is true for snow removal.  I always shovel out my own driveway.  I should say WE always do it, because my wife is always there with me, each of us starting at one end and meeting in the middle like a cold, suburban version of <em>Lady and the Tramp</em>.  Our son gets suited up and runs around making snow angels and occasionally pelting us with snowballs.  It&#8217;s hard work.  We sweat and get nasty.  But we also have fun, and finish up with a sense of pride and a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>As I get older, I realize that a lot of my pride is tied up in domestic labor.  Whether it&#8217;s good or bad I can&#8217;t tell, but somehow it speaks to my sense of manhood.  I like being the one outside working on the house to make life better for the family.  I like the idea that my son is watching me work hard, break a sweat, and get a job done.  I remember watching my own dad do it.  He seemed to know how to do everything.  He did all the mundane stuff like lawn mowing, snow shoveling, and landscaping, but he also built swing sets, tree houses, and even two additions to our house!  I remember watching him and being in awe.  I didn&#8217;t understand how he came to know all he did about electrical, plumbing, and carpentry, but I wanted to be that knowledgeable one day.  I wanted to be able to do what he could do.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so fixated on doing things around the house myself.  I want my son to see me out there working.  I want him to see that he can do things for himself one day.  That he can learn to take care of himself and his family.  I make attempts at joining him in that work, like when we built a tree house together with less that optimal results (see my previous <a title="post" href="http://undeaddad.com/2012/11/28/lets-build-a-treehouse-goddammit/" target="_blank">post</a>).  But I try anyways.  It might seem prideful, but there&#8217;s a part of me that wants my son to think I can do anything.</p>
<p>So, when I see other houses calling in the snow plows, I experience an odd mixture of pity and resentment.  Their kids don&#8217;t get to see their parents struggling to contend with the snow.  Don&#8217;t get to join in the fun and toil.  Don&#8217;t get to share in a well-deserved cup of hot chocolate.  There&#8217;s also a self-centered part of me that resents seeing the plows because I believe everyone should think the way that I do.  That they should all want to be outside doing things for their house on their own.  I&#8217;ve read posts by dads who praise hired help because it gives them more time with the kids.  I can respect that approach.  If I had back every hour spent cutting the lawn or shoveling snow, I might have used it to have more fun with my family.  And granted, my neighbors probably have a lot more time freed up to spend with their children.  That&#8217;s probably part of the resentment I feel as the flocks of snow plows or pick-ups head down my street.</p>
<p>But for me, I like doing it myself.  I like the sense of accomplishment, and I like the message it sends to my son. That each of us has a responsibility and a role in keeping the family going, in fixing what is broken, and in cleaning up our own messes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://quitealone.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dskempinski.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-868 alignright" alt="dskempinski" src="http://quitealone.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dskempinski.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" width="225" height="300" /></a>Last weekend I was invited to speak at <a href="http://destinationsshow.com/" target="_blank">Destinations</a>, an annual consumer-facing travel show in London. My subject was &#8220;Reshaping Middle East tourism&#8221; and, gratifyingly, if rather amazingly, something like 100 people came to listen – a vote of confidence in the idea of going on holiday to the Middle East, at a time when doom and gloom is widespread.</p>
<p>I talked about guidebooks, about how tours work and other things – but here is the bit where I tried to explain, for a general audience, what&#8217;s happening in the Middle East at the moment, and how both we, as consumers, and the travel industry as a whole could respond to it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">It&#8217;s mostly as I spoke it, polished up just a little. Note: I chose not to discuss </span>Israel, partly because it has its own tourism context focused on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visits_to_Friends_and_Relatives" target="_blank">VFR</a> and Christian pilgrimage, but mostly because it is generally well insulated from the effects of political upheavals elsewhere.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">&#8230;So how does all this relate to what&#8217;s going on in the Middle East at the moment – what&#8217;s been called the &#8216;Arab Spring&#8217;?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>First of all, the &#8216;Arab Spring&#8217; is a misnomer – implies a single revolutionary event – which, of course, the news media love – in fact the whole region is going through profound social and political change – a transformation, which will take years&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>What is it about? Day by day, in contrast to what news media might say, my sense is it&#8217;s not driven by democracy or human rights or equality, or any of those grand ideals. If I had to sum it up, it&#8217;s about ACCOUNTABILITY. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>People from Morocco to Tunisia to Egypt to Saudi Arabia to Bahrain to Oman have been ruled by leaders – sheikhs, presidents, monarchs – who are effectively unaccountable (not in every case: traditional systems of accountability do exist, but even they are creaking under pressure). </em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Large swathes of those people are increasingly fed up with it.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I was in Kuwait recently, where there have been large demonstrations by the political opposition and others, challenging the status quo – someone there clarified it for me – he said people are asking for CLEAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY. How boring is that? Not democracy, not equality, not all that grand stuff, but simply accountable regulation. People don&#8217;t want to be ruled by whim or decree anymore.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>That&#8217;s a revolution. It&#8217;s also an uprising against authority. But it is not a single, one-off event.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Building the kind of nation to replace the hideously invasive, militarised police state Egypt suffered under Mubarak, or the psychopathic repression inflicted on Syria by the Assad regime, or even the widespread corruption in Jordan, with a balanced constitution where the rule of law is respected, where accountable politicians debate, and where there is transparency in government allied with freedom of expression – that takes years. Generations.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>It is not one news story, after which everything goes back to &#8216;normal&#8217; – despite whatever <em>Egypt&#8217;s tourism minister might <a href="http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2013/02/05/43057/tv-overblows-cairo-unrest-says-egypts-tourism-minister.html" target="_blank">wishfully think</a>.</em></em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Down the tubes</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Here&#8217;s a thought. Tourism does very well under dictatorships. The global travel industry loves stability even more than the White House does. Tourism in Egypt boomed under Mubarak, when developments JUST GOT BUILT and when nobody asked too many questions (because if you did you could end up in the Nile wearing concrete underpants). Ben Ali, Tunisia&#8217;s tinpot dictator who was the first to fall, back in 2011, oversaw his country&#8217;s tourism industry develop from nothing, even while his police forces were pulling out people&#8217;s fingernails in the torture cells under Tunis.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Even Assad in Syria – I remember 2006 and 07, when there seemed to be a genuine window for reform – I wrote several <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/24/damascus.travelfoodanddrink" target="_blank">articles</a> on the tourism opportunities opening up in a freer Syria&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>This is not to condemn anybody in travel for complicity with dictatorship, passive or otherwise. <a href="http://newsfromsyria.com/2012/08/21/syria-the-bad-old-good-old-days/" target="_blank">None of us</a> foresaw the uprisings. Nobody did – not journalists, not analysts, not the people themselves.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>But now, today, instability means Middle East tourism – particularly in Egypt – is <a href="http://skift.com/2012/12/27/egypts-once-thriving-tourism-industry-makes-little-comeback-amidst-political-instability/" target="_blank">down the tubes</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>In Egypt in 2010, 15 million tourists brought in £7 billion in revenue.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>In 2012, tourism numbers dropped by 4 million – and revenue was cut by £2 billion.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>And that mostly happened during what was thought of as a period of recovery. That all ended on 22nd November last year, when the elected president granted himself <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84163.html" target="_blank">unlimited powers</a> to &#8220;protect the nation&#8221;, which brought hundreds of thousands of people back out onto the street in protest. That public anger at the unaccountability of power, and incompetence in government, remains at boiling point.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>As a consequence, in Luxor and Aswan hotel <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/0/63596/Business/0/Egyptian-tourism-sector-ravaged-by-political-unres.aspx" target="_blank">occupancy rates</a> are down at 5% – in Cairo 15% – even Sharm and other Red Sea resorts are only half full. That&#8217;s despite <a href="http://travelpicks.dailymail.co.uk/2013/01/red-sea-in-january-all-inclusive-from-375.html" target="_blank">crazy</a> loss-leading offers. Jordan, too, has got it <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/29/257660.html" target="_blank">in the neck</a>. Lebanon is <a href="http://outescapes.com/gaytripperblog/2013/01/50-days-for-50-off-in-beautiful-lebanon/" target="_blank">desperate</a>. Tunisia is <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/news-305918-arab-spring-aftermath-batters-mideast-tourism.html" target="_blank">struggling</a>. Bahrain is <a href="http://www.mybahrain.net/viewtravelnews.asp?ID=911" target="_blank">finished</a>. Only Dubai is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/us-mideast-tourism-idUSBRE9100UC20130201" target="_blank">booming</a>.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Normal no more</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Here&#8217;s a prediction. If &#8220;normal&#8221; is what the situation was in 2010 before the Arab uprisings began, then Middle East tourism will not be going &#8220;back to normal&#8221;. Ever.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">There&#8217;s a new pattern emerging.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>And new opportunities – which most of the travel industry is missing, because they&#8217;re too worried by the news headlines to notice.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>If you forget about &#8220;normal&#8221;, there&#8217;s a chance presenting itself to rebuild the KIND of tourism the Middle East can offer.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Sustainable.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Responsible.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Tourism with integrity.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Tourism where money and resources are channelled to the people of the host destination, rather than siphoned off by big-business cronies of the ruling elite – which is what was happening cheerfully under Mubarak in Egypt, Ben Ali in Tunisia and is still the case, in marginally different circumstances, in Dubai and the Gulf.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>My sense is – as in food, media and a dozen other areas of life – our taste for industrially produced tourism on a mass scale is fading. These days, we want better. At the moment the travel industry is failing us – it&#8217;s too slow, and too hidebound by fossilised business practices to react nimbly – but the economic clout it carries, especially in the countries of the Middle East, could be a key driver for tangible change in the region. The travel industry, if it could see what&#8217;s happening more clearly, could be prompting root-and-branch innovation in the host countries, driving social integration and helping erase inequalities, and could equally be inspiring new outlooks and new approaches to the Middle East within tourists&#8217; home countries.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>At the moment, it is doing neither, because it&#8217;s focused on the 2010 way of doing things. Meanwhile, the Middle East has irrevocably, fundamentally and permanently changed.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Bucking the trend</em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Funnily enough, Jordan – or, rather, Jordanians, since it&#8217;s almost always the private sector driving change, not the government – are already bucking the trend.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Jordanians in travel have been busy the last couple of years reinventing their country away from the standard model of cultural-historical big bus tourism, led by the big players, and into a more niche outlook of adventure-style responsible tourism, down at the grassroots.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>There are lots of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/travellers-guide-jordan-8298360.html" target="_blank">examples</a>. Up in the north is the region&#8217;s first-ever community-owned, community-run tourism initiative, the <a href="http://www.abrahampath.org/jordan.php" target="_blank">Al Ayoun Trail</a>, where three untouristed hill villages are working together to develop a walking trail, country lodging, homestays and rural enterprises. In the south is <a href="http://feynan.com/" target="_blank">Feynan</a>, a desert eco-hotel far off the road, where everything is sourced locally, from food to guides, and where there&#8217;s a sense that the business is genuinely part of the rural economy – there&#8217;s a cultural to-and-fro at Feynan that&#8217;s very hard to find elsewhere (and is the antithesis of similar experiences in the UAE and Oman). Many others in Jordan in similar vein – food, wine, adventure sports and more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.lebanontrail.org/" target="_blank">Lebanon Mountain Trail</a> <em>Lebanon now has homestays across the country </em>offering homespun <a href="http://rovinggastronome.com/mainblog/2012/09/04/summer-break-0-5-lebanon-mountain-trail/" target="_blank">lodging and food</a> – </em><em>you&#8217;ll also find <a href="http://www.soukeltayeb.com/" target="_blank">farmers&#8217; markets</a> in Beirut, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/video/2011/sep/30/lebanon-vineyards-bekaa-valley-video" target="_blank">vineyard tours</a>. Lebanon does rural tourism very well, but most of the media never cover it – they just do the standard Beirut nightlife stories, fawning over swanky hotels and that absurd high-roller lifestyle&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><a href="http://quitealone.com/2012/03/30/independent-travel-in-palestine/" target="_blank">Palestine</a> is a fabulous holiday destination – almost completely untainted by that big-business tourism ethic – from north to south you can be staying with families, exploring city souks and tiny centuries-old stone villages, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/sep/04/palestine-walking-middle-east" target="_blank">walking</a> in the hills, or visiting world-class cultural sites. Palestine is a cracking place to spend time, safe, charming, endlessly fascinating – but I challenge you to find one company at this show [Destinations] that could sell you a touring holiday to Palestine.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Nobody knows about it.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Even the Gulf is experiencing something of the same turnaround – there are small tourism operators even in the big-glitz UAE – I kayaked off the coast of Abu Dhabi with <a href="http://noukhada.ae/" target="_blank">Noukhada</a> – in Dubai there are now rootsy, locally run <a href="http://www.fryingpanadventures.com/" target="_blank">food tours</a> of the city&#8217;s older, unvisited districts – and so on, including <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/travellers-guide-oman-8476622.html" target="_blank">Oman</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>There&#8217;s even some of this coming through in Egypt, with retreats and voluntourism-style working holidays <a href="http://www.makhad.org/" target="_blank">in Sinai</a>, for example.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>The old tourism will survive, for sure, for many years to come – but the terms of what is &#8216;normal&#8217; are shifting – it&#8217;s up to each country in the Middle East to plot a new and better path, and it&#8217;s up to us to reshape our idea of what the region is all about.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Instability. Opportunity. Speciality.</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>This year, next year, for several years to come, expect INSTABILITY. The Middle East is going through a prolonged revolutionary episode, driven by popular discontent. It will not be over quickly. Even when the killing stops, things won&#8217;t settle for years ahead. Work with – and around – the instability.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>OPPORTUNITY. Tourism matters hugely to this region. In almost every country it&#8217;s at or near the top of the list of contributors to GDP. Buying a package holiday includes protections, of course, but you pay for that with a series of mark-ups – and so do the ordinary people on the ground, who often see little or nothing of the money you spend to visit their country. Once, we didn&#8217;t know any better. But now we don&#8217;t need to rely on middlemen any longer. Use sources of knowledge – guidebooks, internet searches, social media – to connect with local providers where you want to go. The region&#8217;s changes are an opportunity to reshape how we visit these places. Book direct. Take local advice. Don&#8217;t rush. See more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Instead of a bog-standard tour, go for the SPECIALITY option. If you&#8217;ve been to Jordan already to see Petra and the ruins, go back to stay with a family, or learn how to cook stuffed vine-leaves, or do some country cycling – get to know the place on YOUR terms, not how a London-based tour company wants you to see it.</em></p>
<h3 style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Change is good</strong></em></h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Hospitality is a key aspect of Arab culture – people are fantastically welcoming – but because of the way tourism has developed in all these countries, as a state-directed driver of the national economy, and because of the cultural imperatives dictating the formality of the relationship between guest and host, all these countries have built tourist industries that essentially keep tourists away from locals.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>That, at last, is changing. We need to change with it.</em></p>
<p>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0824-002.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0824-002" alt="IMG_0824-002" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0824-002_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=460" width="640" height="460" border="0" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666666;">The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all but essential travel to Iraq given the security situation. Travel within Iraq remains dangerous. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning dated January 19, 2012, to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns for U.S. citizens in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence. The United States completed its withdrawal of military forces from Iraq as of December 31, 2011. The ability of the Embassy to respond to situations where U.S. citizens face difficulty, including arrests, is extremely limited.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>If you follow the international news you’ll know that Iraq is still being torn apart by sectarian violence more than a year after the US Army and its allies pulled out of the country. The coalition forces have brought some kind of democracy to the place but they failed to put an end to the mass slaughter which is indiscriminately laying waste to the population. The Angel of Death works overtime in this land, visiting pain on household after household. And a spirit of enmity continues to divide religious sects and ethnic groups. Unsurprisingly emotions are strongest in the oil-rich areas.</p>
<p>That being said I can say with hand on heart that the Kurdish-majority northern part of Iraq felt to me as safe as anywhere else I’ve been. Several times I roamed freely on my own without feeling threatened at all. In all honesty I have felt more at risk in parts of New York or London than I did in downtown Sulaymaniyah. When I walked in the bazaar the locals barely paid any attention to me even though I was the only white face in the crowd. And when they did interact with me they were invariably charming and friendly.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am a little reckless. Or just stupid. My friend Ciprian, who has been living there for around three months now, was more nervous about me going out on my own than I was. He advised me not to take taxis on my own, fearing I’d be an easy target for kidnappers. One time I told him I was going outside to take some photos but when he saw me fish my brand new Canon EOS 550D out of my bag an ashen look came over him. ‘I don’t think that’s a good idea,’ he said, ‘it’ll attract too much attention.’ Nonetheless I ventured into the thronging bazaar shooting away with my DSLR and all I got by way of a reaction was a friendly salute from this kid.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0799.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0799" alt="IMG_0799" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0799_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=435" width="640" height="435" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>However, I do not wish to deny the disturbances which do sometimes take place in Sulaymaniyah. In March of last year an American teacher was shot dead in front of his class by one of his students. The reason for his horrific fate may be that he was an outspoken Christian. At an international church which congregates in a rented room of a shopping mall I spoke to several people who knew him. They all agreed that this teacher had been too forward in his attempts to evangelise the Kurdish people, who are predominantly Muslim. The student who shot him had not responded well to having his worldview challenged. Exposure to Christian teaching left him confused – some days he embraced it eagerly, other days he reacted angrily to it.</p>
<p>There was also a consensus in the international church that the American teacher had been an extremely kind-hearted and approachable individual. Even Kak Amanj knew him and claimed that he was a close friend.</p>
<p>Such shootings are relatively rare in Sulaymaniyah. But, as I said in my previous <a href="http://samnorthcote.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/the-other-iraq-part-1">post</a>, political demonstrations are common and sometimes things can get ugly. If you want to read about some of these protests from the perspective of a Kurdish blogger who has been under fire from the government’s riot squads I recommend you check out <a href="http://themovingsilent.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/sulaymaniyah-iraqi-kurdistan-they-killed-the-protesters-they-killed-the-people/">The Moving Silent</a>.</p>
<p>I had arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan at around 5am on Saturday, the 12th of January 2013. And after a bumpy ride from the airport in Kak Amanj’s battered car we arrived at Ciprian’s dorm. His living conditions are Spartan, like a cell in a hermitage or something. A stripped-down type of life. There is no inbuilt heating and Ciprian hates the smell of the bulky kerosene heaters which are normally used to heat interiors in Sulaymaniyah, not to mention the twofold danger of fire and carbon-monoxide poisoning which they pose. So he instead uses a small electric fan-heater. The only problem with that is the power-cuts which happen several times daily. You see, Sulaymaniyah’s power-grid was not built to handle modern-day levels of electricity consumption. As wealth grows in the city more and more people can afford to run air-conditioning and other power-hungry appliances and the electrical system can’t cope. Most businesses have back-up generators, and their insistent humming is part of the sonic background of the city. Some shrewd entrepreneurs have bought large generators and earn a tidy profit from providing back-up power to residential neighbourhoods for a fee.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0769.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0769" alt="IMG_0769" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0769_thumb.jpg?w=639&#038;h=431" width="639" height="431" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Ciprian says he can handle the primitive conditions of the dorm. Having spent his childhood in communist-era Romania when food and other basic necessities were in short supply he is familiar with extreme deprivation. But one thing he can’t stand is the cold. Even with the electric heater on he goes to bed nearly fully clothed and still complains that he’s not warm enough. It doesn’t help that his balcony door doesn’t close properly and is only secured with an elastic band tied to the bunk-bed. One night there was a sandstorm raging outside and this door was constantly being yanked open by the fierce wind. Funnily enough I didn’t feel cold at all in the room. I guess all those bitter winters I spent in Beijing count for something.</p>
<p>Ciprian’s neighbour, a slightly eccentric maths teacher called Kak Salim, was pleased to see his Romanian friend. ‘I thought you were never coming back!’ he exclaimed. (Ciprian had been traveling around Europe for a month or so, visiting his scattered family and doing musical performances). Kak Salim welcomed us with a plateful of dried figs, raisins and assorted nuts which had apparently come from Iran. Then he went back to his room to Skype his fiancée.</p>
<p>We also met the guy who was Ciprian’s roommate when he first arrived in the dorm, before he moved into a room of his own. I don’t recall his name but he was a Catholic from Mosul, a city about four hours drive north of Sulaymaniyah. Mosul is said to be a hub of al-Qaeda activity and is regularly buffeted by violence. The city’s Christians in particular are being forced out by targeted attacks. Just three days before I arrived in the country a Chaldean Christian teacher had her throat cut in Mosul and the following day a car bomb claimed the life of a Christian final-year medical student.</p>
<p>Ciprian’s ex-roommate is doing a PhD in family medicine. The ongoing violence in Mosul made it impossible for him to complete his course there. So, to pursue an uninterrupted education and to escape the brutal attacks on Christians in his hometown, he moved to the comparatively peaceful Sulaymaniyah where, amazingly, schools were only stopped once during the Iraq War. He is now in his final year of study and when he finishes he will apply for refugee status and move to the USA. His sisters are already living over there.</p>
<p>The three of us sat down to a simple breakfast in Ciprian’s room – freshly baked naan, cream cheese, jam, a salty yoghurt drink called <em>ayran</em>, and mandarins.</p>
<p>Then we hit the bazaar – Ciprian and myself – to drink sweet cardamom tea and buy a guitar. I would frequent the bazaar in the coming days after developing a strong attachment to the sweet tea, savouring its delectable comfort on cold mornings. The teashop owners for the most part were exceptionally friendly and sometimes would refuse to accept payment from us for the tea.</p>

<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0562.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0562" alt="IMG_0562" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0562_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=434" width="640" height="434" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As I already said I never once felt in danger when walking around the bazaar. Strangely I didn’t even feel out of place there. Although I was the only white person around I was barely conscious of my foreignness. People mostly paid me no attention. I was not overwhelmed by hawkers or dogged by pickpockets. I was not trailed by beggars. And the shopkeepers didn’t try to exploit my lack of local knowledge by charging me over the odds for things.</p>
<p>One time when I was looking for my sweet-tea fix a shop-owner hailed me over and struck up conversation with me. ‘Sprechen sie deutsche?’ he enquired.</p>
<p>I told him I couldn’t speak German.</p>
<p>‘Kurdi?’</p>
<p>I shook my head: ‘Inglise.’</p>
<p>‘Pity, my English is not so good.’</p>
<p>But his English was good enough for basic conversation. He told me he lived in Nuremburg, Germany as a refugee for about a decade. I asked him if he liked it there. He shook his head. ‘Too many racists.’</p>
<p>I experienced many variations of this conversation during my time in Iraqi Kurdistan. Pretty much everyone I met there had lived for some time in Europe or America. It’s only really since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the Baathist government that the Kurds have been able to feel safe in their homeland.</p>
<p><a href="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0806.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="IMG_0806" alt="IMG_0806" src="http://samnorthcote.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0806_thumb.jpg?w=640&#038;h=433" width="640" height="433" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This caused me to re-examine my own views on the Iraq War. I have always been a pacifist and was staunchly opposed to the deployment of coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have long felt that foreign wars are a counter-productive way to combat terrorism. And yet I cannot deny that the US-led invasion of Iraq was, for the Kurdish people at least, a good thing insofar as it took Saddam out of the picture.</p>
<p>Saddam was a ruthless dictator who sought to impose Arabic culture on the Kurdish region of Iraq. When the Kurds resisted this process of ‘Arabization’ he implemented Operation Anfal, a long, bloody campaign to wipe them and their culture off the map. I will come back to Anfal in a later post but for now suffice to say that Kurdish life was cheap under this reign of terror. Hundreds of thousands were killed and many more displaced. But ever since American troops spearheaded the overthrow of Saddam and the Baathists the fortunes of the Kurdish people have changed dramatically. Their cities are, for the most part, thriving; their markets are buzzing with activity; their children play freely in the streets; their villages have been rebuilt; their culture and language is intact; and hope is alive and well.</p>
<p>Whatever ulterior motives the allied forces may have had for entering Iraq – and I’m still convinced oil was the main motivator rather than empathy for suffering civilians – I’m glad that their actions at least gave the Iraqi Kurds the chance to live at peace in their homeland.</p>

<p>In the evening Ciprian and I went to the Saturday service at the international church. The congregation was small but several nationalities were represented. I spoke to a Swiss man who had come to Kurdistan with his family to do business and a Mexican businessman who had likewise come with his family. Because of the lack of international schools the children of these families were being home-schooled.</p>
<p>There was also a bunch of American girls in their early twenties. They had come to Kurdistan as volunteers with humanitarian organisations to teach English. They too said they feel perfectly safe walking around in Sulaymaniyah. One of them had started out teaching in a village out in the mountains surrounding the city.</p>
<p>There were only two Kurdish guys at the church. One – Kak Saber – gave me his business card and said he worked for the International Bible Society. He was also a freelance journalist for various Kurdish newspapers. The other was a softly-spoken young guy with long hair and a Michael Jackson T-shirt. His name was Kak Shorsh. He couldn’t speak much English but he was pleased to see Ciprian. I learned later that this guy had lost both of his parents. In fact there wasn’t much left of his family at all. I’m not sure what his day-job is but, according to Ciprian, he is a gifted preacher.</p>
<p>After church Kak Shorsh took a taxi with Ciprian and myself because he lives near the dorm. He could barely speak a word of English and Ciprian’s Kurdish is very limited so there wasn’t much verbal communication between us. But this Kak Shorsh radiated some kind of inner peace which baffled me. His family had been wiped out – decimated. But if he harboured any bitterness there was no sign of it.</p>
<p>Back at the dorm Kak Amanj invited me to eat popcorn with him. In no time he had a saucepan rattling on the stove in the communal kitchen. A guy from the Turkish part of Kurdistan came in and I greeted him with the Arabic phrase which is always used in Iraqi Kurdistan: ‘Salaam alaikum’ (peace be upon you). But he laughed and said ‘I&#8217;m not an Arab! Don’t speak Arabic to me, I hate it.’</p>
<p>The following day I would visit an old prison where the Baathists detained and tortured their political opponents. And later in the week I would talk to a class of high-school students and take the bus to the ancient city of Erbil which is crowned with an 8,000-year-old citadel.</p>
