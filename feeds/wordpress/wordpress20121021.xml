				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been going back and forth on when I should share this.  When I started my blog, I had no doubt I would eventually share it.  In part, I have been going through a healing process the past few months and I feel this is a step towards true healing. But, most importantly, I wanted to reach out to anyone who might be going through the same thing.</p>
<p><em>Note: I will probably end up deleting this post eventually, this sensitive subject is highly confidential personally.  But something inside me is saying that someone needs to hear this.</em></p>
<p>The year 2004, was a blur. I was a single mother, just coming out of a divorce.  A young-minded 25-year-old, I felt like I was invincible.  I was on a Divorcee Honeymoon.  Having fun was my life&#8217;s goal.  Last month, 8 years ago, we had just been through 3 of 4 hurricanes.  The power was out for 4 days in this little condo. We cooked out of the fireplace.  At night, we played board games by candlelight.  I had a friend, he was just a friend.  But, was it cabin fever? Was it curiosity? I am not sure.  But it was not a relationship either of us needed to pursue.  One-night-stand.</p>
<p>This month, 8 years ago, I jumped up. No symptoms, nothing out of the ordinary.  I just knew, I needed to take a test. Something in me was different.  And there it was a clear and quick answer&#8230;&#8230;. positive. I was pregnant.  Me, a &#8220;good girl&#8221; but already divorced, already a single mother: pregnant.  And this time, with no one to turn to.  My first thought, should I even call him?  I did. His answer, &#8220;you better take care of it.&#8221; So I did. I called the doctor. I went to a specialist, and at the time with my given diagnosis I would have been a high-risk pregnancy patient.  At that time I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus. I was severely sick in the past, and my doctor was telling me the &#8216;worst case scenario&#8217; that I would be on bed rest the entire last half of the pregnancy.  I ran it through my mind, prayed, became numb, even put off the first appointment.  But I didn&#8217;t want it to draw out, I did what I thought I had to do: went to the clinic. I had an abortion.</p>
<p>My heart became numb, hate grew to its worst in my heart.  And I tried to forget.</p>
<p>See, last year, the same doctor that gave me the high-risk prognosis, took away my diagnosis of SLE.  Was I healed? Or had I not carried the disease all that time?  And for the first time in years, I realized that had he not told me I was going to be high-risk I would have kept the baby.</p>
<p>I said I tried to forget, yet I have not.  My unborn baby has been in the forefront of my thoughts many times through the day.  Often in my thoughts, my afterthoughts, and in my prayers.  She would have been 7, she might have shared the same birthday month as me and her eldest brother.  Sometimes I would imagine if she was with me in the car driving the kids to school.  And slowly, in the past few months, I have come to the realization that I need to let her go.  I need to let her be at peace, as she is in a much better place than I could ever have given her at that time.</p>
<p>I have dealt with the guilt, the sadness, the anger.  I hurt and ache, not because I am struggling now.  It&#8217;s the feeling that I would never want my children to hurt at my doing.  As much as I love my children, she would have been loved the same. I wished I could tell her that.</p>
<p>As I live month to month now <em>trying</em> to have a baby, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if I&#8217;m even worthy of the blessing, another chance. I pray, but I cringe. I am hopeful, yet cautious.</p>
<p>I have been seeing a lot of information on October 15th.  A day of remembrance for the Unborn Child.  For those lost in miscarriage, those who have not been conceived.  Not knowing if she fits into this day of remembrance, but I remember her&#8230; Often.  And she is my unborn child.</p>
<p><em>I am not writing this to advocate or not advocate for this sensitive subject.  My experiences have no bearing on a woman&#8217;s right to choose.  I am more writing this from an &#8220;infertile&#8221; point of view.  I want to share with you the dynamics of my darkest secret as someone who has now dealt with infertility for 3 years. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1395322"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3184" title="hanging laundry" alt="hanging laundry, drying laundry" src="http://highlyirritable.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hanging-laundry.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" height="768" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Today’s “Tip Thursday” is about laundry. I hate laundry with the passion of a woman who&#8217;s been scorned, is drunk on Shiraz, and with access to your private cell phone number.  I hate it they way dogs hate cats, snow hates sunshine, and Republicans hate women.</p>
<p>I HATE IT AND EVERYTHING IT STANDS FOR. If it were a person, I&#8217;d punch it in its dirty, rotten face.</p>
<p>It never ends, and there are too many steps to its completion. One of the things I love about humid Ontario summers is wearing wet clothes right from the washing machine. You get a custom “to your body” fit and built-in cooling-mechanism. Plus, no drying or folding.</p>
<p>So, this week, in efforts to reduce our laundry load, I turned to my son for help. He doesn’t like parting with his worked-in (read: <em>filthy</em>) clothing for washing, and I’m sick of having philosophical discussions about “What is dirt, anyway?” with an ornery 8 year-old while playing tug-of-war with a disgusting crusty pair of tiny blue jeans.</p>
<p>If I follow his recommendations, I won’t need to do almost any laundry ever again. This should cut down on my household workload by almost 37% after you account for  my daughter’s 432 Aeropostale t-shirts. So, if clothing or linens do not meet his “dirt” qualifications, I’m not washing them.</p>
<p>However, he can’t really tell me what dirt <em>is</em>, but he can tell me what it <em>isn’t.</em></p>
<p>It’s not dirt if:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s not dirt if it came from your own body. I’m not giving specifics here. Let’s just say if it came from an opening somewhere on your body, it apparently doesn’t count as dirt because “You said our bodies are beautiful,<em> Mom</em>.”</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if it makes a mark smaller than a quarter. In essence, you can wear a shirt with 138 patches of mud on it, so long as their individual size does not exceed that of a .25 piece.</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if it’s fresher than 24 hours. Fresh and dirt cannot co-exist.</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if it was garnered in the act of performing a task requested by an adult. Chore dirt displays lack of autonomy and is therefore exempt from punishment by washing.</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if it is food-derived. BBQ sauce, eggs yolk, jam, or roast beef juices are delicious snacks for later.</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if someone else put it there. Sidewalk chalk up and down your back that you are not aware of because your sister was trying to make you look like a skunk because you never wash your clothes is exempt. It is also a good example of what I refer to as “the laundry wormhole.”</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if you can’t see it from the front. All dirt on the back of your clothing is exempt.</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if it doesn’t smell bad. (See #3 &#8211; “freshness” criteria.)</li>
<li>It’s not dirt if there is an inkling of creative merit involved. Markers, paint, glitter, 6 pompoms and a Popsicle stick inadvertently glued to a sleeve must remain intact to preserve artistic integrity and to prevent accusations of censorship.</li>
<li>(There may have been a tenth qualification; if there was I didn’t hear it. The smell of his laundry basket was too much for me to take, and I had to leave the room. If you have any ideas, leave it in the comments.)</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules can be extended beyond laundry as well, and work equally well when applied to bathing or hair washing. And while I look forward to the day my son becomes a fully independent and responsible member of adult society, someone please point me towards this post if I ever consider eating dinner at his house.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">My father was a military man.  He was an athlete, an artist, a music lover, a charming smart-ass who always had a clever retort.  He was a 6&#8217;6&#8243; giant and there was nothing scarier than his tennis racket sized hands, though he rarely had to lift them to make my brother and I behave.  He seemed to literally be the &#8220;Big Man On Campus&#8221; on our small Air Force Base.  As kids, we couldn&#8217;t go anywhere without someone recognizing him and wanting to talk for a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When I was 9, my little league team was the Cubs, we were in 1st place.  We were playing the Pirates, they were in last place.  It wasn&#8217;t hard to tell why, their coach was negative and aggressive, yelling at players and taunting the other team.  I was at bat and he was screaming at the pitcher &#8220;C&#8217;MON SON PUT IT DOWN THE MIDDLE, THEY&#8217;VE GOT NO HITTERS, NO HITTERS ON THEIR TEAM!&#8221;  The next pitch I roped the ball straight off the center field fence.  As I trotted down first base I looked at the coach and said &#8220;No hitters huh?&#8221;  It turned into a standup triple and, as I settled on the base proud of my early attempt at shit talking, the coach yelled from the dugout, &#8220;BOY IF YOU EVER TALK TO ME LIKE THAT AGAIN I&#8217;M GOING TO STOMP YOU.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In a purely instinctual reaction my dad flew off the bleachers near 3rd base, ran around the backstop, stepped over the waist high fencing on the side of their dugout (a normal sized man would&#8217;ve had to hop over it), grabbed the coach by his collar, looked down from his huge height advantage and bellowed &#8220;WHO YOU GONNA STOMP NOW?!?!&#8221;  I was scared for the coach because I&#8217;d felt the wrath of those tennis racket sized hands before.  At the same time I&#8217;d never understood how much he cared until I saw him react that way.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In 2009, a few days after his 55th birthday, my father was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.  An elongated conversation with the charming man I remember from my childhood has been reduced to a chain of repeated questions or sentiments.  In a long car ride, he&#8217;ll turn around every 2 minutes or so to make sure my mom is still in the backseat.  Even still, if you weren&#8217;t told you might not know.  The remnants of his clever charm have created great defense mechanisms when told he&#8217;s repeating himself [i.e. <em>"I KNOW I just said I haven't been on this road in a long time…but it's been a REALLY long time"</em>].  It&#8217;s not like you see on the movies.  He&#8217;s not old and gray.  He&#8217;s not a happy-go-lucky mindless punchline.  He&#8217;s not a walking zombie wondering &#8220;who are all these strange people.&#8221;  He&#8217;s there.  He&#8217;s just losing his grasp of &#8220;there&#8221; slowly, day by day.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The meds helped at first.  They seemed to bring some life back to him, seemed to slow his decline.  After 3 years, I think they do more for my mom&#8217;s sanity than his health.  She&#8217;s been amazing throughout the ordeal: caring for him daily, keeping him on schedule, writing everything down, researching realistic plans for his care in the future, being a breadwinner, homemaker, and caretaker.  I often wish I were more prepared to help.  I never thought I would be dealing with a parent&#8217;s health decline before I had children of my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This song is about his disease, and how I&#8217;m trying to cope.  This song was hard to write.  This song is hard to show people.  I&#8217;m scared it could be misconstrued as using my father&#8217;s pain for art.  I&#8217;ve pondered how unfair it is that I have a platform to vent about our past, and he doesn&#8217;t.  I worry greatly about how he&#8217;ll feel if he hears it.  I don&#8217;t want it to be seen as a cry for pity.  The worst response when I tell someone my father has Alzheimer&#8217;s is &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> I hope this song raises awareness about a disease that will be cured.  My family and I felt some sort of stigma when we got my father&#8217;s diagnosis.  We&#8217;ve felt alone, I know we&#8217;re not.  Over half a million Americans younger than 65 suffer from some sort of dementia.  My father is one of them, some of you reading might know another.  I hope that some of you will be inspired to donate to <a href="http://www.alz.org/" target="_blank">The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association</a> or <a href="http://www.alzfdn.org/" target="_blank">Alzheimer&#8217;s Foundation of America</a>.  Great strides are being taken to cure this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> My father visited Los Angeles last Christmas.  My brother, Steven, bought us tickets to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSllNKhzKx8&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Bob Seger</a> at Staples Center.  My dad loves Seger, but I noticed him looking around in awe at our surroundings almost as much as he payed attention to the music.  There was a man behind us, in his late 40&#8242;s, drunk and loud.  He kept yelling things aimed at Seger, but my father kept looking back with a puzzled face.  I could tell it would eventually turn into trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> I said &#8220;Dad, stop looking back at that guy, he&#8217;s going to think something&#8217;s up.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> He told me innocently &#8220;Oh, I thought he was talking to me for some reason.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Eventually the guy behind us yelled again.  My dad looked back again.  The guy said &#8220;Is there a problem buddy?&#8221;  I grabbed my dad&#8217;s arm to turn him around, leaned behind him, grabbed the drunk guy by the back of the neck in a firm, but non-threatening way and said &#8220;Look…my dad gets confused, he thinks you&#8217;re talking to him, he means nothing by it.  Leave it alone.&#8221;  He didn&#8217;t yell for the rest of the show.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> My father didn&#8217;t notice how the situation was handled.  At this point he doesn&#8217;t remember that we went to see Seger.  But I think the man that stood up for me as a 9 year old would appreciate the reciprocation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://myfussyuterus.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/7973746474_baa7d8954e_z1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-412" title="7973746474_baa7d8954e_z" alt="" src="http://myfussyuterus.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/7973746474_baa7d8954e_z1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" height="168" width="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>&#8220;Jen, you sure know how to pick &#8216;em&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I have heard this in my lifetime.  Whether it be about boyfriends or friends or what have you, I have heard it&#8230; over and over and over.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As my 93-year old grandmother would say, &#8220;<em>It takes all kinds&#8230;</em>&#8221; and I love <em>all</em> kinds.  I surround myself with <em>all</em> kinds.  I have single-handedly baffled my entire family in one way or another with my  choice of <em>all kinds</em> &#8211; except for my father.  He gets it.  Because that is where I <em>get it from</em>.  The man has the most bizarre range of friends you&#8217;ve ever seen&#8230; until you&#8217;ve seen mine. Then we&#8217;re on an equal playing field of weirdness.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, it&#8217;s no surprise that my fertility doctor is a complete weirdo.  I was recommended to him by a friend that is in no way weird, but she unknowingly set me up with Dr. King of the Weirdos&#8230; and I honestly kind of love it.  I debated for awhile switching doctors. Not because of his personality, but because I questioned how I fit into his practice.  I&#8217;ve since decided to stick it out a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had an appointment with him today &#8211; to check in. To see how things are going down in the nether region. To discuss the pre-emptive strike on my uterus in preparation of another Stupid Journey.  He kept me waiting &#8211; as they all do &#8211; on that damn table.  The nurse led me in sweetly saying, &#8220;<em>Bottoms off, Jennifer!  The doctor will be in shortly!</em>&#8221; as I winced.  It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve heard those words and saw that paper blanket that pathetically dissolves whatever dignity you have left.  <em>So, we meet again&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After twenty minutes of sitting pant-less on that cold table, eyes wandering around the room, fidgeting with my paper skirt and hindering the brief urge to give myself an ultrasound exam (<em>the machine was right there&#8230; the dildo-cam* was calling to me&#8230;), </em>Dr. Totally Inappropriate comes flying in.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>Farmer!  Long time, no see!</em>&#8221; as he quickly glances at my chart.  Then, as his eyes catch the date of my last appointment with him, he rolls his chair back in my direction and flips me off angry-Johnny-Cash-style.  Yep. This totally happened.  &#8221;<em>Six months?!  FUCK YOU! OK?! FUCK YOU!</em>&#8221; he says.  Then he scoots toward me on his rolling throne of weirdness and grabs a condom and the wand.**</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What? That&#8217;s not normal? <em>It takes all kinds</em>&#8230; Ahem. Pay attention.***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Dr. No Boundaries and I established a very long time ago that he could use any language in front of me he wanted.  In fact, I assured him he&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find a way to offend me in any shape or form. (<em>Have you met me?</em>).  We have a verbal agreement that I won&#8217;t sue him for his less-than-graceful bedside manner and, in turn, he will get me pregnant.  No, wait.  <em>He</em> won&#8217;t get me pregnant.  Sweet baby Jesus. What&#8217;s wrong with you?  <em>That</em> would be <em>totally</em> inappropriate. I do have <em>some</em> boundaries&#8230; He will make sure <em>my husband</em> gets me pregnant.  And that I (hopefully) stay that way.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, the appointment went on as status-quo.  I do my part, he does his&#8230; wah wah wah.  A few meds were upped.  A few more ideas suggested.  A few more plans to think about.  Sixteen f-words later and a demand that I tell him loud and clear &#8220;<em>I want to WIN this</em>!&#8221; (ala: &#8220;<em>SHOW ME THE MONEY</em>!&#8221;) and he was off on his merry, spastic way.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yep, I know how to pick &#8216;em.  I know how to pick &#8216;em just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, that&#8217;s that. We&#8217;ll see how this goes&#8230; the shots have started up again and my stomach looks like I let Brian conduct batting practice with a wooden 2&#215;4 on my abdomen.  I&#8217;m starving from the Prednisone and my pee is neon yellow from the prenatals.  The circus has started.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Come one, come all&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><strong>*Ok, I know dildo-cam is a totally inappropriate name to call an ultrasound wand &#8211; but let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves: it looks like a dildo and it&#8217;s basically a camera (and this is what the seedy underground of fertility chat-room users call it.)  No need to sugarcoat it.  Although, in the trademark world, dildo-cam would totally be considered a descriptive term.  (Look!  I just taught you something legal!)</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><strong>**Wand seemed more appropriate to use the second time around since you clearly had such an issue with dildo-cam.  Prude.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><strong>***Did you see what I just did there, RHONJ fans? I just went Teresa Guidice on your ass.  Pay attention!</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just did it moments ago. I do it every Friday morning. It’s generally before 7 am and I’m naked. I pee first, then close my eyes and mentally prepare. I tell myself, “It’s going to be good. It’s going to be okay.” Then, cringing with fear, I step on the scale.</p>
<p>No, I’m not going to tell you what it says. I may be confessional, but I have boundaries, people. But honestly, the number doesn’t really matter (except to me of course, where it HUGELY matters), what matters is how my entire mood changes by 7:01am. Depending on that flat glass surface with a digital screen, I’m either fabulous or frumpy. Happy or miserable.</p>
<p>Friday after Friday, I’d cringe, exhale as much breath out of my body and step. Often, the number is happy, smiling up at me. But lately, it’s been two to three pounds up – and when it’s up, I am most certainly down.</p>
<p>Three pounds may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me, or to anyone in my house who has to deal with my cranky, fat ass. Don’t judge me too harshly. I grew up surrounded by the body disorder disease &#8211; my mother has it, my aunt has it, my cousins have it. It seemed to affect every female member in my family.  Only my tall, skinny cousin seemed immune, living on a diet of Oreo cookies and chocolate bars, until well after her third child was born. Then, she too, succumbed.</p>
<p>I remember once, as a young girl, noting my mother’s strange skin color. “Carrots.” She explained. “It’s all the carrots.” I don’t want to know how many carrots you have to eat before you start to turn into one, but my mom was well on her way. I think she tried living on broccoli as well, but she always looked better in orange.</p>
<p>So after weeks of seeing a number that used to be reserved for “I had better be pregnant,” I did what anyone would do – I stopped going on the scale.  I know you thought I was going to say I went on a diet. Screw that. I eat basically vegetables and ice cream, and exercise a solid five days a week.  But something had to go, and it was the scale.</p>
<p>I had always been amazed by people who just ate without fear of the scale. Now I was one of them, and for the first few weeks, not having to see the number eased my mind somewhat. I felt a little more carefree, my clothes fit and for the first time in my memory, I wasn’t my scale’s bitch.  It was revelatory. It was enough to make you want to celebrate! With cake!</p>
<p>As you might guess, my celebratory liberation ended as soon I began to feel that subtle tightening around my waist, my favorite jeans no longer my favorite. I knew, but I didn’t want to believe. So I gathered my courage, got naked, exhaled and stepped. It was a big step, and even though I was no longer happy, at least I knew where I stood. 2lbs fatter than the fat that made me shun the scale. Damn.</p>
<p>As I contemplated my next steps – no more peanut butter, two cups of ice cream a day instead of three &#8211; a funny thing happened, I got used to the new number. My old fat became my new average. I hated it, but accepted it in the way I accepted another load of laundry, annoyed but resigned. I didn’t know what to make of this development. For a long while I became depressed, not at the number any longer, but that I had given up and accepted a newer version of myself – an older, fatter one.</p>
<p>Twenty odd years at the same weight (give or take those same up and down five pounds), and I will forever teeter on the edge of weight anxiety. I am always afraid Friday morning when I step on that scale, but I’ve learned my lesson. I will not cover my eyes like a two-year old. I will step. Knowing is better than living in denial. My coping skills, if not my body image, have strengthened over the years. I am more okay with who I am than I ever was. Even though my body is a little softer, I’ve got a tougher skin.</p>
<p>Besides, there’s always next Friday.</p>
