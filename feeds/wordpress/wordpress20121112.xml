				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://realwomen1.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/salute.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-708" title="salute" alt="" src="http://realwomen1.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/salute.jpg?w=237&#038;h=300" height="300" width="237" /></a>Today is one of those days when we are reminded to do something we should be doing every day.  Honoring and thanking past and current Veterans.  Veterans are very Real People who have decided to take an extraordinary career path by entering the military to serve our country and protect us all.</p>
<p>For the majority of us, imagining what it is like to go through military training and active service is just that &#8212; something we can only imagine.  It is a service that we hear about, legends and stories we learn, and news and images we see on TV. But it isn&#8217;t something that most of us truly experience.  And I know that at least for me, it can be hard to wrap my head around what our Veterans have seen, done, sacrificed and endured.</p>
<p>Especially humbling are those Veterans who gave their lives fighting for us and protecting us, and all of those who have been somehow injured in the line of Duty.  They all deserve our respect and gratitude.  Then there are all of the other Veterans who walk among us today, or are off right this very minute answering the call.</p>
<p>My Dad fought in the Korean War.  His stories he has told us over the years never cease to amaze me &#8212; nor do the stories I hear from other Veterans. They are truly awe-inspiring.  Today I am also thinking about the very Real Women who are somehow connected to the Military. I think about the women Dad left behind when he went to war. What was it like for my mom, his then fiance, to hope and pray he returned?  She was only able to speak to him once the whole time he was off fighting &#8212; when Dad was granted leave to Japan and spent hours in a hotel room just waiting to put a overseas phone call through.  Or his mother, who was collecting stubs of candles to box up and send to her son and the other troops so they&#8217;d have light to use at night on the front lines.</p>
<p>Sure, technology has changed, and the wives, girlfriends, mothers, and sisters of our troops today have a bit more opportunity to stay connected &#8212; but the anxiety and worry can&#8217;t possibly be any easier.</p>
<p>And today, of course, are the Real Woman who are serving in the military.  They have gone through unbelievable training, and have left family and loved ones, even their own children, behind to serve our country.  I like to think of myself as a strong women &#8212; but I can&#8217;t hold a candle to any of them.  I am in awe.</p>
<p>Today, as I go about my safe, peaceful, easy, happy civilian life, I will think about, honor, thank, and respect the Veterans in all of our lives who do what they do so I can have the life I lead.  They are Extraordinary Real People.</p>

<p>What was that? Do I have any superpowers?</p>
<p>Great question, intrepid reader. You constantly ask the best questions. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always thought makes you stand out from the crowd. All those other people always ask stupid questions like, &#8220;Paper or plastic?&#8221;, or &#8220;Boxers or briefs?&#8221;, or &#8220;How do we obtain world peace in an ever increasingly violent global landscape?&#8221;.</p>
<p>But not you, you always ask the important questions. The in-depth queries, such as, &#8220;Do you have any superpowers?&#8221;, or &#8220;Are you going to finish that sandwich?&#8221;, or &#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re going to finish that sandwich?&#8221;</p>
<p>To answer your question, no I do not have any superpowers. That&#8217;s not to say that I wouldn&#8217;t welcome them. I spend a considerable amount of time researching ways to acquire some. Literally minutes a day are spent on Google searches of this very nature. Nothing I have learned from these intense study sessions have led me closer to obtaining superpowers. But I have learned a few things I would like to share.</p>
<ol>
<li>I know that Spiderman, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Spider-Man" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Peter Parker</a>, got his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. But I call hogwash on that. I&#8217;m almost positive that a bite from a radioactive spider would kill you. Although I&#8217;m not a doctor, I&#8217;m also not a dentist. But either way, if a radioactively infected arachnid used its mandibles to pierce your epidermis it would most likely lead to <a class="zem_slink" title="Anaphylaxis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">anaphylactic shock</a>, increased heart rate, hyperventilation, loss of consciousness, and possibly death. Oh snap! Who may or may not be a doctor and/or a dentist now? Still me? Whatever.</li>
<li>Batman, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Batman" href="http://www.dccomics.com/sites/batman/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Bruce Wayne</a>, doesn&#8217;t have any superpowers. He&#8217;s just a rich dude with expensive toys. He&#8217;s a one percenter, and therefore the enemy of the Occupy Gotham movement. Listen, if I had an unlimited influx of cash, I could totally fight crime in a big bad way, too. But instead of spending a million dollars on a utility belt, I need to come up with hundreds of dollars for my utility bills. Electricity, home heating oil, cable, etc. I could use a little help here, Dark Knight.</li>
<li>Superman, or Clark Kent, gets his powers from the yellow sun of Earth. But he&#8217;s also an alien from another planet, and truth be told, I&#8217;ve never trusted him. I&#8217;m sure he has some ulterior motive to helping people, but I haven&#8217;t quite figured it out yet. But I will, and boy when I do, that dude&#8217;s gonna get his. I&#8217;ve been stockpiling kryptonite for years in the hopes of knocking that guy off his high horse. Don&#8217;t worry, his time shall come.</li>
<li>The <a class="zem_slink" title="Hulk (comics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_%28comics%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Incredible Hulk</a>, or Dr. Bruce Banner, was exposed to gamma rays. When he gets angry, he turns into a big green tough guy with super human strength and a pissy attitude. Once again, nuclear contamination doesn&#8217;t seem like a safe and effective way to obtain superpowers to me. Also, I think a lot of his power can be traced back to his easily flustered personality. Maybe if he saw a therapist and tried to work through some of his personal issues he wouldn&#8217;t be so quick to enrage. Think about it Mister Doctor Banner. You&#8217;ll thank me later. Or rip my head off during one of your classic hissy fits. You&#8217;re so predictable.</li>
<li>No matter how much society tries to convince me it&#8217;s true, I will never agree that The <a class="zem_slink" title="Wonder Twins" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Twins" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Wonder Twins</a> are superheroes. Having the ability to transform into various sized portions of water doesn&#8217;t make you a superhero. It just makes you terribly sad, and incredibly well hydrated. And hydration isn&#8217;t a superpower, it&#8217;s just a very important part of mainaining a healthy body. Deal with it.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever participated in a psychological survey or study in which you were asked to list your top 5 or 10 self-descriptors?  Psychologists love to gather these lists code them in a million and one binary ways, including whether you are individualist or collectivist, action-oriented or passive, introverted or extraverted, and then correlate them with random measures such as stigma consciousness and political orientation.  Oh, there are so many ways we can break a person down into random numerical representations and associations.  In such lists, do you include your job or career as a self-descriptor?</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at someone’s business card and wondered what their title meant? What is an <i>ontologist</i>?  Apparently, they decide what exists in the virtual world. What is a <i>taxonomist</i>? Here’s a clue, they could be a biologist or a librarian, and it in no way involves stuffing dead animals for mounting.</p>
<p>While I was at the <i>Department of Justice</i>, over a decade ago (stop trying to calculate my age), there was someone who was the <i>Director of Supplies Distribution</i>. Basically, she had the laborious and intellectually stimulating task of doling out pens from the supply closet. She would open the closet door for one hour each day and take pen requests.  I am completely serious about this.  While she handed out pens, she also tried to sell us her Avon products, clearly a much more fulfilling occupation. A bunch of us paralegals would rotate as to who would buy her products so that we could generate office-supply good will.  A decade later, I may still have some of those products in a bottom drawer somewhere and she may still be director of pens. I actually do not know since I long moved on to jobs where writing implements are not so highly regulated.  But this begs the question of what’s in a title anyway?</p>
<p>Job titles are supposed badges of honor, authority, power, and pride. Not getting the job title appropriate to your position can supposedly undermine your standing both inside your organization and with outsiders such as key stakeholders, clients and consumers. Additionally, not getting the title that you believe you are due can stymie a career trajectory.  Yeah, yeah, we get the human resources perspective – a perspective highly divorced from any reality of the working world.  But does it seem to you that something has gone awry with the allocation of job titles?  From Director of Pens to Director of Reporting to “Rug Hooker” (ok, I had to throw that really random title in). What about the ubiquitous title of <i>Analyst – </i>you’ve got your business analysts, product analysts, intelligence analysts, systems analysts, management analysts, information analysts, and a host of other “fill-in-the-blank” analysts? Who gets labeled an analyst, and for that matter are there non-analysts?  Is there someone out there whose specific job description says, “No analysis required”?  I’d like to think most jobs require some analytical thinking. Of course, looking at the news these days, there seems to be evidence that analytical thinking is not as abundant in the wild as one might hope.</p>
<p>Globally, we have seen changes in certain job titles that reflect either political correctness, attempts to boost self-esteem and collective rights, or attempts to legitimize certain fields.  For instance, we have seen the job title change from <i>stewardess</i> to <i>flight attendant</i>.  In essence, the term &#8220;<em>stewardess</em>&#8221; evolved into the gender-neutral &#8220;<em>flight attendant.”  </em><em>Interestingly, in 1912 the first flight attendant was a male by the name of </em><i>Heinrich Kubis </i>from Germany. Two decades later, the first female flight attendant (stewardess) was a 25-year-old registered nurse named Ellen Church hired by United Airlines in 1930.  Afterwards, female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role; with that being one of the career paths seen as “legitimate” for women.  Nowadays, we are just as likely to see a male as a female flight attendant.  I assume the old rules about a stewardess being an unmarried woman, less than 118 pounds (somehow I doubt this had to do with the physics of lifting a lot of weight of the ground), and around 5 foot 4 inches tall, are no longer in effect, much to the dismay of some  frequent business travelers.</p>
<p>In a different field, in the late 1970s, the word &#8220;prostitute&#8221; morphed into the term &#8220;sex worker&#8221;.  The terms &#8216;sex work&#8217; and &#8216;sex worker&#8217; were adopted by sex workers themselves to redefine commercial sex, not as a social or psychological descriptor of a type or class of women, but as an income-generating activity or form of employment for both women and men. Now, every time I hear someone use the phrase prostitute, I physically flinch.  Although the use of the term “commercial sex worker” has permeated our social consciousness, the phrase prostitute is still much more readily used and accepted. In non-profit organizations concerned with social justice and health, commercial sex worker is the phrase du jour, but the linguistic influence of non-profits on the overall societal vernacular is limited.</p>
<p>Speaking of non-profits, in the non-profit world where you cannot bestow much in terms of financial compensation, managers oftentimes go overboard in the anointment of positions through grand, abstract titles. Yes, numerous titles resounding with grand import worthy of a royal court are bestowed as a way of mollifying the middle management masses, when financial compensation is hard to come by.  Of course, you also have this issue to some extent in the corporate world where you have countless senior Vice Presidents of this and that. While a Vice President in a non-profit is high up on the hierarchy, in the corporate world they are one of many, but are fairly well financially compensated.  The VP in the non-profit world can get power but not much in terms of financial compensation. See, the VP in a non-profit (and there is often only one, as opposed to the corporate stables of VP’s) is an executive officer ranking immediately below a president who oftentimes may serve in the president&#8217;s place under certain circumstances.  A senior VP in a for-profit corporation may not, and may be one of many VP’s vying for the attention of the higher-ups.</p>
<p>But let’s go back to the non-profit world and examine the title of <i>program coordinator</i> in two different non-profits. In one, this individual is essentially a program director, coordinating the program’s implementation according to a vision and mission.  In another, this individual is the person that handles logistics such as travel arrangements, calling participants and other essentially administrative tasks. Two very different functions, but nonetheless the same title.  Such individuals may even interact with each other across agencies for the coordination of client services and linkages, but their interaction can be impacted by their differing agency functions and thus they may not fully understand each other’s role or authority in the transaction.  The power individuals may seek through the use of their titles is somewhat weakened when there is no uniformity.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different scenario. In a small non-profit of less than 50 people, you can at times have up to 20 “directors” along with 5 senior executives. Meaning, that 50% of an agency may be classified as middle or senior management.  In such a scenario, what does it even mean to be a director or middle management? Is this akin to being in Middle Earth in a constant struggle to control the world?  Imagine what these Middle Earth, Director Meetings look like with all the Midlings sitting at an oval table fighting over the distribution of toilet paper and pens.  They are all fighting over this distribution system because many of them, although called directors, direct no one other than themselves.  The most ambiguous is when you have a Director of Strategy.  I have seen rising use of this title across many agencies.  Every time I picture a Director of Strategy at a meeting I imagine a <i>Bay of Pigs</i> situation about to ensue: you know, a groupthink environment being led by the anointed visionary strategist&#8211;what could possibly go wrong?  You’re trying to figure out how to reach a population and provide services.  You end up invading Poland.</p>

<p>So, besides <i>Middle Earth-style</i> fights and strategic <i>Bay of Pigs</i> scenarios what are the other perils of over-inflated job titles? Yes, titles are valued by employees and are important for many internal and external reasons. So, they seem like a really perfect give-away come annual review time. If you can’t give a raise, give an inflated title away.  Hell, make up a title that is so abstract that no one can quite figure out what the person really does but it sounds cool.  That is bound to make an underpaid employee happy, right?  People want and value job titles and that supposedly costs the company nothing.  But there is indeed a price to pay.</p>
<p>How can an office even function when titles can lead to burgeoning egos and job inflation?  And it leads to a world inside the organization where people are fighting over seemingly ridiculous title issues and not so ridiculous title issues such as who is seemingly in charge of the team and who gets to fire unproductive staff.  In that vein, how do you even determine someone is unproductive when their title is completely abstract?  If your job title is “Odd Jobs”, who is to say you have not been productive?  Yes, supposedly there are job descriptions that you hold people to, but you have to wonder about those accompanying descriptions&#8211;Those too are oftentimes abstract to the point of meaningless.  Nobody does everything on their job description and many do far more.  Plus, you always have that ubiquitous catch-all phrase “other duties as assigned.” You could be hired as an executive assistant, and asked to design furniture under the rubric of “other duties”.  Furthermore, the first time you make an unworthy promotion through an abstract title assignment, all the people who were already at that other level feel devalued. In all, this over-inflation of titles will lead to the tyranny of over inflated Middle Earth egos!  And, we all know what happens then: we get obsessed with those ever-so “precious” titles.  Ah, So bright that title&#8230; so beautiful.. that title. ah, so Precious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been reading sad books. Books about sad people. While I was reading Suzanne Scanlon’s <i>Promising Young Women</i> (which I reviewed <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/164646-promising-young-women-by-suzanne-scanlon/">here</a>), I was rereading <i>Two Girls, Fat and Thin</i> by Mary Gaitskill, and at this point in my life I must have reread it five or six times. It’s always a bad idea for me to read this book—I’m always in a funk for a week after, sometimes longer, or perhaps but now it’s just lodged itself somewhere inside me and each time I reread it it’s like lighting a match. <i>Two Girls</i> is about two girls, but it’s also about gender war(s), heterosexuality as violence. Chris Kraus writes about wanting to solve heterosexuality before turning 40 in <i>I Love Dick</i> but I feel like every conversation with single straight women friends over beer is an attempt to solve heterosexuality, and after a few drinks the solution is simple: Drink some more or dance; failing that, overthrow the patriarchy and end heterosexuality (somehow).</p>
<p>But what do I know?</p>
<p>It’s just that when I walk around this city I wonder if it makes sense to talk of the Neoliberal Heterosexual Couple. Gym-toned bodies, “tasteful” dressing (“Keep it classy!”—I fucking hate this fucking ubiquitous phrase), identical cannot-be-arsed-about-anything-except-ourselves faces. The couple that won’t let go of each other’s hands even in a crowded walkway; not so much because they’re so In Love and cannot bear to let each other go, but because they have so much contempt for everyone around them who is not-them; contempt written on their faces. Handholding as a weapon, maybe, handholding as a contemptuous gesture. I mean, not being able to step aside, even for a second, for an elderly lady with her shopping bags. The Couple as a Fuck-You-to-the-World might have been a romantic idea at a certain point in time, or even a form of resistance against the status quo, maybe? But now just a part of the obnoxious status quo.</p>
<p>But what do I know? I am single and bitter. (Maggie Nelson, in <i>Bluets</i>: “I have been trying, for some time now, to find dignity in my loneliness. I have been finding this hard to do.”)</p>
<p>And no doubt dying to get married, as various members of the “older generation” have implied to me over the last year. Not even a question, “Do you want to get married?” No. They just <i>know</i> that you need to get married because if you do not you will rot and die. I bumped into an old acquaintance of my father’s a few days ago, while I was with my sister, and among the things he said to me after not having seen me for close to twenty years (I didn’t even recognise him!) was the ever-reliable, “You should get married and take care of your family.” It was the last bit that puzzled me, this idea that I could not be otherwise taking care of my family if I was not married. But it’s not a puzzle really; Tamil people everywhere are on autopilot when it comes to giving Life Advice to wayward young (and not-so-young) women doing horrible things with their lives like being unmarried, cutting their hair short, and wearing red lipstick. GET MARRIED&gt; MAKE THE BABIES&gt; TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY BY MAKING MORE BABIES&gt; YOUR MOTHER IS WORRIED</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>Overthrow the patriarchy. End matrimony. (I shouted, in my head, while smiling vaguely into the distance while this man gave me free life advice. Oh, the smile, how it makes you fucking complicit.)</p>
<p>Thinking about singleness and marriage, stewing over it, often means that I start thinking about beauty. Because it’s beauty that I’m struggling with at this point in time. That is, I lack it, but this is not news to me; when I say “this point in time”, I mean that at this point in life as I know it, it seems that <i>everything</i> is the exterior, that the image is you, and you are nothing but the image. (<i>This day in Capitalism it was discovered there is no there, there.</i>) Romance is a marketplace, and you are one of the many images on sale, and if you’re not the right image you are, essentially, shit. “Never before has society demanded as much proof of submission to an aesthetic ideal, or as much body modification, to achieve physical femininity,” says Virginie Despentes in <i>King Kong Theory</i> and I’m suspicious of the phrases here—“never before”—“society demanded”—yet this sentence rings with truth, for me, and perhaps for other (cis, straight) women who are single and wanting (yearning? dying for?) a connection with someone else that isn’t predicated on aesthetic ideals, all of us who identify as “normal-looking” or “not beautiful” or whatever-</p>
<blockquote><p>“What if the self-commodification of individuals is all-encompassing, as the analysis of the job market suggests? What if there is no longer a gap between an internal realm of desires,   wants and fantasies and the external presentation of oneself as a sexual being? If the image is the reality?”</p>
<p>“Objectification implies that there is something left over in the subject that resists such a capture, that we might protest if we thought someone was trying to deny such interiority, but it’s not clear that contemporary work allows anyone to have an inner life in the way that we might once have understood it.”</p>
<p>-Nina Power, <i>One Dimensional Woman</i></p></blockquote>
<p>What if the outside is all we have left?</p>
<p>When I talk about beauty I don’t know what I’m talking about, particularly if I’m also talking about desire, and I want to talk about beauty without talking about Plato or Kant (I just can’t with Kant), and I know <i>for a fact</i> that desire is a <a href="desire%20a%20colonized%20space">colonised space</a>.</p>
<p>“We speak, act, think, behave, and micro-manage ourselves and others according to the “score” that is the general intellect—in short, the protocols or grammar of capital,” Jonathan Beller <a href="http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/beller.php">reminds us</a>. Love in the Time of Capital. Yes, okay, I tell myself I know how to grasp this intellectually, but the bigger fear is that this is the only way I know how to love: according to the protocols of capital.</p>
<p><a href="http://calloutqueen.tumblr.com/post/17225575658/arent-simple-desires-dead-yet-are-we-still-so">“Aren’t simple desires dead yet? Are we still so obsessed with the hegemonic body?”</a></p>
<p>/</p>
<p>I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_of_Siam"><i>Love of Siam</i></a> a few weeks ago and cried all the way through it, and after it was over, cried some more, and felt like I couldn’t understand myself—why all these tears? And the movie is a “tear-jerker”, in a sense, in the vein of Asian family dramas that are a blend of realism and melodrama, and so it wasn’t unexpected that a person watching it would cry. But it’s also a film that’s unabashedly pro-love. And as soon as I write that I know it sounds silly—what does it even mean? But I guess it means what it is: it’s a film about love, and not just the “provocative” aspect of young gay love between two Thai adolescent boys that’s highlighted in all the promotional reviews of the film, but also about all the banal and taken-for-granted forms of love between friends and family, the kind that is familiar to me because the families and the communities in <i>Love of Siam</i> remind me a little of what I knew growing up in Malaysia, of how I came to understand the intersection of multiple identities. The differences between these (often conflicting) identities&#8211;of discovering one’s queerness, of being a son of an alcoholic, of being a brother, a friend, a grandson, a pop star, a boyfriend—aren’t reified; one identity doesn’t trump the other, and it makes no sense to speak of <i>Love of Siam</i> as a movie only about romantic love or gay love. <i>I contain multitudes, </i>said some American poet and everyone went ooooh, but come on, Asian people have known this forever.</p>
<p><a href="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/love-of-siam-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" title="love of siam 1" alt="" src="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/love-of-siam-1.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>But a big part of this movie is about love between these two boys, Mew and Tong, and it’s the genius of the movie (the result perhaps of the direction and the casting decision to go with two young, relatively inexperienced actors), that the love between these two boys feels so organic and unforced, an entirely surprising yet predictable outcome of shared moments and the pull of desire. Looks are not the currency, eroticism isn’t purchased or a choice<a title="" href="#_edn1">[i]</a>; love happens because two people like each other so much, and the question of attraction—sexual or otherwise—is not absent or glossed over so much as it is depicted <i>whole</i>. Mew and Tong are attracted to each other because they’re drawn to each other as people containing multitudes, not because they possess an alluring physicality; not once does anyone tell the other “You’re hot” or “You’re sexy” and I don’t know if I’m regressing or blossoming into full-blown prudedom, but it was so fucking refreshing I don’t even know how to talk about it. I recognise that a lot of the movie’s dialogue and scenes are necessarily circumscribed by the cultural norms in which it was made—in this case, Thai society and Thai censors—but it’s astonishing how much is and was conveyed through looks and faces, and tenderness and understanding. So much of how we understand romance these days is mediated through this narrative of consumerism: “I’m worth it”, “You’re worth it”, “I deserve the best”, “You’re hot”, “I like a nice smile and nice tits”, “I need a man who’s all man, you know what I mean?” All these standards that we think arrive fully-formed in our heads without any external influence, all these principles of picking and choosing The Right One, of having control and autonomy—this movie sort of chips away at those assumptions very quietly and tenderly. The camera loves its subjects; the film loves its characters. The act of loving reveals the love.</p>
<p>But talking about how it’s not a choice doesn’t simply mean that love is something that chooses you. It’s a convenient poetic fiction, and poets and writers and artists talk about it this way all the time, and I fall for the force of that fiction: <i>It wasn’t my choice, I can’t help who I fall in love with.</i> In order for that to happen there has to be an “I” who stands outside of economic, political, social, and cultural influences. So maybe part of my love of <i>Love of Siam</i> is a desire to want to believe in that fiction again. I don’t know though: everything I just wrote down, I believe and don’t believe. Love is attachment, so maybe love <i>is</i> a kind of choice or decision to allow oneself to like/become attracted to a person who is close to you (literally, in the sense that the other person is physically present, as opposed to, say, an image on a dating site; also, figuratively in the sense of a mental and emotional connection based on shared moments, experiences, conversations, and silences that constitute <i>shared time<a title="" href="#_edn2"><b>[ii]</b></a></i>). Mew and Tong turned inward, toward each other, and it was love. But the movie didn’t require them to turn <i>away</i> from other people, or from life itself. (Although there were necessarily moments where they retreated from life, from people, pulled away and stood aside in order to stand beside each other. But it wasn’t a mode of being, this retreat from life. Their love isn’t about making an investment in coupledom as the only form of solace in a difficult world.)</p>
<p>Similar to the points Elaine Castillo <a href="http://www.pankmagazine.com/pankblog/young-bright-things/notes-on-watching-asif-kapadias-senna-2010/">makes about <i>Senna</i></a>, another movie that moved me in an almost forceful way, <i>Love of Siam</i> is in love with faces—long close-ups of faces dominate throughout. The camera lingers tenderly, lovingly, on faces. I watched it online where the sound and subtitles were off-time; characters would say things before the audio and subtitles kicked in, and although it’s one of the most agonising ways to watch a movie, I kept watching because once I watched the first ten minutes I was hooked. I had to closely watch and observe the faces to understand what was going on before the subtitles arrived to provide the language with which to make sense of these faces. The camera follows their faces slowly and closely, and because the two actors in the lead roles were so <i>young</i>, and almost naïve, watching their faces is a kind of heartbreak. The close-ups of Mew and Tong’s faces are also meant to reveal how much they want to look at <i>each other</i>. The frequency with which they simply look at each other is astonishing; astonishing in the sense that it’s unashamed and assertive. (Here I think about Nicholas Mirzoeff’s <i>The Right to Look</i>, and what it means that two queer Asian boys claim this right so forcefully and tenderly.) I also think about Kelly Oliver’s “The Look of Love”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A loving look becomes the inauguration of &#8220;subjectivity&#8221; without subjects or objects. In <i>Etre Deux</i>, Irigaray suggests that the loving look involves all of the senses and refuses the separation between visible and invisible. A body in love cannot be fixed as an object. The look of love sees the invisible in the visible; both spiritual and carnal, the look of love is of &#8220;neither subject nor object”.</p>
<p>Irigaray&#8217;s suggestions about the possibility of loving looks turn Sartre&#8217;s or Lacan&#8217;s anti-social gaze into a look as the circulation of affective psychic energy. The gaze does not have to be a harsh or accusing stare. Rather, affective psychic energy circulates through loving looks. Loving looks nourish and sustain the psyche, the soul, as well as the body. Irigaray&#8217;s formulation of the loving look as an alternative to the objectifying look, and her reformulation of recognition beyond domination through love, suggest that the ethical and political power of love can be used to overcome oppression.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/love-of-siam-21.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1504" title="love of siam 2" alt="" src="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/love-of-siam-21.png?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>There is no happy ending in <i>Love of Siam</i>, though. Nothing is “resolved”. Life goes on and love adjusts its proportions to let life pass through. Love is the vessel and life rushes in to fill it. “If we can love someone so much, how will we be able to handle it one day when we are separated? And if being separated is a part of life, and you know about separation well, is it possible that we can love someone and never be afraid of losing them? Or is it possible that we can live our entire life without loving at all?” Mew asks Tong, and it’s a question that isn’t answered. “Now that we’re grown up, loneliness seems so much worse,” says Mew, and it’s true, and the movie doesn’t rush to fill the loneliness with love. Rather, it suggests that love doesn’t replace that fundamental sense of aloneness, much less transcend it. In the end, Mew and Tong don’t end up together as A Couple, and Tong tells Mew, “I can’t be with you as your boyfriend. But that does not mean I don’t love you.”</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Maggie Nelson, in <i>Bluets</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>238. I want you to know, if you ever read this, there was a time when I would rather have had you by my side than any one of these words; I would rather have had you by my side than all the blue in the world.</p>
<p>239. But now you are talking as if love were a consolation. Simone Weil warned otherwise. “Love is not consolation,” she wrote. “It is light.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Like when Courtney Love sings in “Malibu”, “I can’t be near you, the light just radiates”.</p>
<p>No happy endings in sight.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>When I think about <i>Senna</i>, too, I think it’s a film about love. It feels like it was made with so much love, and it’s also a movie that’s in love with its subject, a subject who’s not afraid to love his life’s work, the people who matter to him, God. I love that Masha Tupitsyn focuses on what is, for me, <a href="http://mashatupitsyn.tumblr.com/post/14531963363/i-the-writing-on-the-wall">the most moving scene</a> in <i>Senna</i>: that brief moment between Senna and his father, which she describes here:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the scene where Senna wins the Brazilian Grand Prix in 1991 (after he won the race, Senna actually passed out, so great was the anguish of his ecstasy. Victory.), he suffers unbearable shoulder pain from the tremendous stress of the race. He is literally pulled out of the race car and driven off the track. He can barely move. But when Senna sees his father, he calls over to him, “Dad, come here. Come here.” His father hesitates, but Senna insists. “Come here. Come <em>here</em>! Touch me <em>gently</em>,” he orders. His father, much taller, stands beside his son, as Senna rests his head against his father’s chest for a moment. When he starts to walk back, Senna tells everyone else (even before anyone actually touches him; even if no one is trying to touch him at all), “Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!” He commands everyone but his father to get away from him. This scene, which is the difference between <em>touch me gently</em> and <em>don’t touch me at all</em>, between everyone else and you, between a son and his father, beloved and not-beloved, can also be read as a love story.</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever a moment could be charged with love, a love so rarely seen on screen in its rawness and vulnerability—the love between father and son—it was this. I think I scrunched my eyes a little when I watched that scene, I wanted to keep looking and then I looked away, mostly because I wanted to cry (tears! again!) because watching felt like I was looking right into a bright light.</p>
<p>Being a witness to love can often feel like an affirmation of something (of what? something you had but lost?), but more often it feels like a wound. Late-capitalist society doesn&#8217;t tend wounds; it just looks for ways to avoid it and move on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/senna-mother.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1505 aligncenter" title="senna mother" alt="" src="http://disquietblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/senna-mother.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<div>
<hr />
<div>
<p><a title="" href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> There is one scene that involves a kiss. The camera doesn’t intrude; it pulls back, and then goes a little closer, but maintains a respectful distance—this kiss isn’t for the benefit of an audience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><a title="" href="#_ednref2">[ii]</a> Which makes me think of this: <a href="http://likeafieldmouse.tumblr.com/post/33874562265/felix-gonzalez-torres-perfect-lovers-1987-91">http://likeafieldmouse.tumblr.com/post/33874562265/felix-gonzalez-torres-perfect-lovers-1987-91</a> What if lovers are not in-time? “We conquered fate by meeting at a certain TIME in a certain space. We are a product of the time, therefore we give back credit where it is due: time.” And yet—as if it can ever be that simple—“[A]s military time has become militarized time over the past few years, time itself, what is defined as ‘my’ time, has ceased to exist in any meaningful way. We are in the time of service.” How does <a href="http://gukira.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/timely-service/">militarised time</a> shape how we love? What is the neoliberal couple in service of?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it might be fun to take a word we hear often enough and consider its history. I&#8217;m reading <em>An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America</em>, by Henry Wiencek. On page 157, Wiencek discusses being ruled with an &#8220;arbitrary sway&#8221; and how &#8220;that could turn a proud, independent man into a <strong>toady</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/blue-hat-toad.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-567" title="blue hat toad" alt="" src="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/blue-hat-toad.jpg?w=150&#038;h=122" height="122" width="150" /></a>I stopped reading at that point and wondered how in the world an amphibious term morphed into something derogatory. When I think of &#8220;toady,&#8221; other synonyms come to mind: boot licker; flunky; lackey; teacher&#8217;s pet; brown noser&#8230;the list goes on and on, and none of those terms are flattering.</p>
<p>Turns out we have to head back to the late 1500s to learn the answer to the riddle of how toads came to be viewed with derision. Back then, all toads were considered extremely poisonous in a &#8220;touch-them-and-die&#8221; kind of way, and trust a snake oil salesman to get on stage and come up with a way to exploit the public&#8217;s fear.</p>
<p>At markets and exhibitions, the unscrupulous salesman would have his assistant pretend to eat a toad. Horrified onlookers would gasp and cringe, certain that the hapless assistant was on a fast track to imminent doom.</p>
<p>But wait! The assistant might be gasping on the stage, clutching his throat and <a href="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/snake-oil2.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-570" title="snake-oil" alt="" src="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/snake-oil2.jpeg?w=126&#038;h=150" height="150" width="126" /></a>breathing his last, but the salesman had just the thing in his bag of tricks. Out came a bottle of snake oil, sold by the gallon to unsuspecting fairgoers, now assured that with a few gulps, their homeward journey was safe. No need to fear the gangs of toads leaping from behind trees to accost weary travelers! Whew!</p>
<p>The salesman&#8217;s toad-eating apprentice was called, aptly enough, a &#8220;toadeater.&#8221; Often, these assistants were young, and some were mentally challenged, which, at that time, meant they were objects of contempt, fit only for the lowest jobs. They served the needs of the snake oil salesman with their toad-eating behavior.</p>
<p>See where this went? <em>Toadeaters </em>were viewed with scorn, and over time, the term was shortened to <em>toady</em>, meaning anyone who served another with their behavior. Today, we consider a toady to be someone who sucks up, who behaves in a fawning manner. Not a good thing.</p>
<div id="attachment_574" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 156px"><a href="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/toad-cottage1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-574" title="toad cottage" alt="" src="http://dmswriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/toad-cottage1.jpg?w=146&#038;h=150" height="150" width="146" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">toadilytoads.com</p></div>
<p>Thankfully, we&#8217;ve reached Toad Enlightenment, and the little critters no longer frighten the way they used to 500 years ago. I did a little research and learned that toads are prolific pest eaters, and their presence is desired by some gardeners. I even found a website that sells toad houses, little clay things that look like charming English cottages. Line up a bunch in your garden and start your own Toad Subdivision!</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t be a toady.</p>

Does anyone still care about the Miami Herald other than the people who work there? The father of Fiver is the editor, and he thinks it is &#8220;one of the half-dozen-or-so most important newspapers in the United States&#8221; in an era when the era of newspapers has passed.</p>
<p>The Miami nightclub is named &#8220;Balzac&#8217;s,&#8221; after another Wolfe preoccupations. There is a prurient mention of girls who &#8220;were wearing denim shorts with the belt lines down perilously close to the mons veneris and the pants legs cut off up to. . . here . . .&#8221; Has anyone in the U.S. <em>ever</em> used the term mons veneris, outside of Tom Wolfe and medical schools? I think it appeared in <em>I am Charlotte Simmons</em> a couple of times too, and there it was even more improbable. And the word loins! In this case, &#8220;juicy little loins and perfect little cupcake bottoms.&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard loins described as loins before, but only by Tom Wolfe and the writers of the Bible. Someone born more recently than 1931 would use &#8220;pussy&#8221; if they wanted to be crude, &#8220;va jay jay&#8221; if they wanted to be hipster, or &#8220;vagina&#8221; if they wanted clinical directness. But not loins. No one but Tom Wolfe would use loins, and use it again and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes writers working out variations on ideas that iterate subtly book by book can work—Elmore Leonard is a good example. Others just feel like they&#8217;re repeating themselves. When <em>I am Charlotte Simmons</em> came out, I was in college and skipped class to read it, only to feel an increasing sense of disappointment with the wrongness of many scenes—like Charlotte feeling nervous about the cost of long distance calls. That was an anachronism. Most college students had free long distance by 2004. I would&#8217;ve let anyone who asked use my phone to call home. Or, for another example of reportorial wrongness, Charlotte gets a salvaged, pieced-together computer, like a salvaged car. By 2004, however, older but working computers were $25 on Craigslist, or outright given away by schools. These two examples are salient, but there were others, just as <em>I am Charlotte Simmons</em> repeated words, phrases, and ideas from Wolfe&#8217;s earlier books. It, and <em>Back to Blood</em>, repeatedly describe moments of cowardly prurience, with men likes wolves and women who didn&#8217;t want it or didn&#8217;t want to want it and submitted to it only reluctantly, like a female character from the 19th century and not at all like many of the contemporary women I know.</p>
<p><strong>The period details </strong> in <em>Back to Blood</em> are wrong. Today, anyone cool would be driving a Tesla Roadster, or Fisker Karma, not a Ferrari 403; Ferraris might&#8217;ve been cool twenty years ago, but technology and culture have moved on. Then there&#8217;s the simply and wildly improbable: a French professor named Lantier thinks of his daughter that she wasn&#8217;t ready for &#8220;snobbery&#8221; because &#8220;She was at the age, twenty-one, when a girl&#8217;s heart is filled to the brim with charity and love for the little people.&#8221; Someone exposed to live students every semester is unlikely to think of their hearts as &#8220;filled to the brim with charity and love&#8221; for much of anything, except perhaps alcohol, condoms, iPhones, verbing nouns, and obsessive Facebooking. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with those things, but familiarity is a great slayer of illusions like Lantier&#8217;s belief about the hearts of most 21-year-old girls.</p>
<p><em>Back to Blood</em> isn&#8217;t a bad book, but it has the same but lesser strengths of the earlier novels, with the same but exaggerated weaknesses of them. We&#8217;re told, not shown, that &#8220;Mac was an exemplar of the genus WASP in a moral and cultural sense,&#8221; without knowing why, if at all, that&#8217;s important. We&#8217;re told a lot of things, most of them not especially new if we&#8217;re familiar with the Wolfe oeuvre.</p>
<p>There are clever moments, as when Magdalena, in a fight with her Spanish-speaking mother (or, in Wolfe-land, Mother), resorts &#8220;to the E-bomb: English.&#8221; It&#8217;s a moment of geriatric cruelty, since &#8220;Her mother had no idea what colloquially meant. Magdalena didn&#8217;t, either, until not all that many nights ago when Norman used it and explained it to her. Her mother might know hang and possibly even slang, but the hang of slang no doubt baffled her, and the expression clueless was guaranteed to make her look the way she did right now, which is to say, clueless.&#8221; It&#8217;s clever, and the kind of cleverness that makes the scene fresh and unusual. It&#8217;s also the kind of cleverness missing in repeated references to the mons verneris, or to loins, or to high-end private schools.</p>
<p>Wolfe also gets and has gotten for decades the weirdness and power of modern media; its spotlight is restless yet powerful, and it plays a tremendous role in <em>Bonfire</em>. In <em>Back to Blood</em>, Nestor Camacho, a Miami cop, rescues a refugee from the mast of a ship and is recorded doing it; consequently, he becomes momentarily famous, such that: &#8220;Even now, at the midnight hour, the sun shone &#8217;round about him.&#8221; The analogizing of fame to light seems obvious, even necessary, and although I don&#8217;t want to probe its deeper properties here I like how Wolfe avoids the spotlight metaphor, much as I didn&#8217;t a few sentences ago. Wolfe uses metaphor in an almost 19th Century fashion, usually effectively.</p>
<p>He gets the way civic booster types think of the arts not as a thing in and of themselves, but as a checkbox; an editor at the Miami Herald thinks that &#8220;Urban planners all over the country were abuzz with this fuzzy idea that that every &#8216;world-class&#8217; city—world class was another au courant term—must have a world class cultural destination. Cultural referred to the arts. . . in the form of a world-class art museum&#8221; {Wolfe &#8220;Blood&#8221;@111}. He&#8217;s right, of course, but right in a generic way, like people are right about love being like a rose. If you&#8217;ve read anything about urban planning, or cities (and I have), you won&#8217;t be surprised at the editor&#8217;s knowledge, which he probably picked up in the same places I did, and which says very little about him as a character, exception that he, like so many Wolfe characters, is an information and status receptacle more than he is a person with his own needs and desires.</p>
<p><strong>The complaint expressed throughout this post</strong> is similar to but a bit <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/10/15/121015crbo_books_wood?currentPage=all">different than James Woods&#8217;</a>, which concerns how Wolfe&#8217;s characters tend to speak in similar or identical registers, despite coming from wildly different backgrounds. That isn&#8217;t <em>necessarily</em> a weakness, but the verisimilitude of the characters must be maintained in novels that portray such startlingly different people in a similar register; that&#8217;s what <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em> does and what <em>Back to Blood</em> doesn&#8217;t, quite. The earlier novel also doesn&#8217;t feel reported even if it was reported; the latter does, in the same way <em>I am Charlotte Simmons</em> misses the college milieu in a thousand subtle ways. If you swing, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you miss the ball by a millimeter or a meter. The scrim of realism is pierced and the novel doesn&#8217;t quite work.</p>
<p>Wood also says that &#8220;Wolfe isn’t interested in ordinary life. Ordinary life is complex, contradictory, prismatic. Wolfe’s characters are never contradictory, because they have only one big emotion, and it is lust—for sex, money, power, status.&#8221; But this isn&#8217;t quite true: Wolfe is interested in ordinary life when it&#8217;s touched by big events, or ordinary life when its inhabitants have a powerful yearning for something other than ordinary life. That yearning, that drive, can be fascinating. Plus, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with writing about extraordinary life, which can be as fascinating, &#8220;complex, contradictory, prismatic.&#8221; Wood obviously isn&#8217;t making this argument, and I doubt he would make it in the kind of caricature I&#8217;m making it here, but it&#8217;s easy to draw this kind of false lesson from the <em>Back to Blood</em> review. Almost every Wood review is a momentary master class in the novel as a genre, which is why so many writers and would-be writers attend so carefully to them, and why it&#8217;s worth appending this brief commentary to a review that in some ways is more useful and interesting than the impressively hyped novel being discussed.</p>
<p><em>Back to Blood</em> is drawing on capital built up from Wolfe&#8217;s earlier novels, and overall it leaves a sense of &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&#8221; If another Wolfe novel appears, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m likely to be fooled again. There are better novels about the state of America—Gillian Flynn&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gone-Girl-Novel-Gillian-Flynn/dp/030758836X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Gone Girl</a></em> is one—even if they don&#8217;t announce themselves as tomes about the state of America. Given how the voices of <em>Back to Blood</em> don&#8217;t quite work and the book-report function doesn&#8217;t quite work, there are probably better uses of one&#8217;s reading time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 121px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_ribbon.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="A light blue ribbon is the symbol for prostate..." alt="A light blue ribbon is the symbol for prostate..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7c/Blue_ribbon.jpg" height="200" width="111" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A light blue ribbon is the symbol for prostate cancer (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>This whole run-up to surgery is becoming very tiring.  Not only is there a waiting period to allow my biopsied prostate to calm down, but now I have pre-op testing, a bowel cleansing, filling out forms that ask the very same questions that are already in my records and the very idea that my prostate will be removed by remote control. What&#8217;s a poor boy to do?</p>
<p>What I have concluded is that I need to return to my core, I need to sit quietly, do those things that I must do to take care of myself and the others around me, but mostly sit quietly and let this very moment be at the center.  I decided to not look at my calendar or wear a watch so I don&#8217;t have to focus on the future.  That&#8217;s a start, for sure.  But what I do best is think about issues, learn how others think about the same issues and synthesize ideas.  This means I&#8217;ll be reading a lot.  Currently, I am reading <em>Modernity and the Holocaust </em>by Zygmunt Bauman, a powerful postmodern sociological take on how the holocaust follows from the vision of the Enlightenment and modernity and, while not a necessary effect of modernity, it is made possible only by the emphasis of rationality and science combined with unchecked political power and a bureaucracy that is efficiently geared to cost effective problem solving.</p>
<p>My core understanding of how life actually works centers on the very notion that all that is real is this very moment, already past.  The idea of the future being nothing more than the projection of goals or desires and the past being nothing more than a trace existing only as a memory that fades as the moment moves further away from the very moment of the present.  Given that central idea, I believe that it is easier to close the door on projecting into the future.</p>
<p>I am also bolstered by the very idea that I will die someday.  That is an unavoidable fact!  There are no vampires, zombies or other beings that are immortal in spite of the fantastic story telling of novelists and Hollywood.  The fact of dying has given me an opportunity to measure my life.  In a nutshell, I discovered this simple, yet extraordinary, truth; if I were to die at this very moment I would leave this life with no regrets of any consequence.  Sure, I would regret not seeing the Chicago Cubs win a World Series but this is of little consequence.  Up to this point I have lived a life of which dreams are made.  I worked at a job that I would have done for free, that&#8217;s right, for FREE.  The bonus was that I actually got paid to work at something so interesting and rewarding.</p>
<p>As a middle school teacher, I had the opportunity to influence the lives of hundreds of young, maturing human beings.  As an education professor I had the opportunity to work with future teachers and even watch them as their career unfolded.  Professionally, I published scholarly papers in professional journals, many of which were extensively cited by others, I presented research at scholarly meetings and seminars internationally and, with a colleague, co-authored a book.  During my working years I never felt like I was going to &#8220;work!&#8221;  I can go to the grave knowing that I made a difference in my time on this earth.</p>
<p>None of this means, however, that I intend to go easily.  But my best weapon for fighting my cancer is to focus on this very moment, live my life as it presents itself to me, and do that which needs being done at this very moment.</p>

<p>by Tessa</p>
<p>I&#8217;d finished <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad" target="_blank"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>. The new <a href="http://www.fox.com/new-girl/" target="_blank"><em>New Girl</em> </a>was under Hulu embargo. I watched all of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Apartment23" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217; Trust the B*tch in Apt. 23</em></a> when I visited Rebecca (it counts as bonding, ok?). <a title="10 Reasons You Should Be Watching Make It Or Break It" href="http://crunchingsandmunchings.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/10-reasons-you-should-be-watching-make-it-or-break-it/" target="_blank"><em>Make it Or Break It</em></a> was sadly cut short in its prime. I still am resisting <a title="Spotted: 10 Reasons You Should Watch Gossip Girl" href="http://crunchingsandmunchings.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/spotted-10-reasons-you-should-watch-gossip-girl/" target="_blank"><em>Gossip Girl</em></a> for some reason. What was I to do with my &#8220;turn off the brain&#8221; time?</p>
<p>Then I read an article about <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/suburgatory" target="_blank"><em>Suburgatory</em></a>. Which I can&#8217;t find right now. But it does exist, because it&#8217;s too boring of a reason to make up. I felt compelled to watch it, because A. the girl&#8217;s name is Tessa, and I have to scrutinize all bearers of my name who appear in popular media B. the article compared it to the WB&#8217;s<a href="http://fuckyeahpopularwb.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><em> Popular</em></a>, which I remember liking and should watch again and C. it&#8217;s on ABC which is apparently home to all shows that I will become addicted to.  But what, you may ask, is the particular appeal of this show?</p>
<p><strong>1. A Gilmore Girls-style family pairing</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8171025142"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3024" title="georgentessa" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/georgentessa.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>In no way are Tessa and George fast-talking homebody small-town bffs like Rory and Lorelai, but they are a father and daughter who have grown up with only each other, have their own inside jokes, and, because George has moved Tessa out to the richie-rich suburbs of Chatswin, NY, they have a us-against-the-world vibe going on. It&#8217;s touching to see and a little different than some of the nuclear family stuff or blended family stuff you see on sitcoms.</p>
<p><strong>2. Suburb satire</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3022" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 330px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8171023298/in/photostream/"><img class="size-full wp-image-3022" title="chatswincaf" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/chatswincaf.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The cafeteria offerings.</p></div>
<p>Everyone in Chatswin is obliviously ridiculous and the set designers and writers aren&#8217;t afraid to go over the top, while keeping everyone human.  After all, we&#8217;re supposed to see why Tessa feels like she&#8217;s an alien but also see how she can get used to the Chatswin bubble. So the water fountain in the school has fresh lemons and limes in its holding tank, and prime rib and sushi for lunch. There ends up being a pet kangaroo for one of the characters. Dallas, the lonely wife who commissions a skylight from George only to become his first new Chatswin friend and a strange kind of mother figure for Tessa, opens up a store that sells only crystal, as in blocks of crystal etched with portraits of loved ones, crystal chef hats, and crushed crystal called &#8220;Tears from Heaven.&#8221; The Halloween episode this season is about &#8220;The Witch of Chatswin&#8221; who ends up just being&#8230; a feminist.  And the bumbling, self-absorbed, but genuinely enthusiastic guidance counselor, Mr. Wolfe, comes out to the student body by saying something like &#8220;I&#8217;m gay, which means I will now be driving a Mazda Miata.&#8221; I think the best part about the absurdity of Chatswin is that it&#8217;s not all in your face suburb satire all the time. It comes out in one-off jokes and sub-main plotlines, and no one reacts to it except for Tessa and George, which heightens the feeling that this is real life for these people.  It doesn&#8217;t stop to explain itself and that&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p><strong>3. A great cast</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8171016862/sizes/n/in/photostream/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3018" title="chrisparnell" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/8171016862_4f36439cfc_n.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Although I think Jane Levy is cute as a button, droll, and good at stomping around like a real teenager, she still seems a little too old to be believable. Luckily, the good attributes outweigh the weirdness, Jeremy Sisto and the other main cast members are great (more on that later), and George and Tessa&#8217;s next door neighbors played by are Ana Gasteyer and Chris Parnell. Jay Mohr plays Dallas&#8217; oft-travelling husband who is mainly worried about shoes being worn in the house while he&#8217;s gone. Mr. Wolfe is played by<a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/03/rex-lee-on-entourage-movie-and-the-piv.html"> Rex Lee from </a><em><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/03/rex-lee-on-entourage-movie-and-the-piv.html">Entourage</a>; </em>I don&#8217;t know if that means anything to anyone but he&#8217;s really funny on this show. Tessa&#8217;s next door neighbor and best friend comes to us from <em>Weeds, </em>and even though I&#8217;m sad to see that she lost her normal body to become thinner and blonder as the seasons progress, she&#8217;s still hilarious and a treat every time she&#8217;s on screen, so it hasn&#8217;t affected her character. And she did just graduate high school (omg) so I shouldn&#8217;t judge at all because bodies are still settling into themselves and forget I said anything.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Jeremy Sisto acting funny.</strong></p>
<p>Sisto has played so many douchey characters that it&#8217;s surprising to see him play a dad. A normal, slightly neurotic single dad who attempts to make his daughter break a date by planning a surprise board game night with her friends.</p>

<p>And it works! Except when he tries to date Alicia Silverstone. I didn&#8217;t buy that at all.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Mean Girls aren&#8217;t really mean.</strong></p>
<p>Dalia, the daughter of Dallas and what passes for Tessa&#8217;s nemesis, is clearly modeled on Paris Hilton, with her blonde hair, eyes ringed with smudgy black eyeshadow, and deadpan delivery of all her lines, often ending with a crisp &#8220;bitch.&#8221;  Her minions are, as so often is the trope, foolish followers. No one, though, is really following them, and no one is really their target. (Except for one instance in the pilot episode, and I think the writers realized their misstep after that).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8171019374/in/photostream/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3019" title="dallas" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dallas.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Most people at Chatswin High have their own money and social status, which makes for an almost neutral playing field.  We catch glimpses of nerdy characters, but they are clearly preoccupied with their AP classes, and Tessa, who often interacts with and is therefore insulted by Dalia, has too much self-esteem to let it effect her. Dalia&#8217;s insults are more because she has no etiquette or filter between her brain and her mouth, rather than a desire to hurt anyone. If anything, she just wants people to go away because she&#8217;s so solipsistic, not have a crowd of worshipers following her. It&#8217;s kind of refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Awkward neighbor is not really awkward</strong></p>
<p>Lisa might be my favorite character on <em>Suburgatory. </em>She starts out being a flustered girl who wears a cream-color based palate, accented with tiny flowers, bullied by her controlling mother. Early in the first season we have this exchange at the end of a forced neighborly dinner between the Shays and the Altmans:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lisa: May I be excused? I&#8217;m having a terrible time.</p>
<p>George: What about dessert?</p>
<p>Sheila: Lisa can&#8217;t have dessert.</p>
<p>George: Whu-uh, Why not, the sugar?</p>
<p>Sheila: No.</p></blockquote>
<p>But she slowly takes a page from her own mother&#8217;s book and uses it to rebel against her tyrannical reign. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all due to Tessa&#8217;s Manhattan influence. You can just tell that that spark was living inside of Lisa, waiting to start burning. Everything she says has this undercurrent of plotted derangement, and there&#8217;s no episode about how she&#8217;s afraid to get a boyfriend. She just gets one, no angst, and proceeds to gross Tessa out with her PDAs.  (And her boyfriend, Malik, is also a funny character. He&#8217;s mostly a well-rounded dude who is very into the school paper, but is also part of a <em>Medium</em> fan club and will very occasionally be seen to dress like Patricia Arquette.)</p>

<p><strong>7. Cheryl Hines rocks her character, and has the best accent.</strong></p>
<p>Cheryl Hines plays Dallas, and she imbues the stereotype of a bored trophy wife with real charm.  Then she subverts the stereotype by being a happy-go-lucky loon, not at all weighed down by the grim business of beauty. And she has the weirdest accent that is not southern, but sort of is. If a voice could be &#8220;tangy&#8221; that would be Dallas&#8217;s voice. Here&#8217;s the first time we get to hear it:</p>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=1.161" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="photo_id=8171015662&amp;photo_secret=0&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=1.161"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=1.161" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="photo_id=8171015662&amp;photo_secret=0&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" wmode="opaque" height="300" width="400"></embed></object>
<p><strong>8. Alan Tudyk&#8217;s crazy smile.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8170994443"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3023" title="alant" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/alant.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><strong>9. Jane Levy plays a kind of reverse teenage Carrie Bradshaw/Daria/Cady from <em>Mean Girls</em> hybrid and it somehow works.</strong></p>
<p>Ostensibly Jane Levy&#8217;s Tessa is the crux of <em>Suburgatory.</em> It&#8217;s her life that is being upended and her voiceover that delivers the Carrie Bradshaw-like homilies at the end of the episode. As you can tell, though, the show is about much more than Tessa.  Instead of a woman embracing the big city and writing about it, Tessa is forced to embrace the suburbs and live&#8230; about&#8230; it. And instead of being fashion obsessed and finding herself she&#8217;s obsessed with being true to herself and not caring about fashion (her outfits are still cute).  She wears motorcycle boots and skirts and plays the outsider/observer, but she&#8217;s also not so invested in that role that she won&#8217;t become involved in the world of Chatswin. And she&#8217;s not too cool &#8212; in fact, when she goes out of her way to define her coolness it ends up making her look dorky, and that&#8217;s very endearing.  For instance, her favorite band plays at her 16th birthday party and for the first song it&#8217;s just her rocking out on the dance floor, with that face that means that you&#8217;re REALLY FEELING THIS SONG more than ANYONE ELSE, and when a poetry class is being taught by a tattooed teacher, Tessa trips all over herself to try to be the star pupil, creating a monster of a mother poem in the process.</p>
<div id="attachment_3020" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 330px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beuysgirl/8170990899/in/photostream/"><img class="size-full wp-image-3020" title="danceface" alt="" src="http://crunchingsandmunchings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/danceface.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the I&#8217;m Feelin&#8217; It face</p></div>
<p>Which leads me to my last reason&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>10. Because if there&#8217;s going to be a character named Tessa on American TV, I&#8217;m cool with this one.</strong></p>
