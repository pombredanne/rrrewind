According to the study, reports of “wrong-site surgery” are on the rise. To clarify, “wrong-site surgery” occurs when a doctor operates on, say&#8230; Your brain. When he was supposed to operate on, say&#8230; Your big toe. Or someone else.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the next person who mentions Christmas before I taste turkey gets a kick in the jingle bells. It’s not that I’m a Grinch (although my sister, the Christmas Elf, will gladly tell you otherwise). It’s just that my ability to enjoy the Christmas season is inversely proportional to my level of exposure to it. Don’t get me wrong; we have our holiday traditions, and I love them all. The music, the food, the decorations; most of all I will never forget the look on my sister’s face the year I finally slipped the lump of coal into her stocking for a change. But I digress. The point is that these moments are beautiful because they are rare, they are fleeting, and thereby they are magical.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a kid (and I have never felt older than when I typed those words) there seemed to be an understood rule: Christmas didn&#8217;t start until after Thanksgiving. Sure, you might see a few commercials about the big sale at your local department store on Black Friday in the week leading up to Thanksgiving, but it was always in the background, like the siren song of savings before the mad rush of commercialism truly began. First came the parade, Dad would yell at the TV while he watched football all day, then the turkey, and you finished off the night with <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. The next day would come with its marathon of shopping quite soon enough, and Santa’s lap would be waiting all month long for you to whisper your list of impossible desires to be passed on to your long-suffering parents.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, and particularly I&#8217;ve been noticing it in the last yen years, it’s like the stores can’t wait for Christmas to start. They’re worse than the kids. My roommate told me he was in one store, which shall remain nameless (but it rhymes with K-Mart), and they had a Christmas aisle set up already. Oh, I forgot to mention: this was <i>three weeks before Halloween</i>. It was right next to the Halloween aisle; talk about one-stop shopping. I’m surprised they didn&#8217;t have chocolate bunnies out, too.</p>
<p>It can’t be the economy, or trying to lure in the “early shoppers”, because they were doing it before the economy tanked, and there have always been early shoppers (my mother is still finding gifts she “hid” back in August… of 1998). It’s like someone decided to hell with the unspoken rule, and once one person crosses that neutral zone and gets away with it, everyone else jumps on board, and I for one think it’s time we all take a stand. We mock people who leave their Christmas lights up on their homes more than a few weeks into the new year; isn&#8217;t it time we boycott stores that put theirs up more than a few weeks before the holiday? Don’t we deserve a chance to celebrate one holiday at a time?</p>
<p>Am I the only one who has seen <i>Mame</i>? Does no one else know the song “We Need a Little Christmas”? There’s a reason that song resonates, and it’s because Christmas is supposed to be a special time, a time of magic and joy. But to be special, it has to be rare. When Christmas gets pushed back so far that it literally becomes “Christmas in July” as the marketing campaigns of my youth used to say, where’s the magic? Doesn&#8217;t Santa deserve a few months off?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Green is the prime color of the world, and that from which its loveliness arises.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> -Pedro Calderon de la Barca</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is hard to visit Guatemala and not become completely entranced by her greenery. The color green can be found in every place you look- from the verdant terraced farmlands, to the lush fertile peaks of the volcanoes. After a long, cold colorless winter arriving in Green Guatemala almost hurts your eyes and reminds me of the constant rebirth and cycle of life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As I sat in a small café eating lunch yesterday, a man entered with his dog and headed back toward the bathroom, his dog following him. He nodded to me and said &#8220;Que aproveche&#8221; (Bon appetit) as he passed, then waved a vague signal in the general direction of his dog, who then promptly sat down about 6 feet from me. The man continued on his way to the back of the café to the bathtroom, and his un-leashed dog waited patiently for him, occasionally glancing over at me, probably envious of my succulent jamón ibérico. I got to thinking about how normal this whole scene was to me: the stranger telling me to enjoy my meal as he passes me on his way to the bathroom, the dog entering the café unleashed and then sitting patiently for his owner to return&#8230;where am I? When did these things become so normal to me?</div>

</div>
<div><em>**Side note: the manners of the DOGS here is a topic that deserves a post of its own. As <a href="http://meggr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/consejos/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve mentioned before</a>, they&#8217;re not usually on leashes, and they&#8217;re soooo obedient! What kind of dog training programs do they have here that we don&#8217;t?!</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>__</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about differences in what is considered polite and impolite here in Spain and in the States. I started compiling a list a couple weeks ago when <a href="https://twitter.com/MattLeidholm/status/262930325808758785" target="_blank">a friend of mine asked me on Twitter</a> whether it was true that Spanish people say goodbye to each other when leaving an elevator. Yes, that is in fact true, and it really struck me how that had become so normal to me I don&#8217;t even think twice about it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>__</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>So here is my ever-growing list of differences in manners/politeness between the US and Spain:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Say goodbye when you leave an elevator. </strong>I didn&#8217;t find this quite so funny until I was talking about it with my dear friend <a href="working-love.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Jackie</a> the other day and told her that you don&#8217;t actually say &#8220;Adios&#8221; but rather &#8220;Hasta luego&#8221; (See ya later!), as if you have plans to meet up with these strangers again later in this same awkward, claustrophobia-promoting scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Say &#8220;Que aproveche/Buen provecho&#8221; to tables you pass in nicer restaurants.</strong> My roommates also do this at home&#8211; if I&#8217;m eating and they enter the room, they wish me an enjoyable meal. Adorable, no?</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t say hi to or smile at strangers on the street.</strong> They&#8217;ll think you&#8217;ve mistaken them for someone you know, or that you&#8217;re just crazy. The exceptions to this rule are: 1. When you meet strangers on a hiking trail and 2. When you meet strangers in the hallway or entrance to your own apartment. Then it&#8217;s totally cool.</li>
<li><strong>Say hello and goodbye; it&#8217;s kind of a big deal.</strong> After living with a Spanish family this summer and now with Spanish roommates, I&#8217;ve concluded that they&#8217;re much more intent on saying hello and goodbye whenever they come and go, as well as goodnight before retiring to bed and good morning the first time they see you each morning. And the hellos and goodbyes themselves are a bigger production: when you encounter family or friends in the street/restaurant/bar/etc., you give them &#8220;dos besos&#8221; (two kisses) which aren&#8217;t exactly besos, but rather you pull them in, your right hand on their left arm (and them the same to you), and you touch cheeks with them on each side, making a kiss sound. I guess it&#8217;s a pretty intimate greeting/salutation compared to the way most Americans greet each other. It&#8217;s amazing, though, how quickly it becomes normal. Even my American friends and I here greet each other in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your hands on the table</strong>. Last year at a Christmas dinner at the house of some Spanish family friends, I learned that at meals here, it is most polite to keep both hands on the table at all times. This is something I still have to be conscious of almost every time I&#8217;m eating a nice meal here. From a young age, I learned that the proper thing was to keep your non-dominant hand in your lap. It turns out that here (also in France and maybe other parts of Europe), if you don&#8217;t have both hands on the table it signifies that you&#8217;re not really enjoying the meal. But I suspect that, in Spain, it could also have something to do with the fact that you have bread at every meal, and it is to be kept on the table (not the plate) on your non-dominant side. Children are taught that the bread can be used, in the non-dominant hand, like another utensil to soak up the oils or juices from the dish. So in this case you need the dominant hand on the table to be your &#8220;bread hand,&#8221; so to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Get out of the way.</strong> In the US, when we bump into someone we pretty much act like we&#8217;ve fractured their skull: &#8220;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m sorry! I didn&#8217;t see you there!!!&#8221; The return is often just as dramatic: &#8220;No it&#8217;s okay! I&#8217;m fine! I didn&#8217;t see you either!!!&#8221; Oh, so you mean you didn&#8217;t nearly die from me brushing up against your shoulder? Good good good. Well I have to say that here, it&#8217;s the opposite extreme, and I don&#8217;t like that either. People rarely apologize for bumping into you, even if it&#8217;s a pretty good shove. And I still haven&#8217;t figured out who moves aside for who on crowded sidewalks. Younger men will usually move for me, but among women it seems like I always have to be the one to step off the sidewalk onto the street  in a crowd. I guess I get voted off for my foreign-ness.</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Raise your umbrella</strong>. In my 18th non-consecutive month living in rainy Bilbao, I think I&#8217;ve figured out the umbrella-raising codes. <em>*Note: I know this may only be a foreign concept to my fellow North-Dakotans&#8211;not that it doesn&#8217;t rain there, but if it does we just run to our cars or avoid going outside. And in North Dakota you certainly never find yourself in the situation of walking down a crowded street where everyone has an umbrella, so it has been a big learning curve for me.</em> Umbrellas make your space bubble a foot or two wider all the way around, so how do you navigate your much larger diameter through a crowded street? Umbrella-raising. In my experience, there are three simple rules in a head-on umbrella encounter: 1. If you&#8217;re a male, raise your umbrella. 2. If you&#8217;re younger, raise your umbrella. 3. If you&#8217;re taller, raise your umbrella. So being young and tall, I do a lot of umbrella-raising. That&#8217;s okay though, it&#8217;s good for the biceps.</div>
<div></div>
<div>__</div>
<div>Manners are a peculiar thing, and it&#8217;s good to be aware of how different they can be from country to country, culture to culture. Even the most culturally-conscious of us are bound to make a faux pas here and there. Laugh it off, learn from it, and move on.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Buen fin de semana!</strong></div>
<div></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I was trying to dream up a story. In the story, my young hero&#8217;s sister has an arranged marriage and moves to the United States from India. I could dream up the humdrum of the colourful wedding, of the bridal finery, of the perspective of the female protagonist&#8217;s reaction to the whole cacophonous affair. But as my mind travelled to the inside of this sister&#8217;s head, I drew a blank.</p>
<p>What was going through our sister&#8217;s head moving to a new country with a strange man? Did she feel powerless not being able to be the engine of her own destiny? Did she feel empowered by the social status that a good groom and a good marriage bestowed on her? Did she feel lost? Did she feel regret at not having pursued her studies or training further on her own? What would she do now?<span id="more-5019"></span></p>
<p>Sure there are lots of stories out there involving women from the East having arranged marriages moving to either the &#8220;freedom&#8221; of the West or to complete alienation and isolation in a foreign land. They are all creatures of destiny driven by systems of male dominance or convention going through the kind of arranged marriages that were probably a reality in my grandparents&#8217; generation. Maybe not even then was life so lacking in nuance and three dimensionality as some of those stories would suggest.</p>
<p><a class="aligncenter zemanta-img" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/55476234@N00/403042881" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="DSC09601" alt="DSC09601" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/403042881_10ac7eda71.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>So what could be the story of my contemporary generation?</p>
<p>My whole intention here was to imagine a character that would not be a stereotype, that would be a round character, not flattened out by what society would have us believe, simplistically speaking, be what <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>But here I drew a blank as I realized I had never known any such person myself. All the Indian women I knew had come to the US for higher studies, had led a graduate student life in their initial days, had not even remotely tied their destinies to an unknown person in a foreign country. Hence, I had nothing to draw on to build this character. Yet I knew there was lots here. Lots that could turn into a story. But the gap in familiarity was huge.</p>
<p>So I let this character go for the time being and tried another track.</p>
<p>Two men.</p>
<p>One is a man from a middle-class family in India who studies to become an engineer. Driven by his ambitious mother whose personal ambitions were thwarted once she got married at age nineteen, he is a mediocre student who studies fourteen hours a day to get into an engineering college and finally makes it to the USA for higher studies. (And perhaps gets married to our hero&#8217;s sister  as a good prize for his efforts without having to take away much from his fourteen hours of studies for dating purposes. Maybe his mother finds the match through the internet?)</p>
<p>I realized that this man is almost completely a stereotype. Does he exist? He does exist as the social pressure driven &#8220;nerd&#8221; character derived from Indian and American TV shows, newspaper accounts of the rare suicides of young men disappointed during engineering entrance exams, and general ideas floating around my world.  I did not know very many people personally who were like this. Hence this was probably an exact reproduction of a stereotype that I could describe only as an outsider.</p>
<p>The other man is someone who has grown up in a very liberal atmosphere, has not been able to fit this type of the conservative, useful, socially productive man, spends his time hanging out at the alternate movie theatres of the city, writes mediocre poetry, looks at all social constraints with disdain but is acutely aware of the ideals of masculinity in his contemporary world that has taken a turn for the former man who he comes face to face within my story.</p>
<p>Now<em> this</em> man I know. I have known dozens of such men. If I put such a man in my story, he would take over the story and eat up all my other characters. The stereotypes would have a hard time surviving faced with flesh-and-blood characters I&#8217;ve known.</p>
<p>Now what is a writer to do? The inside of the head is not a good enough space to find real people in. And you find no one there who you have not already met in the real world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this mean that a writer should go out there and meet as many kinds of people as possible?</li>
<li>Is living in the inside of your head bad for dreaming up characters?</li>
<li>Do imagined people come from the inside of the head who just need some layers to be added to fit the world of the story?</li>
<li>Or rather, do characters come from the outside world we inhabit? Do we simply process them through our story-telling mind as a window pane frames a view?</li>
<li>Is real memory of people and places an absolute necessity as a vital fodder for the imagination?</li>
<li>Is social isolation and long hours of isolated work bad nourishment for the storyteller&#8217;s mind?</li>
<li>Or does an isolated writer produce fewer but intense characters and a &#8220;social&#8221; writer produce a world teeming with people?</li>
<li>Or might it be that isolated writers simply write stories that are different from the &#8220;social&#8221; writers?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that there is no one simple answer to these questions. I guess I&#8217;m just trying to understand the effect of isolation or its reverse, a social presence, on writing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a 24-year-old, college-educated, middle class, caucasian male. I graduated from a private University in 2011 with a Bachelors Degree, and I have a little gold sticker on a fancy piece of paper that says &#8220;Cum Laude&#8221;. In other words, I went to school, studied hard, worked hard, and received a good education like the millions and millions of others just like me. I am writing this post as a representative of a well-educated, accomplished, and motivated slice of the U.S. population. I am concerned right now because I have come to realize that I know very little about the world I live in. I am preparing myself to become an independent, to move out on my own and start taking care of myself without the safety net of parental guidance. As I ready myself to embark on this fateful journey, I am starting to discover that I don&#8217;t really know anything.</p>
<h6>Despite my education and social standing, I remain more or less in the dark about a lot of things. Here are some things I do not know about; what is going on in Libya, what an Investment Bank does, how Healthcare works, the problem with Social Security, what is going on with the Housing market, what a Mutual Fund is, the conflict in Israel, the conflict in Iran, the consequences of my own college loan debt on the Economy, and plenty more important issues going on in America and around the world.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not proud to admit that I don&#8217;t understand these things. Some of them I even know a little bit about, but if you asked me to explain them to you I wouldn&#8217;t be able to. These are questions I would definitely get wrong on a test. As I have said before, though, I am not uneducated, and I am not ignorant. I watch the 6 o&#8217;clock news, I read magazines, I surf the web. I am also interested in many other subjects. I spend my Saturdays watching College Football and I study the BCS Rankings like a pollster studies election results. I could recite to you the history of Dave Matthews Band without taking a breath. I could effortlessly rant for twenty minutes about why Tom Brady is better than Peyton Manning. I know all of the details of the Lance Armstrong case. I  know far too much about Kim Kardashian. I can name off the top of my head, less than two days after the story broke, who David Petraeus had an affair with. I know all about Don Draper and Walter White, but please don&#8217;t ask me about Bain Capital or the Private Sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://matthewrossetti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ap_david_petraeus_121113_wg.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-64" title="ap_david_petraeus_121113_wg" alt="" src="http://matthewrossetti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ap_david_petraeus_121113_wg.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" height="168" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Petraeus &#8211; The newest household name courtesy of news media.</p></div>
<p>My question here is, where is the disconnect? Was it our education system, are schools focusing on the wrong subjects? Are we learning too much advanced calculus and not enough current events? Was it on me to take Economics, Finance, Government, and International Business courses as a Communications major? Perhaps, instead, it is the media&#8217;s fault. The news media doesn&#8217;t report on these issues, they report on scandal, disaster, sensation, and celebrity. Maybe I should be reading <em>Time</em> magazine and watching MSNBC, but I&#8217;m not sure that will even help. I have been watching the news for the past two hours and so far I have seen reports on David Petraeus and Hurricane Sandy. Two hours of news coverage dedicated to two topics. As a woman once said in a viral YouTube video, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that&#8221;, and she&#8217;s right.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://matthewrossetti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/twitter-trends-2010.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-65" title="twitter-trends-2010" alt="" src="http://matthewrossetti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/twitter-trends-2010.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is what Twitter deemed most important in 2010. The only 2 news stories were disasters.</p></div>
<p>In our everyday lives we don&#8217;t have time to read about or seek further information on all of these complex issues if they aren&#8217;t spoon fed for us. Instead we learn about the things that trend on Twitter and get shared on Facebook. We spend our free time debating sports, listening to music, and watching TV shows. I have learned more about current events by watching HBO&#8217;s &#8220;The Newsroom&#8221; than I ever did by watching the actual news. We live in a technology driven and celebrity obsessed world in which important issues fall by the wayside in favor of the latest sex scandal, celebrity breakup, or slanderous political statement. As I become an adult and head out into this terrifying &#8220;real world&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard so much about, I am doing so with a paper thin knowledge of real world issues and a rock solid understanding of pop culture. I am concerned about which information I will be calling on in a few years time and I am worried it will be the former. I am worried that I am going to be scanning bullet lists I find on Google when it comes time to find health insurance, buy a house, or file my taxes. Most of all, however, I&#8217;m worried because I know that I&#8217;m not alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tarapook.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-277" title="photo(16)" alt="" src="http://tarapook.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo163.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674" height="674" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>My mom was going through boxes of old family stuff in the garage when she came across this fine work of art. I drew this when I was about five years old and on the back I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a dream theat I was in the Olympics and I wun ave sgl game and my mom and dad was happy at me and I wis it hapind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back then I was certain that I would become an Olympic Gold medalist. I didn&#8217;t know how to spell &#8220;happened&#8221; but I definitely knew how to spell &#8220;Olympics.&#8221;</p>
<p>After laughing at my awful handwriting and portrayal of my parents, I began to think. <em>Would Tara, age 5, be disappointed in Tara, age 21?</em>  True, kids change their dreams quicker than we change the channels on a boring Saturday night, but I still couldn&#8217;t shake the thought. I was only in kindergarten but yet I had bigger dreams than I do as a senior in college.</p>
<p>Remember when dreaming was that simple? There were no such things as limits or doubts of our capabilities.</p>
<p>If we all had the faith of a five year old, the number of things that we could accomplish would be infinite. We wouldn&#8217;t worry about how much work, time, or money our dreams would take. Instead we&#8217;d take the first step and leave the rest to fate.</p>
<p>Somehow if I could meet my five year old self with the help of a time machine, I&#8217;d say thank you. Thank you for reminding me that sometimes dreams are as simple as dreaming them, and knowing they will happen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.</p>
<p>-<em>Saint Augustine</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are heading off next week to visit family and friends, to celebrate the countdown to Christmas by being gluttons for a day. However, this being an election year complicates Thanksgiving for the many of us whose political views are &#8211; shall we say &#8211; incompatible with those of our family members. And while most people are polite enough not to start a balls-to-the-wall political debate over the marshmallowed sweet potatoes, there&#8217;s always that <em>one</em> person, isn&#8217;t there? So in anticipation of this delightful, stressful time, I&#8217;ve prepared a list of possible conversation topics designed to help you avoid the political in favor of, well, something else.<span id="more-2590"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_2604" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://5cities6women.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-27.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2604" title="paper-bag turkey" alt="" src="http://5cities6women.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-27.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" height="300" width="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The happy turkey you&#8217;ll be when you don&#8217;t have to engage in political discourse over dinner.</p></div>
<p>Disclaimer: This list is not guaranteed to prevent arguments, but it is guaranteed to confuse your opponents. In other words, misdirection: if it works on a screaming toddler, it&#8217;ll work on a belligerent adult.</p>
<ol>
<li>If anyone mentions the POTUS in general, switch the focus to Joe Biden&#8217;s teeth: how <em>does</em> he get them so white? Another possibility is to talk about trains coming from Scranton, because trains are a popular holiday topic with young and old alike.</li>
<li>If anyone mentions abortion, start talking about how cute those Anne Geddes babies in pumpkins are. Have a picture available to show if possible (I&#8217;m not linking to one, I think they&#8217;re pretty damn creepy). But anyone who doesn&#8217;t stop talking politics to ooh and aah is definitely evil, and you should cut him/her out of your will. Not that you need one because the Democrats are going to give all your money away anyhow, amirite? (iamnot)</li>
<li>If anyone mentions Obamacare, discuss in great detail your most embarrassing and/or boring medical problem; which one you should choose depends on the audience. Will she duck away in horror if you mention a rectal fissure? Will he yawn his way through your lengthy battle with eczema? If you&#8217;re perfectly healthy, you lucky bastard, just make something up. (And have an exit strategy, like pretending to choke on a turkey leg, in case your relative wants to disclose his/her own medical problem. You&#8217;re not trying to punish yourself here.)</li>
<li>If anyone mentions gay marriage, ask who his/her favorite person is from the web of insanity and hilarity that is the Petraeus affair. Personally, I like <a href="http://gawker.com/5960959/finally-the-shirtless-fbi-agent-photo-is-revealed-putting-the-petraeus-affairs-biggest-mystery-to-rest?tag=petraeus-affair" target="_blank">the shirtless FBI guy</a> because he stayed anonymous the longest, and plus, he was totally joking. Also, he reminds me of that one time <a href="http://www.worldwidehippies.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mulder_simpsons.jpg" target="_blank">Mulder was on The Simpsons</a>, and his FBI badge was him in black underwear.</li>
<li>If anyone wants to talk about the economy, start sobbing about how you&#8217;re never going to be able to pay for that Black Friday shopping trip you have planned, but you have to go anyway because getting up early to buy a crap ton of stuff is What Thanksgiving Means to You. Then pass a hat for donations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few extra topics, just in case anything random pops up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask why we don&#8217;t eat that green bean casserole with the crunchy onion things on top year-round. Go on and on about those crunchy onion things for as long as you want; really, go ahead, they are so truly delicious that even Ayn Rand would like them.</li>
<li>Gush over how awesome that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/11/nicole-westbrook-goes-viral-with-its-thanksgiving-song-video/" target="_blank">new Thanksgiving song </a>is (it isn&#8217;t, except for that one adult in the chicken costume, which is some weird sort of genius).</li>
<li>Insist on deciding which flavor of pie is superior. Taste-testing as many kinds as possible will be necessary to make an informed decision, so you should offer to go out and buy more. And if you take long enough at the store, the discussion will be over because everyone else is in a tryptophan-induced coma.</li>
<li>Talk about that time you were abducted by aliens (this also reminds me of Mulder). This is almost always an effective conversation killer, and if it isn&#8217;t, then I&#8217;m rather concerned for the person you&#8217;re talking to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all else fails, remind yourself that these people are your family and/or friends, and you love them (you know you do). Then go get another drink, and distract yourself with this awesome picture of my pet bunny after a bender. Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
