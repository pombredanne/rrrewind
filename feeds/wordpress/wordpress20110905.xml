			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-172082319 alignright" title="gen_limbo" src="http://thoughtsonteaching.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/gen_limbo.jpg?w=294&#038;h=303" alt="" width="294" height="303" />As we celebrate Labor Day, I feel fortunate to be one of those employed in a full-time job with health benefits and a retirement plan &#8212; something that many Americans don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially thinking of recent college graduates who had the aspirations that most graduates have of joining the work force in their chosen field. Many of those recent grads are working part-time and in jobs that aren&#8217;t related to their college education.</p>
<p>The New York Times says these college grads are part of Generation Limbo &#8212; &#8220;<a title="Generation Limbo: Waiting It Out" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/fashion/recent-college-graduates-wait-for-their-real-careers-to-begin.html" target="_blank">Generation Limbo: Waiting It Out.</a>&#8220;</p>
<p>The article starts with the story of Jennifer Kelly, who was a 2009 graduate of the University of Florida. Kelly represents the storyline of the story &#8212; college grads who are underemployed and developing a life outlook in response to their employment status.</p>
<p>Kelly was a UF advertising major. She may have been a student in the auditorium writing course I teach, Writing for Mass Communication, that is required for advertising, journalism and public relations majors.</p>
<p>Kelly has a professional job (part-time secretary at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville), and she&#8217;s got a positive outlook about her situation, saying that by working part-time she can have more flexibility to write and cook. But she and the other college grads profiled in the story are struggling with finding jobs in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>As the NY Times article discusses, this is a very challenging job market. My own experience with undergraduate and graduate students who have graduated in the last two years echoes what the NY Times story found. Many of the grads who are desperately job hunting now would have been hired if they had been on the job market just four or five years ago.</p>
<p>A focus of my time at the <a title="2011 BlogHer Convention" href="http://www.blogher.com/blogher-11" target="_blank">2011 BlogHer Convention</a> last month in San Diego was talking about the job market with the photographers, videographers, exhibit hall workers and bloggers attending the convention. The convention was a great opportunity for me to find out more about the current job market in communications &#8212; especially for those in their 20s and 30s &#8212; so that I could share my observations with my students.</p>
<p>Several of those I talked with at BlogHer, including three of my former students (what a surprise to see them at BlogHer!), were in full-time jobs doing just the kind of work they had hoped to. Most of those were working in public relations, and they  said that their divisions/departments had been downsized and that they had more duties now than they did a year ago.</p>
<p>But the majority of people working the convention (versus those paying to attend the convention) were freelancers who had been hired by a company to work the convention. A photographer I talked with said that he had been caught in the downsizing initiatives of two different newspapers. He now is freelancing. He was at BlogHer working for Hershey&#8217;s, but most of his work was for news organizations, such as the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Several of the 20-something bloggers I talked with were journalism majors who hadn&#8217;t been able to land a job in journalism when they graduated. Most were blogging as a way to keep writing and earn some income, such as by receiving products from blogging endorsements or through revenue from being an affiliate for an organization like Amazon.</p>
<p>Based on the interviews with those members of Generation Limbo in the NY Times story and my own conversations at BlogHer with folks in the under-35 age group, here are eight tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. While waiting for the job that you really want, take another job or freelance.</strong><br />
Those interviewed for the NY Times story had jobs, primarily part-time jobs. But those jobs provided some income (many had student loans they were paying off) and also helped with their outlook. In the communications field, freelancers play a key role in most organizations.</p>
<p><strong>2. <strong>Make positive use of the time if you aren&#8217;t in a 40-hours-a-week job.</strong><br />
</strong>The NY Times article made the point that many of those in Generation Limbo are using the time that they aren&#8217;t in full-time jobs to explore other interests &#8212; music, art, writing or travel. From what some of those interviewed for the NY Times story said, they may be developing some life balance skills that will be helpful for when they do have a full-time job.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use volunteer opportunities or your own ventures, such as blogging, to help you connect with the field you are trying to be employed in.<br />
</strong>You may be employed in a field that you aren&#8217;t planning on as a career, but you can be volunteering related to your career goals. For those hoping to be employed in the communications field, helping with an organization&#8217;s event (such as the <a title="March of Dimes Walk for Babies" href="http://www.marchforbabies.org/" target="_blank">March of Dimes Walk for Babies</a>) or editing your church&#8217;s newsletter can lead to materials to include in your portfolio and also can lead to useful contacts.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Establish a level of independent living.</strong><br />
One of the people in the NY Times story moved into more active job hunting only after his parents started charging him $500 a month for rent after he had been living with them for several months. Family and friends will be supportive &#8212; but up to a point. As a student or grad with only a part-time job, defer those major purchases. College students should avoid building up credit card debt. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Develop and practice technology skills.</strong><br />
The BlogHer Convention had a major emphasis on technology, of course. But more and more businesses of any kind require technology skills. Learning technology skills and being able to include that in your resume can be very helpful. One of my former students who has been working in public relations for seven years pointed out how important it is to stay up-to-date with technology, which often means learning it on your own. Among the new media applications she has had to learn are Facebook, foursquare, blogging, Twitter and Google Docs.</p>
<p><strong>6. Determine what job-related activities your college or university provides and if you, as a grad, can participate.</strong><br />
Most colleges and universities have career counseling centers that host internship fairs, offer resume critiques, and provide a databank of employers. Those services are designed for current students, but many universities allow recent grads to participate.</p>
<p><strong>7. Always have business cards for planned and unexpected networking opportunities.</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve talked with students who think they need to wait to get business cards until they have a job to list on the card. Having business cards can be a key part of helping your get a job. Most of the business cards  I collected at BlogHer included the person&#8217;s name, email, cell phone, blog and/or website, and a list of skills &#8212; but few included a business&#8217;s name.</p>
<p><strong>8. Network, network, network.<br />
</strong>Update your online profile, such as <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Let your friends, relatives, former teachers and former employers know that you are looking for a job. That kind of networking often leads to hearing about jobs.</p>
<p><em>What other tips would you give for those in their 20s and 30s &#8212; especially those who recently have graduated from college &#8212; for obtaining a job?</em><strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will wear white. It&#8217;s because I am a rebel from California living in the Southeast. I&#8217;ve noticed that there are some hard and fast rules about dressing on the East Coast and I am amazed how diligently some people follow them. Two stick out in particular. 1) No white before Memorial Day and after Labor Day. This rule seems to mainly apply to shoes, pants, dresses, and suits. Seersucker material is also included in this rule. I don&#8217;t quite understand this rule, it can still be really hot and humid out here until late October, why on earth would I give up my cool breezy clothes? 2) Always wear stockings. They call this professional. I call it torture. Please tell me why I would wrap my legs in nylon when the humidity is at 75%?</p>
<div id="attachment_744" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://sacredmonkeysofthevatican.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/20081119_043coco-chanel_w.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-744" title="20081119_043coco-chanel_w" src="http://sacredmonkeysofthevatican.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/20081119_043coco-chanel_w.jpg?w=440&#038;h=280" alt="" width="440" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coco says &quot;Vous pouvez porter le blanc toute l&#039;année!&quot;</p></div>
<p>If you want a little more history on the &#8220;no white after labor day issue&#8221; <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920684,00.html">this article </a>from Time helps explain some of it. It doesn&#8217;t explain why to this day people insist on following this rule to this day. I like following etiquette rules, I think they are fascinating and useful. But these are two rules I just don&#8217;t understand.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765" title="-18" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/18.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a>By chance, luck or the randomness of the universe, I scored three pints of the last blueberries of the season at the farmers&#8217; market (hello fall squash and apples, goodbye berries).  In my eagerness make use of the berries,  I made my first blueberry (and peach) pie, concocted from a <a href="http://sweetpeaskitchen.com/2011/07/09/blueberry-ice-cream/" target="_blank">variety</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments/dp/1580088082" target="_blank">sources</a> my own version of blueberry ice cream, and made an old stand by, blueberry muffins. It was the jackpot winner of Labor Day weekend, and not just because of the awesomeness of the desserts, but because of the joy&#8211; yes, joy &#8211;they brought to family and friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been in Chicago for two weeks and driving back into Three Oaks on Saturday, I felt like I&#8217;d been away for months. It is pleasantly cool here, fall-like already.  Our yard needs raking, the leaves are turning, and the smell of fall &#8211;  wood smoke and fragrance of crisp crunching leaves &#8212; is already in the air.  I felt and smelt it today on my bike ride, and was pleasantly surprised by my welcoming of fall, which means the end of carefree days. The last juices of summer blueberries combined with the cool of autumn made my hours of cooking seem my own symbolic transition into school-readiness. (JY &#8212; you were right; I needed to be here to center).</p>
<p><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1766" title="-3" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/3.jpg?w=495&#038;h=360" alt="" width="495" height="360" /></a>Our neighbors hosted a party today, and my pie was a hit &#8212; combined with peach sherbet, and for the very adventurous, corn ice cream, (also made with sweet corn from the local farmer market) and Gorilla Girl ate two platefuls of pie sans crust! The blueberries were tart and the pie was still warm when we dug in after the shared neighborhood dinner. Perfection.<a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1767" title="-5" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/5.jpg?w=370&#038;h=165" alt="" width="370" height="165" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1768" title="-12" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/12.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a>Monkey Man and Gorilla Girl got into the act with me in the kitchen, rolling dough with the excess from my (first ever, and spectacular) pie crust. Monkey Man made noodles, à la Kung Fu Panda, and he invented a story about eating said noodles. Gorilla Girl just cut and rolled, cut and rolled.<a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1769" title="-13" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/13.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" title="-9" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/9.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>At the Labor Day bash, Monkey Man and Gorilla Girl played with so many of the other party goers that EE and I actually had time to visit, talk, and even relax a little.  Our children are growing up, becoming more confident and relaxed here with the folks in our town, and probably do as good a job entertaining the neighbors as the neighbors do of keeping Gorilla Girl and Monkey Man occupied. Between games of put-put for cash in DK&#8217;s garage (called the &#8220;barn&#8221; by MM), playing soccer with the guys in the yard, playing with DW&#8217;s i-phone, catching cheeto-eating moths, and dancing, Monkey Man and Gorilla Girl had quite a final farewell bash to summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_1771" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/8.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1771" title="-8" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/8.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blueberry ice cream in process</p></div>
<p>When we finally made our way home, as we meandered across the yard, Gorilla Girl said, in her most grown-up and serious voice, &#8220;It&#8217;s good to be back in Michigan.&#8221; I laughed out loud at her perception of my own inner thoughts. It<em> is</em> good to be back.  Once in the house, getting ready for bed, Gorilla Girl continued her philosophizing about the evening.  &#8220;That was a really good party, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was happy, and Monkey Man was equally content.</p>
<p>We are content here, gathering our strength, centering before the coming academic storm that will bring more challenges and rewards, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_1772" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1772" title="-11" src="http://adoptsomom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/11.jpg?w=550&#038;h=400" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blueberry ice cream</p></div>
<p>And the blueberry trifecta &#8212; well, that warmth of the pie, especially shared with friends, the incredible color of the ice cream, and the welcome familiarity of the muffins capture our good fortune and all that summer had to offer as we plunge ahead into autumn.</p>

My wife informed me a few years ago that for those who buy into high society, Labor Day is the last day you can wear white. But more importantly, Labor Day weekend is the start of football season.</p>
<p>Summer is that time of year when our hearts are as free as our toes. Your skin is kissed by the sun and seeing the person you love dressed in sunsets. A great summer day is when the sun is shining and the lawn mower is broken. September is here and summer is gone but the memories we have made will last forever.</p>
<p>This past summer has been filled with family, friends, and good times. I feel blessed that I was able to spend this summer with cousins on the beach, brothers on the lake, and parents at campsites. It was a time for me to slow down and catch my breath. I live a busy life. I am always moving sometimes not even clear on the direction. My mind is always turning. But this summer I was reminded about simple things that are also the most important things. This summer taught me to<em> appreciate the things you have before time makes you appreciate the thing you had. </em></p>
<p>What lessons did you learn this summer?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have enjoyed watching movies my whole life, but it wasn&#8217;t until a few years ago that I had fallen in love with them. As a casual fan for so many years, I missed out on a lot of great movies. I have done an admirable job catching up on many of them over the last couple years, but I am still lacking in many areas. My biggest weakness is in the area of classics, particularly foreign classics. Outside of a handful of Kurosawa films, I haven&#8217;t seen too many older foreign titles. I am also still a novice to Film Noir, although I have greatly enjoyed every one I have seen.</p>
<p>In order to continue to push myself to see more great movies, I have compiled this list of 50 movies I must see before the end of the year. Fifty seems like a low number &#8212; and it probably is &#8212; but I thought it would be a fair amount to squeeze in amidst the summer madness, and there is no telling how busy I will be in the future. These are 50 movies from all eras, and I made sure to include some genres and directors that I want to familiarize myself with. Some are more important than others, but these are all films that I have heard quite a bit about and therefore would like to indulge in them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="20110616 185500 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883525500/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6099/5883525500_fd7b05615e.jpg" alt="20110616 185500 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>When folks think of what to do in Korea, rock climbing isn’t really the first thing that comes to mind,</p>
<p><a title="20110616 185628 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883533500/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/5883533500_e80f70aa35.jpg" alt="20110616 185628 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>but I would argue it is the best way to see Korea.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 191337 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883561294/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5199/5883561294_78034e92ca.jpg" alt="20110616 191337 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The palaces and markets are cool and all,</p>
<p><a title="20110616 185738 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5882976827/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5882976827_c4e9466ec3.jpg" alt="20110616 185738 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>but if you live in a big city, wandering around another big city gets old fast.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 184023 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883507478/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5883507478_a304f20c84.jpg" alt="20110616 184023 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Bukhansan National Park is at the edge of the big city, accessible by public transport, with lots of English signage.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 175053 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5882934791/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6056/5882934791_534b14afc7.jpg" alt="20110616 175053 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So if you were to go there to hike, especially on a weekend, the trail would be buku crowded.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 185902 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5882983189/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5156/5882983189_571293aae1.jpg" alt="20110616 185902 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Not so if you climb.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 185009 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5882952087/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5320/5882952087_2024b4566a.jpg" alt="20110616 185009 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We did a ridge climb with lots of being roped up but scrambling and not always doing technical climbing,</p>
<p><a title="20110616 211739 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883005661/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5883005661_425cd2a86a.jpg" alt="20110616 211739 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>there were enough tricky spots to keep it challenging…of course it helped I’m not the best climber in the world.</p>
<p><a title="20110616 190036 Bukhansan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23908805@N05/5883552920/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5883552920_d50e93eb8b.jpg" alt="20110616 190036 Bukhansan" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The best part? Clear skies, a rare event that lets one see beyond the Han river.</p>
<p>And there was no one else on the route to have to share with.</p>
<p>Korea, just the way I like it.</p>
