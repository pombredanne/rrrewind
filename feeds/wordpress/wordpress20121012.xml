That&#8217;s my kiddo.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;ve always been politically minded and involved. When I had my son, that didn&#8217;t change and I probably became even more politically conscious. I strapped him to my back and went out to vote, ran exit polls for Planned Parenthood, and helped campaign on both local and national levels. But more importantly, I did my best to keep an open dialogue with my son about the political process at an age-appropriate level. I taught him the importance of voting as a civic duty, and he&#8217;s joined me as I&#8217;ve casted my ballot in every election since his birth, even in non-presidential election years.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re a family that listens to the local (some might call it progressive) radio show in the morning and NPR at other times while in the car, and I happen to have a 5.5 year old who is a total sponge with really well trained ears, and an inquisitive nature. Something will catch his attention and he&#8217;ll ask question after question until he&#8217;s satisfied. I&#8217;m both proud and &#8211; at times &#8211; overwhelmed by this particular quality.</p>
<p><a href="http://themamafesto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/big-bird-presidential-debates-romney1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2242" title="big-bird-presidential-debates-romney1" alt="" src="http://themamafesto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/big-bird-presidential-debates-romney1.jpg?w=246&#038;h=300" height="300" width="246" /></a>So it hasn&#8217;t really taken me by surprise that in the last few weeks, most of his questions are related to the election &#8211; especially when that&#8217;s pretty much all everyone is talking about. Last week after the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, somebody on the radio mentioned Big Bird and the kiddo&#8217;s ears perked up big time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Bird?! Why are they talking about Big Bird?&#8221;</p>
<p>We listened to the analysis of the debate together before I answered his questions. By the end of the car ride, EZ was well versed in Romney&#8217;s declaration that he&#8217;d pull funding from PBS in order to lower the national debt (which, as my pal Joanne Bamberger <a href="http://www.punditmom.com/2012/10/romney-thinks-big-bird-is-a-moocher" target="_blank">has explained</a>, is less than a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things). Later that evening, I found him still puzzling over what we had talked about earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean I won&#8217;t get anymore Wild Kratts? He can&#8217;t take my Wild Kratts!&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d still get your Wild Kratts. Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that, I thought, was the end of that.</p>
<p>Until yesterday evening when I got an email from EZ&#8217;s teacher (who also happens to be a friend of mine from before his days in Kindergarten) that included the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>E is apparently a VERY passionate Obama supporter. He was telling everyone at snack that Mitt Romney [...] would get rid of Pbs.org so everyone HAD to vote for Obama.</p></blockquote>
<p>The email went on to say that while she thought it was very cute, that perhaps we could talk to EZ about framing his thoughts in another way, since we never know which way other families lean, and EZ&#8217;s enthusiastic emphasis on <em><strong>needing</strong></em> to vote for Obama might leave some kids feeling out of place.</p>
<p>I totally understood what his teacher was saying, and agreed to think about ways to talk about this with EZ, but not before feeling a huge swell of pride that my son took it upon himself, unprompted, to do a little bit of campaigning for the President. Then, I sat down to figure out how to deal with this situation. His teacher certainly wasn&#8217;t saying that political talk in school was discouraged (although it did seem clear that EZ was the only kid bring politics up at snack), but that we had to find a way to discuss politics where everyone&#8217;s choices felt validated.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>So, while he took his bath, the kiddo and I talked. We talked about how just like we can&#8217;t force someone to like the same type of food or music we like, we also can&#8217;t do the same for who we feel should be President. I told him that I loved that he thought about these things and that he clearly felt so passionate about this one issue, but that we can find a way to discuss this and also make sure that everyone leaves the conversation having their own opinion. It seemed to go over well &#8211; I think. In typical 5.5 year old fashion, he then immediately turned the topic over to his birthday party plans (which, ahem, isn&#8217;t until January, but clearly ever-present on his mind) and all political talk ended for the time being.</p>
<p>However, I want to hear from YOU &#8211; have your kids broached politics in school or in a similar setting? How did it go? And I would also love any thoughts you might have on additional conversations I could have with the kiddo about politics and how we talk about them. <strong>Please leave your thoughts below!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a fiction writer. Poetry is not my thing. I tried to write a poem for this post, and my husband said, <a href="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mothergoose1.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="border:0 none;" src="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mothergoose1.jpg?w=256&#038;h=370" alt="Image" width="256" height="370" /></a>“You didn’t rhyme the last two lines.” Of course I did. I’m not an idiot. I went back and read them. Hmmm … I guess “come” doesn’t rhyme with “done.” Crap!</p>
<p>But, in an effort to post outside of my comfort zone, I am forging ahead with poetry. I even have a picture to use for inspiration. Also outside of my comfort zone is to ask for participation. I can barely squeak out a question at the end of my posts, so this is definitely outside of my comfort zone. (I just used the words “comfort zone” three times in one paragraph. Now four.) So, here we go …</p>
<p>Sing with me. Led Zepplin. Stairway to Heaven. Do you have it in your head? Good.</p>
<p>Thanks to my husband, whenever I go out into our backyard, the song rolls around in my head. There isn’t a stairway to heaven out there, there’s a stairway to nowhere. Now sing the song using the words “buying a stairway to nowhere.”</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 340px"><a href="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc00327.jpg"><img style="border:0 none;" src="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc00327.jpg?w=330&#038;h=249" alt="Image" width="330" height="249" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click for a closer view.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">This summer, the house next door to ours was gutted and completely renovated. The stairway in question used to go to the door to the kitchen. As you can see, they made a new entrance with new stairs. They didn’t remove the old stairs; they simply painted them <em>brown</em>. What were they thinking? For me personally, the stairs to nowhere would be a deal breaker.</p>
<p>Rather than try to understand the logic, let us pay homage to the stairs to nowhere today. Leave a poem, limerick, haiku, or simply your comment about the stairs to nowhere – or anything else for that matter. I’ll walk over, sit on the stairs, and read your work or comment aloud. Maybe. I might pay a neighbor kid to do it.</p>
<p>We’ll start. Here’s hubby’s limerick because he is a fountain when it comes to limericks:</p>
<p>There once were some steps, a total of four,<br />
That led from the ground up to the door.<br />
The door went away,<br />
An improvement some say.<br />
Now they lead to a door that’s no more.</p>
<p>Good, but BORING. His <a href="http://breezybooksblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/do-you-want-to-kill-your-blog-posts2/#comments">bacon/schmeckel</a> limerick was so much better. If he hadn’t mowed the grass this past weekend and used up all of his energy, I’m sure he would have given us better.</p>
<p>Here’s my poem:</p>
<p>Oh stairs once gray,<br />
I feel your dismay.<br />
Slathered in brown,<br />
The bane of the town.</p>
<p>You went to the kitchen,<br />
You used to be bitchin’.<br />
Now useless to all,<br />
There is only a wall.</p>
<p>That is why I don’t do poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ugly_leaves1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:0 none;" src="http://breezybooksblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ugly_leaves1.jpg?w=428&#038;h=261" alt="Image" width="428" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>Let me try a haiku:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Gray happy stairway<br />
Leaves fall on distressing brown<br />
Renovation sucks</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m supposed to take a moment to reflect on the experience of this new type of blog post for me. It only took a nanosecond to have my thought: Poetry is hard. I’m stickin&#8217; with fiction.</p>
<p>Your turn.<br />
Just go with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, in the vast open ocean, there were corals as diverse as plants on land and fishes as much as the stars in the sky. But they weren&#8217;t the only ones. There were also sharks, turtles, starfish, seahorse, crabs and other sea animals as much as you can count (if you can). But of course, there lived one tiny creature that was hard to miss.</p>
<p>She was colourful and considered one of the most beautiful creature underwater. Due to her striking colours, she was quite safe from her predators because it gives out warning that she was poisonous, which was not the case at all. Some of her relatives do pose danger for other animals if disturbed, but she just somehow harmlessly possess vibrant colours. Her name was <strong>Risbecia Tryoni</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/423430_10150991190477934_830168810_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2094" title="tryoni1" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/423430_10150991190477934_830168810_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" height="300" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>She was barely 2 centimeters in length. She was so tiny that you might think she&#8217;ll get washed up by the strong currents and get eaten by other animals. But no, she thrived to survive. Her small figure helped her hid in holes and crevices easily, which was great because that&#8217;s where her food source will be. Sponges and algae she feeds on everyday.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/223954_10151029410077934_1600707728_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2095" title="tryoni2" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/223954_10151029410077934_1600707728_n.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" height="300" width="225" /></a>And soon enough, she grew to matured size. Her angel-like mantle flapping was one of her captivating features besides the purple spots and lines along her mantle.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/418853_10151043429672934_1000600770_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2096" title="tryoni3" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/418853_10151043429672934_1000600770_n.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" height="300" width="225" /></a>Along the way she met friends. She&#8217;s a follower. She loved following them. And follow is what they do to each other! Sometimes one of them will be the leader. Sometimes one becomes the follower. Sometimes one will realise that it&#8217;s better off to trail away.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1160552-copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2097" title="tryoni4" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1160552-copy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" height="225" width="300" /></a>But for Tryoni, she loved being a follower <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . One time, a friend that she was following caught her attention. She had found her soulmate. She knew that this other Tryoni is the best for her and it was a mutual feeling. So they started dating and exchanged their personal keepings.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1160481.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2098" title="tryoni5" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1160481.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" height="225" width="300" /></a>Sad to say that she needs to move on after that. All of them do. All her relative slugs do. They move on after the courtship. But that doesn&#8217;t slow her down because she knows she has went through that one important step in her life! And by now, all the personal keepings that she has exchanged with her ex-partner were ready to be released. So she kept crawling and looking for a suitable spot. Better still, a place where it&#8217;s near to her food source. She finally found it and started her ritual dance. The sacs started coming out from her reproductive organs called gonopore, forming red ribbon-like structures on the rock. She started swirling in the direction of an anti-clockwise while laying the red ribbon, filled with millions of eggs.</p>
<p><a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1170032-copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2099" title="tryoni6" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1170032-copy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" height="225" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>And after she&#8217;s done, she moved on, leaving her next generation behind, hoping that they too will survive in the wild like her. What&#8217;s her next plan? I don&#8217;t know. Only she knows where her trail will lead her to. She might bump into new friends, start her trailing dance, meeting new partners again. But one thing she knows for sure. The ocean is a big playground with plenty of adventures, risks and dangers waiting for her. But she will just have to keep crawling endlessly into the open ocean until she needs to stop and rest eternally.</p>

<p>To commemorate Tryoni&#8217;s bravery, here&#8217;s a sketch I did of her (no pun intended)<a href="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cb3c7ecc138311e2942b123138190f7f_7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2103" title="tryoni7" alt="" src="http://krisss86.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cb3c7ecc138311e2942b123138190f7f_7.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" height="300" width="300" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ve heard it said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t go home.&#8221; And, &#8220;Home is where the heart is.&#8221; But, if you can&#8217;t go home, and that&#8217;s where your heart is . . . then . . . does that mean you&#8217;ve lost heart?  Not me.  Nope!! I can go home any time I want, and I do &#8211; often. Not all the way home, though, usually. I go to the front gate, where all the flowers are. I can lean on the gate and relive all the fun times and exciting days, and it&#8217;s like picking a bouquet of memories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My foster father &#8211; what a guy! Farming was his life, and so was his wife. He had more old sayings than a dog&#8217;s got fleas. I used to just marvel at how many he could quote in one day, without repeating himself. As a teenager, I often scoffed at those sayings. Now I remember them with great fondness, and have found myself using most as though they originated in my own brain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a saying for every occasion, and several he used for multiple situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A typical day at our house may have included one or more of the following interchanges . . .</p>
<address><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong><em>me:</em></strong></span> </span><em><span style="color:#800000;">How ya doin today?</span></em></address>
<address><span style="color:#333333;"><strong><em>him:</em></strong></span> (on a good day)<em><span style="color:#800000;"> finern frog&#8217;s hair split three ways</span></em>  (on a better day) <em><span style="color:#800000;">happy as a clam the clam-diggers missed!</span></em>  (on a great day)<em><span style="color:#800000;"> if I was any better, there&#8217;d have to be two of me!</span></em>  (on a day he didn&#8217;t feel well)<span style="color:#800000;">  </span><em><span style="color:#800000;">I got a hitch in my gitalong.</span></em></address>
<address> </address>
<address><strong><em>me:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">I don&#8217;t get it. What did you mean by that?</span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>him: </em></strong><em><span style="color:#800000;">Oh, nuthin. My tongue just got tied around my eye-teeth, and I couldn&#8217;t see what I was saying.</span></em></address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;"> </span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>me:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">I hate my hair! Why can&#8217;t I get it cut?</span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>him:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">well, you&#8217;ve cut it two or three times, and it&#8217;s still too short.</span></em></address>
<address> </address>
<address><strong><em>me:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">What time is it, Claude?</span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>him:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">two hairs past a freckle, goin&#8217; on to the elbow.</span></em></address>
<address> </address>
<address><strong><em>me: </em></strong><em><span style="color:#800000;">AARRGGHHH! I can&#8217;t do this stupid thing &#8211; it&#8217;s not working!</span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>him:</em></strong> <em><span style="color:#800000;">here&#8217;s your problem &#8211; you&#8217;re not holdin&#8217; your mouth right.</span></em></address>
<address> </address>
<address><strong><em>me:</em></strong> (before a date) <em><span style="color:#800000;">Do I look OK? </span></em></address>
<address><strong><em>him: </em></strong><span style="color:#800000;"><em>you look purtiern a spotted hog.</em> </span>(by the way, that did NOT instill any confidence in me at the time, as I hated hogs and thought they were ugly)</address>
<address> </address>
<p>Oh, and all those little multipurpose sayings! He would often use these interchangeably &#8211; when he was upset, mischievous, crabby, happy &#8211; whatever. Sometimes he&#8217;d just use them to make me laugh, or to get a rise out of me, or maybe even to make me a little mad (he got a kick out of getting my teenage temper stirred up).</p>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">I&#8217;m gonna cut your tail off right behind your ears! </span></em><span style="color:#333333;">(upset with one of us kids&#8230;teasing the dog&#8230;or just feelin&#8217; a little rambunctious)</span></address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">Put your shoes on, Lucy &#8211; doncha know you&#8217;re in the city?!  </span></em>(by the way, we weren&#8217;t in the city, my name isn&#8217;t Lucy, and I probably had my shoes on anyway)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">Independent as a hog on ice </span></em><span style="color:#333333;">(somebody he considered even more stubborn than he was &#8211; usually me)</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#800000;"><em>Come on in, pull up a chair and sit down beside it</em></span> (when company came, if he liked them)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">Here&#8217;s your hat what&#8217;s your hurry</span></em> (when company came, if he wasn&#8217;t all that fond of them)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">Well, sit on your fist and lean back on your thumb</span></em> (to whoever lost, when we were fighting over the best seat in front of the TV)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">If everybody thought alike, they&#8217;d all want Suzie</span> </em>(this one always cracked me up, as his wife&#8217;s name wasn&#8217;t Suzie)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">slice me off a chunk of that</span></em> (when I tried to make coffee once &#8211; by the way, you COULD slice off a chunk of HIS coffee)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">I druther die owin&#8217; ya than cheatcha out of it</span></em> (ALWAYS said with a twinkle in his eye and a twitch in the corner of his mouth)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">I feel like I&#8217;ve been rode hard and put away wet</span></em> (I honestly think he got that one from watching all those old westerns he loved on TV. Jes sayin)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">I&#8217;m so hongry my stomach thinks my throat&#8217;s been cut</span></em> (another one I&#8217;m sure he got from westerns &#8211; except maybe for the &#8216;hongry&#8217; part. That was all him)</address>
<address><em><span style="color:#800000;">Well, bust my britches!</span></em> (this one he used to convey any number of emotions)</address>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My foster father rarely just &#8220;said&#8221; something &#8211; he was the master of hyperbole, simile, and metaphor, even though he had no idea what any of those words meant. When I think of all his sayings, I can hear his voice and see the twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if someone did something he didn&#8217;t like, look out! He could jump straight up in the air and land with both fists up, ready to do battle, sort of a mixture between Snuffy Smith and Popeye. True story! I actually witnessed that happen once, when someone had badly mistreated his plow horse, Patsy. She died from the mistreatment &#8211; and the fellow came very near that himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Normally, though, my foster father was a kind, gentle little man, always a hard worker, and meticulously honest. He was a good man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I could go on and on and on and . . . or not. What are some of your favorite memories from days gone by?</p>
<address><em>This week&#8217;s WordPress writing challenge is all about <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/weekly-writing-challenge-and-now-for-something-completely-different/">something completely different</a> from the normal posting, and my foster father was just that - completely different from any post I ever met. There are fence posts, and postcards, and postmarks, and postmen, and post-holes, and post-modern, and even blog posts. Claude was a postmark from another era, forever stamped on my memory. </em><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/weekly-writing-challenge-metaphor-and-similie/"><br />

<p>before i started sewing today, i changed my serger thread from white (what i always serge with) to black. i don&#8217;t change my serger thread very often, so when the threads were all wonky, i thought it was because i&#8217;d done something wrong. after nearly an hour of threading and rethreading, i realized…wait for it…i had lifted my presser foot up to rethread and forgot to put it back down! oof, no wonder the fabric wouldn&#8217;t feed through! anyway, once i figured that out, this little shirt came together in a snap.</p>

<p>behold the daring fireball upcycled tee. my husband follows tech news like other guys follow football. one of his favorite sites for info on apple and other techie stuff is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">daring fireball</a>. the site is widely read among those that follow that sort of thing, but pretty obscure in our day-to-day lives (kinda like me with sewing blogs!), and it has a really cool and simple design to it. my husband pretty much wore this t-shirt until it couldn&#8217;t be worn anymore (by him). so off it went into my upcycle pile for the boy!</p>

<p>i used his t-shirt for the body plus a slightly lighter gray tank top that my sister gave me for the bindings (she just moved back to town after finishing up school and was doing deep cleaning). the pattern is rae&#8217;s <a href="http://www.made-by-rae.com/2012/02/flashback-skinny-tee-sewing-pattern-is-here/">flashback skinny tee</a> in 18-24 months.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Radiation is not fun. Now, on the spectrum of not fun things this year it&#8217;s probably not as bad as chemo, but in some ways it&#8217;s more insidious than the surgery. With surgery each day was an improvement, now I slide downhill. After surgery, the pain was moderate (when asked what my pain threshold was a friend answered for me &#8211; DUDE, she took tylenol a day after her double mastectomy). But, this is uncomfortable, painful, and daily.</p>
<p>I have never had that wonderful skin that bronzes beautifully and glows happily in the sun. I have been blessed with a fair complexion that freckles and burns and makes keloid scars for even a mole removal. Ironic that I thought skin cancer would be my bane. I like my skin in general, but all of a sudden, a curse &#8211; red as a lobster on impacted areas, tender from swelling on areas where I would LIKE to wear a support undergarment and rosacea of the face somedays. My doctor proscribed daily rinses &#8211; &#8220;so it won&#8217;t peel&#8221; &#8211; great, not even a chance of a sun tan after all this? I find myself daydreaming of times naked in one of Davis&#8217; old shirts.</p>
<p>So much has changed &#8211; I find shopping therapeutic in ways it never was before. Part of it is I keep trying to find things that flatter my new strange-to-me-shape. I try to find things that work in pixie haircut land. Accentuate the positives, right? Just when I feel like I have a little wardrobe for summer it turns 50 here! I scramble &#8211; no pants! Which sweaters? What shirts? I have discovered the magic of tunic shirts and leggings.</p>
<p>I finally took everything out of my closet that I can&#8217;t wear right now. It was exhausting but so was the feeling of looking at it every day and wishing I could fit into it again. I&#8217;m realistic &#8211; there is likely a chance I will, but there&#8217;s also a chance I won&#8217;t &#8211; my five year dosing of tamoxifen may impact my body into fat hoarding.</p>
<p>Regardless I have to say I am thoroughly confused when I do shop &#8211; I can figure out what size to get for tops, but is it just me or are the sizes for bottoms crazy? I can&#8217;t find something that fits my waist &#8211; and my bootie &#8211; without falling off my thighs or being two inches too long. I am going to -ack- actually go shopping for jeans and try on different sizes and shapes and models. Does anyone like doing that?</p>
<p><a href="http://mommyunlocked.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/famoct.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-478" title="famoct" src="http://mommyunlocked.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/famoct.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a>Though I have won the battle against cancer, the war continues &#8211; and I want you to remember this. When we are cancer free, we are not always treatment free. When we are done with chemo the hard part is not always over. Hug your survivor friends, love them through and past the first battle because the hits keep on coming., You like your hair &#8211; sorry. You like your waist? Cancer will take that too &#8230; and forget about the silhouette. How about your metabolism? Mood? Skin sensitivity? Ability to get to sleep? Now I&#8217;m left with my sparkling wit and personality. Good thing I have a fantastically supportive husband. Along with adoring friends and family and three amazing children of course.</p>
<p>There it is, the thread back to happy.</p>
<p>And, the news that only 13 more treatments of radiation. 6 of those with the dreaded bolus. In radiation therapy, <strong>bolus</strong> is a material which has properties equivalent to tissue when irradiated. The bolus is laid on my skin to  increase the skin dose &#8211; yup that&#8217;s right, to make my skin MORE red. Run cancer baby cells. You cannot hide.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_171" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://creativeliar.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wine.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-171  " style="margin:-10px;" title="Wine" alt="A picture of a wine glass filled with red wine." src="http://creativeliar.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wine.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" height="300" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A picture of me teaching children to read in Uganda. Wait, no, it&#8217;s just my wine glass again.</p></div>
<p>My kid?  She kills me.</p>
<p>No, I mean she’s feasting on my soul and I feel like I’m aging a mile a minute.</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there.  The real point to this post is to remind myself that if I never had her, I would not be teaching children to read in Uganda like I mistakenly tell everyone within a three mile radius at least seven times a day:</p>
<p>“You know sweet, darling child of mine, if you didn’t just break off my nose to feed it to the dog, I’d probably be teaching children to read in Uganda right about now.  And I’d be sporting a killer tan.  And I’d be wearing gold-plated jorts.  And Brooke Shields would be my best friend.”</p>
<p>My kid?  She’s frustrating.  She’s got a spine stronger than mine and she is, in fact, literally stronger than me.  She’s smart and confident and often makes me wonder why I thought I was fit to raise a volatile Furby-sized ninja.</p>
<p>But she motivates me.  That’s the most surprising part.  How she keeps me wanting to do my best AT EVERYTHING no matter how hard she smacks me in the face with our metal spatula.  If it weren’t for her, I don’t know what I’d be doing right now.  Oh wait.  I do:</p>
<p><strong>CHILDLESS CL’S AWESOME RESUME OF FUN</strong></p>
<p><strong>CL graduated with honors from the University of Awesomeville and then immediately quit trying.  She’s written a dozen half completed short stories that she keeps stacked in her bathroom in case she runs out of toilet paper and isn’t up for a good old fashioned shame waddle.  Nobody likes the shame waddle.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>When she’s not manufacturing emergency toilet paper, she sponsors a nightly wine club in her home where members sample an assortment of bargain basement wines and a jug of moonshine she concocted that one day when she sniffed too much glue in a Wal-Mart parking lot when attempting to give her seat belt some semblance of safety.  How was she supposed to know glue smelled so good? </strong></p>
<p><strong>When she’s not asking fellow Wal-Mart patrons if they’d be interested in drinking a shit ton of booze at her place (she likes Wal-Mart.  A lot), you can often find her drunkenly stumbling through the Fiction aisles at Barnes and Noble, throwing loose coins and dried balls of chewed gum at any books written by Jersey Shore cast members or curled up with various copies of Harry Potter, asking an imaginary J. K. Rowling what her secret is and wiping her tears with their pages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When she’s not hard at work locking herself out of her house or calling the Accidental Glue Sniffers Anonymous hotline, she’s watching reruns of The Office on Hulu and casually mentioning the characters in every day conversation with her husband until he catches on that these are not, in fact, friends she met at her church group.  Who want to drink wine at her house in the evenings.  From 7:00 to 10:00 p.m.  Her mom lets her borrow her Wii.  So email her if you’re interested…please.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone that keeps you from accidentally sniffing glue or begging Wal-Mart strangers to drink wine in your place of residence is worth their weight in gold.  So life with a preschooler is no slow motion beach jog with Brooke Shields, but at least I have someone in my life that makes me a better person.</p>
<p>Even if nothing in my closet is gold plated.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I think about physical signs that indicate how well a lesson is going, it’s clear that I made mistakes today.  My first great flop!  I guess it was bound to happen, and I’m sure I will flop again, but I never anticipated feeling so awful about it all, like the students missed an opportunity to learn so much more than they did.</p>
<p>The 2M students are reading a collection of essays by Bill Bryson called <em>Notes from a Big Country.</em>  Bryson was born in Iowa, but moved to England in his twenties, and this collection comes from a series of columns he wrote upon returning to the States in the 1990s.  He’s pretty critical in most of them, but his writing also involves a good deal of humor, which is what Isabelle wanted me to focus on today, something she informed me of about two hours before the lesson was to begin.  Now, a lack of preparation was probably a factor—I needed to know about more than just satire, irony, and hyperbole for a fifty minute lesson—but I think my flop had more to do with a difference in expectations.  That and my sudden inability to spell “exaggeration.”</p>
<p>The students had read “Why No one Walks” for homework, a piece describing the relatively extreme pedantic nature of Americans, and one that employs a fair share of hyperbole, irony, and the other assorted terms I had only recently learned.  My plan was to ask the students what they thought about the piece, initiating a discussion that would last for a few minutes before asking them to pick specific lines they had found funny, at which point I would proceed to write the appropriate terms on the board.  My grand plan continued, then, to introducing additional types of humor—ones that weren’t used in “Why No one Walks,” but were in other essays in the collection.  I imagined writing words on the board and students helping me out with definitions, working together to find an appropriate definition that built upon their prior knowledge.  At this point, I would introduce their homework and, if we had extra time, we’d start on it together.</p>
<p>What happened was the initial “discussion” turned into a quick three-sentence summary of the essay by one student and the rest of the class nodding in agreement.  What happened was two or three students pitied me and contributed two or three “funny” lines, at which point I introduced the appropriate terms, attempted to spell “exaggeration” by starting off e-g-a and then forgetting the second “g” once I had the beginning nailed down.  What happened was me talking most of the class time, rambling on about different types of humor and not knowing how much of what I said was understood, and <em>then</em> reading out loud the entire essay they were assigned for homework before doing half of the work in class together because we had so much extra time.</p>
<p>What happened was my first big flop, but what I learned is that a student-centered classroom is not typical for these students.  I’ve observed classes before, and I’ve seen how Isabelle does most of the talking, calling on a random student to answer questions periodically, but I didn’t realize until today how prominent this model was for these students.  I’m not saying I didn’t flop—even taking this into consideration, I know that I rambled and repeated myself and failed to do the subject justice, never mind the fact that I read an entire essay out loud, going against pretty much everything Dr. Frager ever taught me—but I now know that I’m going to have to model any sort of discussion I want to have in the future and adjust my expectations so that I can provide the proper support.</p>
<p>After class ended, Isabelle’s comment was, “Well, you handled that topic much better than I would have.”  When I voiced my concerns about participation, she just said, “Well, this class isn’t one that talks a lot, but they do think a lot.”  Part of that was an attempt to comfort me, I think, but her statements also speak to the importance of knowing your students.  I’ll have to work on that—and my spelling skills, apparently.</p>
