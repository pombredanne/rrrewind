			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Diary Entry: 9-8-11</em></p>
<p><em>I am on a minibus, currently navigating the streets of Hanoi, en route to Halong Bay. After 3 days in Hanoi, I am looking forward to some comparatively quiet time. Hanoi is a most incredible city, and I wish I had more time to explore it. It has all the hallmarks of a developing South East Asian city, however it seems also very determined to get out of the &#8216;developing&#8217; status as soon as possible. The rate of change is tremendous, and in many ways, they seem to be emulating what other developed SE Asian cities such as Singapore have done: good roads, daily street cleaning, well maintained public parks, and an emphasis on Services as an industry. It seems only just around the corner that food safety standards are adopted, road traffic made more stringent, and the prosperity skyrockets. It will be interesting to observe. I can also see how my Grandpa became so impassioned upon his visit here, the hurt and suffering that this country has been through is beyond comprehension, and the strong worded government makes pains to ensure it is not forgotten, that this country has beaten off multiple super powers, and are now independent and proud. It definitely reflects in the attitudes of the people &#8211; &#8216;service, not servants&#8217;.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We arrived in Vietnam on a Saturday morning, just before lunch. One of the first impressions we had as we flew over the country was that it was waterlogged. Rice paddies stretched across the landscape, creating a patchwork effect much like the Canterbury reigon in New Zealand, and all the towns seemed to edge right onto a sizable lake.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class="  " title="Vietnam Landscape" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2100E.jpg" alt="Vietnam Landscape" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vietnamese countryside from the air</p></div>
<p>As our airport transfer wasn&#8217;t forthcoming, we decided to cab it to the hotel &#8211; a nerve racking experience after all the horror stories of taxi drivers exploiting the naivety of tourists and charging them an extortionate amount. We arrived at the hotel safe and sound, and more importantly, still with money in our pockets. We were staying in the Hotel Elegance, one of a chain of boutique hotels, highly recommended to us by a friend. The service and facilities here were second to none, with helpful staff, lovely rooms, and comfortable beds.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class="  " title="Hotel Room at Hotel Elegance" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2147E.jpg" alt="Hotel Room at Hotel Elegance" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hotel Room at Hotel Elegance</p></div>
<p>We spent 3 days making sorties to different parts of the town &#8211; exploring the Old Quarter, Ho Chih Minh Memorial park, Army Museum, and the &#8216;Hanoi Hilton&#8217; prison. In between, of course, we gouged on Vietnamese cuisine, taking guidance from an array of suggestions from friends, guide books, and our hotel map.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of note were the restaurants Cai Ca La Vong, and KOTO. Cai Ca la Vong is a family restaurant, in a rather ramshackle (but clean) old shop house, that sell one food, grilled fish. While it is fair heart attack food, with a lot of butter involved, it was beautiful, tasty, and left us wanting more.</p>
<p>KOTO is a charitable restaurant that takes in street kids, gives them accommodation and income, and trains them up with amazing hospitality skills. The food was divine, and despite a substantially nicer interior (upstairs have nice plush loungers to rest on), the prices were not significantly higher than the other places we had dined at.</p>
<p>One of the interesting cultural oddities I noted in Hanoi is the wake up time for the city. I woke up early one morning to get out and experience the city as it woke up (an activity I highly recommend when in a strange city). I was out on the street at 5am, but I wasn&#8217;t the first. Already lining the streets were flower and fruit vendors, hawking their goods to the fairly sizable traffic already on the road. I got to Hoan Kiem Lake in the center of the Old Quarter shortly after, to find that what appeared to be half the city out and about jogging or walking laps of the lake, playing badminton, doing Tai Chi (or a Vietnamese variant of it), and even ball room dancing. Needless to say, I was impressed. Singapore seems to be the opposite, with the city still fairly sluggish and sleepy by 9am.</p>

<p>After three days in Hanoi, we moved on to the second part of the trip, an overnight cruise through Halong Bay. We booked this through Ocean Travel, and chose the Glory Cruises option &#8211; with a newly refitted boat, and a good reputation, it was the easy choice. After a 4 hour mini bus drive across to the cruise terminal of Halong City, we were transferred to the ship via tender boat, and were on our way. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were cruising through incredible rock formations, green capped and jagged &#8211; reminding me of the legend of the Dragons Teeth that formed the islands of the bay.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class=" " title="Glory Cruises" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2910E.jpg" alt="Glory Cruises" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glory Cruises</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class=" " title="Yean on Deck" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2557.jpg" alt="Yean on Deck" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yean on deck</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class=" " title="Cove in Halong Bay" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2782E.jpg" alt="Cove in Halong Bay" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cove in Halong Bay</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class=" " title="Rock Formations" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2813E.jpg" alt="Rock Formations" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Spoting shapes in rock formations</p></div>
<p>The accommodation on the cruise ship was lovely, and the service was great. For the first time whist on a holiday, we were forced into doing nothing, only to sit on the deck, sip a pina colada, and watch the islands move by. A wholesome experience overall, and nicely punctuated with side trips like a swim at a cove, a kayak through a floating village, and a walk through an extremely large cave system, where upon we spent an hour or so looking at rock formations and trying to see the animals and shapes that the guide was pointing out.</p>
<p>Our overnight location was beautiful, and despite the presence of about 15 other ships, it was extremely quiet, with only the faint drone of the generator and the lapping of the water against the hull to disturb the silence.</p>
<p>The next day we were back on land at mid day, after a hearty brunch that filled us up for the rest of the afternoon. Another 4 hour mini bus trip back to Hanoi was spent dosing and occasionally taking pictures out the window. After being dropped off at the hotel, we had a couple of hours to spare before we had to head to the Airport, so we dined at a quaint French cafe, and then found a small coffee store where we brought a bag of Vietnamese coffee to add to our collection of Borneo, Cameron, and Himalayan tea that we&#8217;re building up at home.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><img class=" " title="Cafe de Paris" src="http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/samholliss/IMG_2935E.jpg" alt="Cafe de Paris" width="448" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cafe de Paris</p></div>
<p>Finally it was time to race to the airport, only finding out there that the flight had been delayed another hour. Note to self: NEVER run out of books to read whilst waiting in the Hanoi airport at 9pm. There&#8217;s not too much to do there.</p>
<p>Vietnam is now high on my list of places to recommend, and I&#8217;d love to get back there for a more extensive trip one day &#8211; I feel a bit disappointed with myself that we didn&#8217;t get far out of Old Quarter, which turns out is the main tourist area, and I&#8217;d love to see more of Hanoi, for instance the water theme park, the business district, and the West Lake area.</p>
<p>Oh well, next time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve written about <a href="http://burkpkrohe.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/pictures-girls-take-that-i-hate/">Facebook before</a>, but I thought I would turn the spotlight on myself for this post. As much as I like pointing what&#8217;s wrong with society (so much), I decided it&#8217;s unfair to give off the impression that I&#8217;m not guilty of any sort of annoying behavior.</p>
<p><strong>5 Food Pics </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m that guy that will occasionally&#8211;and I do stress occasionally&#8211;post pictures of particularly delicious meals I&#8217;ve prepared. I&#8217;m well aware that most people don&#8217;t care one bit. Basically, food boils down to: &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s some food. I Guess I&#8217;ll eat it now.&#8221; For them, a picture of food is useless.</p>
<p>However, I like to cook, and one of my favorite shows presently, and for the last several years, is <em>No Reservations</em>. Frankly, I&#8217;m just proud that I was able to learn that particular skill set and feel some weird urge to prove it.</p>
<p>But, come on, like I&#8217;m not going to share this:</p>
<p><a href="http://burkpkrohe.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-616" title="Pork Roast" src="http://burkpkrohe.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/002.jpg?w=300&#038;h=276" alt="" width="300" height="276" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-615"></span></p>
<p><strong>4 Song Lyric Statuses</strong></p>
<p>Yep, I&#8217;m guilty of this, too.</p>
<p>I love music and collecting albums is a large part of my life. I think it&#8217;s only natural that it would bleed over into my virtual life. I guess I&#8217;m doubly guilty because often the lyrics are from bands most of the people on my friends list don&#8217;t know, giving off a hint condescension.</p>
<p>However, I would like to point out I post lyrics from the songs that are actually good, unlike some of my &#8220;friends,&#8221; who feel the need to post terrible, and often misspelled, Taylor Swift lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>3 Post Overloads</strong></p>
<p>Some of you might have gathered that I spend a lot of time on the Internet. That, combined with my profession, means I take in a lot of information in one day&#8211;videos, articles, pictures, etc&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="LolZombie" src="http://lolzombie.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/twitterburnout2.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="444" /></p>
<p>My natural reaction is to share those things because, &#8220;Hey, I like taking in new and interesting things as much as possible! Why wouldn&#8217;t everyone else?&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s become quite obvious based on a totally unscientific analysis of my newsfeed that not everyone shares my enthusiasm for links.</p>
<p><strong>2. Drunken Pictures </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Yeah, there are quite a few pictures of me enjoying an adult beverage on Facebook. I assure you it&#8217;s not intentional, though. As I pointed out in a previous post, guys and girls use the picture feature on Facebook much differently.</p>
<div id="attachment_620" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://burkpkrohe.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/wedding-bar.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-620" title="Wedding Bar" src="http://burkpkrohe.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/wedding-bar.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Busted. I wish I weren&#039;t wearing that particular shirt in this picture.</p></div>
<p>My friends and I don&#8217;t take our cameras to Buffalo Wild Wings when we go to watch a hockey game. For the most part, we only get the camera out when: vacationing, doing manly things (i.e. fishing or camping) or drinking.</p>
<p>Now, without context, some of those pictures might make it look like I was pretty irresponsible in college, but it&#8217;s not like there were people all around me photographically documenting all the hours I spent studying, working and writing.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m suspicious of people who lock down all their pictures or who meticulously (bordering on religiously) untag pictures to leave only the ideal image of themselves.</p>
<p>What are you hiding!?</p>
<p><strong>1. Passive Aggressively Correcting Others&#8217; Grammar</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re no doubt familiar with this. Perhaps you&#8217;ve been a victim of it or maybe you&#8217;ve just seen someone break after seeing a friend confuse &#8220;their&#8221; and &#8220;there&#8221; one too many times.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lknkosFu9b1qhe5udo1_400.png" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p>Please readers, hold you&#8217;re vitriol and let me explain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a journalist and fan of the English language in general, so I&#8217;m particularly sensitive to grammar. In fact, I would rather have an unstoppable nosebleed during an interview than mix up &#8220;your&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8217;re&#8221; in a tweet or status. Although, both have happened in the past.</p>
<p>So, when someone posts a status that resembles a 14-year-old cheerleader&#8217;s text message, it&#8217;s hard for me to let it go. If you&#8217;re not going to take five extra seconds to say something correctly then just shut up.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m friends with decent amount of journalists due to my time at Mizzou. And believe me, you have never seen passive aggression (or dorkiness) the likes of a reporter correcting a copy editor&#8217;s usage mistake.</p>
<p>*I look forward to someone in the comments pointing out a mistake.</p>

And they are not letting up. Why are they protesting? It depends on who you ask. Some argue that many Wall Street firms are not sacrificing their fair share of wealth distribution. Others are more labor-minded, protesting City University of New York for what they feel are their anti-union practices. But some critics say that this group of mostly under-twenty-somethings are not sure of why they are protesting to begin with. </p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been all to friendly with my treadmill. It was a great learning experience and I&#8217;m proud to say that I managed to stay on the darn thing for more than an hour. But once I arrived on this gorgeous campus, I realized that running outside would be so much more exciting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Stanford Campus" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ilo/f/f7/Stanford_campus_aerial_photo.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="236" /></p>
<p>Yep, that is right, be jealous. This is legitimately the most gorgeous campus I&#8217;ve ever step foot on. You drive up to the main building and are surrounded by palm trees. The other great fact? The area is mostly flat! Most people assumed it would be hilly since I&#8217;m close to San Francisco, but that is a horrible misconception.</p>
<p>Although I love being on the flat ground, there is one reservation where it is nothing but hills. I&#8217;d driven past the entrance a few times and saw my new Hill of Doom. I wasn&#8217;t initially planning to run the route, but somehow I got sucked in. I stopped a woman on my way up to the entrance and she mentioned that there were &#8220;a few hills&#8221; but she thought they were doable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://therunningjewess.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/elevation-map.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1134" title="My Elevation Map" src="http://therunningjewess.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/elevation-map.png?w=483&#038;h=206" alt="" width="483" height="206" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Doable, maybe, but it was brutal. My time fluctuated like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. You&#8217;ll notice that miles two to four were a constant incline, I&#8217;ll admit I took plenty of walk breaks trying to get to the peak. It was well worth it. From the top you can see the most amazing view of campus. And that hill on the way back to my apartment was quite the treat (and my fastest time for the whole run).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As I was hoofing it up I passed a larger woman who was struggling. I stopped to talk with her about the terrain and she was the sweetest. She warned me that the hills wouldn&#8217;t be over for a while; we had a nice time commiserating about the difficulty before she sent me on my way.<strong> Is it odd that I want to high five everyone I see that is kicking butt?</strong> She gave me a major boost and I continued on with a huge grin on my face (I&#8217;m a nerd).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve decided that I want to attack these hills once a week. My goal for the year is to improve enough to jog 90% of the trail. It is going to take a lot of dedication, but hopefully it will help me prepare for the Big Sur marathon next April.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>How frequently do you run hills? Do you have a hill of doom that you like to conquer?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://christinarosendahl.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/036323-fc50.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-324 alignleft" title="036323-FC50" src="http://christinarosendahl.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/036323-fc50.jpg?w=195&#038;h=300" alt="" width="195" height="300" /></a>In November 2010, my father died. He had been sick for years and then one day in November, he got sick in the night, was taken to the hospital and died later in the day &#8211; totally unexpected. My mother had been taken care of him and always put herself second. She called me and told me about how their life was, but although I felt bad for her, although I listened to her and tried to help her, I don&#8217;t think I ever really got it. I don&#8217;t think I ever understood how hard it was for her &#8211; not only having to take care of him but also feeling somewhat good and especially relieved when he was finally put into a nursing home.<br />
I was reminded of all this when reading this book.<br />
This is a book about the Lamberts, Enid and Alfred and their three grown-up children, Gary, Chip and Denise. Each of these has their own issues they struggle with. Enid and Alfred still live in the home where they raised their children even though it&#8217;s slowly falling apart and to big for just the two of them. Alfred is struggling with early Parkinsons and maybe dementia, making it a real chore for Enid to take care of him.<br />
Enid is desperately trying to keep her family together. She&#8217;s old-fashioned, has strict rules for how people ought to behave and is not always proud of the choices her children make. She comes across as a typical woman, set in her ways and determine to present herself to the neighborhood as having the perfect home and family.<br />
This is a story of a mother and wife, desperately fighting to have her family together in her home for one last christmas. Enid lives a life where she has to have something to look forward to to be able to make it &#8211; a cruise, the family christmas &#8211; but when you pin all your hopes on one thing, you are disappointed more often than not.Her children each struggle with their own problems &#8211; and neither of them are really living up to their mother&#8217;s expectations.<br />
Chip is the intellectual, he&#8217;s a struggling screenplay writer after he was fired from his job as a professor after having a relationship with one of his students. This not only lands him in a position where he owes his sister a lot of money but also makes him take a rather questionable job in Lithuania with his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s husband.<br />
Gary is the eldest brother. He lives with his wife and their three boys. Gary wants to be in control. He&#8217;s desperately trying not to admit that his life maybe isn&#8217;t perfect &#8211; in that way, he&#8217;s a lot like his mother. He&#8217;s fighting what seems to be a depression and is having a power struggle in his marriage, especially since his wife can&#8217;t stand his mother.<br />
Denise might be my favorite character in the book. She&#8217;s working hard to be what she wants to be. She&#8217;s an amazing chef and after a failed marriage, she suddenly get the opportunity of a lifetime to be the chef of a new restaurant where she gets to do whatever she wants and where the owner has money enough to support her no matter what. Denise, however, is struggling with her identity and sexuality and this is making her life rather difficult.<br />
Both Denise and Chip are having issues in their professional life because of their sexuality &#8211; something that&#8217;s rather hard for their mother to accept and come to terms with &#8211; while Gary is the know-it-all who thinks he pretty much should be in charge of everybody.<br />
But it&#8217;s so much more than this. This really dives into the relationship between parents and children and between siblings. It&#8217;s about children feeling more in the know than their parents ever were, it&#8217;s about all the things happening in a family beneath the surface &#8211; but sometimes bursting throughs in ways you least expect.<br />
This was an amazing book &#8211; especially because of the way it&#8217;s written. On the surface, it&#8217;s the story of an elderly couple struggling with getting old and sick while their kids are trying to find their way in life, not always having time for their parents. But because of Franzen&#8217;s masterly command of language, there is so much more in this book. It&#8217;s by no means a dysfunctional family &#8211; or at least not a more dysfunctional family than all other families. It&#8217;s a perfectly normal and ordinary family fighting with the issues every family faces. And that&#8217;s what makes it into such a wonderful book.<br />
I can&#8217;t say enough about the excellency of the writing. Not only is it beautiful, it&#8217;s also surprising. He uses a lot of words to describe a person &#8211; like Gary &#8211; and then in just one line, he sums up the totality of Gary&#8217;s relationship with his wife. Or at one point in the book, I expected something to happen &#8211; it didn&#8217;t happen, we switched viewpoint and a couple of pages went by and <em>then</em> it happened anyway and I got so surprised &#8230;<br />
I noticed a lot of reviews are calling it a sad book &#8211; and it <em>is</em> sad what they are going through. A family with a sick father who&#8217;s slipping away is a family desperately trying to find it&#8217;s way. Franzen manages to make his characters so real, their struggles so real, their thoughts feelings and fears so very real that maybe it becomes too much for some readers &#8211; but I could identify with these people and recognize parts of my family in them so I felt right at home.<br />
Sometimes, we want literature to take us away, sometimes we want a fantastic journey into an unknown reality where we can forget and just sigh with wonder. But sometimes, we need to learn about our own existence, learn about how the people around us are coping, by reading books that strike right at home. This is such a book.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_11040" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermangate.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11040 " title="shermangate" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermangate.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Welcome</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">2.2 acres would hardly seem large enough to contain all the horticultural excitement found at the Sherman Library &amp; Gardens in Orange County&#8217;s Corona del Mar. Along with the reference library, visitors will find the following: A tropical conservatory (complete with koi lagoon), a fern grotto, a rose garden, an herb garden, a Buddha-ready bo tree, colorful dahlia beds, and, the subject of this post, a cactus and succulent garden. Probably the size a suburban backyard, this garden area is not only stunning but it&#8217;s idea-packed as well. Let&#8217;s take a look inside &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-11039"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_11041" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanocotillo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11041 " title="shermanocotillo" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanocotillo.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Impactful diversity</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Instantly we&#8217;re wowed by the diversity of the plantings, not to mention the size of some specimens. I see that my favorite non-plant garden material, rocks, plays a big part in the scheme here.</p>
<div id="attachment_11042" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermansucculents.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11042  " title="shermansucculents" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermansucculents.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Succulent bedding</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">These succulent beds are controlled and display a lovely rhythm. I love the use of rocks with plant material here.</p>
<div id="attachment_11043" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermancrevices.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11043 " title="shermancrevices" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermancrevices.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In the fold</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tiny crevice gardens look especially sweet because of the contrast between rocky hardness and soft succulent rosettes.</p>
<div id="attachment_11086" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanrows.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11086  " title="shermanrows" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanrows.jpg?w=480&#038;h=1226" alt="" width="480" height="1226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Circular logic</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Set vertically, stone shards contain succulents in tight semi-circles. The result: graphic stripes of like-colors and textures with seductive eye appeal.</p>
<div id="attachment_11044" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermansucculentcolor.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11044 " title="shermansucculentcolor" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermansucculentcolor.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ground level tapestry</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Rich color combinations create a tapestry effect that&#8217;s irresistibly, singularly, succulent. Contained in terra-cotta pots, other succulents make like spectators in box seats.</p>
<div id="attachment_11045" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanvariegated.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11045 " title="shermanvariegated" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanvariegated.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big drama</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">The wow factor comes from the size of the succulents on display, as with this variegated beauty dwarfing Paul. I&#8217;ve got one in my garden that&#8217;s a third of the size of this one and it&#8217;s striking &#8230; but, at over six feet, this one&#8217;s positively explosive.</p>
<div id="attachment_11046" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanheight.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11046 " title="shermanheight" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanheight.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big reach</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">More super-tall examples &#8230; again, rock material both grounds and unites the plantings, their perfect complement.</p>
<div id="attachment_11047" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermannapolean.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11047 " title="shermannapolean" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermannapolean.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Strangely familiar</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">I&#8217;ve got so many of these plants at the Rancho, but can&#8217;t help but wonder if mine will ever achieve the same stature. Could the nearby Pacific be the reason for their proportions?</p>
<div id="attachment_11048" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandetails.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11048 " title="shermandetails" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandetails.jpg?w=420&#038;h=2054" alt="" width="420" height="2054" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eye candy</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Everywhere we looked there was something unexpected and wonderful &#8230; a feeling often triggered by seeing a familiar succulent in a color we&#8217;d never seen before, or massed in an overwhelmingly lush way like the suspended-and-hanging-to-the-floor example in hot pink &#8230; an enormous aloe tree with dozens of branches would be a suitable Sneetch perch.</p>
<div id="attachment_11049" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermantextures.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11049 " title="shermantextures" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermantextures.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Spiny, spiky</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Spikes and spines squiggle and pulse, jutting from rocky outcroppings in cool colors of gray and mauve, while green arrow-tipped arms rear up in the background.</p>
<div id="attachment_11050" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermancacti.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11050 " title="shermancacti" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermancacti.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Prickly gathering</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Chubby barrel cactus throw their weight around in this grouping that includes more whiskered, gnarled and deeply groovy examples.</p>
<div id="attachment_11051" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandrysteam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11051 " title="shermandrysteam" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandrysteam.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shadow and light</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Being a very bright day we were able to enjoy the effects of shadow and light as it defined mass and texture. That visual rhythm again comes into play and it&#8217;s evident a great deal of planning and consideration went into this relatively small garden&#8217;s creation.</p>
<div id="attachment_11052" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanagave.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11052 " title="shermanagave" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermanagave.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just beautiful</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Such a gorgeous respite from traffic and the noise of people, I almost don&#8217;t want to leave this place &#8230; It&#8217;s not vast by any means, yet I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve really seen it all. A return trip is a must &#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_11053" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandragons.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11053 " title="shermandragons" src="http://ranchoreubidoux.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/shermandragons.jpg?w=480&#038;h=640" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dragon trees on PCH</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">The namesake research library was closed when we visited so that&#8217;s another reason to return to <strong>Sherman Libray &amp; Gardens</strong>. Additionally, there is the three-course <em>prix fixe</em> lunch at the charming <strong><a title="Café Jardin reviews" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-jardin-at-sherman-gardens-corona-del-mar" target="_blank">Café Jardin </a></strong>on the grounds that needs addressing, as well as a tour of the gift shop. Altogether, a visit here would be a relaxing and rewarding way to spend a Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sherman Library &amp; Gardens</strong> offers classes and other events; click <a title="Sherman Library &amp; Gardens" href="http://www.slgardens.org/" target="_blank">here</a> for their website as well as other information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Click <a title="A Growing Obsession visits SL&amp;G" href="http://agrowingobsession.com/?p=20144" target="_blank">here </a>for a recent post by Denise at <strong><a title="A Growing Obsession" href="http://agrowingobsession.com/" target="_blank">A Growing Obsession</a></strong> blog. Her photography is especially lovely and offers a more intimate look at the succulents on display.</p>
