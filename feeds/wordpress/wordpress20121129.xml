				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em>You but arrive at the city to which you were destin&#8217;d &#8212; you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>before you are call&#8217;d by an irresistible call to depart.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach&#8217;d hands towards you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">                                            <em> Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road, Verse 11</em></p>
<p>My job gets a lot of reactions – nobody ever hears what I do and then says something bland and polite. Not surprisingly, especially when I’m leaving for someplace exotic (and particularly if it’s during an Alaskan winter), I hear a lot of “you have my dream job – I’m so jealous.” I don’t necessarily correct them, because to be honest, I kind of like the ego boost. I don’t talk about economy class and overnight bus rides and food poisoning and bug bites and impossibly hard pillows. But the most thoughtful reactions are the ones from people who realize that it’s a job, and that there are drawbacks to what I do. Most obvious is the toll on personal relationships.</p>
<p>“You can’t have everything.” Someone said this to me in passing last night – a small piece of a larger conversation that was dropped nonchalantly. But it stayed with me and I heard it over and over again all night and this morning. “You can’t have everything.” I keep trying to make sense of that sentence: what does it mean? My first thought is to wonder what it is I want, and what I appear to want. In the context of the conversation, I wondered what it was the speaker thought I might be asking for that I couldn’t have. Outside the context, on a larger scale, it’s a sentiment that has been repeated to me in various forms over the past few years. Dating is interesting: many guys are enamored by my lifestyle, but I know they’ll make the same mistake my ex-husband did: assume that some day I’ll change. I know that these guys aren’t interested in me in the long haul, even though it might take them years to discover that. And when I mention this to my friends, there’s always the inevitable “have you thought about sticking around for a while? How do you expect to have a relationship when you&#8217;re always running off somewhere?” No one ever says, “have these dudes thought about dropping their careers and traveling with you? Have they considered changing jobs to make the relationship easier?” No, of course not.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have your cake and eat it, too.&#8221; This sentiment also gets passed on to me, the assumption being that my work and my relationships are mutually exclusive, and that I can&#8217;t have one if I have the other. As though it is preposterous to even try on my part to maintain what I’m good at and passionate about. As though my career is frivolous.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget a conversation I had with my was-band early on in our relationship. He’s a super talented artist, and he told me that woodworking is what gets him out of bed in the morning. “It’s the one thing I’m really good at,” he said. I felt kind of sad for a while – I couldn’t think of anything like that in my life. And then I realized: travel is what I’m good at. This was long before I was a travel writer, and so the discovery that what got me out of bed in the morning was the anticipation of a new culture, new food, and even the smell and energy of an airport seemed a bit tragic and wasteful. Teaching seemed to be the only logical way to use my graduate degree. But then, with surprisingly little effort on my part it seemed, I was a Lonely Planet writer. And it was a job that made perfect sense – until my marriage deteriorated.</p>
<p>The thing is, I tried to change. I thought for sure that being in a quiet place would quiet my mind as well, that I would fall into the rhythm of a schedule and routine and appreciate my simple life in my small town. Instead I found that the lack of stimulation and variety drove me crazy, especially during winter. Anchorage &#8212; and its international airport, and Asian grocery stores, and movie theaters, and places where you could buy pants &#8212; was over two hours away on a road where I totaled my car my first winter living in Seward.</p>
<p>There are people who are good at managing people, good at being moms, in love with crafting, don’t enjoy travel. They’re finding their places in the world, doing what they love and what they are good at. They have successful relationships. My friends are incredibly successful people that amaze me at their abilities to grow. Their lives are relatable, tangible, and many fall into categories that our culture understands. Me not so much. I&#8217;ve wanted so much to be like them, to WANT consistency, and to be able to reap the benefits of stability. I&#8217;ve spent many lonely nights in buggy hotel rooms typing on a slow, tiny netbook, thinking about how if I had a regular job I could have money for a Mac, and a gym membership so that I could fit into (and afford) sexy jeans, and an awesome, successful boyfriend. In this daydream I drink a lot of wine and go out to eat a lot and take weekend trips, because isn&#8217;t that what you do?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Thailand has offered me a new crop of girlfriends, ones who are more like me (and here I am not discounting my incredible lady friends back home). These ladies are single, smart, savvy, and successful (apologies for that horrible alliteration). Independent and motivated, they lead lives that I can understand. One of these friends pointed out recently that our lives are flexible to a degree that makes most of our back-home friends uncomfortable. I realized how true this was when my bank account went into the negatives yesterday. But that flexibility allows us a freedom that most people can&#8217;t understand, and I think that that freedom is the reason behind what we do.</p>
<p>I understand that by eating the cake, it means you can&#8217;t have it &#8212; it&#8217;s gone. So you truly can&#8217;t have your cake and eat it, too. But I can&#8217;t just sit and stare at it. I&#8217;m going to fucking devour it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>GUEST POST BY CONGRESSWOMAN BETTY McCOLLUM</strong></p>
<p><em>Nearly a year ago, Congresswoman Betty McCollum, D-MN, traveled to Bangladesh to evaluate U.S.-funded initiatives that impact the health, education and economic security of women and girls, especially efforts to prevent child marriage. She also co-sponsored House Resolution 6087, the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act, designed to protect the rights of girls in developing countries. Companion legislation has already passed in the Senate, and McCollum&#8217;s bill was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_303" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 539px"><a href="http://tooyoungtowed.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mccollum-bangladesh-january-20121.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-303" title="McCollum Bangladesh-January 2012" alt="" src="http://tooyoungtowed.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mccollum-bangladesh-january-20121.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Congresswoman Betty McCollum visited Bangladesh in January.</p></div>
<p>On October 11 the world did something remarkable. Together, we celebrated International Day of the Girl Child – a day to recognize not only the basic human rights of young women but address the unique political, social and economic barriers faced by millions of girls around the world.  We know that when girls are valued, families, communities and nations thrive.</p>
<p>As a Member of Congress, I have been fortunate to visit many struggling countries and hear directly from women and girls. I&#8217;ve heard stories of anger and sadness about the stigma faced by girls simply because of their gender; I&#8217;ve also witnessed stories of hope and progress.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I traveled to Bangladesh and listened as students, mothers and community leaders told me of their work to prevent child marriage. While progress has been made, there is still work that must be done to end this human rights abuse. As a global community, we must commit to ensuring girls, their families and communities have access to the support and services they need to be healthy, educated and safe. We must stand firm that it is unacceptable that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, millions of young girls are forced to &#8220;marry&#8221; men decades older.</p>
<p>Nearly every day, 25,000 girls – some as young as 7 or 8 years old – are sold to men old enough to be their father or grandfather. These girls are almost always doomed to a life of poverty, abuse, poor health and limited economic opportunities.  Soon after she &#8220;marries,&#8221; a child bride will most likely get pregnant before her body has completed puberty.  Proper prenatal care is usually nonexistent, making her pregnancy and childbirth literal threats to her life.  According to the World Health Organization, pregnancy and childbirth complications are a leading cause of death for adolescent girls  in developing nations.</p>
<p>It is time for the global community to stand up for the millions of young girls who deserve the opportunity to grow, learn and achieve. Human rights leaders such as Archbishop <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/child-marriage-robs-girls-of-their-opportunities/2012/07/31/gJQAUd7kNX_story.html" target="_blank">Desmond Tutu and Graça Machel</a> have called on the United States to work with the international community and help provide the resources, tools and support needed to stop this abhorrent practice.  On Oct. 10, the day before the International Day of the Girl Child, <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/10/198803.htm" target="_blank">Secretary Clinton</a> <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/other/2012/198768.htm" target="_blank">committed the United States</a> to this fight because even though child marriage isn&#8217;t prevalent in the United States, its presence across the globe impacts our nation&#8217;s security and success.</p>
<p>Promoting gender equality and protecting basic freedoms are essential to productive, thriving nations.  The United States must take a stand in the fight against child marriage.  We invite other countries to do the same, on the Day of the Girl Child and every day of the year.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://mccollum.house.gov/" target="_blank">Congresswoman Betty McCollum</a> represents Minnesota&#8217;s Fourth Congressional District.  She serves on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees.</i></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Syria, which is engaged in a citizen revolt, has been cut off from the Internet according to several reports. This tactic isn't all that difficult implement and is becoming more common, making the need for new open source technologies for wireless communications necessary. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=589246&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Updated</strong>: Syria is cut off from the Internet, according to The Renesys blog and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/hussein-rifai-dead_n_2210360.html">other media sites</a> citing Syrian rebels, bringing about an isolation that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/web/syria-internet/index.html">many feared</a> was coming to the country. The country is engaged in a citizen-led insurgency against the existing government, which was sparked after Syrian President Bashar Assad brutally cracked down on protesters.</p>
<p>The Renesys <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2012/11/syria-off-the-air.shtml">blog entry</a> is short, and promises updates. From the Renesys blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting at 10:26 UTC (12:26pm in Damascus), Syria&#8217;s international Internet connectivity shut down. In the global routing table, all 84 of Syria&#8217;s IP address blocks have become unreachable, effectively removing the country from the Internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cutting off entire countries form the global Internet has become a strategy employed by some governments in times of civil unrest &#8212; and underscores <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/08/22/libya-bart-and-tethering-understanding-the-webs-weak-points/">many of the weak points of the Internet itself</a>. Both <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/20/us-libya-protests-internet-idUSTRE71I3XJ20110220">Libya</a>, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13510_3-57374594-21/iran-cuts-off-internet-access/">Iran</a> and Egypt pulled much of their connections to the web world offline in the last two years. We explained <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/01/28/how-egypt-switched-off-the-internet/">how Egypt took the country offline</a> in this post:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OpenNet Initiative has outlined two methods by which most nations could enact such shutdowns. Essentially, officials can either close down the routers which direct traffic over the border — hermetically sealing the country from outsiders — or go further down the chain and switch off routers at individual ISPs to prevent access for most users inside.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time Egypt took the second route to take the country offline, a process made easier by the fact that their were few ISPs to contact. It&#8217;s unclear how Syria disconnected its citizens. Some news reports say insurgents are communicating still via satellite phones, but the lost of IP addresses means no IP services can find their way to end users within the country. When a packet destined for a Syrian IP address is sent, it simply can&#8217;t find out where it&#8217;s supposed to go.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here&#8217;s what that drop off in traffic looks like, courtesy of Akamai (s akam). </p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/akamai-syria.jpg"><img src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/akamai-syria.jpg?w=590" alt=""   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-589370" /></a></p>
<p>This is one reason that technologies such as OpenBTS, Commotion, the Serval Project and other technologies to build out <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/02/17/building-the-technology-stack-for-internet-freedom/">open source communications networks</a> are important. While those may not ensure that people in Syria can talk to the outside world unless they have a satellite backhaul, they could still communicate with one another independently of the local ISPs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Lady in the SUV,</p>
<p>You will not remember me, most likely. But I would like to briefly share my story, and how it is that you fit into it.</p>
<p>My girl and I have taken to looking at the ground when we hold hands in public – avoiding as much human eye contact as possible. And hey, if they are walking their dog, I avoid their gaze too; you just never know how deep a person’s hatred may run: maybe so deep their dog would give me a disapproving look as well. Anyways, I don’t like to risk it.</p>
<p>The first time she took my hand in public, we were at the grocery store. And I swear I radiated heat like Death Valley during the summer, feeling the glares on my back. It was painful, for both of us, but we refused to play victim to the hate, and just continued to squeeze each others’ hands a little tighter saying, “Hey, I’m here. I love you. I’ll endure every hateful glance till the end of time as long as you are by my side.”</p>
<p>A few months down the road, we have developed slightly thicker skin. But, I won’t lie, some of those glares still hurt: like the guy we passed on our way to Rite Aid; or the old man who I swear, literally stopped in his tracks when he saw us; or the lady who kept stealing glances at our hands when we saw <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wicked</span> – “No, I <i>still</i> haven’t let go of her hand! Get over it.” (Or that’s what I wish I had said, anyways.) Some of these instances will be forever seared in our brain, like a cut that becomes a scar for all of eternity to remind us of the pain we have endured.</p>
<p>I tell you this so that you know what an incredibly important part of our story you have played.</p>
<p>We were walking across the parking lot, heading to this little diner to grab some breakfast. We were holding hands. “Why?” some people might ask. “Well, because I love her and felt like it.” That’s when I saw your car, window down, woman (you) in the front seat, glancing in our direction. I shot my gaze downward as quickly as I could. I didn’t feel like enduring the glares that morning. You passed in front of us, and that’s when she squeezed my hand and screamed, “Babe! She smiled at us.”</p>
<p><i>I’m sorry, huh? Repeat.</i></p>
<p>“Babe! That lady! She turned around in her seat and <i>smiled</i> at us!”</p>
<p><i>Is this real life?</i></p>
<p>I cannot describe the magnitude of that smile. It made us float on up to Cloud Nine and stay there for the rest of the day. It was the first time someone looked close enough to ignore that we were gay, and instead, saw the love we shared between us. Better yet, I don’t think you “ignored” that we were gay. If you smiled, I think it actually made you <i>happy</i>.</p>
<p>I’m sad to say that this moment we shared with you is one of the very few that felt the same: there was the girl in San Diego – a Megan Rapinoe look-alike, might I add – who beamed at us and said, “You guys are beautiful!” And this guy, shortly thereafter, who told us that we were “a great couple!” But that’s it.</p>
<p>So I want to thank you, and them, for the pure joy that was written across your faces. You will never know what crossing paths with you did for us, or how afterwards we screamed in ecstasy like teenage girls at a Justin Beiber concert. Yes, you made us <i>that</i> happy.</p>
<p>I hope that you will continue to love complete strangers like us in this way – because you never know when someone needs to hear those words or see that smile. And finally, to those who glare, one day I hope you will look at all relationships through the same lens: one of acceptance and joy and love. Because you never know if those crissed-crossed eyebrows will be the one thing that sends a lost soul over the edge. So, I am asking you to adhere to that rule that we learn as children: “If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Or, “If you can’t look without scrunching up your eyebrows, try closing your eyes.”</p>
<p>But, to the lady in the SUV, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Forever grateful,</p>
<p>Her button</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>Everyone loves superheroes. But not everyone considers what it&#8217;s like to be a member of the supporting cast of a comic book series. However, if we&#8217;re honest most of us are the kind of people who qualify more as supporting cast than main characters. So this week, I offer to you my suggestions for things to keep in mind should you ever find yourself trapped as a minor character in a comic book:</p>
<p>1. Never date a superhero. It can never end well, and will most likely result in emotionally traumatizing events.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">a. Yes, even if you have superpowers, too.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>2. Never date a supervillian. For all their charisma, power and (inevitably) good looks, there&#8217;s far too much narcissism required to go into that field of work to be good for a relationship.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">a. Reforming them through the Power of Love is right out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>3. Look into the sidekick business. Even in comic books without superpowers the sidekick gets a really sweet deal. They&#8217;re usually the ones with boyfriends/girlfriends or spouses, steady income and no need for a legion of personal psychiatrists. After all, someone must remind the hero of all they gave up to do the right thing, might as well be you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>4. Alternatively, look into being a reporter of some sort. You can get along with the protagonists as much or as little as you like without getting into trouble, as Freedom of the Press is always treasured by comic book heroes for some reason. Plus you get to see all the action with no personal danger!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>5. If you discover/create some kind of material that is incredibly rare (or unique) in all of earth, make sure you permanently transform it into some kind of purely defensive weapon. Supervillains won&#8217;t want it then.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>6. Alternatively, immediately throw it into the ocean. They can&#8217;t kidnap you for something you don&#8217;t have!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>7. Resist the urge to name anything after ancient mythic figures. It only attracts trouble.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">a. The same goes for putting &#8220;ium&#8221; at the end of a newly discovered substance&#8217;s name, particularly if it is nearly indestructible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">b. Place names like &#8220;Wonderland&#8221; or &#8220;Niflheim&#8221; are right out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>8. Look into homeownership instead of renting. Henchmen seem much more reluctant to break into freestanding buildings as opposed to apartments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>9. If you should have the opportunity to &#8220;borrow&#8221; the source of a hero&#8217;s power, or to joyride in the tricked out car/plane/power armor the hero uses, never take it. Something bad that you&#8217;re not trained to handle is bound to happen, and you&#8217;ll be left holding the bag.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">a. The same applies even if you have permission.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>10. If you should discover whatever business or corporation your local villain is using to fund his nefarious activities take the earliest available opportunity to invest. Those businesses usually do well for some reason.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>11. Never eat or drink anything until you&#8217;ve seen the main character do so first. Dying just to warn them something is poisoned is a lame way to go.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>12. Never ask questions about the supervillain&#8217;s nefarious plot. It only singles you out as smart enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p>By all means share any other tips you can think of in the comments below. Also, while a bit less generic than these, the <a href="http://shieldrecruitsurvivaltips.tumblr.com/">Survival Tips for S.H.I.E.L.D. Recruits</a> tumblr is both funny and extensive. Most advice in there can be extrapolated upon to fit many situations.</p>
<p>If you plan on being an evil minion instead of a helpful red shirt, consult the <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">Evil Overlord List</a> for things to keep in mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK. I&#8217;m going to admit something. And a lot of you are not going to like it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like pets.</p>
<p>No. I REALLY don&#8217;t like pets.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a dog person, I&#8217;m not a cat person. I am a, &#8220;Oh God, get that thing away from me!&#8221; person. The kind of person who crosses to the other side of the street if they see a dog walker approaching. The kind of person who leans away awkwardly when someone asks them to pat their cat. The kind of person who gets disproportionately annoyed when people post pictures of their pets on Facebook. I don&#8217;t like the way pets smell. I don&#8217;t like their fur. I don&#8217;t like the fact that they hang around all the time, but don&#8217;t talk. What&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>
<p>I blame my parents. Growing up, we never had a pet (apart from a brief dalliance with crazy crabs foisted on us as a birthday present. We didn&#8217;t feed them. They died). My Dad, when he was a kid, conducted experiments on his pet cat, in an attempt to disprove they theory that they always land on their feet (he grew up to be a doctor, not a serial killer, by the way). My brother was allergic to dogs. As a family, we didn&#8217;t look fondly on pets. And with three siblings to play with, I never saw the need for a four-legged friend.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I reached adulthood, that I realised that not liking pets was something of a social faux pas. You are meant to tell people their dogs are cute, even if they&#8217;re slobbery, barking, dirty, pooing, well, DOGS. You are meant to pat them. And not rush to wash your hands immediately afterwards. You are meant to find a story of a cat bringing home a dead bird amusing, rather than HORRIFYING (the only thing worse, for me, than the thought of an animal, is the thought of an animal with another dead animal in its mouth).</p>
<p>And when you meet a potential partner, you should do the same. Act interested when they tell you about their pet. Pat said pet when introduced. Go along with talks about the future, which involve a house and a dog. Try not to recoil in horror at the thought of a house with dog hair all over it. A future where you have to get home early, to feed the cat. A future that involves shovelling dog poo. For some men, the pet question is more important than the baby question. A future, with a pet, is non-negotiable.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been pondering this point a lot lately. Wondering if I should tone down my pet hate. Seem a bit more flexible about my future, be more polite about other people&#8217;s animals. Bury the fear and disgust, and just chill out.</p>
<p>Because this new me should be able to do it, right? Think about all the brave things I&#8217;ve done this year, the acceptances I&#8217;ve made, the maturity I&#8217;ve shown! Being cool around animals is just another self-improvement I can make!</p>
<p>Well yesterday, the universe decided to test me.</p>
<p>I was sitting inside, working on a job application, when A CAT JUMPED THROUGH THE WINDOW. INTO MY HOUSE.</p>
<p>And what did the new, chilled out, pet-accepting Claire do?</p>
<p>Screamed. Shouted, &#8220;Go AWAY! Go AWAY! I don&#8217;t LIKE YOU!&#8221; Decided I could probably touch the cat with the bottom of my shoe, without getting cat rabies. Tried to push it tentatively towards a door. Shouted some more. &#8220;Go AWAY! Get out of MY HOUSE! I really don&#8217;t LIKE YOU!&#8221;</p>
<p>After five traumatic minutes, the amused cat decided to take pity on the crazed blogger and wandered outside. I collapsed on a couch, heart pounding, vowing to never open a window, EVER AGAIN.</p>
<p>Yep, cool as a cucumber.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Thanks to Maya at Feministing, I now know that today is Giving Tuesday. Maya <a href="http://feministing.com/2012/11/27/i-give-to-abortion-funds-because/">shared her reasons for giving to abortion access groups</a> and inspired me to talk about why I give. So here goes&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I give because I can.</p>
<p>And I give to NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the National Network of Abortion Funds because access to reproductive health care is a big fucking deal and too many women are losing that access because of systems of inequality in our lives.</p>
<p>If this is your first time reading the blog, I feel like I should give you the quick and dirty of my background.  I&#8217;m white, middle class, cisgendered, and educated &#8211; especially when it comes to issues of access to reproductive health care. In short, I get to carry a freakin&#8217; Prada backpack of privilege around with me wherever I go.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZohXruwOznI/T9X-JoJKbOI/AAAAAAAAVOw/2BL0iZlDuhQ/s1600/tumblr_m3ewl2gy9p1qhw4wvo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZohXruwOznI/T9X-JoJKbOI/AAAAAAAAVOw/2BL0iZlDuhQ/s1600/tumblr_m3ewl2gy9p1qhw4wvo1_500.jpg" height="298" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A few months ago, me and my knapsack o&#8217;privilege made an appointment at the Planned Parenthood in downtown Boston for routine STI testing. In addition to being a vocal proponent of routine STI testing, I had just capped off a week of lecture on access to birth control and abortion in light of Supreme Court decisions and figured that I might as well practice what I preach.</p>
<p>On the Saturday in question, I bop over to the PP center, park my car, grab a coffee, and meander on down the street blithely oblivious to my surroundings. As I walk towards PP, I notice a bunch of people outside. I think to myself <em>someone must be selling Girl Scout Cookies. </em></p>
<p>Seriously. This is my exact thought at this moment.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t girl scout cookies. In fact, all of those people who I assumed were queuing up for cookies are pro-life protesters.</p>
<p>They have signs. They are yelling. Granted, they are not yelling at any particular person but they are still there.</p>
<p>I pause at the corner of the street and think about calling the police.</p>
<p>I pull out my phone to google &#8220;Massachusetts abortion clinic buffer zone&#8221;.</p>
<p>I frown at the protesters.</p>
<p>Two women in neon yellow vests are standing in front of the protesters. I walk towards them, they escort me in.</p>
<p>After I hand off my giant purse and jewelry to the security guard, I start to shake. I&#8217;m mad at myself for being hesitant. I&#8217;m mad at the protesters for breaking the <a href="http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section120E1~2">35 foot buffer zone law</a>. I&#8217;m suddenly feeling very slut-shamed for even wanting to get tested. I start to worry whether anyone saw me walking into the center &#8211; do they think I need an abortion? I start to worry about my worrying about people thinking I&#8217;m having an abortion &#8211; what does that say about society&#8217;s view of abortion? About me and the way I let society influence my thoughts?</p>
<div id="attachment_1530" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://feministlawprof.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1530" title="photo" alt="" src="http://feministlawprof.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" height="300" width="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My artistic rendering of me and my thoughts.</p></div>
<p>I set off the metal detector with my giant watch.The security guard and I laugh.</p>
<p>The appointment itself is uneventful. I hand over my health insurance information which I&#8217;m lucky to be able to afford, speak with a doctor and nurse who look just like me, pocket all of the free condoms, and go on my way.</p>
<p>When I leave, the protesters are gone but all those feelings aren&#8217;t. I&#8217;m completely shaken by the experience and if I&#8217;m shaken, I can&#8217;t imagine what people who don&#8217;t have my shield of privilege must have felt like this morning.</p>
<p>How many women didn&#8217;t show up for their appointments because they were afraid the protesters would harm them? Or shame them? Or recognize them?</p>
<p>How many women left their appointments when asked for health insurance information because they didn&#8217;t have any? How many women didn&#8217;t bother to make an appointment because they knew they couldn&#8217;t afford the care?</p>
<p>How many women sat in the exam room unable to communicate with their doctor or nurse because they didn&#8217;t speak the same language? Or failed to share important information because of a cultural barrier?</p>
<p>I get it. Throwing money at a problem this vast, with so many intersecting issues, isn&#8217;t the whole answer, but it&#8217;s part of it.</p>
<p>So to help those who can work at coming up with answers, I donate.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://secure.prochoiceamerica.org/site/Donation2?df_id=13180&amp;13180.donation=form1&amp;JServSessionIdr004=91hndeyxm2.app220b">NARAL</a>, so they can lobby Congress to support women&#8217;s right to choose.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://secure.ppaction.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=pp_ppol_Nondirected_OneTimeGift&amp;__utma=1.1887799502.1354047759.1354047759.1354047759.1&amp;__utmb=1.3.10.1354047759&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1354047759.1.1.utmcsr=google|utmccn=(organic)|utmcmd=organic|utmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=65329838">Planned Parenthood</a>, so they can continue to provide a wide range of health services, including routine screenings for breast cancer and STI testing.</p>
<p>And to the <a href="https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6713/donate_page/donate">National Network of Abortion Funds</a>, so they can help fund abortions for women in need who cannot afford one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sp33deeohsix.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/smbbox.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2511" title="Can Gaming Help Your Writing? Yes. Yes It Can!" alt="" src="http://sp33deeohsix.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/smbbox.png?w=219&#038;h=300" height="300" width="219" /></a>I&#8217;m a gamer from way back.  My dad brought home the original NES one day about twenty some years ago, and since them I&#8217;ve been hooked.  In the early days, my brother and I played out our on screen adventures on a little black and white television as my parents were afraid that hooking the system to the living room TV would ruin it in short order, under the possibly dubious assumption that game systems were bad for televisions.  We upgraded when my parents bought a new TV and allowed us to use their hand me down TV.  Let me tell you, that was a huge improvement!</p>
<p>My brother and I spent hours and hours lost in the gaming world.  Legend of Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Final Fantasy, and many, many more games.  Eventually, when we got a computer, we got games for that as well.  Point being, I&#8217;ve played a LOT of video games in my time.  And I think that it has made me a better writer.  That might seem like a funny thing to say, given gaming&#8217;s reputation for rotting the minds of the younger generation, but really when you look at the medium closely it becomes obvious it isn&#8217;t so strange at all.</p>
<p>The key is that games are interactive.  Certainly, a book puts you in a character&#8217;s head and lets you see the world through their eyes.  A movie does the same, although in a different way.  But in a game, you get to control the story!  Sure there are set points for advancement through every story, but you have to figure out how to get there.  Even if it&#8217;s a simple platformer like Mario, you still have to figure out how to get through the level to get to the castle at the end (only to inevitably find the princess isn&#8217;t there!).  Games allow you to explore, to play, in a way that books and movies never can.  They actually encourage creativity and a sense of curiosity, especially adventures and RPGs.</p>
<p>Plus, games can give you a basic idea of how to put a story together.  Usually the story line in a game leaves a lot to be desired in terms of depth and content (especially older games, with some notable exceptions such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6), but in a very basic sense they illustrate what a plot ought to be.  Take Super Mario Bros, for example.  The story problem is that Bowser has kidnapped the Princess.  Mario has to go on a journey to save her, fighting through Bowser&#8217;s minions the whole way, until the final confrontation and the resolution, where our plucky plumber hits a switch and dumps the fiendish Bowser into a pool of lava.</p>
<p>Notice how Bowser is the engine of the story&#8217;s conflict.  He wants to keep the princess, and Mario wants to save her.  This basic conflict drives the entire game, just as the basic conflict between your protagonist and Final Boss in a story should drive the story conflict.  Also, as Mario approaches his objective, the obstacles in front of him become increasingly difficult to surmount.  Believe me, the last few levels of SMB get pretty hairy!</p>
<p>Then comes the climactic confrontation with Bowser, where we learn how NOT to tell a story.  You see, it is rare for a boss fight in a video game to live up to the hype; the Big Baddie usually turns out to be a Big Wuss.  Take Mario, for example.  Sure there is more stuff flying around and what not, but really the battle with Bowser is no different than the battle with the bosses at the end of every level previous.  In a book, you can&#8217;t let the climactic battle flop.  It has to be gloves off, no holds barred, and mind blowing.  You&#8217;ve ratcheted up the tension and hopefully have your reader with a white knuckle grip on your book, feverishly turning the pages to see what happens next.  Make the release of tension explosive!</p>
<p>Once the battle with Bowser is over, the resolution comes.  You finally find the princess and credits roll.  Now the ending of a book has to be a bit more emotionally satisfying than that, but the principle remains.  You have to tie up the loose ends and satisfactorily end the story conflict.  Games have an edge over books in this department, as the pay off comes from the conquest.  You fought HARD to get to the end, and even if its just a cheesy line of dialog from a pixelated lady then credits, it feels really good to see that.  However, an author can simulate this feeling of payoff by really toying with their readers, by making them sweat for the protagonist all through the story.  If you do your job right, the reader should be really anxious by the time the climax roles around, feeling like they&#8217;ve been through the ringer right along with the character.  It might not be the same as battling through the mayhem with a digital avatar, but it&#8217;s close!</p>
<p>So, writers, don&#8217;t feel bad when you indulge your gaming habit.  You&#8217;re making yourself a better writer, and having a blast doing it.</p>
