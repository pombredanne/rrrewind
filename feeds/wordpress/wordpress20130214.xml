		<description><![CDATA[Blogger Maria Popova has come under fire from a number of critics for her use of undisclosed affiliate links on her blog Brainpickings, which highlights how heated the debate over alternative forms of advertising has become.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=224723&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been <a href="http://mediagazer.com/130213/p41#a130213p41">a lot of sound and fury recently</a> about a blogger named Maria Popova, who makes her living by curating links to smart content on her Brainpickings blog. Popova has been quite vocal about how she <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/donate/">doesn&#8217;t like traditional advertising</a> and instead relies on donations from her readers, in much the same way that former Daily Beast <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/01/28/andrew-sullivan-nate-silver-and-the-shifting-balance-of-power-for-media-brands/">blogger Andrew Sullivan now does</a>. But that commitment was recently challenged by an anonymous critic who noted that Popova also gets revenue from affiliate links to sites like Amazon (s amzn) &#8212; and the resulting debate says a lot about the future of both content and advertising.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why this incident has drawn so much attention is that Popova seems like a great example of the kind of self-sustaining media entity many bloggers &#8212; and even traditional journalists &#8212; aspire to become. While she may not be in the same league as Sullivan, who employs a team to run his Daily Dish blog (and who will <a href="http://event.gigaom.com/paidcontent/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=intext&amp;utm_term=223801+andrew-sullivan-nate-silver-and-the-shifting-balance-of-power-for-media-brands&amp;utm_content=mathewingram">be speaking at our paidContent Live</a> conference in New York on April 17), the idea that someone can make a living by simply curating excellent content in return for donations is inspiring.</p>
<h2 id="are-affiliate-links-a-sneaky-f">Are affiliate links a sneaky form of advertising?</h2>
<p>The Popova case has also become a flashpoint because as traditional advertising becomes less lucrative, publishers are turning to alternative forms of advertising such as &#8220;native&#8221; or sponsored content &#8212; something that <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/01/16/what-we-can-learn-from-the-atlantics-sponsored-content-debacle/">caused a similar firestorm of criticism</a> for <em>The Atlantic</em> recently &#8212; as well as affiliate-related content. Gawker is hiring writers to create what it calls &#8220;commerce journalism&#8221; that is <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/01/24/nick-denton-says-gawkers-advertising-future-is-affiliate-links-and-commerce-journalism/">designed to drive revenue</a> from affiliate links. But standards on disclosure and other elements of these new forms of advertising are all over the map.</p>
<p><a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/02/14/the-brainpickings-brouhaha-and-the-problem-with-affiliate-links/brainpicker1/" rel="attachment wp-att-224727"><img src="http://gigaompaidcontent.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainpicker1.png?w=720" alt="brainpicker1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-224727" /></a></p>
<p>In a number of profiles, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/fashion/maria-popova-has-some-big-ideas.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">a glowing one in the Sunday</a> <em>New York Times</em>, Popova comes across as a highly intelligent and motivated individual &#8212; a former recreational bodybuilder from Bulgaria who started <a href="http://brainpickings.org">Brainpickings</a> as a way of collecting interesting links to books and other content. The reputation of the blog seems to have spread fairly quickly, to the point where luminaries like former State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter said they support her through donations in the same way they support National Public Radio. And Popova has said repeatedly that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2012/dec/30/maria-popova-brain-pickings-internet">she is proud to be advertising free</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="quote-it-doesnt-put-the-re"><p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t put the reader&#8217;s best interests first – it turns them into a sellable eyeball, and sells that to advertisers. As soon as you begin to treat your stakeholder as a bargaining chip, you&#8217;re not interested in broadening their intellectual horizons or bettering their life. I don&#8217;t believe in this model of making people into currency. You become accountable to advertisers, rather than your reader.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That rosy picture got a little blurrier over the past couple of days, however, after an anonymous blogger (later revealed to be Tom Bleymaier, founder of a startup in Palo Alto, Calif.) posted on Tumblr <a href="http://on-advertising.tumblr.com/post/42994773187/maria-popova-have-you-made-1m-on-affiliate-ads-while">about Popova&#8217;s liberal use of affiliate links</a> &#8212; that is, links to books and other products on e-commerce sites (primarily Amazon) that provide her with a payment if one of her readers clicks through. The anonymous blogger extrapolated from Popova&#8217;s traffic numbers and estimated that she could generate between $200,000 and $400,000 a year from those links.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>.@<a href="https://twitter.com/underoak">underoak</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/moorhen">moorhen</a> blogs that bring in money should have on-site disclosures about where it is coming from. cc @<a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker">brainpicker</a></p>&mdash; <br />Staci D Kramer (@sdkstl) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/sdkstl/status/302097811942559745' data-datetime='2013-02-14T16:51:45+00:00'>February 14, 2013</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="disclosure-is-always-better-if">Disclosure is always better if you want trust</h2>
<p>Given that kind of income &#8212; from something that is pretty clearly a form of advertising, although perhaps a non-traditional one &#8212; the Tumblr critic argued that Popova&#8217;s claim to be &#8220;advertising free&#8221; is clearly inaccurate. He also argued that some of her donors might <a href="http://on-advertising.tumblr.com/post/42994773187/maria-popova-have-you-made-1m-on-affiliate-ads-while">think twice about giving her money</a> every month if they knew that she was deriving a substantial amount of income from affiliate links, something that Popova didn&#8217;t disclose before or after a reader clicked on one of those links (<strong>Note</strong>: She has since added disclosure <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/donate/">to her donations page</a>).</p>
<p>Reuters blogger Felix Salmon <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/02/13/blogonomics-maria-popova-edition/">followed up with a post about Popova</a>, repeating some of the financial claims made by Bleymaier and adding some of his own. Popova has since responded to both Salmon and Betabeat &#8212; which also <a href="http://betabeat.com/2013/02/maria-popova-brain-pickings-affiliate-links-amazon-on-advertising-tumblr-ads-ads-ads/">published a critical post about her practices</a> &#8212; saying she doesn&#8217;t see affiliate links as advertising, is open about using them, and doesn&#8217;t make anything close to what Bleymaier said she does.</p>
<blockquote id="quote-those-numbers-are-lu2"><p>&#8220;Those numbers are ludicrous! If Amazon gave me even a tenth of that a year after Uncle Sam takes his fair share, I’d be delighted. I&#8217;ve been completely honest about the Amazon links with anyone who’s ever asked – and have many, many, many emails I’m happy to forward – and have brought it up myself multiple times in talks and on Twitter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of Popova&#8217;s supporters have said they are happy to have her get revenue from her writing in any way possible, and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesilberman/status/302138662668337153">don&#8217;t mind the lack of disclosure</a> about her use of affiliate links. Others, however, have questioned why she wouldn&#8217;t attach a simple disclaimer to her site &#8212; especially on the donation page &#8212; to note that she uses them (and some have even pointed out that this kind of disclaimer is arguably required by law, due to FTC regulations <a href="http://diannej.com/blog/2012/05/new-ftc-rules-on-writing-reviews-affiliations-and-sponsored-posts/">on disclosing marketing-related content</a>).</p>
<p>I think the main point that Salmon makes in his post on the issue is a good one: namely, that if you are relying on donations from your fans for your livelihood &#8212; as Sullivan is, and others such as musician Amanda Palmer are &#8212; then <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/02/13/blogonomics-maria-popova-edition/">it behooves you to be as open as possible</a> about your financial arrangements, in the interests of increasing the trust your readers or fans have in you. Sullivan and Palmer have both been <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/01/31/what-andrew-sullivan-and-amanda-palmer-have-in-common-a-fanatical-devotion-to-users/">extremely forthcoming</a> about their financial situations, an approach Popova might want to imitate.</p>
<p><em>This story was updated at 5:00 pm to note that Popova has added disclosure of her affiliate links to her donations page, as she <a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker/status/302172114155360256">noted on Twitter</a>.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that Macklemore song in which he sings about a broken keyboard?  Well, not to sound like a total groupie or anything but yeah, I bought a broken keyboard.  For $7.99 at the Ballard location of Goodwill Seattle.  I don&#8217;t mind if you&#8217;re slightly oh-so jealous.</p>
<p>I am not a tech savvy person, by any stretch of the imagination.  My fiancé, on the other hand, is in the software industry and does stuff like write code/invent new software patents.  He is like the right brain to my left one.  Together, we form a somewhat complete brain, but missing many many (several) key elements.  He is a good man for putting up with all of my technical ineptitudes throughout the years.  Here are some prime examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;">I broke my laptop.  He asked me what I was looking for in a new one e.g. storage space, battery life, image quality.  I told him I wanted something with a big flat surface on top, so that I can close it up and use it as a lunch tray when noon rolls around.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;">I once came up with an idea for an invention.  I called it The Lunch Tray Laptop 2.1 EXL with dual cup holder attachments and silverware portals.  This idea did not make it much further than my brain.  The left one.</span></li>
<li>I used a Nokia flip phone for many years, until my sister told me it was embarrassing to see me navigate a phone with a missing #9 button.  I told her I was keeping my vintage phone for as long as it worked.  She bought me a Nexus.  It then sat in its box for a month until my vintage phone with the &#8220;perfectly aged peeling paint&#8221; crapped out.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">I rarely watch T.V.  For the occasional dose of <em>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, </em>I call up my fiancé to turn it on.  My favorite T.V. show is the one in which I stare at my reflection off of a blank television set, for thirty minute increments at a time.  No reruns.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">So what does a technically handicapped person do with a broken keyboard?  Valentine&#8217;s Day gift for my computer lover.  My plan was to make a picture frame composed of keyboard letters/numbers.  Here is what I rounded up: alcohol, broken keyboard, E-6000 glue and a flat faced picture frame.  I bought this frame at an Austin Goodwill for $2.99.  It was made by someone named &#8220;Newton&#8221;.  Let&#8217;s just assume his first name is &#8220;Isaac&#8221;, shall we?  The alcohol is optional.  It makes for some interesting glueing techniques, so keep it handy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Step 1:  Pour yourself a drink.  Or two.  You may need a nap if you go beyond three.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0941.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1610" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0941.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Step 2:  Pop out the letters of the keyboard and arrange them on the picture frame.  There will be some spacing in between some of the letters, so use this to your advantage. Arrange the spaces artistically.  Then take the E-6000 glue you&#8217;ve been sniffing, and glue everything into place.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_09571.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1629" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_09571.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Step 3:  I left the frame to dry a bit and figured I should come up with some backing to the frame, if I intend to use it to hold pictures.  Keeping in line with the computer theme, I decided to use the cardboard box that my laptop came in.  I just cut it down to the measurement of the frame.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0973.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1624" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0973.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Since I&#8217;m usually behind the camera, we don&#8217;t have many family portraits.  Or at least cute ones.  By &#8220;family&#8221;, I mean my fiancé, the dog and myself.  So I drew one.  On lined paper, since I kind of like the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0978.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1635" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0978.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here we are.  The drawing&#8217;s scale is pretty accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0988.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1639" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0988.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I actually snuck in some words and phrases while I was arranging the letters.  This one reads, &#8220;I am John&#8221; as you can very well read for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0989.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1640" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0989.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And then the bottom goes, &#8220;Software Guy&#8221;.  This one requires a few extra IQ points.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0990.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-1644" alt="Image" src="http://willcraftforfood.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0990.jpg?w=710" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And here is the romantic keyboard picture frame for my Valentine.  I plan to present it to him while whispering sweet Java script in his ear.  Maybe some C++ action.  I don&#8217;t know.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21429544">North Korea&#8217;s third nuclear test has provoked the expected condemnation from the international community.</a> With sanctions against Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s state already pretty severe, the usual dilemma of what punishment to impose on the North Koreans without resorting to military might is confounding leading statesmen.</p>
<p>As mentioned before on this blog, there is likely to follow a period of diplomatic brinksmanship before the North Koreans extract an alleviation of certain sanctions in exchange for a promise to dismantle its nuclear programme. Talks and posturing will rumble on, maybe even with the return of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/six-party-talks-north-koreas-nuclear-program/p13593">Six-Party Talks,</a> before the next nuclear test is undertaken and the process is repeated.</p>
<p>North Korea&#8217;s leader has cause to feel vulnerable. His state is isolated, shorn of allies, internationally castigated. Yet it also suffers from a historical vulnerability that has always plagued the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Strategically located between China, Japan and Russia, Korea has historically been highly sought after. With excellent sea access, and the resulting trading benefits that brings, in addition to particularly fertile farmland, it has been desired and conquered by countless foreign warriors.</p>
<div id="attachment_418" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/korean_peninsula_bathymetry.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-418" alt="The Korean Peninsula is located in a strategically-important position" src="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/korean_peninsula_bathymetry.png?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Korean Peninsula is located in a strategically-important position</p></div>
<p>As early as the second century BC, Korea was invaded by the Han Dynasty of China, which established a series of vassal kingdoms across the peninsula. In the thirteenth century, the Mongols invaded, forcing the <a href="http://www.koreaaward.com/kor/history/123">Goryeo Dynasty</a> into a defensive treaty to maintain a degree of independence. Even the long-lasting <a href="http://asianhistory.about.com/od/southkorea/p/JoseonDynasty.htm">Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) </a>suffered frequent invasions from Manchuria and, <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~sford/research/turtle/index.html">in the sixteenth century, Japan</a>, each time surviving in a weakened condition.</p>
<div id="attachment_419" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 416px"><a href="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/406px-busanjinsunjeoldo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-419" alt="The Japanese landing at Busan, 1592. The invasion was a failure, but over 260,000 Koreans died at Japanese hands" src="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/406px-busanjinsunjeoldo.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Japanese landing at Busan, 1592. The invasion was a failure, but over 260,000 Koreans died at Japanese hands</p></div>
<p>By the late 19th century, the economic and industrially-stagnating Korean Peninsula became the target of China, Russia and, once again, Japan. The imperial might of the Japanese won out and <a href="http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/7.htm">by 1910 Korea was under foreign occupation</a>, a pitiful state which would remain until 1945 and the Japanese defeat in WWII.</p>
<div id="attachment_420" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/korea-hidden-history-2010-7-10-8-38-34.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-420" alt="The Japanese occupation of Korea is renowned for its barbarism" src="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/korea-hidden-history-2010-7-10-8-38-34.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Japanese occupation of Korea is renowned for its barbarism</p></div>
<p>After WWII, with the great powers once again manoeuvring for influence in the Far East as  part of a new Cold War, Korea became a battleground once again.<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war"> Between 1950 and 1953, the Soviet-backed North, with help from China, fought the American-backed South into a bloody stalemate. </a>The separate paths of the two Koreas since then is well documented.</p>
<p>Given such a history, in which Korea has been lusted after and fought over by regional and world powers alike, often to the detriment of the local populace, you could forgive its leaders for being hesitant in their foreign policy. Of course, the South Koreans sought to banish their sense of vulnerability through economic development, capitalist expansion and rising living standards. South Korea&#8217;s position as the world&#8217;s 15th largest economy is testament to the success of its developmental path.</p>
<p>The North Koreans, on the other hand, have adopted a fierce nationalism in which the country&#8217;s status as an international pariah, condemned by history, is frequently used to justify the militaristic trumpeting, nuclear threats and vicious propaganda that has come to symbolise the country. Such methods, North Korea&#8217;s leaders argue, are a necessity in the face of a world historically hostile to its people.</p>
<div id="attachment_421" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/military-north-korean-propaganda-posters-10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-421" alt="North Korea adopts an &quot;Us against Them&quot; mentality in its propaganda pieces" src="http://historysshadow.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/military-north-korean-propaganda-posters-10.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">North Korea adopts an &#8220;Us against Them&#8221; mentality in its propaganda pieces</p></div>
<p>Whether the development of a miniaturised nuclear warhead to fit onto an intercontinental ballistic missile will satisfy the North Koreans that their country is at last safe from foreign &#8220;imperialism&#8221;, it is hard to say. What is obvious, however, is that its Kim Jong-Un and his people who will decide the future of North Korea; not the foreign powers that have historically done so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today the International Olympic Committee announced that it was going to be removing wrestling from it&#8217;s list of competitive sports for the 2020 Olympics. When you look at the make-up of the IOC, it is not surprising that of all sports wrestling was the event that was dropped. Not because it wasn&#8217;t popular, but because the majority of IOC members come from nations that have either never or have no chance of producing a winning wrestling team.</p>
<p>When you read through the tally of nations who have won wrestling events in the Olympics, as well as other international wrestling competitions, the same nations have performed consistently, producing skilled athletes who have focused their time and energy, lost blood, and abused their bodies on a daily basis—most of them since childhood. The former Soviet Union was a powerhouse in the sport for decades, with the USSR&#8217;s former republics/nations still leading the world in wrestling, along with the United States, Iran, Sweden, Turkey, Japan, Finland and Germany.</p>
<p>The IOC, however, is comprised of every member nation, most of whom <em>do</em> have wrestling teams, but none of which spend as much money and effort on producing quality wrestlers like other nations. This begs the question—is the sport not that popular, or are the majority of IOC members just sore losers trying to get sports they have a better chance of winning into the Olympic roster of events?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go with the latter.</p>
<div id="attachment_287" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 682px"><a href="http://jimmyjpackjr.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/penn-state-celebration-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-287 " alt="Quentin Wright, the defending NCAA champion at 184 pounds, holds the 2011 team trophy." src="http://jimmyjpackjr.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/penn-state-celebration-2.jpg?w=672&#038;h=446" width="672" height="446" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Quentin Wright, the defending NCAA champion at 184 pounds, holds the 2011 team trophy.</p></div>
<p>And quite honestly, this decision is a bunch of bull. It shows the pettiness and usual selfish politics that populate the world. If any sport deserves to be in the Olympics, it&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s oldest (if not <em>the</em> oldest) sports. Wrestling is something youngsters by sheer nature do that can be harnessed and turned into a skill as they get older.</p>
<div id="attachment_285" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 309px"><a href="http://jimmyjpackjr.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_1835.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-285     " alt="3 PIAA AA Champs all Penn State Bound!

<p>It pains me to think of all the young men and women around the world who have dedicated their life to this sport—particularly high schoolers and younger—and now have no chance to obtain and Olympic gold for their nation. For so many universities/colleges, high schools and junior highs, wrestling is a source of pride and community. It&#8217;s also one of the cheaper sports (as opposed to sailing, equestrian events, hockey, rowing, cycling, canoeing, etc) for schools and parents to afford and/or fund. Not to mention the skill and dedication it takes to turn just your body into a fighting, athletic machine. Wrestling requires no apparatus, no vehicle, no accoutrements of any kind. Just a body, a singlet, shoes and a soft place to get the job done.</p>
<p>With all of wrestling&#8217;s pros, it boggles the mind to even guess what the IOC will put in wrestling&#8217;s place? Jai Alai? Chess? Shopping? TV watching? The Olympics has been turning into nothing but a money-driven pop event anyway, trying to make celebrities instead of organically creating athletic role models for young people, especially in the U.S. where the most popular sport for young people is video gaming and eating garbage.</p>
<p>As an instructor for Penn State (Abington), I know one of our symbols of athletic prowess and pride is our wrestling team. Penn State wrestling is coached by Cael Sanderson, an Olympian who has lived his life for the sport, and he has inspired many young wrestlers to focus their skills not only on athletics, but on their education. Sanderson&#8217;s own Olympic gold has given his team members something to strive for–the ultimate in validation for any athlete who has dedicated their lives to a sport, particularly a sport that doesn&#8217;t have a national league that can guarantee young people a future career, unlike the NFL, NBA, MLB or NHL (note: two of these sports aren&#8217;t Olympic events).</p>
<div id="attachment_286" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://jimmyjpackjr.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/psu-wrestling-cael-sandersonjpg-07d541f545f74222_large.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-286 " alt="Cael Sanderson, head coach of Penn State's Wrestling team.

(AP Photo/Pat Little)</p></div>
<p>So thanks, IOC, for furthering the corporate garbage that passes for athleticism. Hope you sell more t-shirts and commemorative coins now that wrestling is out. And by the way—I, along with thousands (millions?) of people, am out of watching the Olympics from here on in, because I know IOC members have very little interested in bringing the world together through sport. They&#8217;d rather do it through TV ratings and merchandising.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-ii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2743" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-ii.jpg?w=720"   /></a>Since I was a little girl, I have always observed the Lenten season. I grew up in a traditional Protestant church, although most of my Protestant friends from other denominations didn&#8217;t recognize the church holiday. The ritual of attending an Ash Wednesday service, meditating on the Scripture and prayers, and walking to the front of the sanctuary for the imposition of ashes became something I looked forward to as much as Christmas or Easter. Lent always symbolized a period of discipline. It was a season of growth, of a sacrifice for something greater.</p>
<p>I remember one year I gave up drinking soda, and went the entire forty days without a single drop of Dr. Pepper. I was in high school or middle school, and this was a pretty big deal because I&#8217;d gotten into the [VERY BAD] habit of drinking a bottle during my after-lunch math class. For Easter lunch I cracked open a can of soda and was repulsed by the first sip &#8212; as it turns out, I hadn&#8217;t really missed what I&#8217;d given up in the first place.</p>
<p>Many Lenten seasons have been fraught with disappointment, with broken fasts and &#8220;cheating.&#8221; Many have been satisfying in a way that only come from giving up something valuable and learning from the pain of that separation.</p>
<p><a href="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-iv.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2745" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-iv.jpg?w=720"   /></a>But <a title="Shrove Tuesday" href="http://littledutchwife.com/2011/03/08/shrove-tuesday/">all</a> have involved pancakes.</p>
<p>The day before the beginning of Lent, known to many as Mardi Gras, is called Shrove Tuesday in the church calendar. Traditionally, church-goers would clear their pantries of all sugar and yeast before Lent &#8211; a part of the traditional Lenten fast in the Catholic church &#8211; and to use up those resources they would make pancakes.</p>
<p>I love pancakes, so any excuse to eat them is just fine with me.</p>
<p><a href="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-iii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2744" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-iii.jpg?w=720"   /></a>Here are two recipes developed from a hodge-podge of other paleo, grain-free recipes, all made to be fluffy with a tender crumb, a gentle sweetness, and to pack a high-protein punch with fiber-rich coconut flour and eggs. The toppings are what make these cakes special &#8212; add applesauce, sliced or mashed banana, coconut cream, shredded coconut and chia seeds, cacao nibs, warm maple syrup or almond butter! I think these would also be delicious with a bit of melted ghee on top. Simple and pared down, but nourishing, kind of like Lent.</p>
<p><a href="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-i.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2742" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://onaquilt.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pancakes-i.jpg?w=720"   /></a><strong>Fluffy Coconut Flour Pancakes</strong></p>
<p>3 Tbsp. coconut flour</p>
<p>2 egg whites, beaten</p>
<p>1 egg, whisked</p>
<p>1/4 c. coconut milk (or more if texture dictates)</p>
<p>1 ripe banana, mashed (or 1/3 c. unsweetened applesauce, although I prefer the custard-y texture of the banana)</p>
<p>1/4 tsp. vanilla extract</p>
<p>1/4 tsp. baking powder</p>
<p>pinch of salt + cinnamon</p>
<p>butter/oil for griddle</p>
<p>In a bowl, beat egg whites until fluffy and forming stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk the whole egg and combine with mashed banana, coconut milk, vanilla, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and flour. Mix well to combine. Gently fold in beaten egg whites. Head a griddle or skillet on high and grease with a dab of coconut oil or butter, and fry pancakes on both sides until fluffy and golden.</p>
<p>If desired, add a half scoop of vanilla protein powder and drizzle in a bit more coconut milk to maintain moisture. Although this changes the texture of the pancakes quite a bit, if you&#8217;re hoping for extra satiety in the morning this is one way to find it. Or, simply serve your pancakes with a fried egg on top, a side of bacon, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

<p><strong>Grain-Free Banana Pancakes</strong> adapted from <a title="Against All Grain" href="http://www.againstallgrain.com/2012/04/05/grain-free-pancakes/" target="_blank">Against All Grain</a></p>
<p>3 large eggs, at room temperature</p>
<p>1/4 c. coconut milk</p>
<p>1 tsp. vanilla + honey</p>
<p>2 Tbsp. coconut flour</p>
<p>1/3 c. almond flour</p>
<p>1/2 tsp. baking soda</p>
<p>1/4 tsp. salt</p>
<p>1 ripe banana</p>
<p>butter/oil for griddle</p>
<p>In a bowl, whisk eggs and combine with wet ingredients. Sift together dry ingredients and add to wet mixture, omitting the banana. Heat a griddle and grease with fat of choice, then dollop on batter to cook until golden. Before flipping, arrange a few slices of banana on the raw batter side, then flip to cook all the way through. Serve with plenty of butter and a little maple syrup.</p>

<p>Are you observing the Lenten season this year? Are you giving anything up? I&#8217;m going to give up sugar &#8212; it&#8217;s too much of a physical temptation and an emotional crutch &#8212; and to compound my efforts I&#8217;m also going to adopt a new habit along with what I&#8217;m giving up. I like to add some positive reinforcement, and this year I think I&#8217;ll start by going through a new Bible study (one of my <a title="goals :: february" href="http://littledutchwife.com/2013/02/04/goals-february/">goals for the month</a>) or finding somewhere to volunteer. Let me know how you&#8217;re celebrating Mardi Gras/Shrove Tuesday, if you observe Ash Wednesday, and if you&#8217;re practicing sacrifice for Lent this year &#8212; I&#8217;m always curious!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my neighborhood, Crown Heights Brooklyn.  At night, lit only by the street lights, there are typically people out, and traffic at all hours.  During the wee hour of the morning on Sunday, this was not the case, as we were in the midst of a snow storm.  Certainly not the biggest we&#8217;ve had, which allowed me to go out and photograph.  I was only out for a couple of hours and didn&#8217;t go too far, but this is what I saw.</p>
