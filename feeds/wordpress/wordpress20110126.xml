			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">World Nutella Day &#8211; February 5, 2011</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">I can&#8217;t wait!!!  I decided yesterday to do a World Nutella Day Party to celebrate the wonders and versatility of my friend, Nutella.  The ideas are flooding into my head, to the point I feel it&#8217;s going to explode with Nutella goodness overload!  So, this is just to advise you to be on the lookout for amazing things to come&#8230;involving NUTELLA!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">If you haven&#8217;t experienced Nutella yet, purchase a wonderful jar today in your local grocery store.  Should be hanging out near my other friend, Peanut Butter&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nutellausa.com/faqs.htm"><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">Click here for FAQ&#8217;s from the Nutella USA website.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">From </span><a href="http://theonyxplate.wordpress.com/wp-admin/www.nutellausa.com"><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">NutellaUSA.com</span></a><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">: &#8220;Nutella® spread, in its earliest form, was created in the 1940s by Mr. Pietro Ferrero, a pastry maker and founder of the Ferrero company. At the time, there was very little chocolate because cocoa was in short supply due to World War II rationing.  So Mr. Ferrero used hazelnuts, which are plentiful in the Piedmont region of Italy (northwest), to extend the chocolate supply.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nutelladay.com/nutella-recipes/"><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">Check out a ton of Nutella recipes here on NutellaDay.com.</span></a><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">  Some of which I will be making for the party!  Still so excited about the planning!!!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">Yes, as referenced above, there is a World Nutella Day website that explains the beginnings of World Nutella Day.  </span><a href="http://www.nutelladay.com/"><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">Check it out here.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">As I leave you, please consider trying Nutella.  If you didn&#8217;t know&#8230;those perfect little gold balled truffles called Ferrero Rocher&#8217;s are filled with delicious Nutella.  So, maybe you have had Nutella before and didn&#8217;t even know it!  Amazing, eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Raavi;font-size:medium;">The picture is from a little appetizer I put together a while back&#8230;slices of Banana, Nutella (of course), and chopped Hazelnuts sprinkled on top.  Yummmmmm&#8230;</span></p>

However, my Dixie tends to slip out around midnight, when I’m too tired (tarred) to add a “g” to the end of every word.

And if you hear me chatting with my Mississippi peeps on the phone, you might think you’ve happened upon an extremely low budget remake of Steel Magnolias. (I’ll be the one playing Ouiser.)</p>
<p>Considering my non-drawliness, I was surprised when Geoff called me on my pronunciation of ordinary, everyday words. He said, “Say I-N-S-U-R-A-N-C-E.” It took me a few moments to figure out what on earth he wanted me to say. (I can hardly ever spell things aloud, which is why I have a hard time around small children.) When I figure it out, I say, “INsurance.” He says, “It’s pronounced inSURance.” We argue about this for as long as it takes him to pull up some bogus pronunciation tutorial on the Internet that agrees with him.</p>
<p>Once he’s on a roll, he gets me to say words like HALLoween, THANKSgiving, TEEvee, UMbrella, and JUly (which sounds like JEWly).</p>
<p>I had never before noticed that folks in Seattle had such freakish pronunciation. teeVEE? thanksGIVING? Seriously?</p>
<p>Of course, I immediately consulted my Southern friends to assess their pronunciation. Sure enough, we tend shift the emphasis to the first syllables of certain words, Merriam Webster be damned! </p>
<p>I can’t tell you why we do it anymore than I can tell you how folks manage to stretch my name into three syllables: KEE-EE-UM.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://getnycd.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/newyorker_logo_300x239.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1193" title="newyorker_logo" src="http://getnycd.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/newyorker_logo_300x239.jpg?w=135&#038;h=107" alt="new yorker logo" width="135" height="107" /></a>When does one officially become a New Yorker?  The barriers of entry to the city are pretty low, as evidenced by Kim Kardashian’s recent move to the city in the wake of many California reality stars, but there is something to be said for longevity in this town. Whether or not you are a true New Yorker is as divisive as which shop you visit for the best New York pizza, burger and bagel, and perhaps merely having an opinion on such eateries earns you a spot in New Yorkerhood—depending on who you talk to, of course.</p>
<p>There are the lifers. These are the old people you help across the street, or shall I say attempt to help until they exclaim they’ve been just fine without your service for 90-some years. They’ll tell you about the time they organized a rally for JFK or when Frank Sinatra played a gig with only 15 people at some extinct hole-in-the-wall in Midtown. They have a 3-bedroom rent controlled apartment for $350 per month and still manage to complain. They have achieved some elusive state of angry-contentment and every time you talk to one you think, “Is that going to be me someday?”</p>
<p>The more common way to go about determining New York status is the hierarchical years of service metric.  Some newbies tend to think that five years in the city means you’ve earned your stripes. The most common answer is 7 to 8 years. Given that everyone always asks if <em>Sex And The City</em> is an accurate portrayal of city life and it ran for six seasons plus two movies, I suppose that qualifies the number 8 as a reasonable barometer.</p>
<p><a href="http://getnycd.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/images.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1194" title="new york city" src="http://getnycd.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/images.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a>Then there are the cutthroat people that claim New Yorkership is attained if you’ve lived here longer than where you grew up. Assuming you moved right after high school, that is age 36. (Age 40 if after college.) By this time, everyone else in the country has 2.5 kids and a retirement home in Florida.</p>
<p>There is also a theory that living in NYC when disaster strikes creates an instant bond and respect to other residents. Though a bit grim, those who have survived blackouts, blizzards, strikes of varying sorts and even 9/11 tend to walk around with a little more gusto than those who have not experienced such events.</p>
<p>Which of these are the most accurate? Your guess is as good as mine. Someone once told me that you know you’re a New Yorker when you reach this breaking point: As much as you may hate the city on any given day, you hate the thought of living elsewhere even more.</p>
<p>I know that there are certain things that lead to the jaded, New Yorker mentality. You stop questioning the cost of rent. You’re on a first-name basis with the neighborhood bartender, coffee guy and dry cleaner. You give cabbies specific directions. You stop to argue with delivery cyclists and cabbies when they nearly-hit you in a cross-walks. You say “hi” to routine street performers and homeless people. You pre-walk the subway platform to the car that will be nearest your exit when you arrive at the next subway platform. You can’t help but smile and feeling resentfully cheesy whenever <em>Empire State of Mind</em> plays. These are the things that develop over time and make one a New Yorker.</p>
<p>Where do I fall? That’s up to you. I will tell you, however, that the best NYC-style pizza is from Patsy’s, the best burger is 5 Napkin and best bagel is from H&amp;H. And that I’d love to argue with you about it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Last weekend me and a couple of friends decided to take a little day trip to the town of Bosra. The main site in Bosra is a very well-preserved amphitheater which is one of the most amazing things I have seen so far in Syria.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We climbed up the stairs and walked through an opening and was met by this stunning view.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00482.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315" title="SONY DSC" src="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00482.jpg?w=614&#038;h=408" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a><br />
We spent about an hour and a half exploring the theater, I simply love ancient ruins.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00483.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-316" title="SONY DSC" src="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00483.jpg?w=614&#038;h=408" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a><br />
Going to Bosra is so easy. From Damascus is only takes about 1 hour and a half on the bus,<br />
so if you are looking for an easy day trip Bosra should be at the top of your list!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00497.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-318" title="SONY DSC" src="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00497.jpg?w=614&#038;h=408" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a><br />
I felt very small standing in this huge amphitheater&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00518.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319" title="SONY DSC" src="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00518.jpg?w=614&#038;h=408" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">After visiting the amphitheater we went to a lovely restaurant straight across from the ruins.<br />
We first thought it was a bit of a tourist trap but ended up eating some of the best appetizers I have had in Syria.<br />
Not sure of the name but you can&#8217;t miss it as the restaurant had bright blue gates and looked like a little garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00489.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317" title="SONY DSC" src="http://fromsyriawithlove.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dsc00489.jpg?w=614&#038;h=408" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://datingdementia.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/satisfaction-tongues.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-892" title="satisfaction tongues" src="http://datingdementia.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/satisfaction-tongues.jpg?w=184&#038;h=184" alt="" width="184" height="184" /></a>I consider myself a highly organized person.  I like a neat office, home and car.  Ask anyone who really knows me and they will tell you that I&#8217;m always creating files, labeling, cleaning out drawers or recycling stuff no longer needed.</p>
<p>I am also a list-maker.  At any one time, I&#8217;ve got three or four lists going on a steno pad.  Office tasks is one list, another is personal stuff (grocery store, dry cleaners, etc) and then there is my long-range goals.  What&#8217;s considered long-range?  It&#8217;s all the things I want to do before I can&#8217;t do them anymore.  Stuff like visit all 50 states (10 remaining), spend a summer in Maine, meet Tom Brokaw, take swimming lessons, visit Mackinaw Island in Michigan (no cars!), learn to hula hoop (I didn&#8217;t say my wish list was profound), live in New York City, skydive, write a book, experience a great love (okay, that one is profound)&#8230;you get the general idea.</p>
<p>Like all good list-keepers I get a little thrill when I can remove a few items.  It is nothing short of <em> pure satisfaction</em>.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that all &#8220;cross offs&#8221; will elicit the same <em>level</em> of satisfaction<em>.</em> Obviously, striking a line through &#8220;pick up dry cleaning&#8221; does not produce the happiness quotient that say &#8220;have lunch at the Polo Lounge&#8221; (yes, on the long-term list) would.</p>
<p>It does make me pretty happy when I have a itemized list of errands and I can take a pen and mark off each one &#8212; and then toss the list.  Honestly, it is a little slice of heaven.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even<em> more yummy </em>is when I accomplish a few additional errands.  Being the compulsive person that I am, I have to write down these extra errands &#8212; so I can then cross them off. Twisted?  Certainly, but in a good way.</p>
<p>However, I fully realize that if you are not a list person, you may be shaking your head and gazing at your computer screen with a mixture of pity and disdain.  On the other hand, if you <em>are</em> a list person, you will most certainly be mentally high-fiving yourself and shouting &#8220;yesssssssss&#8221; right about now.</p>
<p>My day can be pretty disappointing when I&#8217;m not able to cross any of my &#8220;to-does&#8221; off any of the lists.  The day just feels incomplete.  When I think of that feeling, the <a title="Rolling Stones" href="http://www.rollingstones.com/" target="_blank">Rolling Stones</a> song comes to mind: <em>I can&#8217;t get no satisfaction.</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>So, for you list-keepers out there (and the rest of you slobs) take a few minutes to watch  this vintage Rolling Stones video (priceless).  And then, of course, you can cross it off your list (very satisfying).  Come on, do it for me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago a friend gave me some Walking Onions.  A plant of many names, they are also known as: Egyptian Walking Onions, Mennonite Walking Onions, Tree Onions, Egyptian Tree Onions, Top Onions, Winter Onions, or Perennial Onions.  Their proper name is Allium proliferum (or Allium cepa var. proliferum, depending on who you ask) and they do proliferate!</p>
<p>Hardy to zone 4, these onions start producing juicy bright green leaves very early in spring.  Even before my chives awaken they are giving me crisp green onions for my winter salads.</p>
<div id="attachment_307" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/011.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-307" title="Walking Onions" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/011.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh green onions in January!</p></div>
<p>As they grow, a small white bump at the top becomes a clump of little papery-skinned bulbils or topsets, hence the name top or tree onions.  When these topsets become heavy enough the stalks topple over and given half a chance the sets root and grow away from the parent plant.  If they are left to continue this cycle they will “walk” across your garden.<img class="aligncenter" title="walking onions" src="http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z177/pegrowe62/june%202008/peggy029.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="696" /></p>
<p>This sounds a little alarming but I’ve not found them at all invasive, they are so tasty that I can keep them under control easily; in fact I’ve taken to pulling the clumps of bulbils apart (they are usually in clusters containing 2-30 bulbils) and strewing them around to encourage them.</p>
<p>Sometimes the cluster of bulbils will sprout leaves, and even a second layer of topsets, they are rather bizarre and variable plants!</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img title="walking onion topsets" src="http://i744.photobucket.com/albums/xx85/romysbaskets/EgyptianWalkingOnion.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">topsets sprouting leaves</p></div>
<p>Every part of the plant can be eaten.  The shallot-like onions produced at the base of the plant, the green leaf stalks and the bulbils at the top are all tasty, with a good oniony kick.  And because the plant is actively growing through most of the year (where I live) I almost always have a fresh source of onion!</p>
<p>I have found some onions challenging to grow but not these babies!  And I like plants that are easy to grow, especially if they are tasty to boot.  There will always be a place in my new garden for walking onions.</p>

<p>In his TEDTalk (<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/charles_limb_your_brain_on_improv.html">watch now</a>), Charles Limb reviews his groundbreaking work studying creativity and the brain &#8212; by putting musicians inside an fMRI and watching as they improvise. For the past decade, he&#8217;s been working with jazz piano players, revealing astonishing new data about the way the brain creates art. And his research has recently branched into a new genre: hip-hop. He spoke to the TED Blog about his new study, and about his day job &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide to study hip-hop?</strong></p>
<p>It kind of happened very naturally. I&#8217;m not somebody who&#8217;s listened to a ton of hip-hop; I was much more of a jazz guy, and I listened to a lot of classical music. But I work in Baltimore, grew up around New York and went to medical school in New Haven, and I always did feel that hip-hop is very much a street music, from the people, a grassroots kind of music exactly the same as jazz once as, a kind of iconoclastic music. In some ways, rap has replaced or assumed a lot of the same sociological functions to urban youth. There are a lot of interesting musical parallels between hip-hop and jazz: the rhythmic emphasis, the improvisation, the fact that the musicians are often formally untrained yet they&#8217;re incredible. The more I started thinking about jazz and the brain, rap seemed like a natural transition. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s never been a scientific study of hip-hop ever. It&#8217;s not the kind of topic that I can glean much from other studies or the existing scientific literature.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you, I&#8217;ve been having a ton of fun with this study, just experientially. When we were making our beats and our stimuli, trying to design the study, there&#8217;s no way to do this study without trying to rap yourself. It really transforms the lab!</p>
<p><strong>Do you see a significant difference in brains between wordless music like jazz and music with words?  </strong></p>
<p>Well, I have to be careful, because we&#8217;re not done with the study yet. We&#8217;re still trying to recruit more rappers &#8230; </p>
<p><strong>How are you recruiting rappers for the new study?</strong></p>
<p>I have been slowly infiltrating the Baltimore hip-hop scene. There&#8217;s a well-known beatboxer named <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38NoRYzEFss">Shodekeh</a> &#8212; he&#8217;s performed with the Baltimore Symphony &#8212; he and I got to know each other at a symposium at the <a href="http://www.avam.org/">Visionary Art Museum</a> and we got to talking. I actually told him, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of doing a laryngeal study of beatboxing.&#8221; He connected me to one rapper, and just through word-of-mouth, I&#8217;ve been getting slowly connected with the scene. I&#8217;ve talked now with about 12 professional freestyle rappers, and we&#8217;ve studied about half of them. </p>
<p><span id="more-47719"></span>Given the image Johns Hopkins has as this conservative medical establishment, in an inner city but not of it &#8212; the idea that there&#8217;s a lab that wants to study hip-hop, I think there&#8217;s something appealing to the community.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you how appreciative the musicians are. They really have a vested interest in seeing this research succeed. Because they have thought all along that what they&#8217;re doing is important. And they themselves have wondered all along: &#8220;Wow, how am I doing this?&#8221; They enter an altered state. And what they&#8217;re generating off the cuff is just remarkable. They are fascinated by understanding how they do what they do.</p>
<p>Actually, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWF5SHLSSA4&amp;feature=player_embedded">A Class</a> said an interesting thing to me. We were finishing a study, and I asked him in a post-study interview, &#8220;Is there any last thing you want to say?&#8221; And he turned real serious and he said, &#8220;Hip-hop has a bad reputation. Just give us a chance. We&#8217;re really good people and we have a lot to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for other subjects, I would love it if we could get some really well-known freestyle rappers. If Eminem wants to be part of this study, I&#8217;d fly him over!</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think your studies have captivated people they way they have? </strong></p>
<p>Previously, there wasn&#8217;t a methodology for a study like this. Functional brain imaging is relatively new. When I started my first jazz study, the one in 2003, there was not a single other study I could compare with at the time, there was nothing. It&#8217;s one of those topics that will continue to develop. </p>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t get the chance to discuss this during the TEDx talk, functional MRI is only one tool that we can use to study the brain, and like any other method, it has its advantages and disadvantages. By no means do I think that fMRI will reveal everything there is to know about how creativity takes place in the brain, but it is on the other hand a great place to start.</p>
<p>When I did my first jazz study, I really just did it for myself. I just wanted to know. I wasn&#8217;t trying to be a scientific innovator, I wasn&#8217;t really trying to make a point. It didn&#8217;t really matter to me what people thought of the results. So when it was published and the study received a startling amount of attention &#8212; I realized that more people wanted to know what I wanted to know. The topic of this research cuts across a wide range of fields, which is unusual for science. </p>
<p>It’s also important to emphasize that the lab and improvisation are not natural bedfellows, and that it’s hard to study music in a way that musicians find comfortable and realistic. In the end, I’m trying to perform modest scientific experiments on a big topic, rather than coax out artistic masterpieces from the researchers, although I’d love to study that one day as well! As a lifelong musician, I’m fully aware of all of the ideas, training, time, effort, and concentration that goes into a genuine creative act, and I try to be very careful and respectful of the arts in the science that I do. I hope this is something that artists will realize, because I think it’s important and difficult. This work is extremely easy to criticize, yet I think that some of the critics may miss this very basic premise on which I’m basing all of my work.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is that this type of research is difficult to fund. It&#8217;s not the kind of area that a lot of scientists are exploring. By nature, scientists are often less forward-thinking than artists &#8212; it&#8217;s a conservative field. And in this current funding climate, it&#8217;s not going to be easy to get funding to study creativity. It&#8217;s not disease-based. And obviously every time you&#8217;re funding something, you&#8217;re <em>not</em> funding something else. So there&#8217;s not a lot of support for this kind of research. </p>
<p>The idea that there is a &#8220;crisis in creativity&#8221; is in vogue right now, in conversations throughout the country about the failures of education in America. I suspect that what will happen is, a small group of researchers will take on these challenges from a wide range of disciplines. Many of the scientists that study these topics are really part-artist, internally. On one level, I personally care more about music than about science. I view it from the same lens as an artist would. And I think this is why my research may resonate with people. They see some artistic truth in it.</p>
<p><strong>How has this project deepened your own enjoyment of music &#8212; or do you go home at night going, I am <em>never</em> going to listen to piano jazz <em>ever again</em>?</strong></p>
<p>No, no, never. It&#8217;s funny you should ask, actually &#8212; we write our own music in the lab when we do a jazz study, so that the piece is nothing the subjects have heard before, and there are no previous associations. When we&#8217;re writing the piece to be memorized, I know that we (in the lab) are going to hear the piece literally hundreds of times. So I tell the lab members that whatever you write, make sure you can listen to it ad nauseam, over and over. And we actually have written some things that are catchy! In fact, I think that one of the jazz musicians played a research melody at one of his gigs. It kind of stuck in his head.</p>
<p>There are people who think art is going to be threatened by this type of analysis, but &#8212; no way. There&#8217;s so much complexity in music. And when I listen to music, I still listen like a musician. I can get cerebral, take a more analytical approach to music, but the emotional impact or significance of music &#8212; my enjoyment of it has in no way changed. In fact, it has grown. Like every subject, you fall in love with it the more deeply you study it.</p>
<p>But the first time I told my wife, I&#8217;m going to study jazz using functional brain imaging, she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to do what?&#8221; Of all the impractical things that you could do for your career. I trained my whole life to become a surgeon &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Your surgery career has some interesting, kind of poetic crossover with this work.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m an auditory surgeon, and I specialize in a surgery called cochlear implantation. I also treat all disorders of the ear, from chronic infections to cancer of the temporal bone. Cochlear implantation is a way to help deaf people hear again, and I study how people who are deaf and receive cochlear implants hear music. The summary is that they hear it really poorly. Pitch perception is horrible, timbre perception is horrible. We&#8217;re trying to understand why music perception is so poor and figure out how to make it better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been really lucky. I&#8217;m studying something I&#8217;m fully obsessed with on a personal level. When I go to the lab, I literally cannot imagine anything I’d rather study than music. It&#8217;s exactly where I want to be. I&#8217;m thinking about the things I would think about on vacation. I know I am extremely lucky. And I don&#8217;t take it for granted.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to announce that I&#8217;m going to be part of the &#8220;Post a Week 2011&#8243; challenge.  I&#8217;d really like 2011 to be an inspirational year for me, therefore I&#8217;ve decided to blog more, once a week if not, twice a week! If you have already been reading my blog in the past or have just come across it today, I hope you can encourage me with comments, likes and goodwill along the way.  I will also be proudly supporting the blogging community out there.  Thanks <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Here are some cute mini banana muffins for you.  I&#8217;ve decided to make banana muffins today to show tribute to the recent flood crisis that occurred in QLD.  I know most of the banana plantation originate from QLD.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families that have been affected.</p>
<p>Recipe from <a href="http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Banana-Muffins-L787.html" target="_blank">Best Recipes</a> (I&#8217;ve just added the ground cinnamon). Makes 36 mini muffins.</p>
<p><a href="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-368" title="Itty Bitty Banana Muffy" src="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins.jpg?w=467&#038;h=350" alt="" width="467" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>1 1/4 cups plain flour<br />
1 Tbsp baking powder<br />
1/2 cup milk<br />
1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />
1/2 cup brown sugar</p>
<p>1 egg<br />
1 Tbsp butter (melted)<br />
1/2 tsp vanilla essence<br />
1 ripe banana</p>
<p><a href="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins-steps.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" title="Mini Banana Muffins - how to" src="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins-steps.jpg?w=500&#038;h=376" alt="" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>Pre-heat oven to 180C and grease a mini muffin or a regular muffin tray.  In a large bowl, sift through the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and sugar.  Mash the banana with a fork and place it into a medium bowl. Add to this, the butter, vanilla essence, milk, eggs and beat well.  Add the banana mixture into the flour mixture and mix until all the ingredients are well combined.  Pour this into the muffin tray and bake for 15-20 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" title="Mini Banana Muffins" src="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins2.jpg?w=467&#038;h=350" alt="" width="467" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>The muffins are good on their own or you can dust with icing sugar.</p>
<p><a href="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370" title="Mini Banana Muffins" src="http://muchamunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mini-banana-muffins3.jpg?w=467&#038;h=350" alt="" width="467" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>Happy Eating.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me translate that title for you in case it left you scratching your head. If you (like me) have books you would like to save and display (perhaps the Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon books, just for example) but they are ugly&#8230; you might be contemplating buying them again (even though you already own them) from Amazon, and trying to get older versions so they look cooler.</p>
<p>Save yourself the trouble, head to your nearest craft store, buy some wonderful paper and RE-COVER those bad boys!</p>

<p>My dear Emily of New Moon books are hiding under that patterned paper, waiting to be read on a yearly basis. In the meantime, they can sit prettily on my bookshelf for all our admiring guests.</p>
<p>The one thing I haven&#8217;t had time to do is figure out how I want to label them. Any suggestions?</p>
