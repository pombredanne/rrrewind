				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.centsationalgirl.com/#"><img class="alignnone" title="Mayo trick by Centsational Girl" alt="" src="http://1c6162ac207f6525cfd8-84665c880233094a565668f32cb79f8e.r10.cf2.rackcdn.com/2010/10/mayotrick.jpg" width="640" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>When I was 14 I read an article in Seventeen Magazine that shared how some everyday household items could double as hair care products. Among them, mayonnaise. Mayonnaise (I found out) works also as a conditioner, so I had to try it out. I don&#8217;t remember if it worked any better than the Herbal Essences I used to use then, but I was so excited about this innovation that I kept mayo in the shower for almost two weeks before my poor parents realized what was going on.</p>
<p>I share this gross story because the DIY innovations, and tips and tricks that I see today aren&#8217;t all that revolutionary when you&#8217;re just giving your money to Kraft (now Mondelez International as of Oct 2012) rather than Procter &amp; Gamble. DIY for novelty&#8217;s sake doesn&#8217;t forward anything, doesn&#8217;t actually teach us anything, and perpetuates consumption for consumptions sake.</p>
<div id="attachment_875" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://deconstructioncrafts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the10majorfoodcompanies1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-875 " alt="The food &amp; household products monopoloy" src="http://deconstructioncrafts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the10majorfoodcompanies1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=188" width="300" height="188" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click the image to see it full sized. What does our food &amp; home products monopoly look like?</p></div>
<p>I admit that I&#8217;ve been browsing the interwebs, gawking and loving up hundreds of crafty blogs and websites each offering tutorials, features of other websites, and glimpses into the writers&#8217; lives. They are each unique in their own way: urban farmers in love with their chickens, mother of three working to live as frugally as possible, chef turned to jewelry maker&#8230; each is unique and has a step forward into the DIY world that is blossoming more than ever through these online venues. But I am calling myself out, and I invite everyone in the crafting webmosphere to step up. There&#8217;s times when I wake up from my scrolling and see myself as starved for consumption, wanting to find the next big thing, wanting some cool new gadget, some neat new trick, some handy tool, wanting wanting wanting&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the industrial revolution in the United States pushed domestic workers into factories, men and women (and children) alike. Families living in urban areas got caught into the machines and corporations grew exponentially because of that near slave labor. In the 1950&#8242;s, the iconoclastic housewife was left as the last remaining member in the home. The dominant culture of that time was propelled by commercial interests and the White middle class housewife was the target for most advertising campaigns. She spent her days preparing for and hosting gatherings at the home, kept the children clean and fed, and tidied the house or depended on people of color to do these services for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://deconstructioncrafts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/clothespins-before-and-after.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-891 alignleft" alt="clothespins before and after" src="http://deconstructioncrafts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/clothespins-before-and-after.jpg?w=400&#038;h=600" width="400" height="600" /></a>Why do I bring this up? Because I feel like history is repeating. We are still obsessing over hosting parties, and making sure that the turkey is cooked just so. We are obsessing over decor and trading secrets for upholstery care. Heck, just look at <a href="http://pinterest.com/decrafts/">my Pinterest boards</a>. We are still turning a blind eye to the labor, environmental destruction, and privilege that we are wasting by doing this. Overall, I am scared that we are spending our time consuming and spinning ourselves into circles. We&#8217;re not really creating anything here. Crafting is becoming more of a means to consume, than to create and empower.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now, I&#8217;m loving the slow and steady trend that is climbing for bringing homesteading techniques back into our memory and upcycling techniques for turning trash to usable items&#8230; but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chalkboard+silver+platter&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US506&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wWcAUf_PAsb8igLH8IE4&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679" target="_blank">painting a chalkboard onto a silver platter</a> for cute decor, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=garland+diy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US506&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VmkAUYCAEMOjiAL8s4HABA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US506&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=plastic+animals+diy&amp;oq=plastic+animals+diy&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24.36129.39785.7.39986.19.18.0.1.1.0.99.1232.18.18.0...0.0...1c.1.6O9VbpiEDPM&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.cGE&amp;fp=63895cc9550a5e23&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679" target="_blank">painting plastic animals</a> isn&#8217;t really forwarding anything (and I&#8217;m calling myself out on this too!) There are injustices happening under our feet because we waste our time and don&#8217;t look up. We are promoting below living standards for retail workers across the globe and the international outsourcing of jobs and production when we shop at <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/2004/Wal-Mart-Labor-Record16feb04.htm" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, <a href="http://shutdownbaincapital.org/" target="_blank">Michaels</a>, and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/20/news/fortune500/target_walmart/" target="_blank">Target</a>. In this capitalist country, we are voting for the practices of these mega stores (and impossibly mega owners) by shopping there. We are continuing this blind consumption from the 50&#8242;s and it&#8217;s not all that cute to me when women are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=modern+housewife+blog&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US506&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jmgAUaOALIfniwL12YGIBQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679" target="_blank">living into the &#8220;housewife&#8221; concept</a>.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-890 alignnone" style="font-size:12px;line-height:18px;" alt="baby shower before and after" src="http://deconstructioncrafts.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/baby-shower-before-and-after.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400" width="600" height="400" />Crafts aren&#8217;t meant to be cheap for the sake of saving pennies, to go buy more crafting materials. Buying at mega stores or online (and again, I&#8217;m totally calling myself out on this) is contributing to outsourced jobs, cheaply made biohazardous production made with disposable workers often people of color, in excruciatingly toxic packaging that is immediately thrown into our trash cans.</p>
<p>Crafts aren&#8217;t meant to simply fill time or make you feel good about being able to point to something in the room and say, &#8220;You like that pillow? I made it from a pattern on Pinterest!&#8221;  Crafts to me are the gateway to personal independence from corporations. Crafting to me means that I can learn to make my own plates, spool my own yarn, make my own soap. Crafting means that I can limit my waste and hold everything that I own as sacred. I am not condoning making things beautiful. I am calling myself out for making things that waste far more than my eyes can actually see for something that is purely for decor reasons, or is temporary. The kind of crafting that I am committed to brings me back to the simplicities of living in community and sharing with people around me. When my neighbor&#8217;s tomato plant went crazy he brought me a basket of tomatoes. In return I brought him tomato jam. To me, crafting is asking for help from a neighbor on learning to fix my bike  basket instead of opting to buy another one. It&#8217;s about getting more intimate with my food and challenging myself to only eat from our garden or the farmers market. Crafting means that I get to limit paying taxes to a government feeding war and destruction, spoiled by these all-powerful international corporations. Crafting means that I get to give money to people I love directly, or trade what I make for their expertise in body and health care. Crafting is about local economies, reclaiming independence, and slowing the war machine. I am calling myself out and I am taking a stand. I am committed to crafting truly creating something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I read Zadie Smith’s essay, “Joy,” in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. If you haven’t read it already, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jan/10/joy/?pagination=false" target="_blank">doing so</a>. It’s a beautifully written, decidedly contemporary reflection on joy with a tone I suspect Millennial and Gen-X readers will particularly resonate with. I also recommend Gary Gutting’s <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-joy-of-zadie-smith-and-thomas-aquinas/" target="_blank">follow-up piece</a> in the <i>Times</i>, helpfully bringing Thomas Aquinas into conversation with Smith’s portrait of joy.</p>
<p>As I’ve reflected on Smith’s essay the last few weeks, I’ve thought about a few things. The first is that I believe Smith’s ultimate conclusions about joy as opposed to pleasure are somewhat reminiscent of those of C.S. Lewis, whose reflections on joy ring the truest of all those I’ve come across.</p>
<p>Smith’s essay begins with an assumption that is self-evident to anyone who exists in this world: pleasures are rather easy to come by but joy is a bit more elusive. She then describes a handful of moments in her life when she felt that she touched joy, in particular a London nightclub experience in the 90s at the beginning of the ecstasy craze. But was that really joy? The morning-after letdown makes Smith wonder. Maybe joy exists mostly in the tease, the replication, the mimesis of something far rarer or altogether out of reach?</p>
<p>Reflecting on her drug experience that felt awfully close to joy, Smith <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jan/10/joy/?pagination=false" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the neural level, such experiences gave you a clue about what joy not-under-the-influence would feel like. Helped you learn to recognize joy, when it arrived. I suppose a neuroscientist could explain in very clear terms why the moment after giving birth can feel ecstatic, or swimming in a Welsh mountain lake with somebody dear to you. Perhaps the same synapses that ecstasy falsely twanged are twanged authentically by fresh water, certain epidurals, and oxytocin… We certainly don’t need to be neuroscientists to know that wild romantic crushes—especially if they are fraught with danger—do something ecstatic to our brains, though like the pills that share the name, horror and disappointment are usually not far behind. When my wild crush came, we wandered around a museum for so long it closed without us noticing; stuck in the grounds we climbed a high wall and, finding it higher on its other side, considered our options: broken ankles or a long night sleeping on a stone lion. In the end a passerby helped us down, and things turned prosaic and, after a few months, fizzled out. What looked like love had just been teen spirit. But what a wonderful thing, to sit on a high wall, dizzy with joy, and think nothing of breaking your ankles.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, Smith’s notion of joy here feels like bittersweet nostalgia and longing more than anything, which brings to mind Lewis’s notion of it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Joy-Shape-Early-Life/dp/0156870118" target="_blank"><i>Surprised by Joy</i></a>. Reflecting on the common qualities of Lewis’s own list of “joy” experiences from childhood, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who are still disposed to proceed I will only underline the quality common to the three experiences; it is that of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction. I call it Joy, which is a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again. Apart from that, and considered only in its quality, it might almost equally well be called a particular kind of unhappiness or grief. But then it is a kind we want. I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasure in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and pleasure often is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smith seems to agree with Lewis that joy is a particular kind of unhappiness or grief. “The thing no one ever tells you about joy,” she writes, “is that it has very little real pleasure in it.” And yet she seems more perplexed than Lewis on the question of why humans would choose to desire joy over pleasure, even when it can cause so much pain:</p>
<blockquote><p>The writer Julian Barnes, considering mourning, once said, “It hurts just as much as it is worth.” In fact, it was a friend of his who wrote the line in a letter of condolence, and Julian told it to my husband, who told it to me. For months afterward these words stuck with both of us, so clear and so brutal. <i>It hurts just as much as it is worth</i>. What an arrangement. Why would anyone accept such a crazy deal? Surely if we were sane and reasonable we would every time choose a pleasure over a joy, as animals themselves sensibly do. The end of a pleasure brings no great harm to anyone, after all, and can always be replaced with another of more or less equal worth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smith’s recognition of the ultimate disposability and evanescence of pleasure seems to me representative of my generation’s increasing awareness of the general ephemerality of things, and their skepticism of all the tropes (a house, a family, a career, the suburban life…) previously associated (mostly via Hollywood) with a “joyous” life.</p>
<p>Mine is a generation which has grown up seeing about half of all marriages end in divorce. We’ve seen the real estate market collapse a few times, as well the stock market. We’ve seen umpteen holes shot through our heroes and icons (sex scandals, doping scandals, the generally unflattering transparency of 360 degree media).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the allure of physical possessions seems ever diminished. Books on bookshelves are going the way of the CD. Amassing expensive furniture, investing in home improvements, registering for fine wedding china that will rarely be used… all of it feels pointless in a world whose impermanence is palpable: a world where life is lived via moment-by-moment tweets and Insta-documents quickly forgotten; where natural disaster, terrorism and apocalyptic doom are not feared as much as expected; where market instability, escalating debt and climate change make visions the future look closer to <i>Children of Men </i>than “Tomorrowland.”</p>
<p>Because of all of this (and no doubt much more), many of us are now, on the whole, much more desirous of <i>experiences</i> than things. We’d rather travel, eat amazing food, see movies, have adventures, and live socially in the present-tense than build for anything long-term. Unlike our parents, we tend to rent rather than buy; we work in jobs for years but not decades; we don’t live in one place for very long. We have close friends for “seasons,” but very few for life.</p>
<p>To be sure, the <i>idea</i> of rootedness, permanence and longevity–building an idyllic homestead wherein one’s family can flourish, amidst a tightknit community where “everybody knows your name,” where we can carve out a niche and stake our place for once and all–is desirable, but mostly in a fantasy sense (in the simultaneously nostalgic and eschatological sense, perhaps, of Marilynne Robinson’s reflections on home in the essay, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Was-Child-Read-Books/dp/0374298785" target="_blank">When I was a Child I Read Books</a>.”) Such a vision confronts us mostly as a stab, a pang, a longing for what we know will probably never be.</p>
<p>And this brings us back to the discussion of joy. For it is precisely in those pangs and longings where joy exists, argues Lewis. “All joy (as distinct from mere pleasure, still more amusement) emphasizes our pilgrim status; always reminds, beckons, awakens desire,” he wrote once in a letter to Dom Bede Griffiths. “Our best havings are wantings.”</p>
<p>Though I agree with Lewis that pleasure is surely distinct from joy, I also think they are very closely linked. That is, I believe pleasure–mostly the nostalgic remembrance of a pleasure–can often be a catalyst for joy. Zadie Smith’s experience in the London club likely felt more joyous and profound in her memory–with great distance–than it did in the actual moment. Perhaps in the moment it was closer to pleasure than joy. But without that initial pleasure to look back on and long for, would there be joy?</p>
<p>When I consider instances of joy in my life thus far, most of what I would list probably felt more like pleasure at the time. I think of the summer night in Cambridge when I snuck onto the roof of Clare College with friends, looking out over the moonlit gardens, punting down the Cam river well after midnight, with champagne and laughter in ample supply. I think of the long, late-night undergrad conversations at Wheaton with my roommates: about God, movies, theology, relationships and the like. Or the childhood trips with my family to the Tulsa State Fair, an autumnal tradition rife with the screams and whirring of carnival rides and the smells of all things barbecue and fried. Pleasures all.</p>
<p>The <i>memories</i> of all that, the longing for those happy experiences and the intense recognition that they will never be replicated in just the same way… that’s what stirs up joy. <i>Sehnsucht. </i>And it’s not just nostalgia for the past. It’s nostalgia for a future that a lifetime full of accumulated pangs and pleasures leads us to believe exists. Somewhere. Joy is the ineffable, the transcendent, the sublime stasis which a million little experiences grasp at but can never fully capture. An ultimate settledness for which our hearts now restlessly pine.</p>
<p>This is why Smith feels that there is something melancholy about joy, that it has such a paradoxical capacity to bring us pain. And perhaps that is why in today’s world–so untrusted and unstable, where we’re all so aware of contingency and fragility–the idea of joy makes a lot more sense when articulated as a groaning for completion rather than a smiling-face present perfection. Lewis’ characterization of joy as always pointing away or calling us elsewhere (emphasizing our “pilgrim status”) rings true for citizens of discombobulated late modernity. We know all too well the vacuity that so often accompanies lives of consumption; the limited capacity of <i>things</i> to bring lasting pleasure. (Of course, <i>experiences</i> can also be disposable and empty, though I think they have greater capacity to morph into pleasant memories which ultimately bring joy).</p>
<p>Still, whether we’re curating commodities or experiences, It’s up to us to make the most of the little pleasures we come across. We can either celebrate the presentness of pleasure (YOLO, right?!) and stop there; or we can go further and see in pleasure signposts, recognizing that the ecstatic feeling triggered by a dance party, or a small-batch bourbon, or a down-to-the-wire Super Bowl, is not an end unto itself but rather a means by which we can contemplate our true pilgrim status and the <i>telos </i>to which it all must point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human brain is an incredibly complex object. With billions of cells each with thousands of connections, it is difficult to know where to begin. Neuroscientists can probe the brain with electrodes, see inside it with scanners, and observe what happens to people when bits of it are damaged in accidents and disease. But putting all this information together is rather like reconstructing a puzzle without the picture on the box for guidance.</p>
<p><a href="http://elusiveself.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/computer_brain.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-122 alignleft" alt="computer_brain" src="http://elusiveself.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/computer_brain.jpg?w=206&#038;h=240" width="206" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>We could take inspiration from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" target="_blank">Human Genome Project</a>. The genome is also extremely complex, with billions of building blocks. Despite these challenges, the genome was successfully unraveled at a cost of around $3.8 billion in 2003. The knowledge generated by the Human Genome Project is <a href="http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf" target="_blank">estimated to have produced</a> $141 in the economy for every $1 spent on research.</p>
<p>Now the Obama administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">plans to do the same for the human brain</a>, on a similarly ambitious scale ($3 billion over ten years). The goal of the “Brain Activity Map” (BAM) is to map the activity every neuron and connection in the living brain. Because activity of the brain determines our mental lives, the hope is that a comprehensive roadmap will help us understand how memories are formed, how particular drugs might alleviate psychiatric disorders, and even how the brain generates consciousness. The relevant technologies (multi-electrode recording, optogenetics) are advancing rapidly, and large-scale studies are already providing new insights into how networks of cells interact with each other. A successful Brain Activity Map is well within our grasp.</p>
<p>But what will success look like? Will a map of the human brain be useful in the same way that a map of the human genome is useful? In genetics, success allows us to understand and control physical characteristics. In neuroscience, success should lead to an equivalent understanding of the mind. We would be able to use the map to help reduce aberrant emotions in post-traumatic stress disorder, to lift mood in depression, and to reverse the decline of Alzheimers. Yet all these applications rely on a thorough understanding of the mind as well as the brain.</p>
<p>The computer scientist David Marr noted that the mind can only be fully understood by linking three levels: the function of the system, the computations the system carries out, and how these computations are implemented in the brain. Recording brain cells firing away on their own, even thousands of them, will only get us so far. Imagine being able to visualize the electronics of your computer while tapping away at an email. The patterns you see might tell you broadly how things are working, but you could not divine that you had a web browser open, and certainly not that you were writing to an old friend. Instead, to gain a full understanding of the computer, you would need to understand the software itself, as well as how it is implemented in hardware. <a href="http://download.cell.com/neuron/pdf/PIIS0896627312005181.pdf?intermediate=true" target="_blank">In an article in the journal <i>Neuron</i></a>, the scientists behind the BAM proposal remind us that brain function emerges “from complex interactions among constituents”. They seem to agree with Marr. But while we don’t know the full details of the proposal, in its current form the majority of BAM funding will be thrown at understanding only one of his three levels: implementation.</p>
<p>Studying one level without the other is rather like building the Large Hadron Collider without also investing in theoretical physics. Psychologists and cognitive scientists are experts at bridging the gap between the workings of the mind and brain. For example, by carefully designing behavioral tests that can probe mental dysfunction, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177032" target="_blank">they are beginning to delve beneath the traditional classifications of mental disorders</a> to understand how particular components of the mind go awry. These individuals need to walk hand in hand with the technologists on the frontline of brain science. The new technologies championed by the BAM scientists will produce a rich harvest of data about the brain, and they are a crucial part of a long-term investment in the brain sciences. But without similar investment in the mind sciences we will be left puzzling over how the pieces fit into our everyday lives. Only by considering the mind when tackling the brain will we get more BAM for our buck.</p>

<p>So, <a title="Yahoo Memo" href="http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer banned working from home</a> for her Yahoo! employees. Hilarity ensued.  Not really. More like polarization between women has intensified.  I have a vague sense male CEOs and workers are sitting down with popcorn to watch the catfight and go &#8220;Rawr.&#8221;</p>
<p>I worry that our reactions, no matter how well-intended and articulate and based in truths, aren&#8217;t wholly productive.  Why is it more outrageous for a female CEO to ban flextime than for a male CEO?  I don&#8217;t think it is.  It&#8217;s a questionable business decision, and only time will tell if it is a good one, but would the outrage be as severe if it came from a man?  I doubt it, and I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the policy itself.  It constricts parents of both genders.  It constricts adults of both genders.  It constricts any male or female who would like to enjoy the benefit of staying home with a sick kid, taking an aging parent to the doctor, or giving blood at a time that is convenient for them.  In <a title="Women Can't Have it All.  Neither Can Men." href="http://worthingtonpost.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/women-cant-have-it-all-neither-can-men/" target="_blank">this post I wrote last June</a>, I posited the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideally, in order for one spouse to have <em>true </em>flexibility in and control over his or her scheduling, the other spouse would have it, too.  Because for every mother I know who needs flexibility to support her career, I know a father who needs flexibility to support his family life.  For every mother who needs control over her schedule so she can present a case in court or put on a hard hat and climb into the sewers, there is a father who needs flexibility to leave work early to coach his daughter&#8217;s softball team or make dinner while the mother is making closing arguments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the person who issued the policy.  Marissa Mayer never claimed to be a pioneer/crusader for the family-friendly workplace.  Au contraire.  I think she made it very clear from the time she was hired that work was her priority. Frankly, this policy change doesn&#8217;t surprise me at all.  My friend, Elissa Freeman, <a title="Thinking Like a Man" href="http://www.the-broad-side.com/marissa-mayer-thinking-like-a-man" target="_blank">wrote a piece defending Mayer</a>, and even expressed the hope that</p>
<blockquote><p>(m)aybe, just maybe, Mayer has a grander plan. Once she has the credibility of saving a company and winning the respect of Wall Street, she will have the potential of standing on an even grander soapbox for carving out family friendly policies. Policies that even the old boys will have to take into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe, though I doubt she will, because that is not who she claimed to be or what she claims to want.</p>
<p>I understand having higher hopes for a female CEO of such a large company.  (I, too, cheer a little louder for the underdog when they break through barriers, whether it is a female CEO, a gay couple getting a marriage license, or the New York Mets breaking .500.)   Yet, just because a person is in possession of a uterus doesn&#8217;t mean she also possesses wisdom, empathy, or vision.  As a matter of fact, I know of plenty of women who hurt the causes of gender equity and families in general.  Last January, I decried a <a title="Credit Card rule" href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/stay-at-home-parent-credit-cards-household-income-1282.php#ixzz1aZrr1gKc" target="_blank">new rule by the Federal Reserve </a>making credit cards available based on individual, rather than household income. <a title="Women in Da House - Not!" href="http://worthingtonpost.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/women-in-da-house-not/" target="_blank">In that post,</a> I was urging women to get more involved in politics.  Then, I did more research on the Federal Reserve.  Three of the five members at the time were women.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s understandable women feel thrown under the bus by one of their own.  I&#8217;m disappointed, too.  But I&#8217;m inclined to be cautious with my criticism.  I fear we do more harm than good by having different expectations for women in power than men.  I worry when we criticize a person rather than a policy.  I don&#8217;t want to cloud the very important issue of family-friendly work-places and productivity by calling Marissa Mayer on the carpet for being a FEMALE who made a certain decision rather than a CEO who made a certain decision.  Counterintuitive as it seems, advancing gender equity might be better achieved by leaving gender OUT of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She called me at 2am<br />
waking me to tell me<br />
that her power went out<br />
and that there was<br />
no possible way that<br />
she would be<br />
able to sleep as<br />
cold<br />
as the night<br />
was.</p>
<p>I said she should spend the<br />
night here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect,<br />
because if I&#8217;m not<br />
going to be sleeping, I&#8217;d<br />
rather the reason to be you,&#8221;</p>
<p>by the time she came over<br />
I fell asleep, apparently<br />
snoring, mouth open on my couch</p>
<p>and she found it rude to just<br />
flat out wake me, so she took her time,<br />
showered instead and then<br />
proceeded to make bacon.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes<br />
to the heavenly aroma,<br />
she was standing there,<br />
hair still wet, wearing one<br />
of my shirts as a night gown<br />
(with nothing underneath)<br />
holding a plate of bacon<br />
smiling telling me to wake up<br />
it was morning. </p>
<p>It was 4:30 and although<br />
I usually brutally murder those<br />
who wake me before<br />
10, I just let her kiss me</p>
<p>or rather I kissed her<br />
and kissed her<br />
and well, kissed her</p>
<p>until she told me to stop<br />
because the bacon was getting cold.<br />
I told her &#8220;I love you.&#8221;<br />
then we ate the bacon.</p>
<p>Later we were lying in bed,<br />
bathed in an awkward<br />
yet tender silence<br />
her head was on my chest<br />
her arms wrapped around me<br />
she then looked up at me and said<br />
&#8220;why do you love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I really didn&#8217;t know<br />
so I told her it was because of the bacon,<br />
and she put her head down and said<br />
&#8220;I love you, too.&#8221; and started to laugh </p>
<p>I asked why</p>
<p>&#8220;because of your heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>We then kissed,<br />
and the night sky became<br />
day, and our breaths became<br />
heavy and room became<br />
warm, we showed each other<br />
we loved each other for<br />
much, much more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really like horse meat. Of course I didn’t know this until a few weeks ago but it has become apparent that we have all been eating rather a lot of it, and I can’t think of a meal I’ve found particularly disgusting recently. Therefore it stands to reason that I have probably finished off my horse lasagne/bolognese/soup with gusto.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure what all the fuss is about. I mean, if we suddenly found out that all horse meat was actually full of illegal lasagne would people be so bothered? I’m rather impressed by the extent of the problem actually. I like to think it even made it into the tin of dog food I served Nick last night.</p>
<p>My favourite development (though don’t tell Customs) is the apparent involvement of an international criminal gang of horse meat smugglers. What does one do with this information? Apart from question the European criminal underworld’s decision to move away from the horse’s head in your bed, and onto the entire horse in your stomach. I for one didn’t know whether to laugh, cry or make a quick phone call to make sure my horse was still alive. Well the latter obviously, but beyond that I really don’t know what to think.</p>
<p>As a solutions focused kind of guy, I’ve been considering ways we can make the whole thing a bit more positive. I think this is a golden opportunity to introduce a whole new range of horse-based dishes into our schools. What’s not to like – it’s cheap, nutritious and apparently really easy to get hold of. Step aside Jamie! Just because I haven’t got a run of incredibly successful cookbooks/TV shows/restaurants/food campaigns doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to contribute to the country’s food culture. Having said that, perhaps a cookbook isn’t a bad shout – it would certainly help tone down my bad-boy image. How about ‘Horsing Around with Dave Cameron’? Fantastic.</p>
<p>Whatever the result, at least no one can say this is my fault. What a strange yet pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Dave</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear People of the Internet,<a href="http://whatasillygirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/shy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-754" alt="shy" src="http://whatasillygirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/shy.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m back!  Don&#8217;t get giddy just yet, but I may have something interesting to say.  Maybe.  It has been six months since that has happened and I may have forgotten what interesting things look like.  This could be related to the fact that it has been nine months (NINE MONTHS?!) since I&#8217;ve had sex.  I could have grown a whole person by now!  Instead I have acquired two cats, which is merely a coincidence, I assure you.  I would like to have reported this interesting situation at a more Godly hour, but I accidentally fell asleep at 9 pm while putting my three year old to bed.  Alas, one of the many pitfalls of parenting.  And so I present to you: The Situation<em> (with a conspicuous absence of abs, though I&#8217;m sure I have some under all this ice cream)</em>.</p>
<p>Remember those times in your life when you were simply mad about someone, probably from the first moment you met, but that person never returned your feelings?  Rhett M., fourth grade.  John R., eleventh grade.  Justin W., college.  I&#8217;m certain you&#8217;ve just made a similar list in your head.  I hate unrequited love.  It&#8217;s the most horrible fate a heart can endure.  I&#8217;d rather go through 10,000 breakups than spend my life hopelessly in love with a man who would never love me back.  <em>(Oh Johnny Depp, when will you return my calls??)</em>  Right now I am on the other side of that equation.  I&#8217;m sure this has happened at some other point in time (Prom Date, high school) but this is the first time I have encountered this situation as an adult.</p>
<p>When I began work at an overpriced clothing store last November I met a man who told me his name a few too many times and said good-bye standing awkwardly outside my car.  I knew right then that he found me attractive, that he was younger than I am, and that he had no idea how to ask me out.  Since that time I&#8217;ve learned that he is in fact three years younger, but he&#8217;s about as emotionally evolved as that guy I went to prom with <em>(what the hell was his name??)</em>.  In fact, let&#8217;s call this guy Spanky.  If he were a dog he would most certainly be a terrier.  Anybody remember Wishbone, the book-loving Jack Russell circa 1998?  Anyway.  He&#8217;d jump up and down at you, eat your shoes and pee in the house, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to get rid of the damn thing because it was cute and you knew that it meant well.  Unlike Wishbone, who was a genius.  I don&#8217;t dislike Spanky as such, but he does not appeal to my sapiosexual instincts and nothing about him says Future Father of My Child.  Normally I&#8217;d give him a polite no thank-you, but&#8230;  I don&#8217;t know.  Don&#8217;t you ever just want to punch Karma in the face?  What would happen if unrequited love got what it wanted just this once?  Would that really be so terrible?</p>
<p>Fact is, I haven&#8217;t exactly got much going on right now.  I&#8217;ve had many offers for dates on OKCupid, but nothing to write home about.  Except that one guy.  He was perfect.  Smart, cute, college professor, sarcastic and clever, and we never met.  We had a bit of wonderful banter about apes and poetry and the next thing I knew his profile had been deactivated.  It was a sad day for this <span style="color:#800000;">silly girl</span>.  He was PERFECT.  Then there was the fellow I met at my Masters conference in Chicago.  He was also all of those things, except he worked in a home for behaviorally challenged teens.  He made me laugh every single day, abhorred the idea of men treating women as objects, and sang karaoke just to make me happy.  But he&#8217;s married with an infant son.  Again, sad.</p>
<p>So what if this time around I decide to make someone happy?  Would that be such a terrible thing?  I think Spanky is something of an idiot, but maybe I&#8217;m wrong.  And just because someone is an idiot, that doesn&#8217;t mean he can&#8217;t be fun to hang out with or good in bed.  The only tricky bit is the coworker aspect.  If things go south (not in a good way, wink wink) then I will still have to see him at work.  I can keep my shit together, but can he?</p>
<p>I told my boss about it (who is a whole other story) and he laughed and said next Spanky was going to bring me an apple.  He&#8217;d hold it out, sheepishly grinning at the floor, and then run away.  I see his point.  Spanky is not the most mature of souls and this has all been very seventh grade in nature.  I half expect to find a note in my locker that says, &#8220;Do you like me?  Check yes or no.&#8221;  Meanwhile I&#8217;m over here calculating how proficient he would be in the sack.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get real people.  Romance is the last thing on my mind.  I&#8217;ve been unsuccessfully trying to check &#8220;one night stand&#8221; off my bucket list for the past month, but this is not a hit it and quit it situation.  I&#8217;d rather not have someone muttering &#8220;bitch&#8221; every time I passed through the men&#8217;s department, but I may not be giving him enough credit.  Oh, hell.  Let&#8217;s throw caution to the wind, shall we?  Let&#8217;s give unrequited love the shot it has always wanted!  Let&#8217;s spread a little happy at the risk of future disappointment!  I mean, what&#8217;s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Brrr.  Anyone else feel that chill go down their spine?</p>
<p>Fate-temptingly yours,</p>
