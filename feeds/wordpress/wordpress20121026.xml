				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My husband and I have been waiting for some bad news. We’ve been on tenterhooks for 10 months because we know that someone out there is keeping a dirty secret and we want to be put out of our misery.</p>
<p>There must be something awful about living in Norway. Some beastly part of the lifestyle that we have yet to discover and will send us for an icy swim to another coast in the North Sea. America has its outrageous medical and education costs and the UK has nauseating universal healthcare. And Norway has… long winters. They also have too much cash, more oil than they thought and practically extravagant parental benefits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia">Sir Thomas More’s fictional perfect island is real,</a> except it’s not called Utopia.</p>
<p>I moved to Oslo on 17 November last year and those first few weeks were tough, it was dark by 3pm and it rained a lot. But things perked up quickly. In a matter of weeks the city was covered in beautiful gleaming white snow, the sun was casting long Arctic shadows and I soon saw how great things are here.</p>
<p>I found a website that gives Norwegian news in English and here&#8217;s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- 5 January: The finance minister<a href="http://www.newsinenglish.no/2012/01/05/extra-billions-flowed-into-state-treasury/">“suddenly found” a $19 billion surplus </a>in the fiscal budget.<br />
- 9 January: Norwegian oil big-wig<a href="http://www.newsinenglish.no/2012/01/09/new-oil-province-found-off-norway/"> Statoil made a “major” oil discovery. </a>It was the second time the company found hoardes of oil in Norway within a year.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The exact opposite happens in the US and UK &#8211; America owes an arm and a leg to the Chinese and are frantic for more oil, and the Brits can’t spare a dime for their ailing healthcare system. Her Majesty and the rebel Yanks just can’t make ends meet, while Norwegians are deep-frying donuts in crude oil and scrubbing their snow boots with wads of 1,000 kroner notes.</p>
<blockquote class="pull alignright"><p>I&#8217;ve touched on the beastly topic of socialism and through my experiences in Norway I&#8217;ll do my best to dissect it, so stay-tuned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that week in January, I’ve been waiting for the bad news. There has got to be <i>something</i>. The local cuisine is a little bland but there must be something more unbearable than that, right? An obvious example comes to mind.</p>
<p>Cost of living is outrageous &#8211; a gallon of milk costs 56 kroner ($10). Multiply that by a toddler and a mom who loves hot chocolate and we spend the equivalent of a private high school tuition on 2% milk.</p>
<p>Imported items are expensive too and the price is going up. From next year tariffs on certain imported cheeses will skyrocket by 277%. It’s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism">protectionism</a> and the US could use a lesson in it (maybe not quite to the Norwegian extreme).</p>
<p>I understand that the figures I just gave you may seem impossible to digest, it was months before I was comfortable enough with the pricetags at the supermarket to splurge on a $4 Snickers bar. But if you live in Norway it all pans out, I swear.</p>
<p>The average income here is more than half million kroner ($82,000) a year and a vast majority of households have two incomes because the oustanding parental benefits available make it easy for women to maintain their careers.</p>
<p>There’s more. Starting next month, when we’ve been here a full year, my son will get 970 kroner ($171) each month as part of the government’s way to help cover the cost of raising children.</p>
<p><a href="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1000front_stor.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-244" title="1000 kroner" alt="" src="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1000front_stor.png?w=478&#038;h=248" height="248" width="478" /></a></p>
<p>And then there’s the whole reason we moved here in the first place. My husband and I left the effervescent city of London to live in what is comparatively a hamlet on a glacier because a Norwegian company made him an offer he couldn’t refuse:</p>
<ul>
- more money<br />
- less work<br />
- overtime perks<br />
- gym membership<br />
- a buffet-style hot lunch every weekday<br />
- A 3,000 kroner ($530) yearly allowance for newspaper and magazine subscriptions</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>It’s a fairly common package here.</p>
<p>Besides that we’re entitled to high-quality healthcare that’s practically free and our son goes to a top-notch nursery for the laughable fee of 803 kroner ($142) a month.</p>
<p>I’ve touched on a broad subject: the beastly topic of socialism. Big government, as the Americans call it. That&#8217;s what Norway&#8217;s secret is. Through my experiences here I’ll do my best to dissect this subject for you so stay-tuned and signup to follow my blog because if I ever get the bad news about Norway, you’ll be the first to know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://acvoice.com/author/dbolger13/">(Dana Bolger)&#8211;</a> <em>[Trigger warning for sexual assault]</em></p>
<p>Dear Amherst College community:</p>
<p>The photographs below feature eleven men and women who were sexually assaulted at Amherst College and the words that members of our community said to them following their assaults. Not every survivor is holding his or her own sign; some of the students have transferred or dropped out of Amherst out of fear of their attackers’ continued presence on campus or from lack of options in the face of an unsympathetic administration.</p>
<p>Many of you were shocked to read <a href="http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2012/10/17/account-sexual-assault-amherst-college">Angie Epifano’s story</a>. Most of us in the survivor community at Amherst were deeply saddened but not surprised to learn of her experience with the College administration, since it so closely mirrored our own.</p>
<p>I have followed our college community’s reactions to Angie’s story. The outrage toward our school’s administration is just and appropriate. That our administration owes a formal, public acknowledgment of, and apology for, its treatment of survivors goes without saying. That it is time that we demand from our administration transparency, <a href="http://acvoice.com/2012/10/08/amherst-college-roasting-fat-ones-since-1847/">dialogue</a>, and priority of students’ safety over Amherst’s image likewise goes without saying.</p>
<p>In the photographs below, survivors reveal hurtful words said to them by Amherst administrators—and also by teammates, roommates, and friends.</p>
<p>In our impulse to point a finger outward at the Amherst administration, let us not forget to look inward at our own complicity in the creation of a culture that gives Angie’s rapist the power to act and our administration the power to silence and dismiss her experience.</p>
<p>I urge you to see the words in these photographs—see them, be angry—and then recall your own words. I think we have all, at some time, in some way—through our jokes, our questions, our arguments—silenced a survivor. I think we have all, at some time, in some way, exerted our respective privileges—male, white, heterosexual, cisgendered, able-bodied—to silence our peers. As a woman, I have been silenced and shut down in the classroom, at parties, among friends, even in planning meetings leading up to Friday’s <a href="http://www.barryscottphotography.com/rallytoendthecultureofsilence">rally to support survivors</a>. As a white, upper-middle class, heterosexual individual, I know I have silenced and shut down my peers.</p>
<p>Angie’s article has revealed to the rest of the Amherst community what survivors here have known since our own rapes: it is time to demand radical change from our administration. What I hope you will read in Angie’s article and see in the photographs below is that it is time to demand transformation from yourself.</p>
<p>Let these stories be a portal for self-examination and growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the old black and white war movies where so much of the action takes place in the dark? Soldiers from one side or the other stumble around a muddy camp or sneak silently into or out of a different camp until that terrible moment when they&#8217;re stopped by a burly guy in a helmet with a big rifle across his chest. His scowl does nothing to make anyone feel better as he utters the fateful words: &#8220;Halt! Who goes there?&#8221;  After which, the unwitting soldiers have to come up with a password or die.</p>
<p>This happens to me several times a day as I try to get work and business done at my computer.  Nobody&#8217;s holding a gun to my head, but they might as well be as I try to remember one password or another before I can access my bank account or get to my websketches or check to see if a story&#8217;s been accepted at Glimmer Train magazine, or get help from my internet provider when things go south.  User Name and Password are the big bully gatekeepers of my life these days.   </p>
<p>Somebody once said that computers are like Old Testament gods &#8211; lots of rules and no mercy.  When it comes to passwords this is absolutely true.  The rules:<br />
     1. Never write your password down.  (Good luck with that.)<br />
     2. Never use the same password twice. (Ditto)<br />
     3. Use a random series of letters and numbers. (Which I can&#8217;t possibly remember unless I write it down.)<br />
     4. Never use your birthday, your kids&#8217; birthdays, etc.  (Okay, I can be more creative than that.)<br />
     5. Change your password frequently. (Are you kidding? I just memorized the first one.)</p>
<p>Yes, I know all these passwords are meant to protect us, our money and our privacy in the Age After Typewriters. But if that&#8217;s the case, how come hackers are able to break into systems every other day and steal thousands of identities?  Shift money into their own accounts? Change websites? Who&#8217;s stopping them and shouting &#8220;Halt! Who goes there?&#8221;  Huh? Who&#8217;s stopping them? That&#8217;s what I want to know.  Nobody, that&#8217;s who. </p>
<p>Because computers are imperfect and flawed. They&#8217;re useful tools for any number of things, but machines that were originally designed to do big, complicated calculations have been redesigned by imperfect techies to do a lot of other things that were never intended in the beginning. And we&#8217;ve been lulled into believing those other things make our lives easier.  Worse, we&#8217;ve been lulled into believing those other things are now <span style="text-decoration:underline;">necessary</span>.</p>
<p>I recently opened a new bank account, and by the time I&#8217;d come up with three new passwords (which are written down but I&#8217;m not telling you where), selected two new icons, and gone through all the other rigamarole, I was too frazzled to learn how to deposit my checks at an ATM where I would use one of those new passwords. I was assured it was great to be able to deposit my checks anytime, anywhere, even at 3:00 a.m.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an old-fashioned customer who is sleeping soundly at 3:00 a.m.  I might go online to check my balance, but when I put a check in the bank, I want to hand it to a teller and let her give me a receipt. I want to say, &#8220;Hi, how&#8217;s your day going?&#8221; and have her smile back and say, &#8220;Great. How about yours?&#8221; I want to have a life that&#8217;s never too busy to make it more convenient to find an ATM at 1:00 a.m. where I can deposit my checks than to just run to the bank during the day and do it. </p>
<p>Depositing a check at 3:00 a.m. may be just the thing for another customer, but I&#8217;d be happier if the bank didn&#8217;t have a one-size-fits-all way of doing business.</p>
<p>This morning at 8:00 a.m. I had a call from the bank. A cheery young woman wished me a good morning and then launched into a spiel about other new services I might want sign up for.  At 8:00 a.m. I was groggy, and asked that she call me back later. She will. I don&#8217;t want any more services from the bank. I have more than I can handle right now, and I know those new services will all require new passwords. I don&#8217;t want anymore passwords.  I was too groggy to say this when she called, but I was not too groggy to ask where she was calling from.</p>
<p>Ohio.</p>
<p>My head was clear enough to ask her to please vote for Barack Obama.  She chuckled and said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t like the other guy?&#8221; and then the line went dead.</p>
<p>Halt. Who goes there?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have spent about a decade and a half as a real, honest-to-goodness, working adult.  In that time, I have stayed in the same general field of education, but have worked in four very different positions in two very different school systems.</p>
<p>And I have complained about every job I have had.</p>
<p>And, of course, at a certain point, I do have to ask whether it is the job that sucks or whether it just might be me.</p>
<p>It is an awfully shitty moment when, as a grown-up, you realize that it isn&#8217;t everyone and everything else out there that needs to be fixed.  All the jobs in all the world can&#8217;t be awful.  Maybe it ain&#8217;t the JOBS that are the problem.</p>
<p>Crud.</p>
<p><a href="http://offdutymom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/disappointment1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-485" title="disappointment" alt="" src="http://offdutymom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/disappointment1.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183" height="183" width="275" /></a></p>
<p>So, what does one do when one is punched in the throat with the hot, sloppy mitts of Reality?</p>
<p>If &#8220;one&#8221; is &#8220;me,&#8221; then &#8220;one&#8221; makes inappropriate jokes, becomes sarcastic to a fault and hides behind the thin veil of snark and other condescention.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I use humor as a defense mechanism.  The problem with this is that everyone just thinks, then, that I am a snotty bitch.  I, however, think that I am hilarious.  I think I know how Joan Rivers must feel.  If she can feel anything with all that plastic shit in her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
See?  There I go again.</p>
<p><a href="http://offdutymom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/joan-rivers.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-486" title="joan rivers" alt="" src="http://offdutymom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/joan-rivers.jpg?w=194&#038;h=204" height="204" width="194" /></a>And, so I am left with trying to figure out a better coping skill here.  Throwing around ill-crafted jokery and f-bombs isn&#8217;t, in the end, really making me feel that much better.</p>
<p>I take that back.  It does make me feel better.  Plenty better, really.</p>
<p>But, it doesn&#8217;t make me HAPPY.  And, I wonder what happiness IS, even.  Not that I&#8217;ve never felt it, but I don&#8217;t know that I understand it in the way someone like John Stuart Mill or Martin Heidegger would have.</p>
<p>By the way, I am sure that my 200-level philosophy professor will come across this blog post one day and totally take back that &#8220;D&#8221; he gave me in 1996 because I referenced two dead guys above that I am sure he talked about in class.  Or something.  I don&#8217;t know.  I was probably hung over.</p>
<p>Anywho, I am now on the hunt.  I am in search of an explanation as to why I can&#8217;t settle my ass into a job, stay put for more than a handful of years, stop complaining about it, eventually retire and move to Tahiti already.  I constantly feel unsettled.  I feel as though I need to &#8220;find myself.&#8221;  Whatever the crap that means.  I question everyday what I am supposed to do with my life.  Then I make a lame joke about it all.</p>
<p>So, if you are working in a field or at a place that is just amazeballs, I would love to hear about it.  And, hear about when they&#8217;ll be interested in hiring a quirky misanthropic wannabe writer.  If you identify with feeling a little lost (despite being all grown up and being of an age when you are totally supposed to have your shit all figured out), let me know I am not alone.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I think there are some bad drivers I haven&#8217;t flicked off yet today, so I better hop to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nice is nice, to sum up my first trip to the <em>Côte d&#8217;Azur</em>. Actually, it&#8217;s awfully grand and I wish Blai could have come along on this work trip of mine. As it was, I had my lovely colleagues as company and we did pretty well on the eating front though there were a couple disappointments along the way. But the city, oh the city is beautiful and lots of fun with the sea and the hills and lots to see and do; I do hope to return one day.</p>
<p>I developed a slight obsession with the Niçoise <em>socca</em> during my week in Nice. This soft/crispy baked pancake is made of chickpea flour and is usually served as a snack with drinks. On our first night in the city, I dragged my friend and colleague to Chez Pipo, one of the best places for socca according to <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/06/the-best-socca/">David Lebovitz</a>. We grabbed the last available table outside and set to work on the menu. With such low prices (everything was about €2,50 per portion), we ordered one of everything to try. Salty <em>tapenade noire</em> and <em>anchoïade</em> were served with little toasts.</p>
<p><a title="Tapenade Noire et Anchoïade by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8084076882/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Tapenade Noire et Anchoïade" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8044/8084076882_1786785538.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Their <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pissaladi%C3%A8re">pissaladière</a></em> was delicious and I could easily have handled about three portions of this. However, there was cause for restraint as I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</p>
<p><a title="Pissaladière by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8084075806/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pissaladière" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8324/8084075806_222aa68b35.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We had quite a wait for our portion of <em>socca</em> as only a tray&#8217;s worth is made at a time (each tray being about the size of a wagon wheel). It was incredibly addictive with it&#8217;s crispy edges and softer centres&#8230;but then again, I adore chickpeas.</p>
<p><a title="Socca by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8084079125/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Socca" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8336/8084079125_ce305c7b4b.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.chezpipo.fr/">Chez Pipo</a><br />
13 Rue Bavastro<br />
Nice, France</p>
<p>After dinner, we strolled through old and new Nice to our next destination, a very important destination.</p>
<p><a title="Nice at Night by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8086906406/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Nice at Night" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8189/8086906406_25452f724f.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Place Masséna by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8086901430/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Place Masséna" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8334/8086901430_2a2a81b2f5.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The reason for our restraint at dinner was this: Fenocchio. One hundred flavours of ice cream. We made it our mission to try as many of these flavours as we could during the week. I think I only managed 7 overall.</p>
<p><a title="Fruit Flavours by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8084127520/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Fruit Flavours" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8469/8084127520_05ffa71e6a.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>My first tasting was of two scoops: an exquisite <em>marron glacé</em> studded with lots of the candied nut and a brilliant speculoos. It was a good start.</p>
<p><a title="My First Fenocchio Ice Cream by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8084121380/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="My First Fenocchio Ice Cream" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8475/8084121380_23d4f8c5bc.jpg" height="500" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Later in the week, two more flavours: a bright and fruity guava and a slightly disappointing, subdued salted butter caramel. I heard that the intensely chocolately flavours were excellent as were the other fruity ones. I can also vouch for the ginger flavour!</p>
<p><a title="Guava and Salted Caramel by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8103820461/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Guava and Salted Caramel" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8469/8103820461_c0a3576a2c.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We started at their stand in the old city by the tram line but then became loyal to their main stand in Place Rossetti. They have seats in the square and you get to gaze upon the imposing Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate. Oh, and they serve sundaes and waffles there too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fenocchio.fr/eng_index.html">Fenocchio</a><br />
2 place Rossetti (main shop)<br />
6 rue de la Poissonerie (not open every day)<br />
28 boulevard Jean Jaurès (by the tram line)<br />
Nice, France</p>
<p><a title="Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8103703910/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8045/8103703910_2220a708f3.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>On most days, there&#8217;s a fruit and vegetable market at Cours Saleya &#8211; more on that in the next post. What you want to look out for is <em>Chez Theresa</em> and their excellent socca.</p>
<p><a title="Socca by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8086995250/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Socca" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8086995250_24795ff8c2.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The large tray of socca sits on an oil drum stove, frying gently. It&#8217;s not cooked there but in an oven of Chez Theresa, located in the Old City; you can buy your socca at this location but it&#8217;s not quite the same. To get the socca from one site to the other, there&#8217;s a man and a moped and a trailer for the large tray.</p>
<p>Theresa herself serves the socca. It&#8217;s a pretty no-nonsense affair &#8211; hand over your €3 and get your portion. She&#8217;ll direct you to the salt and pepper (both recommended) and off you go with your snack.</p>
<p><a title="Serving the Socca by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8086993666/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Serving the Socca" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8055/8086993666_24a2779cdf.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Her socca isn&#8217;t much of a looker and could certainly be improved by being more crispy (it&#8217;s soft almost all the way through). However, what&#8217;s amazing about it is its flavour &#8211; all toasty and coated in extra virgin olive oil and so so good. It&#8217;s hard to stop burning your fingers as you reach for more. It&#8217;s highly recommended. On weekends, you can expect a queue for it.</p>

<p>Were these the best soccas in Nice? Well, I did try a couple others but mainly their flavour was weak. These two were certainly the best I tried on this visit.</p>
<p>Chez Theresa<br />
Cours Saleya (stall in the market)<br />
28 Rue Droite (shop in the old town)<br />
Nice</p>
<p>When in Nice, you can&#8217;t swing a cat without hitting a place that serves pizza. Nice is located very close to the Italian border (and was itself under Italian rule until 1860) and this shows in its local cuisine and well&#8230;all those pizza and pasta joints. We grabbed a random takeaway one from a cafe in the old city and took it over to the base of the castle. It has a good thin crust and good quality toppings &#8211; it sure beat most of the takeaway pizzas in London.</p>
<p><a title="Pizza by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8087931358/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pizza" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8051/8087931358_5589c16557.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I love that every takeaway pizza comes with a sachet of <em>sauce picante</em>, which turned out to be some pretty good chilli oil.</p>
<p><a title="Sauce Picante by su-lin, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/8087930146/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Sauce Picante" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8476/8087930146_f0d7596e3b.jpg" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We had also grabbed some pastries from the renowned <a href="http://www.patisseries-lac.com/">Patisserie Lac</a>. My friend&#8217;s intensely chocolate macaron filled with chocolate ganache almost did her in (in a very good way). I tried Lac&#8217;s version of the Niçoise <em>tourte de blettes</em>, a Swiss chard tart that comes in both sweet and savoury varieties (here be sweet). It was delicious with the raisins and pine nuts coming through rather than any vegetal flavour.</p>

<p>Our lunchtime view was nothing to sniff at either.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://room435.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/money-or-meaning.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-860" title="money or meaning" alt="" src="http://room435.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/money-or-meaning.jpg?w=510&#038;h=117" height="117" width="510" /></a></p>
<p>When did it become the middle class dream to quit your well paid job and open up a little artisan coffee shop in the slightly dingy part of town? I can’t count the number of people who have confessed this secret fantasy to me recently, and I know one <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_eliza_j">person</a> who has bitten the bullet to make it happen. It’s easy to see the allure. Especially for Generation Y (of which I am just on the verge) who have grown up with the expectation that work should be a rewarding and empowering pursuit, not a ball and chain around your neck.</p>
<p>This is partly because the wealthy western world is moving higher up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. It’s no longer enough for jobs to provide money, security and status. Now many of us are looking for careers which help us grow as people and reach our full potential. And that doesn’t just mean stimulating our brains, but our heart and soul aswell. In 1980 21% of British people felt the need to “fulfil myself as an individual by being more creative” whereas in 2012 this has risen to a staggering 61% (NVision). Creativity is no longer the sole domain of bohemians.  &#8221;Making stuff&#8221; has gone mainstream. &#8220;Making a difference&#8221; is building momentum.</p>
<p>London now feels to me to be a city divided (for aspiring professionals at least) into those who chase money and those who chase meaning. Success looks different depending on where you fall on this spectrum. And I see two parallel cities sitting side by side. There is the city of bankers and lawyers, whose astronomical wages allow them to exist on a higher plane to their once-while peers. And there is the city of the aspiring bloggers/fashionistas/tech start-ups/foodies/social entrepreneurs, rich in education and taste but priced out of ever owning their flat. They’re cycling to work partly for health and environmental reasons, partly because the tube is too expensive.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I decided to go into advertising was because it felt like I could have the best of both of these worlds. A career where you could make a bit of money while also fulfilling your intellectual and creative ambition. Of course what you realise once you’re in, is that you will inevitably still have to make that choice, at least once in your career. You’ll have to be honest with yourself: which is more important to you, money or meaning? Do you take the high paying job with the status boosting title and accept that the work will not be that exciting or ground-breaking. Or do you punt for the innovative hotshop where the drive is high, client budgets are low, output is near invisible and wages are modest. Most people will fall somewhere between the two. The ultimate dream is to have both creativity and commerce, but is that an impossible ask, or an outcome limited to the lucky few?</p>
<p>Perhaps we should take lessons from Hollywood. They don’t choose money or meaning, they alternate. The smartest actors do the big -budget box-office smash to earn enough money and credibility to invest into their indie project, which in turn gains the Oscars and kudos to drum up the next bankable role. That’s how George, Brad and Johnny roll. Less idealism, more pragmatism. Oprah Winfrey, the original celebrity sage sums it up best:</p>
<p>“You CAN have it all. You just can’t have it all at once”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memory is a problematic thing.  It is necessary that I trust it, but at the same time I understand that it is malleable.  On one hand, I have a very good memory—I remember my dad’s family sitting in my grandparents’ living room watching the fall of the Berlin wall. I was five at the time, not an age particularly known for being aware of world events, but I remember my family’s excitement.  On the other hand, I have memories that are slightly warped in detail.  The most obvious examples are my memories of movies, because I can track down the films and see how they are different from what I remember.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Collector Movie Poster" alt="" src="http://www.leninimports.com/terence_stamp_the_collector.jpg" height="428" width="231" />Now there were quite a few things I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch when I was younger of which I saw parts.  When I was a teenager, I set about tracking down these films.  Sometimes, I was disappointed by how different the film was from what I remembered.  Take for instance 1965’s <a title="The Collector" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059043/" target="_blank"><i>The Collector</i></a>, the way I remembered it perhaps shows my interest in radical retellings from a young age. In the film that I remember, the trapped woman has a lot more power and manipulates her captor.  When I finally tracked the film down as a teenager, I was disappointed by how truly helpless the woman was, particularly when she tries to escapes but feels guilty for hitting her kidnapper with a shovel.  The character of my memory wouldn&#8217;t have checked to see if he was all right; she would&#8217;ve got the hell out of there.  Originally, I had only seen the end where the women was dying of pneumonia, and I created a story around it. A story that I, as young girl, wanted, one where the victim can get the upper hand.  While the film may be a bit more realistic about the nature of abductions, I’m sad that what I remember doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other times where I was pleasantly surprised by the real films.  I <img class="alignright" title="Craig T. Nelson " alt="" src="http://www.tvacres.com/images/fraternal_hayden3.jpg" height="133" width="115" />remember catching bits and pieces a Red Riding Hood werewolf film.  I was disappointed when I found 1989’s <a title="1989 Red Riding Hood" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093831/" target="_blank"><i>Little Red Riding Hood</i></a>.  Yes, some parts were obviously what I remembered, but I didn&#8217;t remember Coach being in the film.  Also, where was that kick-ass werewolf transformation scene: the one were the wolf emerged from the person’a mouth discarding the human skin?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YZhioAOD1qM/TLIPOZp3D2I/AAAAAAAAANo/2LYyA3K1vPk/s320/PHOTO_8296316_40602_15862097_ap_320X240.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Still for The Company of Wolves " alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YZhioAOD1qM/TLIPOZp3D2I/AAAAAAAAANo/2LYyA3K1vPk/s320/PHOTO_8296316_40602_15862097_ap_320X240.jpg" height="164" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>It was in another film: <a title="The Company of Wolves" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087075/" target="_blank">T<i>he Company of Wolves</i></a>, one of my favorite films of all time.  Since I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch werewolf films, I had to switch to other channels whenever an adult walked through the room.  My memory was just snippets of the film. So when trying to recall it, it was only natural to assume that I’d only seen one werewolf movie involving little Red Riding Hood rather than two.  When I finally tracked down <i>The Company of Wolves</i>, I was surprised, but I much preferred the actually movie with its dreamlike quality and the fact there are several folktales, or at least folktale-like stories, embedded in the film.  I even memorized Perrault&#8217;s poem that was recited at the end.  Also, it introduced me to the writings of Angela Carter.</p>
<p>There are other memories that I&#8217;ve not been able to place.  I remember watching a film where two teenage boys and a girl try to break into a crypt.  The girl suddenly has vampire fangs and tries to bite one (there may have been two girls).  I&#8217;ve never found the film that this scene belongs to, but because I&#8217;ve tried to track it down I discovered other films like <i>Near Dark</i>, <i>Fright Night</i>, and <i>The Lost Boys</i>.  I sometimes wonder if I would even recognize the scene, maybe my memory is too different from the actual thing.  <i> </i></p>
<p>What can I take away from all of this?  I’m not sure.  Memory is a strange thing that changes, but it must be trusted because it’s all we have.  Maybe what I can take away is that exploring memory is worth while even if it sometimes disappoints. There are several vague memories that I have no context for: the above mentioned vampire scene or a scene from another film where girl escapes in a car from people with no skin.  I may never find these scenes again, because they only exist in my memory, but the search will be worth while.</p>
<p>(P.S. If you do recognize the scenes please tell me what films they are from.)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[While planning my own wedding at the start of the year I joined an online forum for brides (and grooms) to be. There were debates about wedding etiquette. There were discussions over who should lead the procession down the aisle. There were panics over centerpieces and rants about the rudeness of not replying promptly to [...]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=356&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Children are everywhere. This is how we all started out.</p>
<p>I recently read &#8220;Bringing up Bebe&#8221; by American author <a href="http://www.pameladruckerman.com/">Pamela Druckerman</a> about her experiences of living and raising her children in Paris. She is exposed to the French model of raising a child: from sleep to food to naughty allowances to manners &#8211; specifically how young children are well-behaved while enjoying fine dining.</p>
<p>Under the ideals of French parenting, no child should ever have poor table manners. This extends to eating out and eating politely and eating in fancy restaurants in a way that all patrons may enjoy their meal. There is something to this that our North American babyhood experience seems to lack.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Getting_down_to_it_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747821.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="English: Getting down to it Very poor table ma..." alt="English: Getting down to it Very poor table ma..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Getting_down_to_it_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747821.jpg/300px-Getting_down_to_it_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747821.jpg" height="225" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey! no elbows on the table! (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>I read an article regarding the new phenomenon of <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/10/19/child-free-zones/">&#8220;child-free&#8221; zones</a>: dining places where patrons can have a meal without the noise and distraction of children. I have kids and am not immune to their screaming. I also think it&#8217;s bad mannered to have kids screaming at the table, throwing food, or running around just because you may tolerate it and/or don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Once, for an anniversary celebration, my husband and I went out for dinner. We had no choice but to bring our daughter, who was almost 6 months old. She was a wailer and couldn&#8217;t be soothed. One of us ate, while the other paced the alley behind the restaurant, shushing and rocking to minimize the noise that patrons inside, behind a closed-door, might hear. Then we switched positions and finished our meal this way. Happy anniversary. No one thanked us for our consideration, but we got no dirty looks or evil glares on our way out. And we&#8217;ve been welcomed back to that restaurant.</p>
<p>I understand the issue that having toddlers tearing around a cafe or playing tag between waiters is annoying, disruptive, and dangerous. I can understand why people would want an &#8220;adult-only&#8221; environment. I don&#8217;t think, however, that this is the real issue. I think the issue is how we initially teach our children their manners and a sense of respect that this lack of etiquette has resulted in this growing problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been said that a family that eats together creates cohesion, as well as creating an environment where each person enjoys their food more, eats slower, and eats less overall. We are a society of &#8220;stuff-and-go;&#8221; how often do we even eat standing up, or in the car? In reality, one seated meal a day, with everyone present, is lucky in our house. But I can still teach my kids some basic expectations of courtesy and manners when we do eat together; they are not wild animals that <em>need</em> to multi-task with toys and can only eat noodles with their fingers.</p>
<p>Creating child-free zones does put a band-aid on a problem. Adults who have chosen not to have children, or those trying to take a break from their own households, may not welcome the chaos that can go along with another family&#8217;s brood. But the issue is why these children don&#8217;t have the understanding or expectation of what eating entails, especially when paying for a meal and being surrounded by strangers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://irunibreathe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/choky.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3060" title="choky" alt="" src="http://irunibreathe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/choky.jpg?w=287&#038;h=383" height="383" width="287" /></a></p>
<p>I am loath to have my own children dash around a restaurant because they are &#8220;bored.&#8221; Most places we visit provide some kind of coloring or small toys for distraction before we eat; as they get older we replace this with conversation. I have not specifically set out to create tiny perfect avatars of impeccably mannered diners. I was raised to behave appropriately when eating out (my own parents are from Europe) and expected the same of my children. I also started my children eating out young; meals sometimes were only as long as it took to order food and the kids to eat it, but so be it. They had the experience and didn&#8217;t have time to indulge in any destruction.</p>
<p>If we want to limit where we allow children the discretion could lie with an understanding of tolerable behavior. No one wants to admit their child behaves in a way that others find offensive. But we need to look at how we are helping these little people think it&#8217;s okay to throw food or run around a restaurant uninhibited. It starts in our own homes with our own meals. Maybe it&#8217;s time to all sit down together, and ask who sets the example.</p>

<p>*<strong>Do you feel like children are impeding on your space when you go out? (restaurant, museum, movie theatre)</strong></p>
<p>*<strong>Are parents being too permissive with children&#8217;s manners?</strong></p>
<p>*<strong>If you have children, how often do you eat a sit-down meal together?</strong><br />
