				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3801" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://asenseofbelonging.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/cornish-tree.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3801" alt="Cornish Tree" src="http://asenseofbelonging.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/cornish-tree.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An uprooted tree on the Nile Cornish, just outside of Tahrir Square.

<p>Egypt has just witnessed some of the fiercest clashes in the revolutionary era, as many protestors appear radicalized. There are still peaceful demonstrations, to be sure, but even these appear to be violently resisted by police. It is hard to blame the police, though, as the lines are blurred.</p>
<p>I missed out on the latest battles. I spent January 25 in Helwan, a city to the south of Cairo at the end of the Metro line. The Muslim Brotherhood was conducting an outreach campaign to counter-program the message of demonstrations and unrest offered in Tahrir. I planned to take the Metro downtown to see these protestors, but on the way the car stopped and sat for five minutes &#8211; at the very stop nearest our home in Maadi.</p>
<p>Demonstrators in Tahrir had cut the tracks, causing a backup. Rather than waiting what could be an hour or more, based on previous examples, I left and went home, seeking to catch up on the news of the day, and perhaps go down after a bit.</p>
<p>A minute later, before I was able to exit the station, the Metro started up again. Perhaps it was propitious I had left.</p>
<p>These pictures taken this morning are from my first visit back to Tahrir. The worst clashes occurred in the Suez Canal cities of Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez, where a state of emergency has been declared. It is hard to know precisely what happened anywhere &#8211; the consequence of sitting home and following news updates and Twitter bylines. But the pictures to follow give a disturbing indication of where Egypt stands at the moment.</p>
<p>Is this the last gasp of resistance to a new order, or a sign of worse things yet to come? Please pray for Egypt, either way.</p>

<p>I like El Prado and I like art, but sometimes an art gallery is an ordeal that strains every sinew in the artistic, unathletic body.<br />
<span id="more-59"></span></p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p>How to tackle an art gallery:</p>
<p>Divide and conquer</p>
<p>Take cubism by the early afternoon</p>
<p>Form base camp</p>
<p>Distribute rations</p>
<p>Establish a watch for errant surrealists</p>
<p>Attempt the summit in the morning</p>
<p>Of earlyÂ RenaissanceÂ and the Dutch</p>
<p>If you feel dizzy</p>
<p>Sit down and read a football magazine</p>
<p>Take this step-by-step</p>
<p>You are only one man</p>
<p>And this is an art gallery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care for cubism</p>
<p>It may seem unkind</p>
<p>To dismiss an entire school</p>
<p>And so out of hand</p>
<p>But there you go</p>
<p>This is my poem</p>
<p>And I can do whatever the hell I want</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>
<p>Modern art</p>
<p>See part 2</p>
<p>But I do like</p>
<p>The 300 paintings</p>
<p>Of a crucified Jesus</p>
<p>That are absent</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Friday, I saw the dark brown smudge<br />
rising to the sky over the river and knew.<br />
I just knewÂ its feel, look, sound, and haunting aroma.<br />
Iâd had more than a few of these blazing affairs<br />
when they existed for my artistic interpretation.<br />
The newsroom scanner would beep-boop-beep<br />
as its voice summoned the fire companies<br />
&#8230;and me.</p>
<p>I would race with them, drawn I was<br />
by that sign in the sky like<br />
some scribbling magus set on Bethlehem.<br />
Iâd see the smoke belch a column so rank,<br />
so thick from a portal eaten through the roof,<br />
or twining together from broken windows,<br />
you would think you could climb it<br />
like Jack&#8217;s beanstalk.</p>
<p>Then I would interview the inferno,<br />
making notes of what it wore, how it stood,<br />
how the lights within and without<br />
and the freezing water it drank framed it<br />
as some angry crystal phantasm, scorching faces<br />
in hellish ferocity all the while we suitors<br />
shivered in the mist from what Iâm sure was<br />
January&#8217;s frightful chill.</p>
<p>And then, I&#8217;d go back to write her<br />
biography and obit, later to stumble teary-eyed<br />
to my tiny flat, shuck my stinking clothes<br />
into the corner of the room, feel her<br />
scratchy touch on my skin, smell her<br />
fetid perfume on my body, knowing<br />
sheâd be with me for days. Then I&#8217;d sleep,<br />
naked, with my interviewee until morning.</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#993300;">Friday afternoon, I saw a column of smoke climbing over downtown Albany, and that ProustianÂ thing came upon me andÂ my imaginationÂ recalled the memories of the smell of fires in houses, barns, and mobile homesÂ I coveredÂ from my reporter days way up in New York&#8217;s North Country. It is not the romantic aroma of a simple woodfire.Â  Those memories coalesced in this rambling bit of verse.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/t.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-287" alt="letter T" src="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/t.jpg?w=110&#038;h=150" width="110" height="150" /></a>his weekend we lost some friends.</p>
<p>The news came in the form of a phone call from one of the parties involved. It was a sad goodbye, letting us know that our couples/family friendship, which we both enjoyed, was no longer. Their marriage was over. The culprit, of course, was sex.</p>
<p>I wonât pretend to empathize with either party. The pain they both must be going through is beyond my frame of reference. I wonât belittle it by offering platitudes. All I could do was offer condolences, reaffirm the âyouâve got to do what youâve got to doâ, and re-emphasize that although the nature of our friendship will never be the same, my love will still be there, unchanged.</p>
<p>The totality of the news, taken in all its context, left me feeling ugly and defeated. Couple friends where the moms, dads and kids all get along simultaneously are hard to come by, and that loss was enough to put a damper on the day. But it was also a blow against faithful, committed relationships in a way that makes you feel sad and dirty at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/superman-lois-lane-kiss.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1702" alt="superman-lois-lane-kiss" src="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/superman-lois-lane-kiss.png?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>What is this grip that sex has over us? Yes, Iâm a scientist. I understand the evolutionary importance and the irresistible limbic-system drive to procreate. I understand the biological rationale for sprinkling sexual implications into every aspect of our lives. I understand the neurochemical rewards we receive for having sex &#8212; how it feels so damn good it incentivizes more of the same behavior later. I appreciate that it is such a primitive, bare-bones, evolutionary drive that it sits right at the center of the collective psyche of our species, and for that reason itâs a really easy place for all the broken bits of our lives to manifest themselves and express themselves in our sexual behavior. It drives Kings to lose their kingdoms. It drives Presidents to impeachment. Countless families are torn apart by it. It makes actors cheat on Elizabeth Hurley.</p>
<p>For crying out loud, itâs just sex.</p>
<p>How much time in our lives do we spend actually performing sex, compared with everything else? Even a pr0n-actor who goes to work and has sex from 9-5, thatâs only 40 hours a week (assuming no overtime) which boils down to less than 25% of all the hours in a week. To spend even 1% of all the hours in your life having sex youâd have to spend roughly 90 minutes a week in the act of lovemaking. Though itâs certainly within the realm of possibility, married couples with kids will tell you (with a wink and a smile) that 90 minutes a week is a good week.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>TO SPEND EVEN 1% OF ALL THE HOURS IN YOUR LIFE HAVING SEX YOU&#8217;D HAVE TO SPEND ROUGHLY 90 MINUTES A WEEK IN THE ACT OF LOVEMAKING.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For something that takes up such a small fraction of the totality of what we do with our lives, how do we let it have such a grip over the rest? Entire industries revolve around sex. Those that donât are infected by it whether they admit it or not. Itâs everywhere. Itâs inescapable; and yet, the success of my day has more to do with what the traffic on the freeway is like, rather than whether or not I had sex the night before. The emotional implications, the domestic implications and the health implications of our sexual practices seem ridiculously out of balance given everything else our lives require of us.</p>
<p><a href="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/amazingspider-manannual21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1704" alt="AmazingSpider-ManAnnual21" src="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/amazingspider-manannual21.jpg?w=322&#038;h=490" width="322" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>There are a thousand things necessary for a successful day and a successful life. Balancing the checkbook. Reading to the kids. Visiting your parents. Maintenance on the house. Laughing. Resting. Playing. Growing. Learning. These are the things of life. These are the things that determine whether we are fulfilled, whether we are successful in life. None of them require intercourse. And yet still we venerate sex as the ultimate goal in life, as if everything else is just a way of occupying time between sexual interludes. We high-five our friends when they âgot luckyâ or âgot someâ or âgot some actionâ as if to say âWell done. You got that taken care of. Now you can move on to all the other stuff.â</p>
<p>Granted, there is no better way to foster intimacy with your partner than sex. It connects you and makes you vulnerable and draws you together with another person like no other way can. But when considering intimacy, it isnât even necessary for that (blasphemy, I know). Imagine the potency of your partner gently running her fingers through your hair, or down your back. Picture those moments when youâre lost, looking into your partnerâs eyes, and neither of you has to say anything. Think for a moment on the lasting rewards of gently holding hands, or on the way you can totally lose yourself in a deep, committed kiss. These too are the things of intimacy. Because of them, even if you never knew sex, surely you could still know intimacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tumblr_l5sd32wrtx1qbujox.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706" alt="tumblr_l5sd32wrTX1qbujox" src="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tumblr_l5sd32wrtx1qbujox.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>To be cold and clinical, the only thing sex is absolutely *REQUIRED* for is baby makingâ¦ and even in that case there are exceptions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>THE ONLY THING SEX IS ABSOLUTELY *REQUIRED* FOR IS BABY MAKING&#8230; AND EVEN IN THAT CASE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Last night lying in bed, after more than 10 years of marriage, I asked my wife âDo you trust me? I mean do you *REALLY* trust me?â</p>
<p>âOf course I doâ she replied. âI wouldnât have had three kids with you if I didnât.â</p>
<p>Sheâs no dummy. The idea of me stepping out on her is laughable. First of all, even if I wanted to, there is no opportunity. I work from 7am â 6pm and Iâm home within minutes for dinner. There are no real ânights out with the guysâ or âbusiness tripsâ which could be a cover for a clandestine meet-up with someone else. Sheâs all up in my life in a way that doesnât allow for secrets. Thatâs just the way it is. Add to that the fact that in real life, guys like me just donât get girls like her. Sheâs WAY above my station. Sheâs smarter than me. Sheâs more thoughtful than me. Sheâs a better parent than me. Sheâs more likeable than me. Sheâs infinitely better looking than me. She would have no problem finding a replacement for me. I, on the other hand, could never recover from losing her. Finally thereâs also the fact that I am totally in love with her. She fills my cup completely. I look across the table at her and I can not imagine a better life.</p>
<p>And then she went and had my babies, and with each one I fell in love with her even more.</p>
<p>To lose all that for the fleeting, momentary, primitive, physical gratification of an extramarital tryst would be the height of insanity â even if I had the desire.</p>
<p>Which I donât.</p>
<p><a href="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2060535-superman_wedding_super.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1707" alt="2060535-superman_wedding_super" src="http://dorkdaddydotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2060535-superman_wedding_super.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>It serves no purpose to play the pious blogger, and Iâm conscientious about coming across that way. I donât think Iâm any better than anyone else. I am a relativist at heart and I can appreciate that it takes two people to be in a relationship. You can never know whatâs going on behind the curtain in a relationship you arenât part of, or whatâs going on under the hood in a life you havenât lived. But I will say this:</p>
<p>If somehow the act of sex was cleanly extracted from my life leaving everything else intact, although it would be incredibly disappointing (and as laughable as it may sound) my life in its entirety would be relatively unaffected. Everything that I need to get through my day would still be there. The love, the intimacy, the laughter, the living of lifeâ¦</p>
<p>Iâd just have to find some other way to fill that 1% of my time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jlwrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/baby-horse-running-wallpaper-240x180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1253 alignleft" alt="Baby-Horse-Running-Wallpaper-240x180" src="http://jlwrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/baby-horse-running-wallpaper-240x180.jpg?w=720"   /></a>I want my mania back.</p>
<p>Now, if youâre normal, you probably canât understand why someone with Bipolar Disorder would even contemplate wanting a ride to the top of the roller coaster, particularly when whatâs waiting on the other side of the climb is a drop into depression.</p>
<p>Even if youâre Bipolar, you might not understand remembering mania wistfully. Getting deeply in debt, driving drunk or high, having sex with strangersâ¦why would anyone want to live that way? Certainly, Iâm in no hurry to return to my wicked, pre-medicated ways, but the life of lethargy Iâve been living lately has seriously outworn its welcome.</p>
<p>A little mania and my house wouldnât look like, well, like someone was too depressed to straighten. The cleaning ladies are scheduled to come tomorrow, but even that isnât uplifting. Without straightening, it wonât even look like they came except for the telltale trails of a vacuum cleaner. Add in the fact that we canât afford the mostly ineffectual crew but donât have the heart to fire the now 70-year old woman who has been cleaning our home since my son was two and who just lost her retirement savings in a series of ill-advised real estate transactions, and my morose mood is more understandable.</p>
<p>A little mania and I wouldnât be feeling like a parental failure because my sonâwho carries my genetic codeâbarely scraped together the four Cs and an A on his recent report card while my daughterâadopted from Chinaâcame home with all As . . .ok, one B+. Sure, my son also had an A in PE, but PE doesnât count. I know, I know . . .a class focused on activity suits his ADHD brain, PE is an important class in a society full of couch potatoes , an A is an A. Yada, yada, yada. And I know that lots of kids get Cs, even lots of kids we know and lots of kids we know who got into colleges they wanted to go to. Cs arenât Fs, but thatâs the problem. To me, Cs are just Fs with a silent F. Unkind and unfair, I know, and further evidence that I richly deserve the depression Iâm in.</p>
<p>A little mania and my creative well wouldnât have run dry. Iâd have posted witty commentary on Martin Luther King Jr.âs birthday, how I came to love the running skirt, watching my husband writhe in pain. Well, maybe that last one wouldnât have been witty. I might even have finally figured out how to get my sonâs obscene sense of humor featured in a blog with a PG13 rating.</p>
<p>Just a little mania, thatâs all Iâm looking for here. Of course, thereâs no such thing as a little mania. Oh, at first I think there could be, that I can keep the momentum from building out of control. But it always escalates so that what started as a trot through the park turns into a wild gallop and a crashing fall.</p>
<p>So, I took my meds. I let the house be cluttered beyond recognition. I sat my ass down at the computer and I wrote, even though writing was the last thing I thought I could do, and pulled these 600 plus words out of some secret place even I didnât know existed. Pretty soon, Iâll put on my running gearâit might even be warm enough for a skirt todayâthen get my ass off the chair and onto the trail. Iâll ignore that the unseasonably warm weather is most likely caused by global climate change which will lead to the early demise of our planet. At least, Iâll try.</p>
<p>Iâm sure all of that will help. But Iâll still miss my mania.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have heard it said, or more likely I have read, that we writers don&#8217;t find our voice until we&#8217;ve written one million words.</p>
<p>The first five times I read this it didn&#8217;t sink in. Â I read &#8220;million words&#8221; and thought &#8216;it will take me forever to write a million words &#8211; I&#8217;m just not going to worry about it.&#8217; Â But you know what I did worry about? Â For the last twenty years I have lamented the fact that I did not have a real, independent and bona fide style. Â I had no idea where this &#8216;style&#8217; thing came from, how my favorite writers got it, why I couldn&#8217;t find it. Â I was like David Banner trying to discover the answer to the tragedy of why I couldn&#8217;t make an important difference when things depended on it. Â But even then I was no closer to becoming the Hulk.</p>
<p>For writers style is everything. Â Style determines our use of language, the originality of our expression, the nature of our themes. Â Style is about the choices we make and how we tell our own individual truth. Â Without style we are still amateurs at best, and perhaps we are still imitating other writers. Â Imitation is fine. Â It has its place and time. Â Eventually, however, we must arrive at our own style.</p>
<p>I have to admit that style is a concept I have largely ignored outside of fretting over not having it. Â I never directly addressed style in teaching writing students about writing. Â Perhaps this is a good thing, or at least justifiable in the sense that most writing students (freshmen and sophomores) haven&#8217;t written enough to know their style. Â This is not to say that young writers can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t have a unique voice. Â Some people are just well attuned to their own nature from an early age and can express themselves with fair originality. Â But style, I meanÂ <em>style</em>. Â That comes from somewhere else.</p>
<p>For Christmas I was given two books by writer Natalie Goldberg: <em>Writing Down the Bones</em> and <em>Wild Mind</em>. Â I just finished readingÂ <em>Wild Mind</em> and among the gems of writerly wisdom that she imparted in that book was a return to this notion of a million words. Â A writer does not find his or her style until they have written a million words. Â She wasn&#8217;t even saying it as a fact, but was passingly observing the adage, yet the realization finally bloomed for me that I had not yet accomplished style because I simply had not written enough!</p>
<p><em>*Haaaaallelujah*</em></p>
<p>As weird as it might sound I had toe-giggles when I realized that I wasn&#8217;t a no-talent loser, I was still just finding myself. Â Why hadn&#8217;t I gotten the message before? Â All of the angst I carried prior to this epiphany was like the lost despair of the ugly duckling. Â I wasn&#8217;t good at what I was supposed to be &#8211; and yet, all I had to do was be what I was supposed to beÂ <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, though not so oddly considering that this is how I do things in life, as the realization that I needed to write my million words to gain my style finally settled on me, I also realized that I have finally identified my style &#8211; and just recently. Â This fall I wrote a story that not only manages the characteristics of magical realism which I thoroughly embrace, but also the lyricism of poetry. Â This story I wrote, which is in revision right now, was unlike anything I had ever written. Â It was relaxed, fluid, ephemeral, mystical. Â Many of the things I deeply enjoy in the books, movies and music I experience. Â I like the unusual, the weird. Â Chuck Palahniuk, David Lynch, Daniel Johnston. Â But because I was out of practice (being inexperienced due to a lack of writing enough) my writing had been stiff, distant, cautious. Â At last, however, the event met with the training, and I am happy to say that my style is now on the horizon.</p>
<p>I admonish all writers, from this moment on free yourself from worry that you don&#8217;t have the talent or that you don&#8217;t have an original voice. Â Write your million words &#8211; and I do mean a million. Â Write out some terrible, bland stories, even a whole novel as I did. Â Remember last year I finished a 560 page manuscript? Â Remember how I edited it down to 330? Â It turns out that the exercise was largely to fulfill my million words, and next year I will be rewriting the entire thing with . . . wait for it . . . <em>style!</em></p>
<p>Have I actually written a million words? Â Honestly I don&#8217;t know. Â A million words is around 3,000 pages. Â Yeah, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;ve written that much in my time. Â Probably almost three times that. Â But I don&#8217;t think all of those words count. Â Our million words need to be intentional, focused, unflinching writing in our most creative moments. Â A million words of fiction, a million words of memoir, a million words of poetry. Â A serious writer can do it in a few short years. Â This is how many famous writers established their careers as twenty-somethings. Â But regardless of how and when you do it, what you will get for a million words is yourself, and your readers will get you, too, and your stories, and all of the enrichment that literature brings.</p>
<p>Enjoy the process, my friends. Â There is nothing like the call to create &#8211; take the steps necessary to honor your craft. Â Read a million words. Â Write a million words.</p>
<p>And then write a million more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I look out my window at hundreds of tiny cars as my plane descends into Denver. <i>There are so many people in the world</i>. I get predictably overwhelmed by this thought whenever I am at a baseball stadium, a concert, or looking down at a city from the sky.</p>
<p>There are millions and billions of people, <i>everywhere</i>. I share personal histories with a few of them because we happened to be at the same place at the same time for one fleeting, overlapping moment in our lives. And yet somehow these histories with these people are unshakeable. Somehow they still matter, years later. They are still worth traveling great distances for.</p>
<p>Over the course of the weekend I will spend time with three different people from three different phases of my life: Anahitta from middle school, Scott from study abroad, and John from grad school. All three have, at one point, been my closest friend.</p>
<p>So itâs strange that anxiety and dread have outweighed my excitement leading up to this trip. I left work early yesterday with a crippling stomachache. I went to bed with a fever over one hundred. I had already made myself sick with my longing for what I feared might not still be there.</p>
<p>My curse has always been caring too much. I am nostalgic to a fault. I never get over anything. It has brought deep satisfaction to my relationships and rich color to my life, but it has also made me a selfish friend. My biggest fear is always that the people I love will move on into happy new lives without me. I havenât always taken the natural ebbs and flows of relationships with grace.</p>
<p>I am so afraid of being the one who is left hanging on tighter. Of being rejected by those who once loved me. I donât know where this fear comes from, but it is what caused me to hesitate in reaching out to these friends in the first place. It is why, with two of them, (the two who already live in Colorado), I suggested only that we meet for lunch.</p>
<p>Just for lunch. Because to ask for more than that would be to risk being a burden, or that they might say no. I understand, on some level, that this is illogical. These are people I used to do <i>everything </i>with. Scott and I traveled a continent together. John and I basically lived at each otherâs apartments and at IHOP whenever we werenât sleeping or in class.</p>
<p>But what if they no longer remember all those times and jokes and moments that transpired between us? What if theyâve moved on?</p>
<p>I am exhausted when Anahitta and I find each other at the airport. It is past midnight, but it is an amazing sixty degrees outside as we sit in our rental car trying to figure out how to start the damn thing. Itâs a red Mini Cooper with white racing stripes. Not what we requested. The key isnât really a key. How the hell do you start this piece of crap? Itâs so late. We laugh until we canât breathe. We always laugh until we canât breathe. She is the only person who has ever been able to make me laugh like this. She moved away when we were sixteen.</p>
<p><a href="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/anahitta.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-807" alt="Image" src="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/anahitta.jpeg?w=514" /></a><i>^Anahitta and me in 2005, at the St. Louis airport the night a big storm caused all the power to go out. All the employees abandoned their posts. It was pure chaos. Of course we had to take advantage of this opportunity to photograph ourselves in all the normally-forbidden airport areas, such as the conveyer belt.</i></p>
<p>At the hotel, Anahitta and I reminisce about 7<sup>th</sup> grade and all those afternoons at Leahâs house spent waiting for <i>Bye Bye Bye </i>to come on TRL. We may have different ethnicities, skin colors, and religions, but we will both always know exactly what it was like to be thirteen in America in the year 2000. So we remember <i>precisely</i> how important <i>Bye Bye Bye </i>was. Is.</p>
<p>We pull up all the classic music videos on YouTube. Britney Spears, Destinyâs Child, O-Town. And we dance.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, Scott saves us from the ghetto in which I booked our hotel (oops) and shows us the real city. He is not buying this âmeet for lunchâ thing. He wants to see me, he wants to spend time, he insists. This makes me so happy.</p>
<p>Scott and I share a million memories about Australia over dinner the first night, memories of travel and friendship and adventures gone wrong that I suddenly realize I have been suppressing <i>because they were so good</i>. Because there was no tangible way to take them home with me without feeling alienated from everyone and everything in my other life. Things I was afraid to remember because I was afraid heâd forget and I didnât want to be the only one left with the memory. But he remembers things I donât even remember. Like how mad he got the day I hitchhiked down the mountain.</p>
<p><a href="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/scott5.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image" id="i-809" alt="Image" src="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/scott5.jpeg?w=310&#038;h=414" width="310" height="414" /></a></p>
<p><i>^Scott and me in my Australia dorm room in 2007. These are the types of things you routinely find yourself doing when you have a limited internet quota.</i></p>
<p>âI was so depressed when I came home from Australia,â I admit to Scott after the waitress sets down our bison burgers. Then I lean in and add, hopefully, âDid you get depressed too?â</p>
<p>âOf course I did,â he says, no hesitation. âI knew it would be a long time until weâd all get to be together again. We still havenât been.â</p>
<p>He tells me that when he thinks about pure happiness and perfection, he thinks about Australia. He still keeps the photographs over his bed. I am so relieved he has felt the way I have, all this time. I make a mental note to put my photographs back up.</p>
<p>Later, Anahitta and I help Scott attempt a handstand on our hotel bed at the exact time of night his goofy side (his &#8220;little boy mode,&#8221; I used to call it) would always come out in Australia. I am amazed at how someone I knew for five months five years ago can still feel so familiar to me.</p>
<p>He spends most of the weekend with us.</p>
<p><a href="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photobooth.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-814" alt="Image" src="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photobooth.jpg?w=674" /></a></p>

<p>On Sunday, Anahitta and I have lunch with John. John and I share so many good memories from grad school that Iâm sure Anahitta must be bored out of her mind. But there are just so many. And they simply <i>must</i> be shared. My God we pulled a lot of pranks.</p>
<p><a href="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/john2.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image" id="i-819" alt="Image" src="http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/john2.jpeg?w=392&#038;h=377" width="392" height="377" /></a></p>
<p><em>^John and me the day we helped orchestrate the great Brown Bag Prank of 2010, in which our whole cohort showed up to our departmentâs âbrown bag meetingâ dressed in costumes made entirely out of brown bags.</em></p>
<p>John is also up for more than lunch. He takes us through downtown Boulder. We go into a bookstore and, within minutes, John and I are sequestered at the corner of a book display, our eyes lit up, speaking rapidly about every thought weâve had since we last spoke.</p>
<p>I think maybe the biggest thing John has done for me is given me permission to give voice to all my deepest, weirdest thoughts. He understands exactly what I mean when I say things like I get a perverse satisfaction from spending time with people I donât like, or that being a therapist makes me feel disgusted with myself, or that I had an existential crisis buying a couch. And I know what he means when he says he has built secret rooms in his metaphorical house or that he is profoundly affected by the wind. At times the rest of the bookstore seems to grow silent. I donât think anyone in the room, or the world, could possibly follow the pace and range of topics and darkness and lightness and humor and metaphors of this conversation. But to us, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>On Monday morning Anahitta and I return the red Mini Cooper with white racing stripes. We still hate this car.</p>
<p>I ask Anahitta what her favorite part of the weekend was as we ride the shuttle to our gates. She does not mention riding the gondola into the mountains. She says her favorite was the night we had dinner at the mall and bought sweaters. Because it felt like something we could do any day.</p>
<p>I canât follow that answer. Itâs the perfect answer.</p>
<p>Alone at my gate, I feel like I have been hit by a tidal wave. I have re-lived three major parts of my life in the past three days. Itâs a lot to sort out.</p>
<p>These three friends have allowed me to be three past selves: the silly pre-teen whose successful day is one in which she has laughed until she canât breathe, the easily-excitable twenty-year-old getting her first real taste of adventure, and the grad student trying to balance her hunger for knowledge and wisdom with her propensity for naÃ¯vetÃ© and pranks.</p>
<p>I think of two things as I board my plane.</p>
<p>First, I think of what my supervisor told me on the last day of grad school when I said I was sad to leave my friends. âWhenever I get to see the friends I went to school with,â she said, âI know that they still know me better than anyone.â</p>
<p>The other thing I think about is the line that has gone through my head whenever I have had to say my final goodbye to someone before one of us moves away. I always think, <i>I will never have a friend like that again. </i>I thought that ten years ago with Anahitta, five years ago with Scott, and two years ago with John. And a lot of times in between.</p>
<p>And now I know for sure that itâs true. It was true every time. Itâs always true.</p>
<p>But now, for the first time, I understand that this is not a sad thing. It has never meant that I will spend the rest of my days mourning. It has meant that I have been opened up to new parts of life and myself. It means that I have been lucky.</p>
<p>It means that, out of all the millions and billions of people in the world below my airplane as it takes off into the sky, I get to call a few of them my friends. And that when I get to see them two years from now, five years from now, ten years from now, and fifty years from nowâI will know that nothing has changed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>At a recent news conference, the EgyptianÂ InitiativeÂ for Personal Rights noted that, two years after January 25, <a href="http://eipr.org/en/pressrelease/2013/01/17/1595">many abuses of state power continue</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://arablit.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13290" alt="images" src="http://arablit.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images1.jpg?w=720"   /></a>Censorship is among these abuses: Attacks on journalists have been growing (see: <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2012/12/egypt-press-freedom-ashraf-khalil/">Index on Censorship</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jwkxFCiYmV98bxXo5yVRBKvYaToQ?docId=CNG.a63e78354ecead9d2d1929c90d0217e4.a81">AFP</a>, others). Lawsuits against journalists, creatives, and commentators for &#8220;insulting the president&#8221; have reached, according to the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, a &#8220;<a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/62968/Egypt/Politics-/Insulting-president-lawsuits-reach-year-peak-under.aspx">112-year high</a>.&#8221; Even the English-language press, traditionally freer, is being squeezed: Apparently Hani Shukrallah, the editor ofÂ <em>Ahram Online,<a href="https://twitter.com/HaniShukrallah/status/292649107414204416">Â </a></em><a href="https://twitter.com/HaniShukrallah/status/292649107414204416">is being pushed into early &#8220;retirement.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>(Presumably this was the reason for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=30599">lack of solidarity</a>&#8221; yesterday when there were threats directed at the Muslim Brotherhood&#8217;s paper.)</p>
<p>In other sectors, textbooks <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/education-ministry-faces-heat-after-deleting-unveiled-feminist-textbooks">have been altered</a>. <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/01/24/262239.html">EgyptAir&#8217;s in-flight movies</a> are going under new scrutiny.</p>
<p>Certainly, all the problems in Egypt&#8217;s cultural sector cannot be laid at the doorstep of censorship, nor of the Muslim Brotherhood. TheaterÂ director Galal El-Sharkawy told <i>Al-AhramÂ </i>last December thatÂ Egyptian theater simply continues its downward spiral. &#8220;But this is due to the Mubarak regime; what we witness today is a continuity of ending the arts in Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still &#8212; despite the beauties of a number of visual-art projects that have sprung up in the last two years, and <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/1121/17/Revolution-on-the-shelf.aspx">the surge in revolution-themed narratives</a> &#8212; censorship, instability, and fear of censorship create a difficult environment for longer-form artistic developments.</p>
<p>Those who support censorship in Egypt also might be able to count on help fromÂ John Brennan, who has been nominated by the US President Barack Obama to run theÂ CIA. Apparently,Â BrennanâsÂ <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/121759580/John-Brennan-MA-these-at-UT-Austin" rel="nofollow">1980 graduate thesis at the University of Texas</a>Â argued for increased state censorship in his case study, Egypt.</p>
<p>Not everyone is pessimistic. Publisher Sherif Bakr, of Al Arabi Publishing and Distributing, looks forward to more books on more new subjects in 2013, more translations, new independent bookstores, and &#8220;more professionalism&#8221; in book production. Â AndÂ in a recent interview with Mai Elwakil and Andeel at theÂ <em>Egypt Independent,Â </em>pioneering political cartoonist Amro Selim remained steadfast:</p>
<p><em id="__mceDel"><span id="more-13289"></span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We need to constantly push the boundaries whether they are set by society, the political regime or even a newspaperâs editors. If people equate your critique of a bearded political Islamist figure with atheism, then you must do it more, all the time, on purpose.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This is ground that we are gaining. It is a battle with possible lawsuits and threats. But we must continue.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We went through a lot to be able to draw the president every day. We won ground under Mubarakâs rule. At the beginning of Al-Dostour, I told them that we must shatter the god-like image of the ruler who we cannot draw.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We started drawing him from the back, and bit-by-bit we turned him around, until making a cartoon of him became the norm. Then we drew his sons, Gamal and Alaa.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were very happy when these cartoons were published. Before that, if Mubarak were ever represented, it would be with Egypt holding him like her beloved son.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We have come a long way in a society that asked us to ârespectâ the ruler. Now, they want us to go back.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When you see people dying or losing their eyes and limbs, you find yourself addressing topics fiercely. When you hear about the virginity tests and find the authorities and public defending them, I feel we have to strike back with the same intensity, even if some will be offended. Society will not change unless you challenge it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">As for editorial policies, they can be navigated through a mixture of negotiations and subtlety. I believe there is a communication channel between cartoonists and readers that even editors might miss. It is amusing to experiment with overcoming censorship.</p>
<p><strong>And poetry for the Second Anniversary, from Mostafa Ibrahim:</strong></p>
<p>Ibrahim&#8217;s collection of colloquial poetry, inspired by the first Jan 25 uprising, was recently published by BQFP.</p>
