				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So. After endless debate and vacillation, I have finally chosen a tattoo. Just over a year ago I published a post on <a title="Cellar Door" href="http://that-cellar-door.tumblr.com/" target="_parent">my tumblr</a> in which I wrestled with the idea of attaching meaning to a tattoo. Why, I argued, couldn’t a tattoo have meaning just because it is beautiful? Yet, despite my calls for simple aesthetic appeal, my own tattoo idea sprung out of perhaps the most meaningful time of my life.</p>
<div>
<p>I have gone through a lot throughout this past year. I went off to college, I lost friends, I made friends, I was depressed, I sunk into habitual self-harm, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and, finally, I came home. Somewhere along the line I found a new course of treatment, and subsequently got better. That’s right, better. And not just better, but better than ever. I learned a lot about myself as I went through the belly of the depression-whale and came out (pooped out?) the other side. (Sorry for the delightful imagery, and my sympathies to Jonah.) Now, out of the whale’s belly, I am more self-assured than ever and have reached a new understanding of who I am and what is valuable to me.</p>
<p>To say I fought depression alone would be to lie. A select few friends were there for me every step of the way, and when those friends could not be there I had something else: music. In particular, I had Next to Normal. For those of you who have not heard of Next to Normal (and riding on the assumption that I actually <em>have</em> a readership), here is a brief synopsis. Family of four. Wife is a bipolar depressive with delusions that her son is alive. Son died at 18 months old, making the family not 4 but 3 members strong. Daughter escapes through drugs, Husband tries to hold family together, Wife tries to kill herself then forgets everything then remembers then moves out. Phew. There’s an entire musical condensed into 15 seconds. What is important is not so much the plot, but the message that runs throughout the piece and stands alone in the form of a lyric– “There will be light.”</p>
<p>The promise of light at the end of the tunnel is what kept me going through the darkest of days. The depressive wife of Next to Normal (whose name “Diana” so closely resembles my own) has every chance to end her life or quit trying altogether but she holds on for her family’s sake and because somewhere inside of her she believes that at the end of the long night, there will be light. Likewise, I had numerous opportunities to give up. I could have swallowed the pills instead of checking myself into the hospital. I could have cut a little deeper. But maybe, just maybe, there would be a light that would make enduring the darkest of nights worthwhile. And there was light. God, my psychiatrist, and my war-weary friends all said it was good.</p>
<p>In the heat of my depression I made myself a promise–I would get a tattoo if and when I ever got better. Part of me, the part that fears commitment and permanence never fully believed I would get better. But there was always another part, the daredevil part, that knew I would. When the time finally came to begin deciding on tattoos, it was obvious what I would get. “There will be light.” The meaning was apparent.</p>
<p>But, as my original post shows, I value aesthetics just as much as meaning and believe that beauty can be meaning on its own. There was something about having words on my body that didn’t strike me as beautiful for some reason. I needed a picture, a symbol to embody the concept of “light.” That’s how I came up with this:</p>
<div id="attachment_91" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 90px"><a href="http://myquickbrownfox.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/images1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-91" title="Phosphorus" src="http://myquickbrownfox.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/images1.jpeg" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The alchemical symbol for phosphorus.</p></div>
</div>
<p>This symbol, as labeled in the caption, is the alchemical symbol for the element phosphorus. One characteristic of phosphorus is that it appears to trap light. Therefore the alchemical symbol for phosphorus is representative of light and spiritual illumination and awakening. Given my history, my fascination with light, and my inclination towards nerdy intellectual interests, nothing could be more suitable for my tattoo than this symbol.</p>
<p>The answer I gave in my first tattoo post to some future inquirer as to the meaning of my tattoo was a simple, “It’s beautiful.” This time around, my answer will not change. I still got my tattoo because I find it beautiful, except now beauty has a whole new definition. The beauty is in the meaning.</p>
<p>I’m not sure when or where I’ll get my tattoo, but I know I will. And when I do you, loyal readers, will be the first to know. (Or the second, after my friends, but I’m hoping those two categories overlap a little!) Thank you for listening to my rambling, and on the eve of my second year at college I leave you with this: “There will be light.”</p>
<p>Good night and best wishes to you all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Et tú, Melky?</p>
<p>In 2005, I fell out of love with baseball.  That was the year that Rafael Palmeiro tested positive for anabolic steroids after swearing – under oath – that he never used them.</p>
<p>I was probably more betrayed by the lying, than by whatever it is he actually did or took.   And, so I began a complete baseball boycott that lasted five seasons.</p>
<p>Here’s what Palmeiro said to Congress – under oath &#8212; in March 2005:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Let me start by telling you this: I have never used steroids, period. I don&#8217;t know how to say it any more clearly than that. Never.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Five months later, Palmeiro was suspended for failing a drug test.</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2121659" target="_blank">ESPN: Palmeiro Docked 10 Days For Steroids</a></p>
<p>And, so I fell out of love with baseball.  Not because Rafael Palmeiro was my favorite player.  He wasn’t, although I loved him as an Oriole.  Still, I was angry enough to quit baseball.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to say it any more clearly than this … I’m quite conflicted over performance enhancing drugs (PEDs).</p>
<p>Here’s the Yogic view.  Yoga includes the Yamas and Niyamas, limbs governing personal behavior and lifestyle.   One of the rules is Purity – often defined as not abusing the body with unhealthy food, drugs, or activities.  Clearly, Purity is at risk when you’re taking PEDs.  Another rule is Truthfulness.</p>
<p>From a Yogic perspective, PEDs destroy the body (and we already know that the body can be severely and permanently damaged by the use of many of these drugs).   Lying about it just compounds things.</p>
<div id="attachment_135" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://baseballzen9.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/stevie-dew.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-135" title="Stevie Dew" src="http://baseballzen9.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/stevie-dew.jpg?w=300&h=266" alt="" width="300" height="266" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Even Stevie, my cat, knows about my own Performance Enhancing Drug &#8212; my daily Diet Mountain Dew habit.</em></span></p></div>
<p>OK, full disclosure from me.  I use PEDs.   I’m using right now.  I have caffeine every day, even though I know it’s not good for my body.   Is it a PED?  You bet it is.  It makes me a better massage therapist and a better Yoga instructor.  It ensures that I can teach a Yoga class late in the evening and still be “on” and bright-eyed.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just a mild stimulant.  But, it’s still a stimulant.  It’s a drug.  I use it.  And, I’m not the only one.  So, you see how quickly this issue can become complicated.</p>
<p>Many of us are guilty of using something that “enhances” our work or our play.  Maybe there are some in baseball who see their PEDs as simply <em>their</em> version of caffeine.</p>
<p>The difference is that in baseball – and other sports – the use of these drugs is forbidden.</p>
<p>And, some people get caught.</p>
<p>The more I read, the more people whisper, the more I hear that <em>everyone</em> in baseball is doing it; only the unlucky few get caught.</p>
<p>I guess I would argue that, if it is going to be banned, then Major League Baseball has a responsibility to work a little harder to find and punish as many “cheaters” as possible.</p>
<p>And, why are some of these drugs banned when others like cortisone – also a steroid – are not only approved, but, from my perspective, downright abused by pro sports?</p>
<p>My husband argues that PEDs skew baseball records – and part of what makes baseball so special is its love for tradition and statistics.  But, even before PEDs, there were amphetamines and who knows what kind of snake oil they were using before that. If Roger Maris deserved an asterisk on his homerun season (an asterisk that actually never existed), then shouldn&#8217;t those who broke records under the cloud of steroids?  (Although, to be fair, none of them actually tested positive for anything.  So, who&#8217;s to know?)</p>
<p>And, what about spitballs, pine tar, phantom tags, and myriad other forms of cheating?</p>
<p>(By the way, the Giants&#8217; Melky Cabrera could even still win the NL batting title this year, despite his suspension this month.  I like the Giants and all, but still, that seems a bit unfair.)</p>
<p>I don’t like steroids.  I don’t like cheaters.  And, I don’t like liars.</p>
<p>I’m just trying to figure out why Melky Cabrera &#8212; or anyone &#8212; would risk it.  Maybe I need to look at it from another perspective.</p>
<p>When ballplayers hit .300 they&#8217;re considered superstars.  (My husband and I joke that the Orioles are unaware that batting averages are allowed to go <em>that</em> high.)</p>
<p>But, think about it, these guys who are batting .300 are “out” two out of three at bats.   And, they&#8217;re the BEST in the game.  In their world, taking a chance on a PED, knowing that you might &#8212; <em>might</em> &#8212; get caught, but probably won’t, is way better odds than their regular day at the plate.</p>
<p><strong>The rewards far outweigh the risks.</strong></p>
<p>Last night on ESPN, Orel Hershiser argued that until MLB takes the PED situation seriously – by making the penalty severe enough that a player would be foolish to risk it – then the problem will continue.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball will continue to nab the unfortunate few careless or unlucky enough to get caught and everyone else will breathe a sigh of relief that it wasn’t them … and go back to what they were doing.</p>
<p>So, are we fans angry because they <em>used</em> drugs?   Or, because they got caught?</p>
<p>Are Giants&#8217; and A’s fans angry because Melky Cabrera and Bartolo Colon used drugs or because they got caught leaving their pennant-chasing teams in the lurch?   (On the other hand, are Dodgers&#8217; and Angels&#8217; fans secretly gleeful?)</p>
<p>Are we sitting smug and self-righteous, secretly happy to see a rich superstar have a run of bad luck?  Or, are we hypocrites because we cut corners in our own lives, maybe even cheat from time to time, and take our own forms of performance enhancing drugs?</p>
<p>So, here I sit, my Diet Mountain Dew – my own PED &#8212; right next to me, trying to make sense of it all.  And, all I come back to is this.  I don’t know how to feel.  Betrayed?  Angry?  Or, just resigned to the fact that as long as a game offers such enormous rewards, it will be worth the risk for a player to be all he, or she, can be.</p>
<p>I just don’t know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live theater&#8217;s great and all, but time, theater schedules and money prevent us from experiencing it every day. So sometimes, we have to get our rocks off in different media. And there&#8217;s none more exciting right now than television, but that&#8217;s another post altogether. Today, I want to talk <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.twitter.com/allisonlcarter">follow me on Twitter</a>, you&#8217;ve probably seen me fangirling about this show for the past couple weeks. Prior to that, I was slogging my way through the brilliant yet bleak <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/">Breaking Bad</a>. </em>Intellectually, I knew that was a great show. The acting was subtle and nuanced; the writing was complex and intense. Yet I found myself dreading watching every episode, simply because its world view, its view of humanity itself, is so depressing. After reaching the end of the first season, I needed a break from the blackness.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;d heard about this <em>Doctor Who </em>thing, some kind of retro 1960s British something or other involving time travel, a police box and a man who changes his face when it&#8217;s convenient to change actors, a la James Bond. I&#8217;d turned my nose up at it, assuming it was silly sci fi stuff (and I, of course, am a very serious <em>fantasy </em>fan). I assumed I&#8217;d need a lot of back story about the Doctor, since the show had run for more than 20 years in its heyday from the &#8217;60s to the &#8217;80s. Then one day, for reasons I can&#8217;t recall, I fired up Netflix and found the reboot, started in 2005, available for streaming. And I set off through time and space with the Ninth Doctor and the indomitable Rose.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to love about the show. Its silliness, its quintessential Britishness. The clever way it plays with the laws of physics and time; the irreverent way it ignores them when it suits the greater narrative purpose. Its fantastic characters and the relationships between them (and I ship Rose and the Tenth Doctor like <em>whoa</em><em>).</em> But most of all, this is a show that gives me hope.</p>
<p>Silly thing, to think a TV show could give you hope. We tend to think of TV as disposable entertainment, not the same kind of <em>serious </em>mental stimulation as theater or literature or even film. But you try hearing the Ninth Doctor exclaim &#8220;Fantastic!&#8221; without smiling. You try to see Rose&#8217;s insatiable curiosity for life without gazing up at the stars and wondering. You try listening to one of the Tenth Doctor&#8217;s odes to humanity, to our boundless potential for greatness and, yes, terror, without being a bit in awe of all the wibbly, wobbly stuff inside you.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who </em>is often described in England as a show for kids, but I&#8217;d argue it&#8217;s a childlike show. The most powerful force in the Whoverse is curiosity. It&#8217;s what keeps the Doctor sailing through time&#8211;even though he&#8217;s lived more than 600 years, he can still be amazed by everything from an intricate clockwork robot to a single amusing word. Curiosity is what inspires every companion to leave her life behind for one of danger but infinite possibility. In the beginning of the series, it wasn&#8217;t the Doctor (in his ninth incarnation, played with real verve and menace by Christopher Eccleston) who drew me in; it was his cockney companion Rose, who wanted, insatiably, to see everything. Her childlike joy and wonder at the world was what kept me watching.</p>
<p>In the world of <em>Doctor Who</em>, it&#8217;s only when we stop wondering, stop feeling, that things go dark. Both of the Doctor&#8217;s most fearsome enemies, the tin can Daleks and the hollow Cybermen, have cut out all emotion. All wonder. All hope. That is what we have to fear, not what lays beyond the stars.</p>
<p>In a way, <em>Doctor Who </em>most reminds me of that other campy, silly, moving show, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>. </em>At first glance, the similarities are small. Male lead, female lead. British, American. Sci fi, fantasy. Sure, they both play off fascinating gender norm subversions. Buffy subverts female stereotypes: she&#8217;s active, she&#8217;s violent, she fights with her hands and her feet and Mr. Pointy. But the Doctor fights with his massive brain and a sonic screwdriver. He usually abhors violence, except when he doesn&#8217;t. At times, he&#8217;s almost effete, often sexless. Compare that to his vital second companion Martha, who for all her faults, is a truly physical character: a physician, a fighter, a sexual being. Everything&#8217;s flip-flopped and it&#8217;s <em>fantastic. </em></p>
<p>But even more than that, both shows are tales which, at their best, lead us to believe in the unending goodness of people. They&#8217;re stories of people who walk through great darkness but don&#8217;t let it consume them.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Buffy had to save the world, even if it meant sending her boyfriend to hell, she always had a quip and a smile. She always remembered that the school dance was almost as important as killing those weird dog monsters.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Doctor chooses to keep traveling with human companions, even though &#8220;you can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can&#8217;t spend the rest of mine with you.&#8221; He chooses to laugh and to smile and to dance. He chooses not to let his loneliness as the last of the Time Lords (dumb name, yeah) devour him, but to use his gifts to save as many people as he can.</p>
<p>Sometimes he fails. Sometimes Buffy failed. Both shows have a lot of death. But through it all, both characters choose to fight and live every day as best they can. Which is all any of us are doing, when it comes right down to it.</p>
<p>As anyone who watched <em>Buffy </em>can tell you, the darkness got her in the end. Also, the show became kind of awful. But both of these characters represent a kind of hope you don&#8217;t find that often in media any more. They&#8217;re <em>heroes</em>, dammit, not these new-fangled anti-heroes. They&#8217;re people who fight, even when it&#8217;s hard, because it needs to be done.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s about the idea that what&#8217;s important is the fight, that our everyday struggles matter, and the belief that even if we can&#8217;t win the fight, maybe we can make the world a little better place just by trying.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll go back to <em>Breaking<strong> </strong>Bad</em> one of these days, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a profound experience on the nature of despair and man&#8217;s capability for evil. But for now, I&#8217;ve got three and a half more series&#8217; worth of wondering what&#8217;s above us, behind us, and most of all, ahead of us. No matter what face the Doctor may wear, I&#8217;ll be along for the ride, and fighting the good fight beside him.</p>
<p>Buffy can come, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. <strong>Inspiration.</strong> Since this will be your travel bible you must be able to open it and find instant inspiration. Reserve the first page for your travel inspiration. Write quotes, paste photos of the places you want to visit, checklist of things you want to experience. Basically put whatever that will encourage you to go travel. This page can also cheer you up from your homesickness during your travel.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/44-journal-quotes1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/44-journal-quotes1.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-67"></span>2. <strong>Flight schedule.</strong> Dates, time of departure and arrival, terminal and flight number. I also write here my passport number and expiration date so I don’t have to bring my passport out when filling out arrival cards during the flight.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/45-journal-sched.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/45-journal-sched.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>3. <strong>Priority list/ Itinerary.</strong> I don’t do detailed itinerary rather I just make a list of my must- see, visit, eat and do. I check this list and try to figure out when to do it during my stay.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/46-journal-must-see.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/46-journal-must-see.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>4. <strong>Area guide. </strong> Most cities are big and have a lot to offer. Breakdown the areas and write the attractions and places you can visit. It will help you to plan out your day and make the most out of your stay.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/68.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/68.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>5. <strong>Hotel Information</strong>. Write the address, telephone number and email. It’s hard memorizing the street names in a different country and it’s harder to pronounce them. Not all taxi drivers know the hotels especially hostels and budget lodgings but give them the address and they will get you there.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/46-journal-hotel.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/46-journal-hotel.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>6. <strong>Directions.</strong> This will seriously save you time and money. Public transportations are cheaper and more fun than hailing a cab all the time. Research about how you can get from one place to another by bus, train or boat. Most information are available online. Write as many options as possible if you can ride the bus or hop on a train to get there, write both methods.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/50-journal-walking-route.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/50-journal-walking-route.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>7. <strong>Entrance fees and tour prices.</strong> Just so you have an idea on how to budget your money. It’s also useful for buying tickets from your hotel or tour agencies. You can compare prices and see if you can get it cheaper if you buy directly. Write all the attractions even those not in your priority list.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/49-attraction-and-prices.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/49-attraction-and-prices.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>8. Some Asian countries such as Hongkong, Singapore and Bangkok have very extensive and efficient train systems that are interconnected throughout the city. Stop wasting time navigating your route at the train station. Print maps and plan your route before stepping out of your hotel.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/56-hongkong.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/56-hongkong.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>9. <strong>DIY walking tour map.</strong> In some cities like Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Ho Chi Minh the tourist attractions and sightseeing spots are concentrated in one area. I suggest you skip the city tour and do it your own. Go crazy on Google Maps and plot your own walking route.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/50-journal-walking-route1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/50-journal-walking-route1.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>10. <strong>Time zones and Exchange rates.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/67.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/67.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>11. <strong>Contact list.</strong> You’ll never know when you’ll need to make an important call. This is important when your mobile phone is dead. Write down all important contact numbers you might need. Your families’ cell numbers, your airline’s support hotlines, contact numbers of people you know at the countries your visiting even if you have no plans of meeting them there.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/61-journal-size.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/61-journal-size.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>12. <strong>Hotel area.</strong> This is useful if you’re staying at the central and busy district such as Chinatown in Singapore, Khao San Road in Bangkok or at Pham Ngu Lao in Ho Chi Minh where you can explore many areas within walking distance to your hotel.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/52-khao-san.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/52-khao-san.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>13. <strong>Expenses.</strong> A lot the remaining blank pages to list your expenses throughout the day. It will help you control your budget and check whether you’re spending your money wisely.</p>
<p><a href="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/55-expense.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://yestotravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/55-expense.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s true. I like to pin things on Pinterest; and probably not unlike <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/25/pinterest-user-demographics/" target="_blank">many women who use pinterest,</a> I have also deluded myself in to thinking that I&#8217;m crafty. In earnest, I&#8217;m a unique hybrid of ambitious and lazy.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain.</p>
<h2>The Inspiration: Delicate Artwork To Honor Your Home State</h2>
<p><a href="http://theharpsterhome.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/heart-in-ohio/" target="_blank">The Harpster Home wordpress blog</a> did a post about how their heart was in Ohio and they would commemorate the state with art. Her artwork was later pinned on to, as NPR&#8217;s described Pinterest, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/22/147222619/so-pinterest-is-a-womans-world-does-that-matter" target="_blank">social media&#8217;s newest darling</a>.</p>
<p>
<div style='padding-bottom:2px;line-height:0;'><a href='http://pinterest.com/pin/262053272038487606/' target='_blank'><img src='http://media-cache-lt0.pinterest.com/upload/153966880980913309_LHUUNh4e_c.jpg' border='0' width='422' height='750' /></a></div>
<div style='float:left;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;'>
<p style='font-size:10px;color:#76838b;'>Source: <a style='text-decoration:underline;font-size:10px;color:#76838b;' href='http://theharpsterhome.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/heart-in-ohio/'>theharpsterhome.wordpress.com</a> via <a style='text-decoration:underline;font-size:10px;color:#76838b;' href='http://pinterest.com/mschulzinger/' target='_blank'>Martha</a> on <a style='text-decoration:underline;color:#76838b;' href='http://pinterest.com' target='_blank'>Pinterest</a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I saw this image with the description, &#8220;finally a tutorial on how to do it!&#8221; <em>Well, I can do that,</em> I thought.</p>
<h2>Instructions? Nah, More Like Suggestions.</h2>
<p>Enter <em>lazy</em>, stage left.</p>
<p>I did not actually proceed to the tutorial until I had returned from the craft store with the materials I thought I would need and by then it was too late.</p>
<h3>Materials You Should Not Buy</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlestmartha/7907717646/" title="Crafting by littlestmartha, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8438/7907717646_bd1381f642.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Crafting"></a></p>
<p>You will see pictured here: canvas, corkboard, hot glue gun, pins, thread and an adult beverage. Contrast that to a piece of wood that needs to be sanded down, primed and painted, a hammer, nails and string.</p>
<h3>Step 1: [Image Not Available] Reinforcing The Canvas</h3>
<p>I knew, but was not phased, that the pins would fall right through the canvas and so before any real work could begin I cut the corkboard to size and wedged it behind the canvas. Hot glue kept the boards from sliding around back there.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Cut Out the State and Start Pinning</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlestmartha/7907731466/" title="Outline the state with pins. #Pinterest #Fail by littlestmartha, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8298/7907731466_e05029215d.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Outline the state with pins. #Pinterest #Fail"></a></p>
<p>As with all my projects, this has a promising start.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Remove The Template And Convince Yourself That This Might Still Work Out</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlestmartha/7907735422/" title="Finished #AZ state outline #pinterest #fail by littlestmartha, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/7907735422_4b839e5a94.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Finished #AZ state outline #pinterest #fail"></a></p>
<p>Doubt is starting to trickle in as I wonder how these crooked pins are going to affect the integrity of the artwork. Oh well. Onward!</p>
<h3>Step 4: You&#8217;ve Got To Have Art</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlestmartha/7907747608/" title="Now add #heart. #pinterest #fail by littlestmartha, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/7907747608_a6ea2b28a6.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Now add #heart. #pinterest #fail"></a></p>
<p>As <em>Those Damn Yankees</em> taught me, <a href="http://youtu.be/Ry8CpIg2fvU" target="_blank">You&#8217;ve Got To Have Heart:</a> <em>You&#8217;ve gotta have hope/Mustn&#8217;t sit around and mope/Nothin&#8217;s half as bad as it may appear.</em></p>
<h3>Step 5: Carefully Thread The Pins With, Uh, Thread</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlestmartha/7907755192/" title="String it up. #pinterest #fail by littlestmartha, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7907755192_d6b72fe487.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="String it up. #pinterest #fail"></a></p>
<p><em>Hey, that&#8217;s not half bad. Let&#8217;s do it two more times!</em> &ndash; says a glutton for punishment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen these melted crayon works of art all over the internet lately (see examples of some <a title="here" href="http://emphasisadded.tumblr.com/post/9865255724" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://leslielovesmakeup.blogspot.com/2012/05/chevron-art-using-melted-crayons.html" target="_blank">here </a>or even <a href="http://imgfave.com/search/melted%20crayon" target="_blank">here</a>).  I figured I&#8217;d give it a try too since they look pretty neat.  I only saw pictures and didn&#8217;t read any sort of tips on how to do it, so here&#8217;s what I found from making a melted crayon painting.  You could <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/87669543/custom-melted-crayon-art-with-your" target="_blank">buy </a>one of these paintings if you really wanted, but it&#8217;s more fun making it yourself like I did!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2255.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-108" title="My Crayon Artwork" src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2255.jpg?w=368&h=263" alt="" width="368" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>     First off, get a canvas or wooden board or whatever you want your art to be on.  I bought a three-pack of canvases at Walmart for a couple dollars.  It doesn&#8217;t need to be a fancy canvas since you&#8217;re going to be covering it up anyways.  I prefer the stretched canvas mainly because they are so much easier to hang up on a wall, but this one&#8217;s just a flat canvas.</p>
<p><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2211.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Draw your silhouette onto your canvas with a permanent marker." src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2211.jpg?w=155&h=111" alt="" width="155" height="111" /></a></p>
<p>Since my crayon art is a silhouette in the rain, I found this silhouette online and drew it onto my canvas with a black Sharpie.</p>
<p><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2258.jpg"><img class="wp-image-109 alignleft" title="Select your Crayola crayon colors &amp; unwrap them." src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2258.jpg?w=155&h=116" alt="" width="155" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>Next, gather some crayons in the colors that you&#8217;ll need for your crayon art.<br />
<strong>Do NOT cheap out on the crayons you use</strong>.  I tried doing a test with some dollar store crayons, but they didn&#8217;t melt and drip at all.  Stick with Crayola, for sure.  For my rain, I used blue, indigo, blue green, robin&#8217;s egg blue, turquoise blue, and grey crayons.  Then don&#8217;t forget to unwrap the crayons you will be using.</p>
<p><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2232.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Protect your floor/tabletop by putting down some cardboard." src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2232.jpg?w=155&h=116" alt="" width="155" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to put some cardboard down so you don&#8217;t get melted crayon wax all over the place.  The wax might splatter in all directions, so prepare ahead for that.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to start melting some crayons.  I covered my silhouette with a sheet of paper, but depending on your design, you might like the crayon to melt onto your silhouette (it&#8217;s completely up to you!).  Place your canvas on your cardboard and grab your hair dryer (or heat gun if you have one).  Test out how to melt the crayons on a scrap sheet of paper or on your cardboard (but not too close to the canvas) to get a feel for how the crayons melt and drip based on the different heat and speed levels on your hair dryer.</p>
<p><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2232.jpg"><br />
</a><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2224.jpg"><img class="wp-image-101 alignleft" title="The first couple drips..." src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2224.jpg?w=232&h=166" alt="" width="232" height="166" /></a><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2227.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="This is about when I stopped melting crayons onto the canvas &amp; then used my hair dryer to elongate the drips" src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2227.jpg?w=221&h=166" alt="" width="221" height="166" /></a><a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2229.jpg"><img title="Elongating the drips with a hair dryer...now for the silhouette reveal!" src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2229.jpg?w=227&h=171" alt="" width="227" height="171" /></a>    <a href="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2230.jpg"><img title="Looks pretty good to me!  Just need some touch ups with white out where the wax got under the umbrella." src="http://aworldofinspirations.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_2230.jpg?w=221&h=166" alt="" width="221" height="166" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Here is what I found to be the easiest way to do this</strong>:<br />
1)  When you first start melting a crayon, do so on the side on top your cardboard.  That way, you can turn your hair dryer on high heat at the highest speed until you see the crayon wax beginning to drip of crayon.<br />
2)  Hold the melting crayon directly in front of the canvas with the hair dryer still directed at it (but pointed downward so it drips down the canvas)<br />
3)  When you see the crayon&#8217;s about to drip, tap the canvas to get the melted crayon onto the canvas.  Then you can use the hair dryer to blow the wax down into a drip on the canvas.<br />
4)  When you have enough drips on the canvas (it will take longer than you expect), you can simply use the hair dryer to elongate the crayon rain drops.</p>
<p><strong>Some useful tips</strong>:<br />
- Don&#8217;t worry if the drip doesn&#8217;t go down very far.  While you&#8217;re making new drips, you will be melting the nearby crayon wax, which will continue to drip as well.<br />
- *Make sure you don&#8217;t have the hair dryer blowing too strongly or the wax might start moving upward or sideways*<br />
- If the crayon wax drips below the paper covering your silhouette or in places you don&#8217;t want it to drip, you can always touch that up with some white out at the end.  I had to do that for a little bit right under the right side of the umbrella.  If it gets on the black sharpie area, the wax can simply be scratched off.</p>
<p>Here is my masterpiece!  I think it turned out pretty cool.  I&#8217;m definitely going to do more with melting crayons in the future.  It took a while, but I enjoyed doing it.</p>

It&#8217;s kind of nice how things come in stages. First we were hauling up an unreasonable amount of summer squash, then it was tomatoes. Now it&#8217;s the beans chance to shine. They are the most abundant vegetable in the garden right now. All of these came from the pole beans&#8211;which are <em>finally</em> starting to produce a decent yield. (Which makes hunting in <a href="http://lieslmade.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/how-to-grow-a-woman-from-the-ground/" target="_blank">that jungle</a> worth it.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lieslree/7906117056/" title="Melons by Liesl ♥, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/7906117056_30f527248b.jpg" width="475" alt="Melons"></a><br />
Our melons didn&#8217;t do too great this year. Almost all of them rotted away on the bottom. I&#8217;ve been rotating them each day, so the water moisture pooling at the bottom can dry out. The ones above were picked early for fear of rotting away. They would have been tastier if they vine ripened.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lieslree/7906115730/" title="Canned Tomatoes by Liesl ♥, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7906115730_e1fa5feb86.jpg" width="475" alt="Canned Tomatoes"></a><br />
My Mom canned up a ton of tomatoes. Most were from our garden but some came from a friend&#8217;s garden.</p>
<p>In other news: I&#8217;m ashamed to say that I had let <a href="http://lieslmade.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/minty/" target="_blank">my mints</a> get a little worse for wear. I tended them best I could, watering them and keeping them out of the intense heat but it came down to the fact that they simply needed to be <a href="http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/mintrepotting.htm" target="_blank">re-potted</a>. The roots were crowding themselves out and the soil was pretty depleted. (I just used top soil&#8212;which will work for a little while but not long term.) So I removed them from their containers, cut off a healthy looking chunk and re-potted them with fresh soil. I&#8217;m happy to say after a week or two, they are perking back up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time for a check-up.</p>
<p>It had been nearly 2 weeks since we discovered our hive had swarmed, and while we were still left with over 30,000 bees in the hive, we needed to give a little bit of time for the new queen to get established, take  a few mating flights, and get busy laying her eggs.</p>
<p>With the waiting period over, Cam and I undertook the deepest dive we&#8217;ve ever made into the hive. We had 4 supers in the hive AND a top-feeder (where we had placed the excess comb and honey from the last visit). So this meant that we were going 5 levels deep. The purpose of this visit was to get to the bottom super and inspect the egg laying pattern of the new queen to understand whether she will be a strong queen (as defined by being able to lay enough eggs).</p>
<div id="attachment_947" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1172.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-947" title="IMG_1172" src="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1172.jpg?w=1024&h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mr. Combover holding one of the frames.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 1: Remove the Top Feeder</strong></p>
<p>We removed the top feeder which had a lot of bees in it. We set it aside after scraping the excess comb out of the box. The reason we don&#8217;t want excess comb in the box is that the bees will then try and fill it with honey, but because it is not built on a frame, we will be unable to harvest. With my new learnings from Bryon at Her Majesty&#8217;s Bees I confidently scraped the excess comb into a comb-box (an old shoe box) where we&#8217;ve taken to storing all the scraped comb &#8211; a better solution than just scraping onto the roof! After cleaning out the comb, there were still about 100-200 bees in the top feeder just hanging out.  We set it aside at an angle and let the rest of the bees find their way back to the hive. We removed the top feeder all together on this visit and not put it back on.</p>
<div id="attachment_951" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_11751.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-951" title="IMG_1175" src="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_11751.jpg?w=1024&h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our &#8220;Comb&#8221; box.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Get in There!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super #4:</strong> We had 4 Supers in our hive. The top box was completely filled and capped with honey! To lift it off was a challenge since it was stacked so high at nearly shoulder height. The Super weighed at least 40 lbs. &#8211; likely more with all the bees in it and capped honey. This Super is ready to be harvested but we decided to wait a few weeks before renting the equipment to harvest for the benefits of economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Super #3:</strong> As you may remember from the last visit, we placed a brand new Super with 8 new frames as the 3rd Super in the hive. Just two weeks ago, this Super was completely new and empty, now, just two weeks later, the frames were all built with comb, and nearly four of the frames were filled with honey and starting to be capped! This was exciting progress, although, with being at the peak of honey production, not altogether surprising. Likely two more weeks and this Super will be ready to harvest along with #4!</p>
<p><strong>Super #2:</strong> Supers #3 &amp; #4 were all honey and comb, but as we get to Super #2, we&#8217;re entering into the queen&#8217;s territory. Along with the bottom Super, this is where the Queen lays her eggs. The frames are a much different color, dark chocolate brown. This was also a milestone because to-date in our year of being beekeepers, we had never dived into the brood Supers where the Queen lays the eggs. We had always inspected only so far as the honey supers, trusting the Queen had everything under control in &#8220;her&#8221; Supers since there were plenty of bees, etc&#8230; Needless to say, these supers were packed to the brim with bees and we immediately noticed that they had built comb on the exterior wooden frames which are not intended for comb &#8211; a clear sign they were short on space &#8211; and a clear sign that, had we been more diligent in our visits, we could have identified earlier, so as to avoid the swarming of the bees.</p>
<p>The visit started to get intense at this point, as we got closer to the Queen, the bees started getting more and more inquisitive and active in checking us out. This was probably starting to feel like an invasion vs. a visit for them.</p>
<p>We stayed focused, inspected the frames, and diligently cleaned off excess comb where possible. Overall, the egg laying pattern looked intermittent, and quite honestly, without having closely inspected the egg laying pattern on past visits, it was challenging to understand whether the pattern looked &#8220;good&#8221; or not? In general, we understood that the more closely packed the capped brood cells looked, the more healthy the Queen&#8217;s strength.</p>
<div id="attachment_948" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"><a href="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1176.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-948" title="IMG_1176" src="http://beesomebody.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1176.jpg?w=768&h=1024" alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Here is Cam, having just set Super #3 on the roof, so we can begin to explore into Super #2. Look closely, you can see all the bees that have taken an interest in Cam and his activities. At this point there were hundreds of bees in the air, flying around Cam and Mr. Combover. This photo was taken about 10 seconds before Cam&#8217;s first sting of the visit.</p></div>
<p><strong>Super #1:</strong> As if going 3 deep wasn&#8217;t enough, we were now entering the bottom super, likely the Queen&#8217;s layer! This was our first time here. The bees reached a new level of frenzy which gave us a good indication that the Queen was near.</p>
<p>At this point Cam was stung on his black socks. A quick yell, a quick hop, a quick walk away. Settled down, he returned as the good soldier he is.</p>
<p>Here in Super #1, we started to inspect the frames and immediately recognized what Bryon had taught us were swarm cells hanging on the bottom of the frames. These were remnants from the previous swarm of a few weeks ago. We scraped them clean, took some pictures of the brood pattern, and very quickly started to lose our confidence. I don&#8217;t want to use the word panic, but with Cam having just been stung, the bees in a frenzy, and an overall overwhelming feeling of having 3 Supers open around us, and bees everywhere, we decided rather than try and go frame by frame and try and identify the Queen (what we should have done), we would take a few pictures and bring them to Bryon to ask his opinion on the egg laying pattern and thus the strength and viability of our Queen.</p>
