				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The RCVS headquarters tidy-up has revealed <a title="A model hoof" href="http://rcvscharitabletrustlibrary.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/a-model-hoof/" target="_blank">another</a> gem, and led us to discover the fascinating story of a troubled man. Eight large prints of paintings by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802-1873), depicting animals and bucolic scenes, have been discovered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="Edwin Henry Landseer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Henry_Landseer" target="_blank">Landseer</a> (1802-1873), an English painter, was renowned for his paintings of horses and dogs. Included in his artistic achievements are the lion sculptures in Trafalgar Square. His dog paintings of the 1830&#8242;s are by far his most popular work, ‘Dignity and Impudence’ (1839) being the most famous of all.</p>
<div id="attachment_1310" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 256px"><a href="http://rcvscharitabletrustlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dutyimpudence.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1310" alt="Edwin Landseers 'Dignity and impudence' 1839" src="http://rcvscharitabletrustlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dutyimpudence.jpg?w=246&#038;h=300" width="246" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dignity and Impudence (1839)</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two dogs in the life sized ‘portrait’ belonged to Jacob Bell, a chemist, who commissioned the work. The bloodhound is called Grafton and the West Highland terrier is named Scratch. Landseer cleverly parodies the Dutch portraiture style, where the subject is framed by either a window or a door, with a hand hanging over the edge. According to the <a title="The Tate" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/landseer-dignity-and-impudence-n00604/text-summary" target="_blank">Tate’s</a> summary of Landseer’s painting, Grafton was quite the bohemian and was a visitor at several artists’ studios in London but Scratch was Bell’s favourite of the two dogs. Apparently, Bell made a bet with the owner of a poodle that his West Highland terrier was the better looking of the two. Landseer was to be the judge, he took one look at Scratch and announced, without any prompting, &#8216;Oh what a beauty!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bell and Landseer’s lifelong friendship was founded on a mutual love of animals. Eventually Landseer came to rely on Bell as a business advisor, being ill equipped to deal with every day business matters. Along with Landseer’s brother James, Bell oversaw the commission and sale of his portraits, securing the very best prices. He took on rather more duties than a normal business manager might, as he was heavily involved in the rebuilding of Landseer’s home and helped him to purchase land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Landseer was the youngest son of an engraver and initially developed his talents with his father. He was later sent, along with his two brothers, to study under Benjamin Robert Haydon, the historical painter, in 1815. It was Haydon who encouraged Landseer to study animal anatomy. His early paintings benefit from his excellent anatomical knowledge and portray a variety of moral messages which contributed to his popularity with his Victorian audience. His later work was marred by his sentimentality and the humanization of his animal subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Landseer had social as well as professional success; his friends included Dickens and Thackeray. He moved freely in aristocratic circles and enjoyed royal patronage in the 1840s.  A favourite painter of Queen Victoria’s, she described Landseer as being ‘very good looking although rather short’. Landseer visited Balmoral in 1850 to paint a portrait of the royal family. The painting was never finished, and the failure of his first royal commission greatly contributed to his deteriorating mental health.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1840, Landseer suffered a severe mental breakdown, thought to be triggered by the <a title="The Duchess of Bedford" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Russell,_Duchess_of_Bedford" target="_blank">Duchess of Bedford&#8217;s</a> refusal of his marriage proposal (Incidentally, the Duchess was the originator of the very British concept of ‘afternoon tea’!). For the rest of Landseer’s life he was plagued by severe bouts of depression, exacerbated by his alcohol and drug use. His family had him declared insane in July 1872. Landseer died a year later on 1 October, 1873. The country mourned the loss greatly, shops and houses lowered their blinds, flags were hung at half mast and crowds lined the street to watch his funeral procession.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With his irreverent book <em><a title="Half Empty, David Rakoff" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rakoff#Half_Empty" target="_blank">Half Empty</a></em>, David Rakoff made me laugh. Out loud and lots. But he also explained, succinctly and in his unique way (here insert adult content warning), what being an artist is really about (the italics are mine):</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">… hanging out can be marvellous. But hanging out does not make one an artist. And secondhand wardrobe does not make one an artist. Neither do a hair-trigger temper, melancholic nature, propensity for tears, hating your parents, nor even HIV—I hate to say it—none of these make one an artist. They can help, but just as being gay does not make one witty (you can suck a mile of cock, as my friend Sarah Thyre puts it, it still won’t make you Oscar Wilde, believe me), <em>the only thing that makes one an artist is making art. And that requires the precise opposite of hanging out; a deeply lonely and unglamorous task of tolerating yourself long enough to push something out.</em></p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The Myth of the Bohemian persists with good reason. Given the choice between a day spent giving oneself over to oil painting, or one spent in the confining grid of office cubicles, most folks would opt for the old fantasy of the carnal chaos of drop cloths, easels, turpentine, raffia wrapped Chianti bottles holding drippy candle ends, and cavorting nude models, forgetting momentarily the lack of financial security and <em>the necessary hours and hours of solitude spent fucking up over and over again</em>.</p>
<p>I never met David Rakoff in person but we did exchange a few emails after I wrote to tell him how much I enjoyed his book. In that note, I also sent him my hopes and best wishes for recovery from his cancer that he talked about in <em>Half Empty</em>. (Yes, he could be funny about that too.) He wrote back, which I didn&#8217;t expect. He even called me a mensch for writing him and saying what I did, and the memory of that can still make me feel good. But it also makes me feel sad because David Rakoff died not long after, on August 9th, 2012. He was 48 years old.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of good stuff in <em>Half Empty</em> but what I remember most are those passages about making art. Rakoff reminded us that being an artist is a lot less about <em>being</em> something than it is about <em>doing</em> a bunch of things. If you really want to make this thing called art—and you don&#8217;t have to want that, there are plenty of other things worth wanting, but <em>if</em> you do—don&#8217;t be seduced by the metric tons of bullshit and distraction that befoul the path.</p>
<p>Work hard. Fuck up. Then fuck up again. Stay as still as you can in the face of confusion and failure and discouragement, and work some more. Occasionally you might try going away for a little while—not too long though—but then you get back to work, and do it all over again. And one day, after you&#8217;ve emptied your trash bin for the gazillionth time and learned how to curse in seven languages, it&#8217;s possible, just possible, that you step back and look at this thing—this thing you made, a picture, a paragraph, a lyric—and you hear a voice in your head saying, <em>wow, I made this</em>.</p>
<p>And, by the way, if you come across some fellow traveler also doing the art grind and they happen to have pushed out something pretty cool, why not give them a shout and let them know how much you like it. It breaks the solitude (theirs, yours, who knows?). For a little while anyway. And it might mean more than you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f41579.jpg"><img src="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f41579.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="windmill" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6886" /></a>Ever since my first time there in 2009, SXSW has been one of my favorite stops on my annual festival circuit. There&#8217;s a casualness to everything in Austin that makes it feel often less like work and more like fun. Add in good barbecue and Mexican food, fun traditions like seeing films at the Alamo Drafthouse, and catching up with farflung friends, and the event serves as a great transition to Spring spent away from still-too-cold New York City. Of course, this isn&#8217;t to discount the films themselves, still the main reason to attend. Even though I missed quite a few titles I&#8217;d been hoping to see, I still saw enough of this year&#8217;s lineup to devote three posts. Today&#8217;s will look at the Competition, while upcoming ones will offer brief thoughts on the Documentary Spotlight, Visions, 24 Beats Per Second, SXGlobal, and Special Events.<span id="more-6960"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13792" target="_blank">WILLIAM AND THE WINDMILL</a><br />
With the exception of the Audience Award winning THE SHORT GAME, I managed to see the remaining seven documentary competition titles, which this year were culled from over 900 submissions. The winner of the Grand Jury Prize was Ben Nabors&#8217; portrait of what happens after a young Malawian man receives international attention for teaching himself how to build a working windmill out of junk parts (pictured above). William Kamkwaba&#8217;s story is somewhat well-known, the subject of a popular book, and covered in various media appearances, aided by his proud mentor, TED&#8217;s Tom Rielly. Smartly, Nabors focuses less on the backstory and more on the results of William&#8217;s unexpected fame &#8211; educational opportunities that offer hope for real advancement not only for the reserved young man, but for his family and community. It&#8217;s a hopeful, but at the same time not entirely simple story, as William faces culture shock, the downsides of celebrity, and the pressures of having to live up to the &#8220;boy genius&#8221; myth propagated by his earlier accomplishments. </p>
<p><a href="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2551_15.jpg"><img src="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2551_15-e1363308404665.jpg?w=300&#038;h=154" alt="Touba wide" width="300" height="154" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6962" /></a><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13829" target="_blank">TOUBA</a><br />
Nabors&#8217; wasn&#8217;t the only doc singled out at Tuesday&#8217;s awards ceremony. The jury also bestowed two special recognitions, one going to Scott Duncan, the cinematographer of E Chai Vasarhelyi&#8217;s observational film about a massive three-day Muslim pilgrimage in Senegal. Given that, it&#8217;s almost superfluous to note just how stunningly shot the film is &#8211; beautiful 16mm, occasionally shot from high angles and employing judicious use of timelapse photography, shows off the spectacle of the Grand Magaal and the million strong Sufis who trek to the holy city to celebrate the legacy of their non-violent 19th century leader. Vasarhelyi&#8217;s film offers a unique look at Islam, both in its African context and without focusing on war or conflict.</p>
<p><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13796" target="_blank">WE ALWAYS LIE TO STRANGERS</a><br />
The second special jury prize recognized the directing work of AJ Schnack and David Wilson for their years in the making ode to Branson MO, long the site of immensely popular family-oriented musical/variety entertainment &#8211; though the film never really delves into the town&#8217;s history to explain just why that is. Through multiple characters, Schnack and Wilson, notably joined by fellow producer and cinematographer Nathan Truesdell, offer an engaging portrait of a community and a way of life that&#8217;s under threat due to the economic crisis, with family-run shows suffering noticeably from audience dropoff, the result of cutbacks faced by their largely middle-class traditional clientele. Weaving together a range of figures, from the plucky mayor trying to find ways for her beloved town to bounce back, to a semi-closeted gay couple facing relationship and child custody troubles in a conservative part of the country, the film is more expansive than one might initially imagine, presenting a rounded sense of a part of the country that outsiders might too easily judge and dismiss, but who, as the title suggests, may not be privy to the full story.</p>
<p><a href="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f42307.jpg"><img src="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f42307.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="12 o clock boys" width="300" height="199" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6963" /></a><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13973" target="_blank">12 O&#8217;CLOCK BOYS</a><br />
Another unexpectedly insider portrait, Lotfy Nathan&#8217;s exceptional film explores Baltimore&#8217;s infamous dirt-bike riders, African-American youth who take to the streets each Sunday in a show of defiance and bravado, demonstrating gravity-defying wheelies and often antagonizing authorities. Nathan&#8217;s entreé into this world is brash Pug, a younger boy aiming to join the ranks of this titular group. Following him over several years, and employing often breathtakingly stylized cinematography, Nathan presents an urban landscape of danger, excitement, and few opportunities, where the act of claiming the roadways constitutes a rebellion against inequality and injustice &#8211; though one that can easily take the riders&#8217; or bystanders&#8217; lives through accident or, as some here claim, harsh police tactics.</p>
<p><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13767" target="_blank">LOS WILD ONES</a><br />
Also offering a look into a subculture is Elise Salomon&#8217;s likeable rockabilly music doc. Her main subject is Irishman Reb Kennedy, who runs his small indie label, Wild Ones, out of his LA home and backyard, dependent on his wife to keep the operation going. She&#8217;s not the only member of his family, however, as the various, largely Latino, musicians he works with have become his de facto children. Salomon shows the affection they show for one another, borne not only out of an at-times unorthodox business relationship, but also by being part of a relatively small, underground scene. As Kennedy contemplates making a massive change &#8211; moving from vinyl albums to potentially finally embracing digital &#8211; the film explores what it means for these working class musicians to perform as they try to balance &#8220;real jobs,&#8221; families, and the occasional rockstar experience when playing gigs to far more appreciate overseas audiences.</p>
<p><a href="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f42912.jpg"><img src="http://1basil1.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/f42912.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="hey bartender" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6964" /></a><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13797" target="_blank">HEY BARTENDER</a><br />
Speaking of rockstars, Douglas Tirola&#8217;s film makes the argument that the new ones are actually bartenders, and their instrument of choice is the craft cocktail. Through the story of two bars &#8211; Westport CT&#8217;s corner bar, Dunville&#8217;s, and NYC&#8217;s speakeasy-styled Employees Only &#8211; Tirola traces the rise, fall, and return of the popularity of the bartender, aided by a who&#8217;s who of the cocktail world. At the center of the doc are two winning characters: Dunville&#8217;s Steve Carpentieri, an ordinary guy initially resistant to changing things up in his unassuming local watering hole, and Steve Schneider, a charismatic former Marine who&#8217;s channeled past demons into a quest to become the best bartender in the world. As seemingly disparate as they are, they both keep the audience on their side, tempering the sometimes overstated coolness or assumed import of cocktail culture with real, relatable subjects.</p>
<p><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_FS13802" target="_blank">BIG JOY: THE ADVENTURES OF JAMES BROUGHTON</a><br />
Finally, Eric Slade and Stephen Silha tell the tale of the Californian experimental filmmaker, poet, playwright, and sexually liberated activist. Their film draws together the various parts of his biography, which included relationships with women &#8211; including film critic Pauline Kael and artist (and eventual wife) Suzanna Hart &#8211; and men, including his longterm younger partner, Joel Singer; early film success, claiming a prize at Cannes in 1954 only to ignore the call of a mainstream movie career; and a career teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute. The result is an at-times absorbing biography of a multi-faceted individual whose inspirational creativity and life was motivated, as indicated by the film&#8217;s title, by an expression of pleasure.</p>

<p>This is a big deal physics-wise, and as Michio Kaku says <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50142871n">in this interview</a>, &#8220;Champagne bottles are popping in laboratories around the world&#8221; in celebration of the news. If you want to party too now that the God Particle has arrived, here are some tips on food, drink and tunes for your upcoming physics hoe-down.</p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong> Thematic snack and drinks are a must! Get creative with snacks that celebrate the atomic, the exploding, and the art of smashing. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know the <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2012/08/classic-whiskey-smash">Smash</a> is a cocktail that already exists? And clearly the perfect choice for a party celebrating the work of an atom-smasher.  This super-simple whiskey drink has a splash of citrus and mint, make it a little more atomic with a garnish of your favorite leafy herb or variety of mint.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.honey.com/recipes/detail/17/choc-oat-late-honey-smash-snacks">Smash Snacks</a> like these can include all sorts of party mix favorites from chocolate chips to pretzels.</li>
<li>These <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jeff-mauro/atomic-hash-browns-recipe/index.html">Atomic Hash Browns</a> are likely to be a big hit, but be warned, they can bring the heat! Cut back on the Cayenne if you are looking for a milder alternative.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/30420-maxime-bilets-exploding-chocolate">Exploding Chocolate</a> might be a bit adventurous, but if you love crisp rice in your chocolate and want that extra pop-rock zing, give this recipe a try to wow your guests!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music</strong> There are lots of great options when it comes to thematic tunes to enjoy, but here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/">Symphony of Science</a> &#8211; When I have a rough day and need to remember the majestic beauty of the universe instead of the grueling drudgery of subway delays and gross weather, this is what I put on. All the joy and wonder of some of the most inspirational scientists of our times, beautifully auto-tuned tracks. A recipe for goosebumps, seriously.</li>
<li><a href="http://nineplanets.org/musiclist.html">The Planets, Gustav Holst</a> &#8211; Classical works of music based on the features of the 9 (yes I said 9) planets. If these aren&#8217;t already in your library, check them out. You&#8217;ll feel awesome on a planetary scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are you planning to celebrate the big discovery? Share your ideas in the comments section so all our parties will rock!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent 12 days in Kauai with my family. It was great to get away and spend time together in beautiful Kaua&#8217;i. The cones of my eyes are now so used to bright sun and saturated colors that everything looks one color now that I&#8217;m home in the grey Pacific NW.</p>
<p>I slipped away to do a little bit of sketching but I really wasn&#8217;t prepared for the intensity of the sun when I wasn&#8217;t in the shade.</p>
<div id="attachment_4254" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 468px"><a href="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hanalai-bay-kauai.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4254 " alt="7&quot; x 10&quot; watercolor in sketchbook" src="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hanalai-bay-kauai.jpg?w=458&#038;h=338" width="458" height="338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">7&#8243; x 10&#8243; watercolor in sketchbook</p></div>
<p>This was done in Hanalei, near the north end of the island. It&#8217;s a surfer beach, I forget the name of this particular one.</p>
<div id="attachment_4255" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 468px"><a href="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/from-the-end-of-hokualele-r.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4255 " alt="7&quot; x 10&quot; watercolor" src="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/from-the-end-of-hokualele-r.jpg?w=458&#038;h=342" width="458" height="342" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">7&#8243; x 10&#8243; watercolor</p></div>
<p>I never figured out the name of this mountain in Anahola on the east shore. I found a nice shady spot at the dead end of the road to do this one.</p>
<div id="attachment_4256" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 468px"><a href="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tree-in-kapaa-kauai.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4256 " alt="7&quot; x 10&quot; water color and ink" src="http://billsharp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tree-in-kapaa-kauai.jpg?w=458&#038;h=334" width="458" height="334" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">7&#8243; x 10&#8243; water color and ink</p></div>
<p>There was a large vacant spot, between resort condos, on the beach near Kapaa on the east shore. The beach was quiet and I was pretty much on my own here. If you didn&#8217;t look back to shore, it was easy to imagine being on a deserted island. This is the view in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>When I turned around toward the ocean, this is was the view:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If ‘conditions were favorable’ for romance, why would Orville or Wilbur Wright turn it down?</em></p>
<p>My husband and I are big early aviation enthusiasts. We hang little plane ornaments on our Christmas tree. We have a small replica of the “Glamorous Glennis” with Chuck Yeager’s signature on it and the Time Life collection of books on flight. So when we were visiting North Carolina’s Outer Banks in October 1999, we visited the Wright Brothers Memorial at Kill Devil Hills. Granted, our fascination with flight hadn’t (yet) reached all the way back to when it was invented, but we enjoyed touring the museum and learning about this fascinating pair of inventors&#8211;they did printing? They had a little newspaper? What’s this wind tunnel thing? You mean there were two other Wright brothers in the family? We checked out the beautiful granite structure atop big Kill Devil Hill and got stuck with some of the little cactuses planted there. Note to self: Stay. On. The pathways.  </p>
<p>Then an announcement from a park ranger: presentation in 30 minutes. We thought, well, we might-as-well hear how they managed to invent the world’s first flying machine. It seemed impossible to me, experimenting, building, lifting this 600-pound thing into the wind and controlling it, being brave enough to risk your life in the name of science. And it really inspired me&#8211;maybe things aren’t as impossible as they seem? I don’t remember the name of the park ranger who delivered the presentation that day, but he lit a fire inside of me for these two men. I’ve never seen a more animated, enthusiastic presentation. My gut rolled. I got goose bumps.</p>
<p>I walked out of that room completely smitten.</p>
<p>I had to buy a little model Flyer. I had to buy some books. I left the museum with Fred Howard’s <em>Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers</em>. I also bought a book called <em>Miracle at Kitty Hawk</em>, a selection of several hundred letters compiled and edited by a biographer named Fred Kelly. While there were many anecdotes, facts, stories and interpretations that fascinated me in these books, nothing fascinated me more than these two things: the Wright brothers’ bachelorhood, and the (somewhat annoying) self-focus displayed in their letters. I admit it was such a turn-off, I couldn’t finish reading Kelly’s book.</p>
<p>At the time, I had no answers or insight about these peculiarities. I just thought about it for a while, shrugged it off and then&#8230;</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2009. A full ten years later. We had two sons by that time, William and Reese. William, born in 2002, had been diagnosed with moderate autism at 2 years old. He could not say or nod the word “yes” at age 3-1/2. He was fascinated by the texture of grass, loved swatting at the little yellow key dangling from the electrical box out behind the house, running his hands under water, obsessively lining up his blocks in front of the fireplace, making a bee-line for the doorway whenever we were in crowded rooms. I knew it before the evaluators pronounced the a-word, and I wondered: What will the future be like for him? For us? Doctors and therapists shook their heads and said “I don’t know.” They couldn’t give a prognosis for such a wild-card condition.</p>
<p>I absorbed more literature from 2004-2009 on autism spectrum disorders than for my major in college. I met other kids, prayed, talked to other parents, prayed, attended programs, contacted organizations, enrolled in special preschools, prayed and remembered something really special that I had learned thanks to the Wright brothers: </p>
<p><em>Maybe things aren’t as impossible as they seem?</em></p>
<p>By 2009, William was doing more than talking. He was being mainstreamed into a regular classroom at school. His IQ was rising and he was demonstrating high-functioning abilities with particular talents in math and matrix reasoning. He was also a big brother&#8211;Reese was non-autistic and providing more social therapy than William could ever want. In the meantime I made a very special friend named Stacy Wareham, and I started flipping through those Wright brothers’ biographies again. That smitten feeling came back stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I still wanted to know why they never married, dang-it, what their problem was with women. The intense self-focus of their letters annoyed me more than ever. I bought and read more books. I wanted to better-understand their obsession with flight and Orville’s “painful shyness,” as one biographer put it. They became a puzzle that needed to be put together. The biographies provided pieces, like connect-the-dots, but no ultimate picture was forming.</p>
<p>Stacy Wareham. Another one of those wonder-moms. I met her at a banquet in 2010 and immediately we clicked. That was because she had identical twin sons, William and Sean, who had both been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, a milder form of autism. They were high-functioning, to the point of having incredible IQs, and we decided to set the boys up for a play date. I didn’t realize how jaded I had become by the fact my son was so much more severe behaviorally&#8211;I was expecting Stacy’s boys to have that autism glaze in the eyes, the monotone speech, the hold-you-at-a-distance anima, the quiet reclusiveness&#8230;but nope. </p>
<p>William and Sean seemed completely normal to me. At first.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I had a few conversations with Stacy’s boys that I realized something was&#8230;err&#8230; indeed off. William Wareham loved bragging about his “brains.” He said he had fun with us, but next time he’d rather play with someone else. Sean was going to vomit at Chick-fil-A because he didn’t like the texture of the nuggets in his mouth. They had oral sensitivities to all kinds of foods. They had to be prompted to say “hello” and “goodbye” because they disliked greetings. They loved following rules; things had to be presented in terms of rules. Sean was chronically shy and William was chronically outgoing. They held hands at the Science Center and knew every little factoid about every little thing imaginable. </p>
<p>And Stacy was full of stories&#8230;like the time they came out of the pool locker room completely naked and completely oblivious about it. How they were reading the ingredients off cans and boxes of food when they were three years old. And probably the best one&#8230;Stacy wanted to read them a bedtime story and they picked the dictionary. “Ooo, Mom! Let’s do the D’s!”</p>
<p>I became fascinated at Asperger’s Syndrome and had to read about it. My writer-friend Lisa-Marie Manning suggested some wonderful narrative non-fiction by an Aspie named John Elder Robison, <em>Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger’s</em>. I read it in two sittings and was thoroughly amused&#8230;but thoroughly saddened. So many of these people go through life undiagnosed, secretly harboring the pain of “not fitting in,” trying to appear as normal as possible, a fear of rejection by the opposite sex. Outrageously smart. They have a desire for love and fulfilling relationships but fall just short of them, to the point many of them give up. In the words of Robison, <em>“Sometimes I think I can relate better to a good machine than any kind of person.”</em></p>
<p>A mild form of autism, indeed.</p>
<p>It was around this time we took our boys to the transportation museum in Spencer, NC and I picked up yet another Wright biography called <em>Hidden Images</em>. Author Larry Tise had examined many of the Wright brothers’ photos through a proverbial microscope. And something about the images on page 64 stopped me in my tracks. I had seen it before&#8211;at Kill Devil Hills, in Fred Howard’s biography&#8211;the Wrights’ living quarters inside their hangar. Everything lined up, neatly, perfectly. A little wooden shelf built explicitly to hold the eggs. A separate little wooden shelf built explicitly for the potatoes. They were all turned in the same direction. And at that moment it hit me, these images superimposed in my mind&#8230;</p>
<p>William carefully lining up his alphabet blocks along the fireplace. If I even turned one slightly off, he noticed and corrected it. They <em>had</em> to be this way. </p>
<p>I slapped a hand to my face and blurted the Great Epiphany: The Wright brothers were Aspies. For crying out loud.</p>
<p>Suddenly everything about them made sense. Their affinity for machines. Their aversion to women after being rejected once in courtship. Their intense bonding as brothers. The high intelligence. The mistrust of others, their general aloofness from the world. The self-focus in their letters. Like William Staley, William Wareham and Sean, these guys couldn’t step outside of themselves. After all, the Latin root of the word “autism” is “au,” meaning self. A turning-inward. </p>
<p>By this time I was well-into the first draft of CONDITIONS, and I got to the point I started predicting the Wrights’ behavior before I read about it. Like a situation with Octave Chanute. The man had his scientific shortcomings, but boy was he thoughtful. He sent groceries to the brothers’ camp and was worried about their safety. He arranged for a doctor to be their campmate and crunched data from their wind tunnel experiments. He would be the first one mentioned in an Oscar speech. I could imagine Wilbur saying: “I’d like to thank Octave Chanute for his friendship and mentoring, for his encouragement when we wanted to give up in 1901&#8230;”</p>
<p>But no thanks were ever given, and I wondered if Chanute was ever hurt over this. I found my answer in two letters he sent to Wilbur, dated January 23 and May 14, 1910: <em>“How much I may have been of help I do not know. I have never made any claims in that respect, but I may confess that I have sometimes thought that you did not give me as much credit as I deserved.”</em> And this was the beginning of the end of their friendship. Chanute died shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><em>If ‘conditions were favorable’ for romance, why would Orville or Wilbur Wright turn it down?</em></p>
<p>Well. I know this has been a long answer to a short question. But as I wrote this novel, I often caught myself thinking that the Wrights had a “perfect” life. They grew up in a close-knit family, had a loving home. They were handsome and intellectually gifted. They were self-made entrepreneurs who were successful at just about anything they did. They were persistent optimists who became international legends, and their names will forever be inscribed in human history. So I have to remind myself&#8230;they were real people with real feelings. With real hurts, real desires and broken hearts. They may have been fathers of flight, but they never heard the word “Daddy.” And one thing is for sure: They loved children better than airfoil number twenty-seven. </p>
<p>I can’t even begin to compare my son’s demeanor to theirs. The autism spectrum is&#8230;such a spectrum. And this brings me back to the question that has a stranglehold on my own life: What does the future hold for William? Will the little boy who paces madly around our house, thinking about the carbon cycle, one day be fully toilet-trained? Will the amateur astronomer who pretends to live on Upsilon Andromedae d ever have legible handwriting? Or how about the extreme physics junkie, will he ever be able to step outside of himself long enough to enjoy hugs and kisses? I don’t know. But what I do know&#8230;there is a loving Creator-Sustainer-Redeemer who makes everything work out for good for those who love Him. And from my own challenges in life, not just autism, I can say that it’s amazing how things have a way of working out in the end.</p>
<p>So if there’s any one thought I’d like to leave you, the reader with, it’s this&#8230;just remember:</p>
<p>Things aren&#8217;t as impossible as they may seem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does it feel like things are finally starting to turn a corner when it comes to online data privacy? It seems like a lot more people are starting to care about privacy, at least as an issue, if not as a personal ethic. Sure, some <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-magid/facebook-users-becoming-m_b_1299643.html">people are starting to use Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings</a>, but because <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/facebook-changes-privacy-settings-again/">those things change all the damn time</a>, it&#8217;s hard to tell whether that will make much of a lasting difference.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-magid/facebook-users-becoming-m_b_1299643.html"><img alt="" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-02-24-pew.jpg" width="500" height="289" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Percent of social networking users who have taken these steps to protect their privacy (Source: Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project)</p></div>

Adults (Source: Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project)</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m also not convinced that people are seeing the writing on the wall when it comes to online privacy or the retention of their own civil liberties. People have never seemed to care that <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you">data is used to sell them stuff they &#8220;already want,&#8221; or that current and prospective health insurers are getting all sorts of data on what you Google</a>. Nor do they care that their reading list&#8211;something the Founders would have considered sacrosanct&#8211;has been accessible by government since the PATRIOT ACT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Want to buy a list of people who <a href="http://lists.epsilon.com/market?page=research/datacard&amp;id=313339">read romance novels</a>? <a href="http://www.epsilon.com/pdf/TotalSourcePlus_Overview_0211.pdf">Epsilon</a> can sell you that, as well as a list of people who donate to <a href="http://lists.epsilon.com/market?page=research/datacard&amp;id=259613">international aid charities</a>. &#8230;</p>
<p>A subsidiary of credit reporting company Equifax even <a href="http://redtape.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/30/16762661-exclusive-your-employer-may-share-your-salary-and-equifax-might-sell-that-data?lite">collects detailed salary and paystub information</a> for roughly <a href="http://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/Why/index.asp">38 percent</a> of employed Americans. &#8230;</p>
<p>Datalogix &#8230; which collects information from <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6cc4cf0a-0584-11e2-9ebd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2M3rUaJjK">store loyalty cards</a>, says it has information on more than $1 trillion in consumer spending &#8220;<a href="http://www.datalogix.com/industries/retail/">across 1400+ leading brands</a>.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t say which ones. &#8230;</p>
<p>Data companies can capture information about your &#8220;interests&#8221; in certain health conditions based on what you buy — or what you search for online. Datalogix has lists of people classified as <a href="http://www.datalogix.com/health-related-segments/">&#8220;allergy sufferers&#8221; and &#8220;dieters.&#8221;</a> Acxiom sells data on whether an individual has an &#8220;online search propensity&#8221; for a certain &#8220;ailment or prescription.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People don&#8217;t seem to care about whether their information is up for grabs because they don&#8217;t understand how easily comprehended and quantified they are. Everyone thinks he or she is immune from easy prediction, but with the rise of big data, prediction is getting scarily smart. For example, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/facebook-likes-reveal-sensitive-personal-information">analyzing Facebook &#8220;likes&#8221; is enough to predict a lot about your personality</a> that you probably wouldn&#8217;t tell a stranger, let alone some amoral marketing firm trying to figure out ways to extract money from you.</p>
<blockquote><p>The researchers used a pool of 58,000 volunteers in the United States. Based on “Likes” alone, they were able to predict whether a user was African-American or white 95% of the time, male or female 93% of the time.</p>
<p>They were able to gauge sexual orientation 88% of the time for men and 75% of the time for women. They were also able to predict political leaning (Republican versus Democrat) 85% of the time. On a more personal level, the researchers were able to predict whether your parents divorced when you were a kid 60% of the time.</p>
<p>The study also could make reasonably accurate guesses about whether you were a drug user, drinker, or smoker, as well as a host of other attributes, including emotional stability, satisfaction with life, and extraversion.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in many cases, it&#8217;s not even a question of prediction; it&#8217;s simply data analysis because people live enough of their lives on the web for there to be sufficient data to determine all of those characteristics.</p>
<p>On a small side note, this <em>attitude</em> has had serious implications. Except for Rand Paul and a few others who have been written off as right-wing loonies (and not without some justification), no one really seems to be talking about the near-omnipotence of government vis-a-viz individual civil liberties and freedom from <em>state</em> monitoring, as long as lip service is paid to the correct constitutional priority. Didn&#8217;t liberals care about civil liberties at some point? Wouldn&#8217;t they be crowing about the horrendous abuse of executive power if Bush was still in office, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/drones-explained">authorizing drone strikes</a> or signing off on memos that allow for unilateral targeting and assassination of <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/03/obama-admin-says-it-can-use-lethal-force-against-americans-us-soil">anyone it designates an enemy combatant</a>? People have been placated in this permanent surveillance state by having Obama institutionalize the violations that began under Bush. In that way, greater damage has been done to civil liberties in the failure to restore them than the initial infringement could ever do.</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s hunger for data also fuels its passive allowance of private companies to do its collection and data mining for it. Sure, government is constrained by the Fourth Amendment, but Facebook, Google, Apple, and the like aren&#8217;t. And <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Subpoenas-of-Google-show-law-s-failings-4222199.php">they do respond to subpoenas</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Other than certain kinds of protected data — including medical records and data used for credit reports — consumers have no legal right to control or even monitor how information about them is bought and sold. As the FTC notes, &#8220;There are <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/12/databrokers.shtm">no current laws</a> requiring data brokers to maintain the privacy of consumer data unless they use that data for credit, employment, insurance, housing, or other similar purposes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of online privacy, though, I think it&#8217;s that people are starting to get <em>possessive</em> about their data, and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s becoming increasingly easy to care about privacy as it is to not care about it. Of course, the additional effort means that most people will stay in-by-default than opted-out. But there are ways to start to default to an opt-out. For example, there are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/28/tech/web/online-privacy-policies">user-side solutions</a> like &#8220;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/mozilla-leads-the-way-on-do-not-track">Do Not Track</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The customer demand for stronger data controls led to the introduction of the &#8220;do not track&#8221; feature. &#8220;Do not track&#8221; is a setting that can be now found on all the major browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. When turned on, it asks sites not to track that person&#8217;s online activities. A Microsoft survey found that 75% of people were concerned about online tracking and thought the setting should be turned on by default.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, there are the more <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/howto-opt-out-databrokers-showing-your-targeted-advertisements-facebook">forcible opt-out solutions</a>, that can opt-out your data from being further used and abused. Sure, it&#8217;s more effort, but those who care enough can take the steps to opt-out. That scheme stands in stark contrast to the state of civil liberties, where an opt-out gives rise to automatic suspicion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.dose.ca/5713466.bin?size=dose462" width="627" height="462" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought of Jay-Z as this generation’s Frank Sinatra.  It&#8217;s an easy connection to make.  He’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200#Most_number-one_albums.5B8.5D" target="_blank">biggest recording artist in the world</a>.  He has his own Rat Pack (Roc-a-Fella).  He’s widely regarded as one of the coolest people on Earth.  He has his own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UjsXo9l6I8" target="_blank">New York City anthem</a>.  He makes no bones about being tied to organized crime.   Jay-Z, himself, even makes the comparisons quite often (DOA, Empire State of Mind, Pray, Threat, Hola Hovito).</p>
<p>But, while they have numerous similarities, Jay-Z is not this generation&#8217;s Frank Sinatra.  I once heard a music critic say, (and I’m paraphrasing here because I can’t remember exactly how he put it) what made Frank Sinatra so unique was his ability to speak for an entire generation and to concisely sum up what that generation was feeling and going through at the time.  That’s where Jay and Frank diverge.  Jay-Z doesn&#8217;t speak for the masses.  Early Jay may have spoken for a small part of the population growing up in the projects during the reign of Reaganomics (see: Reasonable Doubt – Vol 3), but a more recent Jay is absolutely unrelatable (see: any verse on Watch the Throne).  Now this doesn&#8217;t necessarily make his music any less enjoyable, but it does disqualify him from the “voice of a generation” conversation.</p>
<p>The voice of this generation – the Millennial Generation – is Drake.  And yes, I am serious.</p>
<p>I know that sounds silly.  I know he’s not the most skilled rapper.  I know he has a whiny, somewhat irritating, voice.  I know he wears goofy sweaters.  I know liking Drake hasn&#8217;t been cool in two years.  I know he’s a cornball.  I know he&#8217;s 26 and still stuck in a hookah phase (<em>sooo</em> High School).  And I know a lot of people will dismiss this as me just being a Drake fanboy, but despite all that being true, he’s still the voice of a generation.</p>
<p><i>Take Care</i> came out 16 months ago.  It’s still on Spotify’s top ten most listened to albums (only two non-2012 albums are in the top 15).  Considering that a super majority of Spotify users fall into the Millennial Generation, this is significant.</p>
<p><em>“Do you think we choose the times into which we are born? Or do we fit the times we are born into?”</em> That’s a line from <i>Lincoln </i>(the movie).  But it also uniquely fits the Drake motif.  The Millennial Generation (Drake included) grew up with AOL, ditched their walkmans for iPods and pioneered social networking.  Napster popularized the <del>illegal</del> free mp3 in 1999.  Apple released the first iPod in 2001.  Today, CDs are irrelevant and free music (legally or illegally) litters the internet.  Without these innovations (or as record companies might call them, “disruptions”) Drake could not exist.</p>
<p>In January 2006, Drake was not Drake.  Drake was Aubrey Graham.  And Aubrey Graham was Jimmy from Degrassi (a wheelchair bound high schooler in a sappy Canadian teen soap opera).  In February 2006, Aubrey Graham released <i>Room for Improvement,</i> a <i>free</i> mixtape distributed through the <i>internet.  </i>Drake was born.  He wasn&#8217;t the Drake we know now, he didn&#8217;t sing and he kind of came off as a Pharrell/Lupe wannabe.  The industry ignored it.  In 2007, he released <i>Comeback Season, </i>again a free mixtape distributed through the internet.  Still raw, he started showing glimpses of what he would become.  His popularity grew and thanks in large part to an internet fan base, he became the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have a music video featured on BET.  The underground hype was swelling and the industry started paying attention, including, the most popular rapper in the game circa 2008, Lil’ Wayne.  Then in 2009 Drake exploded.  Still unsigned, Drake released <i>So Far Gone, </i>another free mixtape distributed through the internet.  And right around then, Drake became the voice of a Generation.  A bidding war ensued, Wayne signed him to Young Money and now it’s an industry necessity that any rap album released needs an obligatory Drake feature if the artist owns any desires of commercial viability.</p>
<p>A half white, middle class, Jewish, former child star from the suburbs of Canada with not a shred of street-cred became the biggest name in rap.  Let that marinate for a second.  In no other generation could this have been possible.  Imagine, if you will, that it’s 1994 and Eddie from Family Matters is Jewish and Canadian <i>and</i> a rapper.  Is there any possible scenario you can conceive where Suge Knight signs him to Death Row or Puffy signs him to Bad Boy?  And before you bring up Will Smith, remember, he was an established rapper before <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>.  The only reason Drake’s accession is possible is because of the generation we live in.  Drake ignored the record labels and their “rules” and spoke directly to a generation (thanks to the internet this was possible) and his fellow Millennials responded, forcing an industry obsessed with gangster mentalities to throw out its conventions and glom to a cornball from Canada.</p>
<p><em>“That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re uncool. And while women will always be a problem for us, most of the great art in the world is about that very same problem. Good-looking people don&#8217;t have any spine<span style="color:#ff0000;">¹</span>.  Their art never lasts. They get the girls, but we&#8217;re smarter … Yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love&#8230; and let&#8217;s face it, you got a big head start.” </em> That’s a line from <i>Almost Famous</i> and it describes a massive part of Drake’s appeal.  I&#8217;ve been to a Drake concert, I&#8217;ve talked to Drake fans and believe me not even the most hardened Drake fans think Drake is cool.  He’s uncool.  He <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlr2xjSRxMA" target="_blank">falls on stage</a>.  His fashion sense is best described as <a href="http://www.nypost.com/rw/nypost/2012/04/24/pulse/web_photos/drake--300x300.jpg">tacky</a>.  And he probably cries during sex.  Don’t be fooled by the fact that he somehow tricked Rihanna into sleeping with him.  That was an anomaly.  Listen to any Drake album, they’re filled with these “love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love” themes.  Alishia, Bria, Nebby, Jade, Cece, Maliah, Rihanna, and a million unnamed strippers all broke Drake’s heart or he broke theirs or “he fucked her once and never fucked again” (but then got into a Champagne bottle throwing fight over her (?)).</p>
<p>We live in what’s been called “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1362253824-wBA5pmc49xBHSmGvUvB+7w" target="_blank">the hook up generation</a>.”  The NY Times describes it as the “rise of the ‘hookup culture’ among young people, characterized by spontaneous, commitment-free (and often, alcohol-fueled) romantic flings.”  No one speaks to this generation more than Drake.  He scatters bars like, “We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together,” “I can tell it wasn’t love, I just thought you’d fuck with me,” or “I won’t say no names, after a while they all seem the same.”  Lines that reveal his knowledge of the reality he lives, the realty any twenty-something lives in, the acceptance of sex without love, but none of these lines come off as loose boasts about sleeping with as many women as possible like other rappers, there’s more depth to them.  There is always a sub context in these verses.  That something is missing from these random hook ups, an emptiness, a longing, that while it may be fun, sex cannot replace love.</p>
<p>The twenty something generation lives in a Facebook world.  We&#8217;ve even been called a generation of &#8220;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/01/08/are-raising-generation-deluded-narcissists/" target="_blank">deluded narcissists</a>.&#8221;  We post pictures of our late night exploits on Instagram, broadcast all our achievements and boast on Twitter, shout out friends and take veiled shots at exes on Facebook and complain about the hardships of growing up on our blogs.  Our online avatars quite literally mirror a Drake album.  While there is no stat for it, I am willing to bet Drake is the most quoted artist on Facebook or Twitter.  Hell, #YOLO became a national epidemic.  The first bars of “Up All Night” are effectively Instagram imagery.  He’s constantly representing his “team” on tracks like “Crew Love” and “Show Me a Good Time.”  His verse on “No Lie” is a not-so veiled shot at Rihanna.  And nearly half of all his material is laced with complaints on his emerging fame and responsibilities (see: The Ride).  Last month Drake released the first single off his new album and I fully expect 21 year old college seniors everywhere to proudly exclaim, without a hint of irony, that, “they started from the bottom now they’re here” when they graduate in May, get a $15/hr job as a receptionist and move into their cramped Washington Heights apartment.  Drake has become the mouth piece of a world that strives to communicate in 140 characters or less.</p>
<p>One of the biggest stories from the 2012 Presidential Election was the changing demographics of America.  The pundits have dubbed it, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/06/barack-obama-reelection_n_2085819.html" target="_blank">rise of a New America</a>.”  America has become more diverse.  Browner.  Younger.  More tolerant.  Fragmented.  As a half white, half black, Jewish, quasi-feminine rapper who grew up in Canada, spent his summers in Memphis and enjoys hanging out with Lil’ Wayne and Justin Bieber in his free time, I doubt Drake will ever experience a Lena Dunham<span style="color:#ff0000;">²</span> “&#8230; but it doesn&#8217;t represent me” type backlash.    While not a U.S. citizen, his mish-mash of backgrounds perfectly represents the “New America.”  Drake is oddly like no one else and everyone else at the same time.</p>
<p>Now, in a few years I may look back at this and shake my head. Drake may be dismissed as a fad like the pet rock or Jnco jeans, because in hip-hop you need at least one &#8220;classic&#8221; album on your résumé to be deemed great.  And Drake doesn&#8217;t have one<span style="color:#ff0000;">³</span>.  Without a classic album, rappers are cast aside with the likes of Nelly or Ja Rule as just a weird phase rap went through way back when<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>4</sup></span>.  Most rappers’ &#8220;classic&#8221; albums are their first, think <i>Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, Doggystyle</i>.  Some come later, most notably the <i>Marshall Mather LP</i>, but they all have at least one.  I could argue that <i>So Far Gone</i> <em><strong>would have</strong></em> been a classic album, if it <em><strong>would have</strong></em> been an album instead of a mixtape, but, then again, the Queen of England<strong><em> would have</em></strong> been the King if she <b><i>would have</i></b> been born with balls.  The point is, &#8220;would&#8217;ves&#8221; don&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>The Greatest Generation lived through the Great Depression, won WWII and built America into a super power.  They got Frank.  The Baby Boomers protested Vietnam, fought for civil rights and changed the world.  They got Dylan.  Generation X wore a ton of flannel   They got Kurt.  And us &#8211; we got Drake.  Deal with it.</p>
