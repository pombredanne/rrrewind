				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent my weekend working at the International Motorcycle Show. The convention center was filled to capacity with leather garments, reprehensible hair cuts, flinch-inducing tattoos, and TESTOSTERONE. With the male to female ratio an astounding 10:1, this may be the #1 place to meet a man in NYC. If you&#8217;re into muscled biker types, buy your ticket for next year&#8217;s show NOW. My job, as it <a href="http://newyorkcliche.com/2011/06/02/she-works-hard-or-not-for-the-money/">so often is</a>, was to stand, smile, and look pretty (and interest people in a brand/sell a product- it is actually work). I spent the entire weekend fighting off men. Not surprisingly, they are a more aggressive bunch than the <a href="http://newyorkcliche.com/2010/10/15/the-strange-world-of-comiccon/">ComicCon</a> <del>nerds</del> lot.</p>
<div id="attachment_3540" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://newyorkcliche.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p1030139.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-3540" alt="motorcycleshow" src="http://newyorkcliche.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p1030139-e1358879358937.jpg?w=500&#038;h=315" width="500" height="315" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The 2013 International Motorcycle Show</p></div>
<p><em>Oh woe is me!</em> It&#8217;s <em>so hard</em> being a pretty girl! The constant flattery, frequent free drinks, rarely having to open a door for myself, it&#8217;s <em>exhausting! </em></p>
<p>I can feel the collective eye roll from my dude-readers. It&#8217;s such a pretty girl cliché to complain about the men who hit on us. Yes, most of them are harmless and -I&#8217;ll be the first to admit it- ego boosts. That said, the slimy feeling when a man&#8217;s eyes scan your body, slowly from toe to tip, is a real one. The look in his eyes says he&#8217;s a ravenous beast and you&#8217;re a fresh cut of meat. He&#8217;s an Italian grandmother at the butcher and you&#8217;re the perfect roast behind the counter. He can imagine sticking you with his meat thermometer as you cook in the oven. If any one shows interest in you before the butcher calls his number, he will smack that bitch with his handbag. Imagine feeling like a bloody, raw, 125 pound chunk of meat sliced from the flank of genetically modified livestock. It sucks. Am I right, ladies?</p>
<p>That said, the men who look at me like I&#8217;m sirloin are few and far between. Even at a biker bonanza with the accompanying &#8220;bad boy&#8221; and &#8220;rebel without a cause&#8221; clichés. I&#8217;m a grown women, someone who&#8217;s been &#8220;pretty&#8221; for the majority of her adult life (post-college at least). I&#8217;ve refuted the advances of plenty of men in my time. Bikers may be more intimidating than the average man on my subway commute, but they don&#8217;t punch you in the nose if you decline to give them your number. Still, as all women -from homely to drop dead gorgeous- know, nothing gets a man to accept rejection better than ye old &#8220;I have a boyfriend&#8221; line. Thus, I spent the entire weekend pretending to have a boyfriend.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">His name is Joe. He rides a Yamaha. He is also in a band called <em>The SpitTakes</em> where he plays a Yamaha. Did you know Yamaha is a brand of motorcycle AND a brand of pianos? I never knew that prior to attending the motorcycle show but I think it&#8217;s AWESOME. Joe is 31 and works in construction. He&#8217;s on the team building the Freedom Tower, how cool is that? He&#8217;s Irish, 6&#8217;2&#8243; tall, full head of jet black hair, and sparkling blue eyes. He has the ever-so-slight beginnings of a beer belly. A tattoo of a mermaid/lady pirate is inked upon his forearm. My father hates him. He would<em> kick your ass</em> if he knew you were flirting with me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_3541" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2005models/2005-Yamaha-R6a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3541  " alt="motorcycleyama" src="http://newyorkcliche.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/motorcycleyama.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" width="300" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is his motorcycle. Sexy right?<br />[image: totalmotorcyle.com]</p></div><div id="attachment_3542" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.musiciansbuy.com/prod.asp?ic=TYROS2KIT"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3542  " alt="But not as sexy as his other Yamaha!" src="http://newyorkcliche.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/keyboardyamaha.jpg?w=300&#038;h=157" width="300" height="157" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But not as sexy as his other Yamaha!<br />[image: musiciansbuy.com]</p></div>So that&#8217;s &#8220;Joe&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t had a <em>real</em> boyfriend in almost four years. It&#8217;s at the point where the TV series/movie/book based on my life would start referring to their heroine as &#8220;chronically single&#8221;. To the point where blogs about my life, autobiographical no less, start identifying me as such. This was a recent realization. One likely made in the shower, on a solitary stroll, or whilst lying awake in bed. (Ok, I don&#8217;t remember where I realized it, so I fall back on cliché). The point is, I realized that however much I think I want a boyfriend <em>in my mind</em>, the <em>actual</em> prospect terrifies me. An actual flesh and body, independent minded man whom I have <strong>no</strong> control over. One I choose and connect myself to so that he is directly associated with me by a label: <i>BOYFRIEND.</i> A man who won&#8217;t see me as a piece of meat or just a pretty face. He&#8217;ll see <em>all my flaws</em>. This man will <em>undeniably</em> threaten my current way of life&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, you guessed it: this realization was in part spurred by a man in my life who seems interested in the label. My hands are sweating just thinking about it (which isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> saying much, I have chronically sweaty hands, but they sometimes comes in handy  -pun intended- to emphasize a point). <del>But maybe he&#8217;s not! He hasn&#8217;t <em>exactly</em> said as much&#8230;I&#8217;m probably making it up!</del> Ok, admitting you have a problem a problem is the first step. Acceptance is a vital step toward change.</p>
<p>Here goes:<br />
Hi. My name is New York Cliché. I am chronically single. I make up boyfriends to make my life easier. And..and&#8230;<em>commitment scares me.</em></p>

<p>To pee, or not to pee? That is the question. Everyone who has ever gone to a movie knows this predicament- whether &#8217;tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of painfully watching a movie when you have to relieve yourself, or to take arms against a sea of porcelain and miss a few minutes of a movie you&#8217;ve paid to see. To help you determine the best possible time to pee during a movie, I&#8217;ve created this flowchart.<span id="more-10778"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Kevin B. Lee decided to publish a total #slatepitch of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/01/down_with_argo_ben_affleck_s_iran_hostage_movie_is_the_worst.html" target="_blank">an article</a> on the terribleness of <em>Argo</em>. It doesn&#8217;t really need to be argued with, but I already wrote most of this, so here we go.</p>
<p>Kevin Lee has completely missed the point. <em>Argo</em> is not a film about the Iranian Revolution, nor is it a film about Operation Eagle Claw, nor is it an attempt to explore the rule of the Shah or the CIA&#8217;s complicity in it. It&#8217;s essentially a heist movie, with a historical backdrop, &#8220;inspired&#8221; by a real event. And it&#8217;s truly only about one event: those US embassy personnel who fled to the Canadian ambassador&#8217;s residence and the clever deception operation through which they were later exfiltrated.</p>
<p>All these other movies that Kevin Lee talks about? None of them are the film that Affleck sought to make. None of them are the film that he made. If someone else wants to make those, fine (and they probably should be made). But I absolutely hate it when filmmakers get criticized for not telling &#8220;the whole story&#8221; when the entire *point* of finding a small story in a much larger one is to make for a more compelling narrative.</p>
<p>You can make a World War II movie without addressing the Holocaust. <em> Gladiator</em> never directly confronted Roman slavery. <em>Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War</em> ends on a downer but without elaborating on subsequent events in Afghanistan (some of which remain pretty important) <em>Black Hawk Down</em> is a fine film without exploring the complete collapse of Somali central government. <em> Air Force One</em> certainly didn&#8217;t need to delve into the machinations of Serbian genocide and pan-Slav sentiment to be entertaining.</p>
<p>Sometimes history is fun, and makes for an enjoyable movie, regardless of surrounding events. Sometimes history is terrible, and we get <em>Schindler&#8217;s List</em> &#8211; a very good film unto itself. But not every film set in 2012 needs the Syrian Civil War as a backdrop, and <em>Argo</em> certainly doesn&#8217;t distance itself from the Revolution.</p>
<p>As one of my compatriots put it so succinctly, the tl;dr of Lee&#8217;s argument is &#8220;I wanted someone to adapt one of Chomsky&#8217;s books into a film! Now I&#8217;m going to have a temper tantrum because it wasn&#8217;t Ben Affleck!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, side note: <em>Argo</em> is a ton of fun, and you should see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back at school for the Spring semester with the typical four-course teaching load, including a modern world history course that I have not taught for some time. So it is time to refresh my arsenal of Powerpoint presentations and <em>maps</em>. An interesting map can quickly catch a college student&#8217;s attention as easily as it does a blog reader, and after perusing my various digital collections a bit, I realized that I might be able to teach world history almost exclusively through <em>octopus</em> maps! Or at least nineteenth- and twentieth-century history: the creature does not seem to have been used as a metaphorical device before 1870. I searched in vain for a map or caricature depicting Napoleon as an octopus but could not find one, which is incredulous:  few rulers deserve an octopus map to represent their regimes more than the little Corsican!  There&#8217;s nothing too terribly original about this post: octopus maps have captured the attention of several <a href="http://octoprop.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/of-maps-and-octopuses/">bloggers </a>before me (also see <a href="http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/521-cartographys-favourite-map-monster-the-land-octopus">here)</a>, but I can&#8217;t resist putting my own take out there.</p>
<p>1870 marks a turning point in European and world history with the unification of Germany (as well as Italy):  Europe was now &#8220;filled out&#8221; and further territorial ambitions could only be satisfied by global imperialism and/or war.  The maps from this time forward reflect this jingoism and fear, but anthropomorphic satire dulls the edge. One of the first major octopus maps, Fred Rose&#8217;s &#8220;Serio-Comic War Map For The Year 1877&#8243; shows Russia as the octopus-aggressor rather than Germany, even though the Crimean War had revealed the severe weaknesses of the Russian Empire (this is reflected on the map below by wound on one of the octopus&#8217; tentacles&#8211;that which is located in the proximity of the Crimea). From the British perspective that this map represents, it&#8217;s a bit early to portray Germany as the aggressor, and so Russia becomes either the ferocious bear or the reaching octopus.</p>

<p><strong><em>F.W. Rose, &#8220;A Serio-Comic Map of the Year 1877&#8243;, London:  G.W. Bacon &amp; Co., British Library; (an earlier Dutch <a href="http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?sid=97d7df7a97584e3999a459707418ccf5;q1=Karikaturen;rgn1=carto_tr;size=20;c=carto;lasttype=boolean;view=entry;lastview=thumbnail;subview=detail;cc=carto;entryid=x-otm-col--sp-hb-kzl-sp-109.05.13;viewid=395112265;start=1;resnum=6">map </a>at the University of Amsterdam upon which this map is based is identical except for the wounded tentacle).</em></strong></p>
<p>A later Rose map, even more obviously depicting the British perspective, is &#8220;John Bull and his Friends&#8221; from 1900 in which John Bull (Great Britain) faces a continent full of hostile, disinterested, or preoccupied &#8220;friends&#8221; and an even more threatening octopus-Russia, reaching out in all directions. On the eve of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), a Japanese take on the Serio-Comic map shifts the focus decidedly <em>eastward</em> and portrays Russia as the &#8220;black octopus&#8221;. And for a completely contrary view, a Japanese print self-identifies with the octopus after the war commenced with the Battle of Port Arthur.</p>

<p>In addition to aggression and domination, whether threatened or realized, the octopus is just the <em>perfect </em> symbol, visual metaphor, <em>avatar</em> of imperialism, and the period between 1870 and 1914 was the golden age of the &#8220;new&#8221; imperialism, in which Europeans divided up the world, eager to get their piece before Britain gobbled it all up. Consequently there are probably more images portraying John Bull as the octopus rather than John Bull confronting the octopus, like this famous American cartoon, which was published in <em>Punch </em>in 1882.</p>
<p><a href="http://streetsofsalem.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/devilfish-map.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15411" alt="Devilfish map" src="http://streetsofsalem.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/devilfish-map.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>

<p>The octopus was not just used <em>externally</em> to criticize an opposing or competitive nation&#8217;s policies but also <em>internally</em> on a partisan basis, particularly in America and Britain. This particular sea creature can symbolize greed just as well as territorial expansion, and this was a gilded age as well as an age of imperialism. Consequently we see octopuses portraying greedy capitalistic monopolists  and associated special interests, on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, <em>Puck </em>magazine illustrator Udo Keppler used the octopus to characterize Standard Oil in 1904 and President Wilson&#8217;s fight for &#8220;business freedom&#8221; a decade later, while in Britain its use was more literally land-based:  as a Socialist critique of urban &#8220;landlordism&#8221; around London just prior to World War I, and to depict urban sprawl from a traditional planning perspective.</p>

<p>As the octopus was a well-recognized symbol of aggression by the time that World War I broke out, it was only natural that it would appear on several anti-Germany maps.  The English and French maps below, from 1915 and 1917 respectively, both single out <em>Prussian</em> aggression, an indication that the militaristic reputation of the new Germany&#8217;s northernmost region was still relevant, and the second one (&#8220;<em>war is the national industry of Prussia&#8221;) </em>is explicitly racist, with its German &#8220;hun&#8221; looming very large indeed.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an easy transition to the propaganda maps of World War II,when both sides used octopuses to put forward their points of view. Hitler is obviously an easy octopus, as the title and cover of a prescient book published by a correspondent for the <em>Atlantic Monthly </em> in 1938&#8211;just before the Germans moved into Czechoslovakia&#8211;boldly asserted.  Henry C. Wolfe was trying to wake up the west and he used the octopus to do it.</p>
<p><a href="http://streetsofsalem.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/octopus-german-wolfe.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15432" alt="Octopus German Wolfe" src="http://streetsofsalem.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/octopus-german-wolfe.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Once the war began, the very clever German propaganda machine issued an anti-British poster from the perspective of France, which they had occupied:  Winston Churchill as octopus reaches out toward French colonial possessions in Africa and the Middle East, echoing the imperial competition of the later nineteenth century. The bleeding tentacles&#8211;the <em>amputations&#8211;</em> indicate that Germany is <em>preventing</em> an English takeover of the French empire, even as it occupies France itself!</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;Have Faith&#8221;: German anti-British propaganda poster, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.</strong></em></p>
<p>As you can imagine, when the real war is over and the <em>Cold War</em> commences, the octopus continues to flourish as a symbol of rampant (anti-American) capitalism and rampant (anti-Soviet) communism, as well as rampant consumerism, evangelical Christianity and Islam, and a host of other perceived threats. However, cephapodal cartography is not subtle, and I think it lost much of its resonance in the later twentieth-century world, after the very literal 1950s.</p>

<p>Now octopuses are rather whimsical, rather than threatening. I superimposed one on a cropped frame of a beautiful 1771 map of Salem and its vicinity and found it charming rather than ominous:  what would they have been afraid of then?  Definitely redcoats and tax collectors.  What are we afraid of now?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kristenbrakeman.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_0529_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-458" alt="DSC_0529_2" src="http://kristenbrakeman.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_0529_2.jpg?w=240&#038;h=300" width="240" height="300" /></a>This morning I had ten minutes  to spare so I tried on my old black crepe suit to see if it would be okay to wear backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards this Sunday. When you work on the crew or production side of these award shows, you’re supposed to dress to blend in. The production rents tuxedos for all the men who might be caught on camera, but all of the female workers are expected to wear an awards show type dress. You know how we all have those lying around.</p>
<p>Well actually, from my years of working behind the scenes on these things, I do happen to have a small collection of semi-formal wear lying around.  But the problem is that most of these items are getting a little old and tired, much like their owner.</p>
<p>I had spent much of the weekend racking my brain, wondering what I would wear to this year&#8217;s show, then I remembered this black crepe suit that I bought about 15 or 20 years ago. I wore it when I worked on the Oscars the year before my first daughter was born.</p>
<p>I remembered thinking at the time that I looked fabulous in that suit. Very chic, indeed.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s possible that the other people backstage might have been saying, “Oh, dear, the poor child,” but I was sure I looked great.</p>
<p>So I was excited that I remembered that I owned it.  This suit was surely the solution to my problem. I had paid a pretty penny for it and it hung beautifully &#8211; maybe enough time had passed that it had come back in style?</p>
<p>Oh, if only that were the case.  As I started to try on the suit I became immediately aware that the suit in my mind&#8217;s eye looked nothing like the one I now saw before me .</p>
<p>First I pulled on the pants  &#8211; the  waistline came within 5 inches of my armpits. Uh oh.</p>
<p>“Look at mommy&#8217;s pants!” my nine-year-old shrieked. “Ha, ha, ha,” she laughed, over and over again.</p>
<p>“Very funny. Don&#8217;t worry.  I know they&#8217;re a little high-waisted, but no one will see the pants because the jacket hangs over them,” I said, trying to convince myself more than her.</p>
<p>I had my doubts.  The pant legs were quite wide. Really, you could fit two of me in those pant legs. But, maybe wide legs are back in? Didn’t I read that somewhere recently?</p>
<p>Then I put on the blazer, buttoned it and looked in the mirror. Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p>I looked nothing like the glamorous girl of my memory.  Nope.  I looked ridiculous.</p>
<p>The blazer and its giant shoulder pads hung on me like it was three sizes too big.  God knows, I certainly haven’t lost weight in the last 17 years.</p>
<p>I walked into the den to show my husband. “What happened?  Do you think this suit always looked this bad? Why is the coat hanging on me like it was meant for a linebacker?”</p>
<p>I was genuinely baffled.</p>
<p>“It’s because you used to have a chest,” my husband explained, matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Oh, God.  Really? Was that it?</p>
<p>Here I thought I was lucky to have kept my weight down to what it was before having three kids. But, I see now that my weight has moved within my body and no longer resides where it once did  -  unfortunately it has moved south from places that could have helped this out-of-date suit.</p>
<p>It was a horrifying realization.</p>
<p>“Should I bother keeping it ? Do you think it&#8217;s ever coming back?” I asked, standing there looking like a clown, a clown that apparently prefers black crepe suits.</p>
<p>“Oh, honey, that suit is never coming back,” he declared. “You’re never gonna make that work.” Suddenly he’s Tim Gunn, apparently.</p>
<p>So, it’s back to the closet.</p>
<p>I wonder if that green quiana wrap-dress still fits?  Didn&#8217;t I read that those are coming back in?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://annaspanos.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_000016.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-23" alt="IMG_000016" src="http://annaspanos.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_000016.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When I first found out I was pregnant, I swore that motherhood would not change me.  I swore to myself that I would still wear combat boots and punk rock t-shirts, still listen to techno and still slouch around at happy hour every now and then.  I swore that I would still be hardnosed and unemotional, and that above all, most importantly, I would never, not in a million years, become one of those writers who has a child and henceforth becomes so consumed by motherhood and the identity of being mother that she ends up spending the rest of her writing life producing schlock feel good stories about parenting.  I mean, seriously, what could be more depressing than that?  If having a child meant that suddenly your whole identity, all the way down to your creative practice, would become about nothing more than that child, then I didn’t want any part in it.</p>
<p>So now, a year into this whole motherhood thing, I would like to report that I do still wear my combat boots and my punk rock t-shirts.  I am still hardnosed, but even now that the hormones have worn off I am definitely more emotional.  I haven’t been to a happy hour in about 20 months, and I can only listen to techno when the baby is not with me and I am not at work (which is to say, never).  And I’m writing a blog about being a mother.  And what’s worse, I’m writing a blog about being a mother INSTEAD OF working on real literary endeavors, like my great and epic novel in progress.</p>
<p>On a superficial level, I am mortified by what I have become: a failed artist turned paper pusher who will never publish a real book and who now seeks satisfaction from the basest of all forms of written expression – a blog (note the sneer with which I write that word).  Just about the only thing that could be worse would be to upload entries directly from my diary.  Right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not.  My desire to start this blog and the experience of putting up my first few posts have really gotten me thinking about the place of writing in my life and what drives me to write.  Before I had my daughter, I used to complain constantly – constantly – about how difficult it was to find enough time to write, let alone time to try getting published.  I considered giving up writing altogether because I simply couldn’t see the point of wasting so much time and energy and emotion when it was next to impossible to see a project through to completion, and anything I did complete simply got moved to my “final draft” folder.  There were a lucky few from my MFA program that found homes for their books, but the rest of us just trudged along, trying to do something new, trying to find meaning in our work, trying to justify all of the sacrifices, all of which just begged the question:  What is the point of it all?</p>
<p>When I think back to my first serious attempts at writing, I wasn’t sitting down and writing a poem because I thought that I would get published; I was doing it because of that abstract, inexplicable urge to create, and the urge to find self-expression in this act of creation.  Writing was the outlet that I would return to again and again to explain my life to myself, to take the maelstrom of ideas and emotions and create something ordered and tangible.  Fast forward ten years to the unique competition of writing MFA programs (particularly those housed in art colleges):  We all want to get published to prove that we are better than everyone else, but getting published is not enough; we must also prove our worth as artists by making work that is truly groundbreaking (or at least that is going to impress my classmates and maybe even catch the interest of the hipper visual artists working in the next classroom over).  Satisfaction from the creative process?  Peace of mind attained through productive self-expression?  Oh no no no, that was not the point of it at all.  Instead it was about ego, aesthetics, and identity.</p>
<p>So what happens when I find I enjoy reading a good story that actually makes sense, that my ego no longer needs a boost, and that my identity is no longer handcuffed to the art scene?  Shouldn’t then my need to write go the way of my wide-legged raver pants?</p>
<p>The experience of becoming a mother while continuing to harbor career ambitions and creative inclinations has taught me a lot about prioritizing.  Out of 168 hours in a week, I spend 60 hours a week working and commuting to and from work, 40 hours sleeping, 10 hours cleaning, 10 hours packing and unpacking baby supplies, cooking baby food, and putting away baby toys, 7 hours showering, dressing and undressing, 7 hours eating, 7 hours feeding the baby, 7 hours rocking the baby, 3 hours changing diapers and bathing the baby, 3 hours doing laundry, and 3 hours checking email and paying bills on my phone.  In a good week, this leaves about 10 hours for everything else, and leaves me to carefully weigh every last activity to determine whether it’s worth keeping in my life.  That ex-best friend that hates babies?  Out.  Long weekend run to clear my head (and inch closer to my pre-baby body)?  In.  <i>Law and Order</i> reruns?  Definitely out.  Writing for no reason other than to synthesize my thoughts?  I thought this one was borderline, but it turns out that I was wrong.</p>
<p>It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’m actually kind of relieved to have rid myself of the art school cool quotient.  I have a stable career, a tiny little house in a quiet little neighborhood, a beautiful and amazing little girl, and enough graying hair to not care quite so much about how others might be judging me.  I also understand that with only a few hours a week to commit, it is almost certainly impossible that I will write a book length work (or even a polished short story) anytime soon.  And it actually feels really, really good to just write a sentence without worrying about whether or not it will win me respect and a book contract.</p>
<p>So here I am.  Mother, wife, middle manager, and blogger extraordinaire.</p>
<p>How long will I survive this sense of contentment before once again my ambition takes over?  That’s anyone’s guess.  But in the meantime I’ll do my best to enjoy it.  After the baby goes to sleep I’ll take out my laptop, plug in my headphones, rock some old school Detroit techno, and make the most of this newfound appreciation of this old forgotten simple pleasure.</p>

<p>I have always admired the work Philadelphia Student Union has done. I remember they were one of the groups I discovered in the early days of my blog, and I wanted nothing more but to drop out of college and join these students in the struggle. I talk about them often, and if you haven&#8217;t already, <strong>go to <a href="http://home.phillystudentunion.org/">their website</a> RIGHT NOW (I caps locked that, that&#8217;s when you <em>know</em> it&#8217;s serious). </strong>See what amazing things they&#8217;ve been able to accomplish. Anyway, just to add onto their great list, they held <a href="http://www.mediamobilizingproject.org/updates/school-closings-zombie-apocalypse-making">a student apocalypse</a> in response to the 37 schools in their community set to close.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Remorsefully, that is becoming almost abnormal for any student to feel that way. Never in 12 years of our academic careers (all of which has taken place within Sumter School District) has there been so much hopelessness for the future of our school district.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Every day, we see teachers &#8211; men and women that have worked hard for college degrees in their fields in order to earn an honest living and obtain a better quality of life &#8211; who are afraid to teach in comfort for the fear of being reprimanded by an administrator or a district official with a pen and checklist.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Every day, we see teachers who have sadness in their eyes because they know that the teaching techniques they are forced to use are not truly what is best for the students.</em></p>
<p>I have written about <a title="Today: Stand In Solidarity with Students and Teachers in Sumter, SC" href="http://teacherunderconstruction.com/2012/12/10/today-stand-in-solidarity-with-students-and-teachers-in-sumter-sc/">Blake Ward before</a>, and the brave steps he has taken to bring to light what is going on in his small town of Sumter. Blake is a high school senior who is a founder and current co-chair of the Sumter School District Student Coalition. Blake and his other co-chair, Lance Foxworth, wrote an <a href="http://www.theitem.com/opinion/columnists/sumter-school-district-on-the-wrong-path/article_2587bc84-4f4e-5641-97e5-075f5dcdd77e.html">Op-Ed</a> to their local paper, &#8220;The Item.&#8221; I can&#8217;t encourage you enough to read what these two students have to say, and the fear they have for the path their district is taking. As things move forward, we are hoping <a href="http://studentsunitedforpubliced.org/">Students United for Public Education (SUPE)</a> can initiate a National Campaign to put the pressure on his school board officials to be held accountable for their actions&#8211;if you are interested in helping build this campaign, please reach out to: SUPEcontact@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Can I get a woot woot for New Jersey? (I swear, the more comfortable I am getting with you all, the dorkier I get). Anyway, seriously, how awesome is this?! Some may know already about my interest in running for the school board seat in New Brunswick in this upcoming April\November election, so already seeing another young-adult folk catching some attention on an NJ school board is really exhilarating. Exciting things for NJ and Education indeed.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>&#8220;Noble plans to focus on several areas as a school board member, including the promotion of LGBT issues in sex education classes, banning military recruiters from schools, opposing merit pay for teachers and fighting budget cuts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Noble is not the first teenager with ties to far left groups to win a school board seat in the U.S. In 2005, Shane Brinton, an 18-year-old who had been involved with local Communist Party anti-war activities, was elected to the North Humboldt Union High School Board of Education in northern California. &#8221;</em></p>

<p>Well there you have it. Just a few of the many phenomenal things happening in regards to students taking risks and standing up for  education in their community.

<p>Every MLK weekend for the last two years, Jared and I have joined a group of 30 friends on an epic ski trip weekend. Because we both like to cook, both years we&#8217;ve made Saturday night dinner for the entire group.</p>
<p>Cooking from scratch for 30 friends is a huge undertaking when you&#8217;re not a professional chef with professional equipment, but it&#8217;s totally doable. In the <a href="http://hoppycow.com/2012/12/26/what-its-like-to-work-future-style/">spirit of documentation</a>, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Plan a Smart Menu</h2>
<p><strong> Know Your Scope</strong>: Ask ahead of time about the number of people, budget, dietary restrictions, and kitchen equipment. You don&#8217;t want to make a pork dish if many people are kosher, and at the same time, you don&#8217;t want to plan a grill-out if there isn&#8217;t a grill.</p>
<p><strong>Time saving recipes are key</strong>: Seek out recipes you can make ahead of time. Both years we&#8217;ve used slow cookers to make the main protein portion of the dish. This means that the meat can be prepared in the morning, and is completely hands off until serving time. It also keeps the food warm until you&#8217;re ready to serve.</p>
<p><strong>Keep folks at bay with appetizers</strong>: Despite all the planning, there will always be some last minute madness. Always have appetizers ready to go so that your starving friends can enjoy some munchies before dinner is served.</p>
<p><strong>Go Buffet Style</strong>: Do not plan a meal that requires plating, like individual steaks. You don&#8217;t want to spend your night serving, and by the time you&#8217;re done plating the food will be cold. Buffet style is more efficient, and everyone gets to eat exactly what they want. .</p>
<p><strong>Seek scalable recipes</strong>: You will most likely be doubling or tripling recipes. Make sure to pick items that can scale up. Avoid anything that needs to be individually made, like dumplings, samosas or biscuits. The time it takes to assemble these items will dramatically increase your prep time. A few trays of mac &#8216;n cheese, or two slow cookers of pulled pork can be scaled.</p>
<p><strong>Use America&#8217;s Test Kitchen recipes</strong>: Sure, you might say <a href="http://hoppycow.com/2012/09/21/recap-2-years-at-americas-test-kitchen-2/">I&#8217;m biased</a> but <a href="http://www.americastestkitchenfeed.com/foodles/2012/05/our-12-step-path-to-recipe-perfection-infographic/">these recipes WORK</a>, and if 30 people are waiting on me for dinner I can&#8217;t leave anything up to chance. Both years we&#8217;ve used ATK&#8217;s tried and true recipes and it&#8217;s worked out great – they&#8217;re foolproof, and the cook times are exactly what they say they are. This year, we tried one <a href="http://www.thenourishinggourmet.com/2008/12/mexican-roasted-potatoes-2.html">recipe off the internet</a> and the oven time was way off, which meant we had to serve it after the meal had started.</p>
<p><strong>Prepackaged desserts are ok</strong>: By the time you&#8217;re done making the meal, you&#8217;ll be way too exhausted to want to make dessert for 30 from scratch. Either assign out dessert to a friend, or go with a boxed dessert – this year we went with Betty Crocker brownies and ice cream. No one minds brownies, cookies or cake from a box!</p>
<h2>Step 2: Plan out equipment and cook times</h2>
<p><strong>Read your recipe</strong>: Read it carefully and read it three times over. Don&#8217;t leave anything to the last minute.</p>
<p><strong>Plan out Cook Times</strong>: If something requires one hour in the oven, or 10 hours in a slow cooker, set deadlines (i.e. meat must be in the slow cooker by 9 a.m.). Also, whatever you can get done ahead of time, do. This year we picked an appetizer dip that could be made one day ahead of time, so that all we needed to do was pop it in the oven before dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure You Have Equipment</strong>: For these ski trips, we&#8217;re cooking in houses entirely foreign to us, so we have to bring all the equipment we need for dinner. Be sure to think about items you need <strong>to prep</strong> (peelers, measuring cups, strainers, prep bowls, knives, cutting boards, don&#8217;t forget paper towels!), <strong>to cook</strong> (roasting pan, dutch oven, slow cooker), <strong>to serve</strong> (disposable trays, serving spoons, large bowls, paper plates), and <strong>to store</strong> (foil, plastic wrap, tupperware). However, be prepared to send someone out on a last minute grocery run. You will always forget something (this year it was paper plates).</p>
<p><strong>Rationing Equipment Space</strong>: If you have multiple dishes that require the stovetop, but only have 4 burners, use your space wisely. Also, if you have multiple dishes that require the oven, carefully plan out oven space, oven cook time, and what temperatures you should pre-heat to. Appetizers like guacamole are great because they require no cooking space.</p>
<p><strong>Get Machines To Help</strong>: Food processors are amazing time savers. If you don&#8217;t have one, borrow one from a friend. By using a machine, you&#8217;ll cut down prep time from 2 hours to 20 minutes. No one wants to spend an hour chopping onions. Also, if you&#8217;re baking, you might want to consider a stand mixer.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Grocery Shopping</h2>
<div id="attachment_1039" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 382px"><a href="http://hoppycow.com/2013/01/21/how-to-make-dinner-for-a-lot-of-people-when-youre-not-a-professional-chef/photo-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-1039"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1039" alt="The grocery cart this year was so epic, we both had to stop to take pictures. " src="http://hoppycow.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo-6.jpg?w=372&#038;h=500" width="372" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The grocery cart this year was so epic, we both had to stop to take pictures.</p></div>
<p><strong>Make a shopping list:</strong> Since you&#8217;ll likely be doubling or tripling recipes, use a spreadsheet to tally up the quantities you&#8217;ll need to buy. If you&#8217;re <em>really </em>into planning, you can even split up your list into categories like produce, meat, pantry, and frozen for easy access at the grocery store.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Go Alone</strong>: When you are buying a few hundred dollars worth of food, you&#8217;ll need a friend to help push the cart, carry bags.</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Fridge</strong>: If you&#8217;re shopping a day or two ahead of time, make sure your have enough space in your fridge or pantry to hold the epic amounts of food. For us, we were lucky that it was cold enough outside that we could leave most of it in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget The Basics</strong>: When you&#8217;re cooking for 30 people, you will need an extra bottle of cooking oil, box of salt, package of paper towels, box of foil, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Get Perishables Last Minute</strong>: Need to get ice cream, frozen veggies and other things that will melt? Put them on a separate list to pick up last minute. Also, if you&#8217;re making guacamole, get your avocados ahead of time so that they have time to ripen.</p>
<p><strong>Use Extra Money Wisely</strong>: We had about $30 left over in the budget. We used it to buy beer for everyone.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Setting Up</h2>
<p><strong>Unloading the car</strong>: When you&#8217;re sharing a kitchen space with 30 people (like in our ski house), make sure to put away all the food in designated locations. No one wants to waste time searching for ingredients come dinner time.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing the Kitchen</strong>: To the best of your ability, clear and sanitize all the surfaces before you start. Then start setting up, creating stations for different recipes and putting ingredients near the station.</p>
<p><strong>Designating helpers</strong>: We assigned 4 people to help us cook a week ahead of time, and each of them were responsible for a recipe. We sent them instructions and recipes ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe Sharing</strong>: We printed out multiple recipe packets (i.e. all 8 recipes in one stapled booklet) so that folks helping out could have their own copy, instead of everyone crowding around one book.</p>
<p><strong>Ask People To Help Later</strong>: People love congregating in the kitchen. But, when space is limited and you&#8217;re making food for 30, it&#8217;s frustrating to have lots of extra people in the kitchen. Ask folks to hang out in the living room (with those lovely appetizers you&#8217;ve already prepared!) and if they wander in asking to help, tell them they can help you do dishes later.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Cooking</h2>
<p><strong>Mies En Place</strong>: Measure all the ingredients, chop all the veggies, and heat up the oven before you start cooking. Don&#8217;t try to chop veggies or measure stuff out while you&#8217;re cooking &#8212; the ingredients won&#8217;t be ready when you need them.</p>
<p><strong>This Part Is Easy</strong>: With all the planning you&#8217;ve done ahead of time, you should have everything you need and this part should be the easiest to do. Chit chat with your friends, drink a beer, and have fun while you cook!</p>
<h2>Step 6: Serving</h2>
<div id="attachment_1041" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 382px"><a href="http://hoppycow.com/2013/01/21/how-to-make-dinner-for-a-lot-of-people-when-youre-not-a-professional-chef/photo-8/" rel="attachment wp-att-1041"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1041" alt="Take it easy and enjoy dinner with friends!" src="http://hoppycow.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo-8.jpg?w=372&#038;h=500" width="372" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Take it easy and enjoy dinner with friends!</p></div>
<p><strong>Setting up the table</strong>: Set up the buffet the way a restaurant would: plates on one end, followed by starters like rice or cornbread, followed by the main, then the sides, then the toppings and sauces. Tell people which way to line up.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for help with dishes</strong>: When you announce dinner, be sure to ask for help with dishes. We learned this the hard way &#8212; the first year we made dinner, we forgot to ask for help and after dinner, everyone peaced out, leaving us with a few friends to do dishes. This year, everyone pitched in and cleanup was a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate</strong>: You&#8217;re done! Time to eat and enjoy the company of great friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3297" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3297" alt="Bamwanjara Pass, 14,600 ft (4450 m), Rwenzori Mountains" src="http://timetoeatthedogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8125.jpg?w=720"   /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#000000;">Bamwanjara Pass, 14,600 ft (4450 m), Rwenzori Mountains</span></p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><i>For the past three weeks, I’ve been in Uganda doing research on my next book, </i>Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and a Theory of Race that Changed Africa <i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015). The book begins in 1876 in East Africa, where the journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley encountered four Africans whose light complexion and European features “aroused [his] curiosity to the highest pitch.” They came from the slopes of Gambaragara, a snow-capped mountain west of Lake Victoria. That such a towering range existed in the heart of equatorial Africa was astonishing enough. “But what gives it peculiar interest,” Stanley wrote, “is, that on its cold and lonely top dwell a people of an entirely distinct race, being white, like Europeans.”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><i> Stanley&#8217;s story had the ring of the fantastic about it, but was taken seriously by scientists, explorers, and the general public &#8212; and came to be supported by evidence ranging from the origin stories of the Hebrew Bible, the discovery of ancient ruins in Egypt and Zimbabwe, the kingship legends of African cultures, and the physical differences observed &#8212; by Stanley and many others &#8212; among African tribes. The existence of white tribes of Africa was a theory, defenders claimed, supported by many pillars. </i>Lost White Tribe<i> traces the rise and fall of this theory, the Hamitic Hypothesis, and the scientific expeditions that gave it life.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><i> After completing my research at Makerere University in Kampala, I took a bus west to Kasese, and then hired a motorcycle taxi to Kilembe.  This small town was the gateway to the Rwenzoris, the tallest mountain range in Africa. Just east of here Stanley glimpsed the massive blue silhouette of Gambaragara (now called Mt. Stanley) for the first time. I spent eight days on Mt. Stanley with a Bakonzo guide and porters, recording what I could of the mountain, its people, and my own subjective experiences. Here are some brief excerpts:</i></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3298" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3298" alt="Kilembe, Western Uganda. Gateway to the Rwenzoris." src="http://timetoeatthedogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_7855.jpg?w=720"   /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#000000;">Kilembe, Western Uganda. Gateway to the Rwenzoris.</span></p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">10 January 2013</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Sine Camp 8576 ft (2596m)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">At 9:30 we walk into Kilembe village, past wooden huts and kiosks, men raking coffee beans, selling cell phone time, children driving cows. Rows of single-level dormitories stretch off to the left covered by rusty metal roofs,  goats graze the courtyards between.  The dorms were originally built as housing units for workers of the British copper mining company that came here years before. Now muzungu money enters the valley only from coffee sales or trekkers like me. The presence of whites is now rare enough to peak interest. Or fear. As we climb the trailhead, we pass a woman bringing her children to work the vertical fields of bananas and cassava ahead. Her daughter, about three years old, is ahead of us on the trail. As the girl sees us approach, separating her from her mother, she begins to cry. When she sees me, her cries grow sharp. I remove my sunglasses thinking it will help. Bad idea. She screams, covers her eyes, leaps off the trail. Scary muzungu.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3299" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3299" alt="William Kiminywa finds a path through the mud." src="http://timetoeatthedogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8088.jpg?w=720"   /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#000000;">William Kiminywa finds a path through the mud.</span></p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">11 January 2013</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Kalalama Camp 10,327 ft (3147m)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">My guide William Kiminywa is Bakonzo, a member of an ethnic group that inhabits the lowlands of the Ruwenzoris, from Western Uganda to Eastern Congo. All of the porters are Bakonzo too, mostly from Kilembe. He’s heard no talk of “white Africans” living on the mountains, but clearly the mountains are a place of the sacred and the strange. William will not say the names of the mountains that tower above us on both sides of the valley – 13,000ft pinnacles that drop straight down to the heather trees of the valley. He writes out the names in my journal instead. Unwise to say the original Bakonzo names out loud. He is no mere folklorist though. William knows the Rwenzoris like no one else. We hike through knee-deep swamps and bogs, oceans of mud. He always sees a way through though – rocks, branches, tussocks invisible to me – stepping stones through the black ooze. I call him the mud whisperer. He laughs. But its true, his knowledge goes deep, sensory and academic. Where I see a mass of ferns and heather, he sees colobus monkeys, dikas, rock hyrax, turacos. He points them out to me quietly with his walking pole, whispering their Latin names so as not to scare them away. I nod, write, take pictures.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3300" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3300" alt="Blue Monkeys, 12,000 ft." src="http://timetoeatthedogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8008.jpg?w=720"   /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#000000;">Blue Monkeys, 12,000 ft.</span></p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">12 January 2013</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Bugata Camp 13,327 ft (4062m)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Today we approach the lower arm of Mt. Stanley. We are now closer to the mountain than Stanley was in 1876 when he climbed a small mountain near the Katonga River and “caught a passing glimpse of the king of mountains Gambaragara.” It was at the summit of this great mountain, Stanley’s African troops told him, that the white Gambaragarans lived amid the snow and craters lakes. Still, my head is elsewhere today. Tess completes in the final round of an oratory contest in Bloomfield, a big event in her life and  to miss it hurts a bit. More than a bit. I feel the isolation of the mountains as we go higher. William is fantastic, and his crew of porters are polite, knowledgeable, professional, but no companions. I am a client, not a friend. The porters bring food, supplies, then retreat to their own tents. Tea and biscuits at 4pm, even in rainstoms, on windy cliffs. When I visit their quarters to talk, they stand, go silent. I’m unshaven, unshowered, caked with mud, but I’m still the Earl of Grantham and I’ve come to servants’ quarters unannounced. My liberal politics, my critiques of colonialism, Victorian explorers, mean nothing here. I enter a fixed role, one that’s been set in place in Africa for hundreds of years and is kept in place by all kinds of trekkers organizations here, Kilimanjaro, maybe the Himalayas too? (I must ask the Everest people). I’m head muzungu. It’s Upstairs Downstairs, only at altitude. Where’s my pith helmet?</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3301" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3301" alt="Summit of Mt. Stanley, border between Uganda and Congo, dividing point between the watersheds of the Congo and Nile Rivers." src="http://timetoeatthedogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8143.jpg?w=720"   /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#000000;">Summit of Mt. Stanley, border between Uganda and Congo, dividing point between the watersheds of the Congo and Nile Rivers.</span></p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">15 January 2013</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Margherita Camp  14,714 ft (4485m)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We leave at 3 am for the summit, headlamps on. I stay very close to William. I never know if the blackness covers a slope or sheer void. After an hour of hiking we’re in snow, then glacier. We take thirty minutes to put on crampons and harnesses, rope up. The march across Elena Glacier is calming after the rocks. Black sky and an ocean of white, just the sound of our feet. We descent a sharp pinnacle of rocks, then we’re on Margherita Glacier. This is not calming. The glacier is steep here, very steep, and the wind howls. I don’t know how many knots but its enough to push flinty pieces of ice up the 50° slope towards the summit and into the skies over Congo. They hit us and keep moving. The air is so thin, it cracks my lips and it’s impossible to catch my breath. I shuffle like an old man. William seems unaffected. Three hours of this and we are finally the rocky crown. It’s so hard to move up this craggy face, I have to crawl at points towards the summit. When we’re there, I stand and sob. I can’t help it. An accumulation of feelings over the six day ascent, and longer perhaps, the three weeks in Kampala and Western Uganda. There are many points of contact between Stanley’s description, those of his African soldiers, and what I see here. The ice and snow, the small lakes in the shadow of the glacier, the great elevation. But there are no lost whites up here – well &#8212; none except for me. And maybe there’s something to that. Stanley wasn’t the only one to think he saw white people in weird places. Not a product of lying, I think, but, more likely wishful thinking. A racial Rorschach test. It may have given Stanley – already a lonely man &#8212; some comfort to imagine Africans who shared his color, his features, perhaps his kinship, so far from home.</span></p>
