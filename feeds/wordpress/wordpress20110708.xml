			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1128" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 448px"><a href="http://japecake.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/likeyoutohatetolikeme.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1128" title="LikeYoutoHatetoLikeMe" src="http://japecake.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/likeyoutohatetolikeme.jpg?w=438&#038;h=425" alt="" width="438" height="425" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo (prior to alteration): George Eastman House, via Flickr</p></div>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s <em>Wall Street Journal</em> carried an excellent, thought-provoking <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304584004576415940086842866.html" target="_blank">article</a> on what its author describes as the &#8220;like&#8221; culture, an &#8220;insidious&#8221; phenomenon that has crept up, like a thing ascending creepily, in the world of social media. The sobering thesis is that many active participants in social media—writers of blogs included—fall into the trap of pandering to the lowest common denominator in the blind, desperate, adolescent pursuit of page hits, &#8220;likes,&#8221; and subscribers. After reading the article, I decided to do a little soul-searching among the dusty depths of the Japecake archive, and I didn&#8217;t like what I found. (Why, oh, why did I ever buy an entire pallet of bootlegged <em>Glitter </em>DVDs?) With much shame I came to realize that in post after post, I, too, have regularly fallen victim to a pathetic need to be liked, at any cost, by absolutely anyone who was stupid enough to click on my &#8220;FREE √IAG®A HERE!!!&#8221; ad, only to end up on the home page. Beginning with the present post, however, I&#8217;ve resolved to turn over a new leaf, to reclaim my gritty, independent, contrarian roots. There&#8217;s gonna be some changes around here—enumerated below—and, believe me, you&#8217;re not gonna like ’em. <em>Like</em> me? Get ready to <em>loathe </em>me. ’Cause that&#8217;s that way I like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The weekly delivery of free muffin baskets to each of my subscribers will stop immediately. Please return all uneaten and partly eaten muffins at the earliest opportunity.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Like&#8221; button has been reprogrammed so that, each time it is pressed, a kitten somewhere will be forced to eat Puppy Chow, and vice versa.</li>
<li>The use of my trademark sign-off image, seen below, will cease as soon as a suitable replacement can be found.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://japecake.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/japeyssignoff.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1129" title="Japey'sSignOff" src="http://japecake.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/japeyssignoff.jpg?w=300&#038;h=407" alt="" width="300" height="407" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>All amusing anecdotes and &#8220;life lessons&#8221; will now be followed by the phrase &#8220;and then they all got tetanus.&#8221;</li>
<li>I will ignore all readers whom I chance to meet on the street or at social functions. (This policy remains unchanged.)</li>
<li>All of the genial, homespun wisdom previously imparted by Japecake will be replaced with store-bought wisdom made of rayon and PVC.</li>
<li>Before reading each new post, visitors will be instructed to set the mood by playing Barber&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mNg12vg6Q&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Adagio for Strings</a></em> in the background.</li>
<li>Prospective new subscribers will be required to complete a fitness test and a six-hour examination encompassing mathematics, Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, Middle English literature, Potent Potables, and Potpourri.</li>
<li>The &#8220;inspirational&#8221; coffee mug I drink from while composing posts will be replaced by a chipped Mason jar. The coffee will be replaced by dill relish.</li>
<li>All emoticons posted to the blog must incorporate a significant physical abnormality or a crippling psychological disorder. Merely using a slash (/) as a &#8220;mouth&#8221; does not automatically qualify, unless accompanied by a note from a licensed physician or psychologist describing the condition in detail. The use of &#8220;&lt;3&#8243; is prohibited altogether, unless the quantity you are describing is indeed less than three.</li>
<li>The 17th Annual Japecake Teddy Bear Picnic is cancelled. The Japecake Teddy Bear Mulching is scheduled for July 23 (Rain day: July 24).</li>
<li>All of the crudely Photoshopped images for which Japecake is renowned will hereafter be rendered in monochrome black and white.</li>
</ul>
<p>That about covers it. Except for my new sign-off photo. Hope you <del>like</del> don&#8217;t like it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This 4th of July I didn&#8217;t see a single firework, but I did go to the Red Ryder Roundup Rodeo in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. There&#8217;s nothing more American than a good old fashioned rodeo!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046488.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-490 aligncenter" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046488.jpg?w=614&#038;h=512" alt="" width="614" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>I love the rodeo for the skill of the riders, the raw animal athleticism and the obvious bond between cowboys and their horses. Rodeos are also among my favorite events to photograph. I race the shutter and often catch some amazing stills:</p>
<div id="attachment_492" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 521px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046565.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-492  " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046565.jpg?w=511&#038;h=492" alt="" width="511" height="492" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rough dismount/ Lucky shot. He lost his boot!</p></div>
<p>Out West, many of the participants are real cowboys who earn their living on ranches and come in from the range with their working mounts just for the rodeo. In Pagosa, everybody really looked the part of the classic American cowboy:</p>
<div id="attachment_495" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 557px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046695.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-495 " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046695.jpg?w=547&#038;h=411" alt="" width="547" height="411" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Real Cowboys, Real Cowhorses</p></div>
<div id="attachment_507" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 545px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046717.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-507 " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046717.jpg?w=535&#038;h=390" alt="" width="535" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jean &amp; Boots, Chaps &amp; Spurs</p></div>
<p>Rodeos evolved out of ranch work and most of the events, with the adrenaline-soaked exception of bull riding, can be traced to animal husbandry practices still in use today. Traditional rodeos consist of seven events that are always presented in the same order: bareback riding, steer wrestling, team roping, saddle bronc, tie-down roping, barrel racing and bull riding.</p>
<div id="attachment_496" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p8152208.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-496 " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p8152208.jpg?w=553&#038;h=380" alt="" width="553" height="380" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steer Wrestling</p></div>
<div id="attachment_532" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046663.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-532  " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046663.jpg?w=553&#038;h=503" alt="" width="553" height="503" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Team Roping</p></div>
<p>The Pagosa Rodeo was an exceptionally awesome experience because my cousin got us right behind the bull chutes for the bull riding. The energy back there was unbelievable! Most of the bull riders were just kids –teenagers – and they amped themselves and each other up for their rides by yelling, jumping around and slapping their own faces and thighs. One kid looked at me and grinned and all his front teeth were missing. The testosterone and comraderie between the cowboys was palpable, with everybody cheering on everybody else.</p>
<div id="attachment_497" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046725.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-497 " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046725.jpg?w=553&#038;h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Behind the Bull Chutes</p></div>
<p>As for the bulls, I was struck by how calm they were in the chutes in the midst of all that commotion. They didn&#8217;t get riled up until the cowboys climbed over the gate and onto their backs. I got the feeling these aren&#8217;t crazed animals and they know exactly what their job is: to buck those boys off in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Soft eye or not, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d climb onto one of those beasts. Standing behind the chutes when the bulls exploded out of the gate into the arena was thrilling enough. The power of those animals is incredible. Being close to a bucking bull is like standing next to a derailing freight train. Who needs fireworks with this kind of action!</p>
<div id="attachment_508" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 563px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046754.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-508 " title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p7046754.jpg?w=553&#038;h=519" alt="" width="553" height="519" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Snot- Slinging Bucking Bull in Full Force</p></div>
<p>I love the rodeo, but there are those who find it impossible to watch without seeing animal cruelty, probably due to misconceptions about how rodeo stock are trained to buck. Bucking horses and bulls are both bred for brio and trained to respond explosively under a rider. These are valuable animals – a good bucking horse can be worth 10 grand and a champion bucking bull ten times that – and they are treated well.</p>
<p>In any crowd there will be a few nasty apples, but overall, I think ranchers and rodeo-ers respect their animals in the kind of abiding ways that come from working with intelligent creatures day in and out. Having looked a bucking bull in the eye, I know there&#8217;s more to that animal than meat and hooves. I&#8217;m sure the cowboys do too.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://portable.tv/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/af1-620x388.png" alt="" width="380" height="238" />Plenty of old folks like to toss around the question, “Who listens to the radio anymore,” as if it was something sacred to their specific generations and reclusive to others, like the youth of today wouldn’t appreciate it. They have fond memories of the glorious Top 40 days, when rock topped the charts. I’ll admit, it’d be great to see rock bands at the top these days, but I’m a realist, and know that’s a stretch. Pop kills rock. It’s been done. Still, I’m a radio listener, and I listen to many different stations from all over the US. I have to hand it to mainstream radio for making a bold statement by playing some new(er) indie rock tracks lately. The FM airwaves have taken brutal stabs over the past few years by audiences leaving them for the more convenient company of satellites. I guess contemporary rock stations in major cities had to take a risk, and aim to reach a new audience. I think by playing some of these great singles from some of the top alternative rock bands in the world today is a step in the right direction, especially if they want to play hardball with other mediums. Us young folks are digging it. Here are my Top 7 alternative rock tracks that mainstream FM stations in US cities are now playing:</p>
<p><strong>7. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart – Heart In Your Heartbreak</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Interpol – Barricade</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. The Strokes – Taken For A Fool</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Arctic Monkeys – Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Foo Fighters – Back &amp; Forth</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Arcade Fire – We Used To Wait</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. My Morning Jacket – Holdin’ On To Black Metal</strong></p>
<p>From Los Angeles to New York, Seattle to Atlanta, and all over the US, program directors are taking a page out of college rock’s historical rise to fame, and giving young people a reason to tune into the right of the dial again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Heart In Your Heartbreak (Official Video)&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4451" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://spuddey.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/last-shuttle-launch.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4451" title="NASA Prepares For Launch Of Space Shuttle Atlantis" src="http://spuddey.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/last-shuttle-launch.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the last launch is due...</p></div>
<p>As a child born in the 1960&#8242;s I watched the space race develop from the Americans <a title="Apollo 11" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11" target="_blank">landing on the moon </a>(I was only 7 but remember it) to the collaboration between the US and USSR in the<a title="USA/USSR" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo-soyuz/index.html" target="_blank"> Soyuz/Apollo </a>program on <a title="Skylab" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/skylab/" target="_blank">Skylab</a> and then the International Space station.  However once the Saturn Five stopped being launched at the end of the Apollo missions it was all about the Space Shuttle for me.</p>
<p>The Shuttle has obviously had its issues, and some <a title="Challenger" href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_256.html" target="_blank">very bad moments</a>, but the sight of it launching has always been something I loved watching. I almost made it to a launch back in 2001, I had managed to obtain tickets from NASA (you could apply on-line) and was due to visit Florida &#8211; but then various events prevented the trip and so I did not see the launch.</p>
<p>A subsequent trip was within a few weeks of a launch &#8211; again so close&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Now however I will have to add this to my &#8220;failures&#8221; on my wish list (it also includes a flight on Concorde) as the last flight is due to<a title="STS135" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html" target="_blank"> launch today </a>(although the weather may stop it).</p>
<p>Just in the nick of time Apple have managed to get the iPhone approved for flight (they have made some minor modifications &#8211; all wireless communication has been disabled and the battery has been removed. Instead, an external battery pack already certified for use in space will be used. The two units will be used to run some experiments.</p>
<p>So an iPhone 4 will be on the last flight &#8211; I am jealous&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just returned from an 8-day vacation up and down the New England coast with my boyfriend&#8230; and it was A-MAZ-ING. However&#8230; it is now official. I am in the midst of a full-fledged, hard-core, post-vacation funk. And I am here to tell you that the fabled funk is very real and I would argue that it is an inevitable occurrence in the life of any vacationer.</p>
<p>All the fun you’ve been planning for, saving for and laid awake with great <em>night-before-Christmas</em> anticipation for … is over. The photos are now in your camera instead of the brochure and the t-shirt is hanging in the closet.</p>
<p>Mind you, the funk does not occur overnight. Rather it seeps into your conscience slowly and before you know it you are completely mired in it. Suddenly you find yourself knee-deep in the reality that you are neither: A. Independently wealthy, or B. Free from the obscenity that is Responsibility … with a capital “R.”</p>
<p>When you first arrive home—a weary traveler surrounded by the familiar sights, scents and sounds of your “stuff”—you can’t help but experience Dorothy&#8217;s <em>“There&#8217;s No Place Like Home”</em>  feeling and sleeping in your own bed (on the memory foam that still remembers you) is blissful.</p>
<p>The next day comes and whether at home or the office, it is a flurry of activity. You’re answering emails, returning calls and taking care of household chores with that rested, happy glow that only a true getaway can provide. You’re still sportin’ the chilled attitude that comes from spending 7 days in flip-flops and you are recounting the details of your adventure to anyone who will listen. People expect that you will not exactly be “at the top of your game” since your head is most likely still in the clouds (or on the beach, or in the mountains, or by the pool, or at that really cool bar you found) and minor errors and gaffs are swiftly forgiven.</p>
<p>Day three brings with it the bi!@# that is reality. The alarm sounds for the second time since you’ve been back and you suddenly remember that this was why you went on vacation in the first place … to escape that d@mn alarm and the daily grind that follows it.</p>
<p>Day four is the same as the third only worse. The alarm clock hits you like a punch in the face reminding you that yesterday was not a fluke or a joke or a drill or even a bad dream. YOU. ARE. NOW. HOME. And it is only Wednesday. This is when you begin to play a sadistic little game with yourself that I like to call: <strong><em>“Where Were You Exactly One Week Ago Today?”</em></strong> And a word to the wise about playing this game: The non-vacation version of you will always wind up the loser.</p>
<p>By the way… exactly ONE week ago today… I was still in bed… but whatever. I’m not playing.</p>
<p>By day five you <em>understand</em> your fate, but you do not necessarily <strong><em>like</em></strong> it. Anger builds. You can’t stop playing the <em>“Where Were You Exactly One Week Ago Today?”<strong> </strong></em>game every time you open the empty refrigerator, notice a heaping pile of laundry, encounter a pair of sad and sandy flip-flops lying lifeless on the floor or walk past the growing stacks of mail and dwindling supply of saltwater taffy on your dining room table.</p>
<p>It is at this point that you begin to entertain wild imaginings about how you might achieve the life of a full-time vacationer. What if I just <em>disappeared? </em> What might be the consequences of <em>that?</em>  How much DO they pay those people who change sheets and fold towels at all those charming, little B&amp;B&#8217;s? Is it hard to learn how to make saltwater taffy like the guy in the window at that quaint candy shop on the pier? Is it too late to get a degree in Recreation or Hospitality and Tourism Management? Am I too old to become a deck hand?</p>
<p>They say that there are five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and finally Acceptance. They are not necessarily experienced in order. The bereaved might vacillate between the five for several weeks or months languishing for a time at one stage or another. So far I think I have experienced all of them and it has yet to be one week.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the time I unwrap and consume the last piece of taffy, I will have quietly accepted my life just the way it is. It’s either that or you will likely find me behind a glass storefront in a hairnet and white gloves, pulling taffy for tourists.</p>

<p><em>“The greatest enemy of the truth is very often not the lie—deliberate, contrived, and dishonest—but the myth—persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.” —JFK</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Derek Jeter is poised to make history this weekend, his career is in a very unusual place. On the one hand, he is standing on the cusp of history, poised to become the first Yankee to reach 3,000 hits. On the other hand, he is following up 2010, the worst season of his career, with an even worse year. The Yankees played their best stretch of baseball with him on the DL, leading some to wonder <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/new-york-yankees-doing-fine-with-derek-jeter-on-disabled-list-062811">if the team is better off without him</a>. And he remains under contract through at least 2013.</p>
<p>So why release a biography of Jeter now, at such an uncertain crossroads in his career? Writing a biography of Jeter that culminates in the 2009 season—squeezing his dreadful ’10 and his contentious contract negotiations this off-season into the epilogue—is like writing a biography of Julius Caesar that ends on March 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Ian O’Connor’s new book, <em>The Captain: The Journey of Derek Jeter</em>, is bound to be incomplete. So why did he write it? It seems clear that the primary motive O’Connor had for writing this book was not to bring new light to Jeter’s career, but to enhance the myths already surrounding it. <em>The Captain</em> is, above all else, an exercise in mythmaking.<span id="more-6994"></span></p>
<p>Let’s get this out of the way: <em>The Captain </em>is not a good book. It is sloppily written and glaringly biased. The research is copious, but distractingly one-sided—full of clubhouse gossip, heavily dependent on a few questionable sources, and conspicuously missing most of the primary figures (like, say, Jeter). Most importantly, there is (outside of the first three chapters that cover his pre-Yankee career) very little information in the book that an attentive Yankee fan would not already know.</p>
<p><em>The Captain </em>was clearly a labor of love for O’Connor. His investment in the story (he told Joe Posnanski that he wrote the book because Jeter was the player he wanted his son to model himself after) certainly comes through. But this becomes a fault. The book is so clearly written to verify certain assumptions about Jeter that it becomes essentially useless as a primary document.</p>
<p>The new pieces of information that O’Connor does include are not particularly revelatory. It’s not the most thrilling piece of news, for example, that Julian Mock went on a three-mile run before deciding that the Cincinnati Reds would pass on Jeter in the 1992 draft. And while the anecdote about Jeffrey Maier’s trip to Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS is interesting, it probably does not need to go on for twelve pages.</p>
<p>But O’Connor seems almost wary of including new information, lest it clash with the perception we already have of Jeter. Instead we get reminders about things we already know, but have possibly forgotten, like Jeter being named Yankee captain while the team was on the road, his 2003 Visa commercial with George Steinbrenner, or his feud with teammate Chad Curtis. We get broad outlines of each of the Yankees’ championship seasons that include copious details that have little to do with Jeter, such as what Tim McCarver said about Jim Leyritz’s home run in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series or David Wells’ reaction to being traded to Toronto. We get bromides from sources all desperate to present themselves as prescient:</p>
<blockquote><p>David Cone: “When I saw Jeter run and watched how the ball jumped off his bat, I was like, ‘Wow, this kid’s got some talent. This kid’s got it.’ You could tell he wasn’t intimidated and he wanted to play.”</p>
<p>Darryl Strawberry: “I’d be talking to him in the dugout or in the clubhouse, just telling him, ‘Don’t worry about it, your day is coming, bro. This town is going to eat you up. They’re going to love you, trust me. You don’t have star potential; you’ve got megastar potential.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this is done to present the things we already know to be true about Jeter: He’s a winner. He’s poised. He’s determined. He’s had a blessed career. He inspires his teammates. He’s a charming gentleman and a great ambassador for the game. He only cares about championships. His greatness transcends the tangible.</p>
<p>Information that seems like it might contradict any of these preconceptions is merely presented as evidence of another. When he responds to early doubts about his defense by saying to a teammate, “I’m never moving from shortstop… never,” it’s presented as an example of his determination—not as evidence against his love of winning. His pickup techniques with women—“he’d extend his index finger and point and motion for them to come over without making a sound”—are evidence of his charm, and nothing less than gentlemanly. The fact that “he preferred clubs with roped-off areas for VIPs” is evidence of his quest for privacy and a respite from autograph-seekers he never turned down, not any elitism.</p>
<p>O’Connor does seem to criticize Jeter’s unforgiving nature, but even this is presented as a by-product of his perfectionism and self-confidence. When Ken Huckaby tried to apologize for injuring Jeter on Opening Day in 2003, Jeter responded with “nothing but a cold, bloodless stare.” This reaction, though, was only because Jeter was<span style="color:#008000;"> </span>“hell-bent on making this a season to remember” and didn’t like missing 36 games.</p>
<p>But Jeter’s unforgiving streak also extended to any criticism he received. After Curtis told him he didn’t “know how to play the game,” he “was dead to Jeter” even after he apologized. Jeter had a similarly cold reaction to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/02/sports/main275885.shtml">Alex Rodriguez’s infamous comments to <em>Esquire </em>in 2000</a>.</p>
<p>Ah, A-Rod. Although O’Connor’s book is a biography of Jeter, there are times when it feels equally about Rodriguez. As O’Connor puts it: “Alex and Derek. Derek and Alex. The mention of one automatically inspired the mention of the other.” Indeed, there is an entire chapter just called “Alex,” and even that represents only a fraction of the time spent on Rodriguez.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the greatest fault of <em>The Captain</em>. While most of the myths the book espouses—Jeter as the ultimate winner, Jeter as the class act, Jeter as the leader, etc.—are harmless and true enough, insofar as sports myths go, the one that is the most noxious and unfair is that Jeter and A-Rod represent some kind of mirror image of one another, and that the only way to build one of them up is to tear the other one down.</p>
<p>And the book certainly does attempt to tear Rodriguez down, in an almost despicable way. O’Connor includes a quote in which Rodriguez compares his SAT scores with Jeter’s as an example of Rodriguez’s “Jeter envy.” But O’Connor doesn’t mention that <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mn/nyy2/06.html">the quote comes from 1996</a> or that Rodriguez was praising Jeter for winning a student-athlete award.</p>
<p>O’Connor even presents Rodriguez’s record-setting contract as an attempt to get revenge for losing the 2000 ALCS: “Rodriguez cold not beat Jeter, or Jeter’s team…. So A-Rod needed a different vehicle for retribution, a fresh plan of attack.” He then claims that Rodriguez cared so much about having the largest contract in baseball that he “figured he needed to protect the only title he could win” by criticizing Jeter. Of course, in both the interviews O’Connor mentions, Rodriguez was <em>explicitly asked </em>whether or not he thought another player could top his record. And the horrible things Rodriguez said?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Even a guy like Derek, it’s going to be hard for him to break that [$252 million barrier] because he just doesn’t do the power numbers. And defensively, he doesn’t do all those things. So he might not break the 252. He might get 180. I don’t know what he’s going to get.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Later, he would make more inflammatory remarks to <em>Esquire </em>that impugned Jeter’s leadership skills, but even those essentially boiled down to the inarguable fact that Jeter hit second in a very good lineup. And even then, when he found out that his words might have come off like an attack on Jeter, A-Rod drove ninety minutes to Jeter’s house to apologize in person.</p>
<p>But just as O’Connor manages to turn almost every fact about Jeter into a pro-Jeter fact, he manages to spin everything about Rodriguez against him. When A-Rod said, “I’m almost embarrassed and ashamed of this contract,” O’Connor presents it as A-Rod once again caring about how he looks.</p>
<p>The author can barely contain his contempt for Rodriguez, even including absurd potshots at him: “Jeter was said to have stolen [Joy] Enriquez’s affections away from A-Rod, who, of course, had it coming to him.” When Jeter wants to win, it’s an admirable quality; when A-Rod wants to win so badly he’s willing to switch positions it’s because he’s “desperate to avoid finishing his career without a parade to call his own.” Yeah, A-Rod’s only in it for the parade…</p>
<p>All of this is petty, illogical, and unprofessional. Parts of the book read as if they were written because Rodriguez killed O’Connor’s dog. It would be one thing if O’Connor had some new revelations or any hard evidence about the Jeter-Rodriguez relationship, but he doesn’t. He baselessly blames Jeter’s early 2004 slump on the “tense and awkward pairing on the left side of the infield” (yep, that’s what causes slumps). He spends almost a whole chapter on<span style="color:#008000;"> </span>a pop-up the two botched in 2006 and the public fallout that resulted from it. He insists that Jeter “hated being A-Rod’s teammate” without any statement from Jeter or anyone who knows Jeter to back it up. In other words, O’Connor covers perceptions as if they are reality.</p>
<p>This, ultimately, is what the book boils down to. O’Connor tells people what<span style="color:#008000;"> </span>they want to hear and what they already suspect to be true. People already believe that Jeter was a born star, that he is a natural winner, that he has great character, and that he and A-Rod despise each other. It doesn’t take much work to convince people of this, so O’Connor doesn’t bother. He’s happy to regurgitate the myths surrounding Jeter, even as the reality fans are seeing this season slides further and further away from the legend. O’Connor’s <em>The Captain </em>is not concerned with the truth about the captain.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, because Jeter is one of the most interesting athletes alive today. Like Tiger Woods, Jeter has always presented himself so immaculately that his real personality remains an object of curiosity. His career has really been unparalleled in the entire history of sports. But it’s not over yet. Some time in the future, after Jeter’s career has ended and all involved have some perspective on it, there is a great biography to be written. One that is worthy of the player. Until then, all we have is myth…</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parenthood, I had heard someone say, is an opportunity to experience childhood all over. Except this time you have a driver&#8217;s license and a bank account, which makes it not like childhood at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kat1980/5915438802/" title="002 by Katrina Parks, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6040/5915438802_2fe3ff62e5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="002"></a></p>
<p>I <i>am</i> collecting the books that made my childhood, though, hoping they&#8217;ll make my daughter&#8217;s too. I still had my Shel Silverstein books and have put all of the Maurice Sendak that I used to have on Amelia&#8217;s Amazon wish list. I bought big lots of Bright &amp; Early books and Berenstain Bears off of eBay, and am buying the Brambly Hedge books used from Amazon one after another, as good condition copies appear for less than a dollar. I have stood in the (very good) local used book store, marveling at copies of the same editions of the same chapter books that my dad read to me, trying to remember if they were good enough to buy again.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve started remembering the books that were at my grandparent&#8217;s house, which I read over and over, and putting them on Amelia&#8217;s wish list just for nostalgia. <i>Doctor Dan the Bandage Man</i> and <i>The Story About Ping</i> evoke the toothpaste-and-Irish-Spring smell of my grandmother&#8217;s house, the cool plush green carpeting under bare feet, the 50s-tchotchke pictures of a little Indian girl and little Indian boy, grandpa&#8217;s piano with molded candles on top and the bench swing and astroturf on their enclosed porch.</p>
<p>Amelia will have some different books in her childhood and obviously different grandparents&#8217; houses. She won&#8217;t ever know what mine were like. So it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m taking this opportunity to relive my own&#8230; and enjoying every minute.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also a scream to play with her toys.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1755" title="Rhubarb Jam2" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam2.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" alt="" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Every summer, my family road trips about 11 hours north from our home in Missouri to visit my grandma in a teeny town in Wisconsin, on the farm where my dad grew up. It’s one of those trips that we all look forward to every year, not just because it’s a chance to get away from work and responsibility for a week (that’s the beauty of any vacation, right?) but also because we get to spend a solid few days in a place that feels infinitely more peaceful than anywhere else in the world. It’s calm, it’s quiet, and it’s familiar. In other words, it’s perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1756" title="Rhubarb" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" alt="" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Last week while we were at the farm, I told my grandma that I’d been thinking about learning to can or make jam for a while, and she mentioned the bunches of rhubarb she had growing out in the garden that needed to be used before they missed their chance. I’ve had very little rhubarb-eating experience in my lifetime — enough to know I like it but not enough to know exactly how or what to do with it — and my rhubarb-cooking experience was zero before this trip. Rhubarb jam sounded like just what I needed to expand my rhubarb horizons while learning a dandy new skill at the same time.</p>
<p>At the farm, everything comes with a story. The rhubarb plant that we picked from was planted more than 40 years ago, my grandma said. For more than 40 years, that single plant has been growing enough rhubarb for jams, pies, cakes and crumbles, with hardly any gardening maintenance needed at all. Forty years. I wouldn’t have guessed she was a day over 19.</p>
<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-leaves2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1757" title="Rhubarb Leaves2" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-leaves2.jpg?w=427&#038;h=640" alt="" width="427" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Before this rhubarb jam business could get going, Grandma showed me how to do the picking. She grabbed hold of a piece of rhubarb near the bottom and gave it a quick tug as it snapped off the plant. Then with a small paring knife, she cut off the big leafy end and started a pile of red rhubarb stalks next to her on the grass. “That’s all there is to it,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cutting-rhubarb2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1758" title="Cutting Rhubarb2" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cutting-rhubarb2.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" alt="" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Once all the rhubarb was picked (we grabbed enough for a double batch of jam and a rhubarb crumble), we headed inside to clean it and cut it. This is the most time-consuming part of the process, Grandma said. She was right; it took a while to get all the dirt washed off the stalks and all the rhubarb cut up into ¼-inch pieces. But it was pretty smooth sailing for there on out.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because this was my first time making jam, but I felt almost giddy while we were dicing and boiling and stirring away the afternoon. There’s something so simple yet so calming and carefree about stepping back from modern conveniences and doing this type of thing, step by step, from the beginning. By the time we’d spooned the jam into the jars, added the lids and waited for them to seal, I was so smiley from the whole experience that I started thinking I’d never buy jam from the grocery store again. Then one by one, the lids made a loud “pop” to tell us they were sealed. Happy, happy day.</p>
<p>••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1759" title="Rhubarb Jam" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam.jpg?w=427&#038;h=640" alt="" width="427" height="640" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rhubarb Raspberry Jam</strong><br />
<em>From Grannio</em></p>
<p>• 4 cups diced rhubarb<br />
• 4 cups white sugar<br />
• 2 to 3 tablespoons water<br />
• 1 package raspberry JELL-O (Grandma said strawberry works well, too.)</p>
<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam-cooking.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1760" title="Rhubarb Jam Cooking" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam-cooking.jpg?w=427&#038;h=640" alt="" width="427" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Mix rhubarb, sugar and water in a large pot over medium to medium-high heat. Stir occasionally. You’re basically heating it up until the rhubarb starts releasing its juices. If you’ve been cooking for a while and the mixture still looks a little dry, add another tablespoon of water and stir. You can also put the lid on the pot to get the moisture going faster, but keep a close eye on it. Boiled-over jam = messy business.</p>
<p>Once the mixture reaches a rolling boiling, add the JELL-O package while stirring. Keep stirring until JELL-O is completely dissolved. You really need to keep your eyes (and spoon) on the pot at this point. The jam can boil over really quickly.</p>
<p>Carefully spoon hot, hot jam into hot, hot jars [Note: You want everything super hot for this part of the process, particularly if you plan on sealing your jars. After washing your jars, pour boiling water over them and in them, which will keep them hot until ready to use. Right before you’re ready to fill them with jam, pour out the boiling water and let them drain for a few seconds so they aren’t super watery inside. In the meantime, you can put your lids in a bowl of boiling water so they’re also hot and ready to use.]. Place a hot, hot sealing lid on top, then screw on the outer ring. Then Grandma usually places a towel on the counter and flips the jars upside down (lid side on the counter) for about 30 minutes before flipping them back over. After those 30 minutes, flip your jars right side up, and wait for the “pop” to know they are sealed properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1761" title="Rhubarb Jam3" src="http://splashofsomething.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rhubarb-jam3.jpg?w=490&#038;h=326" alt="" width="490" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p>We doubled the recipe and ended up with about 10 tiny jars of jam to last us well into the chilly season. And last they will; Grandma said that once those puppies are sealed (I’m paraphrasing here; she didn’t really use the word “puppies”), they keep for quite a long time. Woo to the hoo for that.</p>
<p>Do any of you have jam-making experience? What are you favorite ingredients to use? Anything out of the ordinary? And are there any gardeners out there who can pick straight from the source and then cook until their heart’s content? You lucky ducks.</p>
