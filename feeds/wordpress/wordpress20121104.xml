				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/header.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-50 aligncenter" title="header" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/header.jpg?w=976&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="976" /></a>I  was looking for a simple, cheap, and cute thank you for the girls at work who were throwing me a baby shower. I wanted something useful/yummy that they could take home with them. I usually bake cookies, but lately I&#8217;ve been really short on time, and who doesn&#8217;t like chocolate?! I saw this idea over at <a href="http://thenewdomestic.com/category/make/page/4/">The New Domestic</a>. Their version is kinda fancier, but I like my simple version using things I had on hand. <a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/supplies.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-51 aligncenter" title="supplies" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/supplies.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a> I used things I already had on hand and only had to buy the chocolate bars. Look through your supplies and be creative!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Supplies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:center;">scrapbook paper (fabric would be cute too)</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">clear tape (you could try glue, but I didn&#8217;t want to wait for it to dry)</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">marker (stickers would be cute)</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">paper doilies (you could also use ribbon, yarn, washi tape, stickers&#8230;)</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">something to cut with</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">chocolate bars wrapped in foil and removable label (these were actually very hard to find. but most specialty chocolates are still wrapped in foil)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/naked-chocolate1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-62" title="naked chocolate" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/naked-chocolate1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702" height="702" width="1024" /></a>Step 1: Get your chocolate naked!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Be very careful removing the label, mine was glued to the foil a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/measure1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-63" title="measure" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/measure1.jpg?w=1011&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="1011" /></a>Step 2: Measuring</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Flip your scrapbook paper over so you don&#8217;t mark on the pretty side. Use one of the chocolate labels and just trace around or make marks for cutting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cut1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-64" title="cut" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cut1.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a>Step 3: Cutting</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I have this nifty little paper cutter from when I made our wedding invites, but a ruler and scissors works (or just trace and cut free hand on the line).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tape-and-fold1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65" title="tape and fold" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tape-and-fold1.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a>Step 4: Tape and Fold</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Lay your chocolate face down on your scrapbook paper, fold an edge over and tape somewhere near the center on the back. Pull the paper tight to get a crisp edge and tape the other side down.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/taped1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66" title="taped" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/taped1.jpg?w=930&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="930" /></a>To get a crisp edge, run your fingers down the sides and crease the paper with the edge of the chocolate (just like wrapping a present).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doily1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67" title="doily" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doily1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=843" height="843" width="1024" /></a>Step 5: Decorate</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Using these little paper doilies, I measure where the best spot would be to write.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/writing1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68" title="writing" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/writing1.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" height="1024" width="768" /></a>I just used my sharpie and wrote a quick thanks in the center.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doily-back1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69" title="doily back" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doily-back1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=619" height="619" width="1024" /></a>Next, I just taped the edges on the back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-end1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70" title="the end" alt="" src="http://scrawnygirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-end1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=695" height="695" width="1024" /></a>And voila! All finished!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am pretty sure I haven&#8217;t mentioned this in recent posts, but I am attempting NaNoWriMo this month. For those who don&#8217;t know, NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month. Each November a huge group of writers and hopeful-writers gather and rather crazily attempt to write 50,000 word novels in that month, or roughly 1,667 words a day. Despite being swamped as always, I wanted to tackle this this month. I planned to use this to finish my already in progress novel, about 11k in so far.</p>
<p>Rewind to yesterday afternoon and picture me, staring at a blank Scrivener doc, feeling utterly useless. <em>Why won&#8217;t the words come out? Why can&#8217;t I write a thousand words easily like &#8216;everyone else&#8217;? How will I ever be an author if I can&#8217;t write as fast I should? I stink.</em></p>
<p>At about 6 o&#8217;clock last night, after spending precious hours agonizing over the few hundred words I managed to write, I tweeted something along the lines of:<br />
&#8220;This is ridiculous. I&#8217;m sorry, but I just can&#8217;t write this many words in a day. I don&#8217;t think I can do NaNo.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response, I got about 5 people tell me to keep trying, to let go of my Inner Editor, all that sort of stuff. The people who told me this stuff meant it in a great and encouraging way, and they&#8217;re lovely for helping me that way. But it seemed to drive a wedge between me and seemingly the rest of the writing world. On one side is me, clinging to my triple digit word counts, and on the other is all of the others, the ones who succeed, the ones who can sometimes write <em>12,000 freaking words in a day. </em>It&#8217;s pretty hard not to feel like a failure thinking of someone writing thousands of words a day and you still struggling.</p>
<p>But after quite a bit of introspection, I discovered what I knew all along. I&#8217;m not like that. I can&#8217;t write 1,667 words a day. I can&#8217;t write 1,000 words in a day, either, unless I&#8217;m feeling particularly inspired. And why should I be expected to? Why does this feel wrong, my inability to write thousands of words on whim? It&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I love to write so much is because I believe communication is beautiful. That it&#8217;s one of the greatest gifts we have as humanity, and writing allows me to speak to people without ever meeting them or actually saying a word. I am like this in person, too. Words are so, so powerful, so I take extra care to make sure the ones I write and the ones I say are empowering. This means, sometimes, that I am slow to speak. It also means that I can&#8217;t sit down and write randomly. I can&#8217;t write the first words that pop into my head, I have to think them through. Call that my Inner Editor if you&#8217;d like, but I call it me. It&#8217;s just who I am, someone who contemplates things.</p>
<p>People who can write thousands of words in a day are amazing, and in no way do I mean that they aren&#8217;t as good as me. Oh gosh, no. I hope you don&#8217;t get that idea.  I admire those people from the bottom of my heart. Their devotion to their stories is unbelievable, and their energy is contagious.</p>
<p>But I thought it would be nice to write a post about the other people, the ones who agonize over every word and come out immensely proud of that paragraph or even page. Remember that race between the super slow tortoise and the sprinting hare? The tortoise won. Why? Because the hare (NaNo-er)  got tired and had to take a nap (really long revisions) while the tortoise continued slowly walking by (with his measly word counts but very limited revisions) and won. But &#8216;winning&#8217; isn&#8217;t really the point here. Both finish eventually, because each are totally legitamate &#8216;competitors&#8217;. To me, finishing in a month isn&#8217;t as important as finishing with a good product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still registered with NaNo, but I&#8217;m shrugging off the pressure. My daily goal is now 833 words a day, half of the NaNo goal, which is good for me. And I won&#8217;t let anyone tell me otherwise. We *technically* aren&#8217;t supposed to worry about word counts, anyway.</p>
<p>So there you have it, all. Remember that slow writing is never unequal to fast writing. Just write, okay? We shouldn&#8217;t really care that some people write slower than others. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Love and writing luck to everyone!</p>
<p>Olivia</p>
<p>&#8220;After that, Hare always reminded himself, &#8220;Don&#8217;t brag about your lightning pace, for Slow and Steady won the race!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, at the far north west end of the Hawaiian Archipelago, lie a few tiny coral and sand islands encircled by a small reef. These little patches of dry land in the midst of a vast expanse of water and sky are Midway Atoll.</p>
<p>Each year, these islands provide breeding habitat for a range of bird species. For example, the largest remaining colonies of two threatened species of albatross – the black-footed and Laysan – are to be found here. Between a third and two thirds of the global population of each species call this place home for roughly eight months each year; tied to the land and engaged in an endless movement between egg and chick rearing duties and the all important search for food at sea.</p>
<p>We do not know with any accuracy how long these species have called this place home. </p>
<p>Like other colonial sea birds, they tend to preferentially nest in places with few or no terrestrial predators. For the longest time small islands have been perfect for this; at least until humans began introducing new species. It is likely that albatrosses once nested throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, but this is no longer the case. Rats, cats, dogs, mongoose, and a range of other recently introduced species – alongside other forms of ongoing human disturbance – have now made most of these islands uninhabitable. (Although albatrosses can now also be found in small numbers on the island of Kauai, due in large part to the work of a few <a href="http://www.albatrosskauai.org/wp/" target="_blank">dedicated people</a>.)</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that recognisable albatross species have been winging their way across Earth’s oceans for at least the last nine million years. And so, millions of years before anything like the human species appeared on the scene, these birds were here. Reduced now to a few small pockets of land, they have continued their ancient way of life: moving between land, sea and sky, soaring effortlessly over vast distances each day, and on land courting, dancing and singing with each other to form the strong pair bonds necessary to successfully rear chicks.</p>
<div id="attachment_55" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 385px"><a href="http://thomvandooren.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/laysan.jpg"><img src="http://thomvandooren.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/laysan.jpg?w=590" alt="" title="laysan"   class="size-full wp-image-55" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Laysan Albatrosses &#8211; Midway Atoll<br />Photo Credit: David Patte/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</p></div>
<p>But this ancient way of life is now threatened in new ways. On multiple different fronts, from introduced species to <a href="http://www.birdlife.org/community/2011/06/longline-fisheries-continue-to-drive-albatross-declines/" target="_blank">long line fishing</a>, we are now undermining the possibility of the continuity of albatross generations – in short, we are pushing these species ever more closely towards the edge of extinction. </p>
<p>This is true even on Midway Atoll itself. Even here, on this piece of dry land that is about as far as it is possible to be from a continental landform and 1,200 miles from the nearest significant human population (in Hawaii), these birds are not safe. Even here, the toxins and detritus of human life are accumulating to do harm. </p>
<p>This is the part of the world’s oceans that has been called the North Pacific Garbage Patch by some. Others have called it ‘<a href="http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/the-seventh-continent-musings-on-the-plastic-garbage-project/" target="_blank">the seventh continent</a>’. Whatever you call it, it is a vast and shifting expanse of ocean in which the average concentration of rubbish is significantly higher than normal. Within this area, plastic and other debris from all over the Pacific (and perhaps further afield too) collects in various densities, shaped not only by the movements of large currents, but also by smaller-scale oceanographic features. </p>
<p>Adult birds in search of food for their young collect these plastic items – mistaking them for food, or because they are entangled with favourite food items (like fish egg clusters). From here, they are delivered into the hungry mouths of waiting chicks where they accumulate to cause starvation, dehydration, and generally undermine the health and wellbeing of growing bodies.</p>
<p>The mass death of albatross chicks is simply staggering. Vividly captured in numerous photographs by <a href="http://www.chrisjordan.com/" target="_blank">Chris Jordan</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_50" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 471px"><a href="http://thomvandooren.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/midwaycj.jpg"><img src="http://thomvandooren.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/midwaycj.jpg?w=590" alt="" title="Chris Jordan - Midway"   class="size-full wp-image-50" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris Jordan &#8211; Midway: Message from the Gyre<br />www.chrisjordan.com/gallery/midway</p></div>
<p>As the bodies of young birds pile up, these species are placed at even greater risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Less than one hundred years of human ‘ingenuity’ – in the forms of plastics discovered or commercialised in the early decades of the 20th century – circulating through rivers and vast oceanic currents, to accumulate in the living bodies of albatrosses and play their part in the undoing of millions of years of evolutionary achievement. </p>
<p>All over the world, plastic is becoming a growing problem for birds and wildlife more generally. At this stage, it seems that the albatrosses of Midway are amongst the hardest hit. Laysan albatrosses in particular may “have a greater incidence, a wider variety, and larger volume of ingested plastic than any other seabird”.*1</p>
<p>But it is clear that Midway’s albatrosses are just an extreme case, by no means a unique one. And as time goes by, both here and in all of the world’s other oceans, plastic concentrations just keep on climbing. How could they do otherwise; the stuff never disappears!</p>
<p>Instead, plastics just break down into smaller size pieces (eventually into &#8216;micro plastics&#8217;) that allows them to enter and accumulate in smaller and smaller bodies, so that they might gradually impact upon a larger and larger range of living beings. And so, with the exception of those plastics that have been incinerated – to contribute to other toxic legacies – all of the plastics ever produced are still around in one form or another, ensuring that countless future generations of albatrosses, humans and others, inherit a growing problem.</p>
<p>It was Chris Jordan’s photographs that first alerted me to the situation on Midway. I have now written a chapter on this entanglement of albatrosses and plastics for my <a href="http://thomvandooren.wordpress.com/avian-entanglements/" title="A book on ethics and extinction in a world of avian entanglements">new book</a>. The photos were first emailed to me in Australia by a friend in California. With the aid of the internet these images have circulated around the world. We need images like these. Images and stories that can travel far and fast: at least as fast as the plastics whose movements are powered by huge and relentless oceanic systems. We need stories that can reconnect people with the distant and ongoing impacts of their waste in a way that might make a difference for the future of generations of albatrosses and others.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I am very pleased to see that Chris Jordan and others are collaborating on a related <a href="http://www.midwayfilm.com/" target="_blank">film project</a> that looks to be both visually stunning and heartbreaking (still in production).</p>
<p><div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/25563376' width='650' height='349' frameborder='0'></iframe></div><br />
</br><br />
Of course, it is not just cigarette lighters, bottle caps and even ‘micro plastics&#8217; that accumulate in albatross bodies. At the same time, a range of persistent organic pollutants – DDTs, PBCs and others – are also making their way through rivers, atmospheric systems and oceans. It seems that these toxins are also accumulating in the fatty tissue of albatrosses to contribute to eggshell thinning and increased embryo mortality as a result of impacts upon neurological development, endocrine function and cell growth.*2 </p>
<p>The persistent organic pollutants of Midway don’t yet have their own photos or film (as far as I know?). They are certainly less visible – at least for now. But, these chemicals are the agent through which ‘we’ – a collective noun that some of us are far more present and complicit in than others – perpetrate an ongoing and sustained form of ‘<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674049307" target="_blank">slow violence</a>’ against many of the world’s living creatures.</p>
<p>And so, alongside the urgent need to do something about all this plastic, we need also to pay attention to these less visible circulating harms. </p>

<p>In the wake of Hurricane Sandy photographers <a href="http://instacane.com/">shared ten images every second</a> on Instagram, documenting the storm, testifying to the power of nature, and underscoring the internet’s <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/193479/instagram-users-are-posting-10-sandy-pics-every-second/">power to shape our collective imagination</a>.  The most ridiculous images following the storm, though, came from <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/brazilian-model-nana-gouvea-mocked-for-sexy-sandy-photo-shoot/story-fnd134gw-1226508373557?sv=b8eedd80af146d4b66391997bb20818b">Brazilian model Nana Gouvea</a>, who wandered about the hurricane-strewn landscape posing for clumsily seductive pictures alongside crushed cars, downed trees, and refuse-strewn streets, producing what <i><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/nana-gouvea-hurricane-sandy-photos_n_2059123.html">Huffington Post</a></i> dubbed genuine <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sirota/our-addiction-to-disaster_b_441745.html">“hurricane porn”</a> (she was immediately lampooned with <a href="http://nanagouveaemdesastres.tumblr.com/">a tumblr page</a> and a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/NanaGouveaEmDesastres">facebook page</a>).</p>
<p>While Gouvea parasitically stumbled about New York, a host of other photographers posted images that were not quite so voyeuristic, but they also were not utterly “authentic” representations of the storm.  The Tumblr page <a href="http://istwitterwrong.tumblr.com/">Is Twitter Wrong</a>? posted images of the storm that were clearly manipulated; <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/nystorm.asp">snopes</a> ridiculed several of the most obviously photoshopped images; <i><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/instasnopes-sorting-the-real-sandy-photos-from-the-fakes/264243/">The Atlantic</a></i> posted a series of images emblazoned “real,” “fake,” and “unverified”; <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/29/fake-hurricane-sandy-photos/">mashable</a> posted many of the same images; and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>’s Metropolis blog ran an article <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/29/caution-that-hurricane-sandy-photo-may-not-be-real/?mod=WSJ_article_outbrain&amp;obref=obinsite">“Caution: That Hurricane Sandy Photo May Not be Real”</a>.</p>

<p>This discourse over storm images illuminates how aesthetic representations shape our imaginations of complex if inexpressible realities like the experience of a natural disaster.  Much of this discussion is a journalism discourse about authenticity, a conversation on attribution that matters in news rooms where the press aspires to present something in which we can believe.  <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/regret-the-error/193470/how-journalists-can-avoid-getting-fooled-by-fake-hurricane-sandy-photos/">Craig Silverman</a>, for example, counsels his followers to verify all images before re-posting, re-tweeting, or otherwise sharing them socially.  This is good advice for a journalist, but much of what circulates online is more important for its power to simply evoke responses, and doctored images can induce us to humor, outrage, sympathy, or response.</p>
<div id="attachment_660" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/shark-fake-hurricane-sandy.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-660" title="shark-fake-hurricane-sandy" alt="" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/shark-fake-hurricane-sandy.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=225" height="225" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sharks did not really enter New Jersey as flood waters rose, but this is an amusing thought (image from snopes)</p></div>
<p>Authenticity may not be the most useful metaphor to understand these storm pictures in particular and aesthetic representation online in general.  That is, we increasingly live in an internet environment that is akin to walking down Main Street USA in Disneyland; Disneyland announces itself as a lie in which we willingly participate from the very outset, and most of us <i>expect</i> if not actually desire clever if not beautiful distortions and misrepresentations in such popular culture.  A discussion focused on the most conventional notion of “objective reality” risks being reduced to a simplistic polarization of authenticity and artificiality that does not capture how anybody with instagram, photoshop, or the most commonplace camera-phone shapes every picture they take.  Flickr and instagram are loaded with straightforward pictures of the storm and its aftermath, but they share space with a host of images that attempt to articulate inexpressible experiences by doctoring with images in small and dramatic ways alike.</p>
<div id="attachment_662" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hurricane_sandy_hits_news_york_by_paulmaszlik-d5jinkr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-662" title="hurricane_sandy_hits_news_york_by_paulmaszlik-d5jinkr" alt="" src="http://paulmullins.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hurricane_sandy_hits_news_york_by_paulmaszlik-d5jinkr.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" height="168" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If the hurricane was not sufficiently intimidating or impressive, this image renders it breathtaking (image from paul maszlik)</p></div>
<p>Pictures are compelling representations of the power of nature, so astounding funnel cloud images and turbulent flood waters appear in numerous pictures of natural disasters.  Even the best-timed images taken by gifted photographers fail to capture the concrete experience of uncertainty and powerlessness within a disaster, so photographers and artists aspire to produce visual representations that will evoke such an experience.  In the hands of the media that representation often has struck observers as parasitic: weather reporters find a place out on the boardwalk where they&#8217;ll be buffeted by winds and risk being swept away by breaking waves;  people emotionally gutted by the bad fortune that destroyed their homes are paraded in front of cameras unable to capture what they have lost; and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2012/10/30/the-strange-allure-of-disaster-porn/">intensive if not ceaseless media</a> coverage of meteorological disaster brings every possible apocalyptic threat to our doorstep.  Simply telling a compelling or amusing story is not always acceptable, because there is a genuine social impact to disaster narratives and their representation in the media.  In 2010 <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/david-sirota/our-addiction-to-disaster-porn.html">David Sirota</a> blasted media coverage of an earthquake that savaged Haiti, arguing that “Like any X-rated content, this smut is all flesh and no substantive plot. The lens flits between body parts and journalists pulling perverse Cronkite-in-Vietnam impressions …. But there is little discussion of how western Hispaniola was a man-made disaster before an earthquake made it a natural one…. The destitution is tragic — and a reflection, in part, of colonial domination.” This is when representation becomes voyeuristic and risks effacing human suffering or ignoring the state’s failure to respond to a genuine tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still very much freaked out by the pictures I see coming into our newsroom and on the Internet of the devastation Sandy has left in its wake and I am thanking God for sparing me. It&#8217;s hard to remain &#8220;stoic&#8221; during all of this when it&#8217;s in your own back yard.</p>
<div id="attachment_1842" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 413px"><a href="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cars.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1842" title="cars" alt="" src="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cars.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Avenue C &#8211; East Village, NYC<br />(courtesy of @jesseandgreg)</p></div>
<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep so well again last night. Went to bed with a splitting headache. I think I worked with a clenched jaw most of the day and night.</p>
<div id="attachment_1844" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/babies.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1844" title="babies" alt="" src="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/babies.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">20 newborn babies clinging to life in the neonatal intensive care unit survive, after being evacuated from an NYU hospital without power: http://cbsn.ws/SkMp1b</p></div>
<p>My coworkers are getting tired. The party-like atmosphere at work is rapidly changing as fatigue is setting in. Many have suffered damage to their property and have issues with transportation and child care. Our crews are stretched to the max, working very long hours. Those of us inside the Broadcast Center are being treated well, we have hot meals and the camaraderie of each other. The crews out in the field are working under lesser conditions in devastated areas but they&#8217;re hanging in and doing great work for us.</p>
<p>I talked to my uncle Tim tonight and learned he and his family are hanging in there, out in Rockaway Beach. I tried all day yesterday to get through to him. Cellular service in the region is spotty as many of the cell towers were either taken out by Sandy or are working on generator power.</p>
<p>When I called Tim, I left a message only to learn later he&#8217;s out of battery power.  When I called Ivy, I was given the message that &#8220;circuits are overloaded, please try again later.&#8221; I waited to hear from Tim and he did call me to let me know the family is intact, there&#8217;s no heat or electricity, but that they have gas for cooking and running water. I worry about them because the forecast calls for temps tonight in the 30s and 40s. But they&#8217;re stuck because the bridges into and out of Rockaway are closed and the trains are not running. Tim assures me they are okay and hanging in. I&#8217;ve updated his Facebook page because a lot of people are worried.</p>
<div id="attachment_1843" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rock.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1843" title="rock" alt="" src="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rock.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What&#8217;s left of Rockaway Beach<br />(Photo by Yug Sriven)</p></div>
<p>I wonder about my friend, photographer <a href="http://www.behance.net/joelgraham/resume">Joel Graham</a>, who nobody&#8217;s heard from since before the storm. He&#8217;s an excellent photographer and I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;s out snapping pictures. He lives on Staten Island and is likely without electricity. But it&#8217;s worrisome not to know how he&#8217;s doing, especially since he&#8217;s sort of a &#8220;McGyver&#8221; photographer &#8212; if you google some of his work you&#8217;ll know why I call him this.</p>
<p>I feel as if I&#8217;m living &#8220;A Tale of Two Cities.&#8221; On the one hand, there are parts of Manhattan, like where I live in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, where you&#8217;d never know anything ever happened. Then just blocks south it&#8217;s as if the Apocalypse struck. It&#8217;s a heartbreaking juxtaposition and hard for one to put their arms around.</p>
<div id="attachment_1845" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/darknyc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1845" title="darknyc" alt="" src="http://nycnewsproducer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/darknyc.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Halloween 2012 in New York City: total darkness below 34th Street. Park Avenue South, Manhattan.</p></div>
<p>Part of my job at work today was just finding out stuff to help out my coworkers. I learned where some showers are in the building; I let them know. I was keeping an eye out for the commuters, letting them know any info I could regarding getting into work, then back home, besides producing generic live shots with Vinita Nair in lower Manhattan and Wendy Gillette in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching news coverage as much as I can, absolutely fascinated and awed by what I&#8217;m seeing. The magnitude of the devastation. The magnificent coverage. And again, I know I am one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t forget that for a minute.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you were in New Orleans for this major storm and in New York for the previous major storm,&#8221; my mother said over the phone.</p>
<p>I understood her as a mother understands wanting to protect her child, certainly. As a granddaughter, niece, and friend of many who suffered and are still suffering the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, however, I felt as though my hands were tied.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve felt impotent all through my monitoring of the struggles with public transportation our friends in the Queens neighborhood that was home to us for four years before we moved back to New Orleans have been having. I&#8217;ve felt helpless in the face of <a href="http://storify.com/PrinceofRazors/tent-1">far too many</a> pictures of the worst hit of the five boroughs, pictures reminiscent of too many neighborhoods across this city that are still recovering over seven years after the levee breaches. And I felt especially sad and angry upon finally getting through to my grandparents in Valley Stream, on their sixth day without power, starting to lose hope.</p>
<p>My grandmother, in our conversation, had never seen anything like what she was seeing in her eighty-plus years as a native New Yorker. Her house and one of the cars she and my grandfather owned were intact, but chilly. A neighbor had a generator and had offered to let them use it for a time, but they didn&#8217;t want to impose &#8211; gasoline is getting scarce. My aunt has power at her Manhattan apartment, but getting there by car or by the Long Island Rail Road is proving to be a difficult thing to even think about, much less embark upon. I had managed to talk to her when she was in the car on the way to her synagogue, which had heat and was serving hot coffee.</p>
<p>I cried out of relief at having been able to talk to her, and out of not being able to hug her through the phone. So many of the things she and my grandpa took for granted had been taken away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I keep checking <a href="http://www.lipower.org/stormcenter/outagemap.html">a site that shows the progress of the energy companies on Long Island</a>,&#8221; my mother said when I discussed it with her, &#8220;and part of the problem is they just don&#8217;t have enough people to get everything back on quickly. It also seems the power&#8217;s coming back on to the places with the most money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh, none of <em>that</em> <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/11/6538939/sensing-divide-lower-east-side-people-who-stayed-are-not-well">sounds familiar</a>,&#8221; I said sarcastically.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all far too familiar &#8211; <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/11/6538990/council-aide-far-rockaway-new-yorks-9th-ward">coastal areas being washed away or otherwise destroyed</a> &#8211; and not quite &#8211; debates over whether or not major events held when the weather is not as freaky &#8211; like <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinBrannan/status/264583670910820352/photo/1/large">voting</a> or a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/sports/new-york-city-marathon-will-not-be-held-sunday.html?smid=tw-nytmetro">marathon</a> &#8211; should go on as always. (<em>For the record, it was absolutely the right move to cancel the NYC Marathon this year. I have little doubt if a serious weather event happens close to Mardi Gras that the krewe captains would band together and cancel the parades.</em>) The &#8220;not quite&#8221; is what has me walking away from the computer from time to time, not wanting to impose on the shock of so many others. I have so much sympathy for the northeast and fear for what more is to come in their recovery. My projections upon them have no place whatsoever right now, except in one crucial way&#8230;</p>
<p>No matter who or where they are, Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s victims need help.</p>
<p>Now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was a good day.</p>
<p>We are 5 days past hurricane Sandy, and we&#8217;re still in the dark. No lights. No heat. A bit nippy at night, especially tonight, going down into the 30&#8242;s. I&#8217;m sitting here by the fire, writing this on my ipad, wearing a down vest, down coat, ugg boots, and a scarf pulled over my head. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the storm, we had no idea how bad it was. No one did, initially. We were glad to be safe, our house intact. We lost power as soon as the storm hit, so we were in the dark- no news. Cell phone service was limited- we couldn&#8217;t access the internet or even make calls, only texts, and with very slow delivery at that. Stranded at home, since all transportation to NYC was suspended, I felt news-deprived and isolated. My husband was able to get to work on tuesday- driving up and across the lawn to get around the fallen tree that blocked the driveway, taking detour after detour as he encountered tree littered roads, downed power lines, and debris. His reports were all the news I had for two days- and it was shocking. The shore- devastated. A massive water surge- flooding Staten Island, lower manhattan, subway tunnels and hoboken. A entire neighborhood in Queens, burned to the ground. </p>
<p>It was shocking to see our always strong, impervious manhattan vulnerable.</p>
<p>It was heartbreaking to start hearing some personal accounts: the woman who decided, too late, that she should evacuate with her children, the car stalling as it hit water, then getting out of the car and losing her grip on the children as the massive storm surge came. The woman on Montauk, who took her dog for a walk and never came home. They found her body the next day. My mailman, who reported seeing bodies floating the day after in Union Beach- just a few miles from here, a town that&#8217;s right on the water on the bay side. All so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>And then there are good stories. The off-duty fireman who evacuated late and heard the cries of a stranded family- who went back to help the entire family, the dog, and parakeet to safety. The people who donated their much needed batteries and gas to keep generators going so that the fish and animals at Jenkinsin&#8217;s  aquarium could survive. A friend&#8217;s neighbor, who has been driving every night to Pennsylvania, to get gas for his entire neighborhood- coming back and distributing up to 25 gallons a day to neighbors for cars and generators. A neighbor offering a neighbor access to a generator. So many people helping each other out. </p>
<p>On day 3, we started seeing the images on our ipad and tablet. Boats piled up like tinker toys. Entire complexes of houses, thrown off their foundations and tilted or flattened- or moved altogether. Houses incongruously landed on roadways and bridges. And still, in the dark, we started seeing the full force of destruction Sandy had wreaked upon the NY/NJ area. </p>
<p>Something like 93% of NJ homes and businesses lost power with this storm. I started seeing the local impact when I tried to go out for gas. There wasn&#8217;t any. Stations that were listed as having some were sold out, almost instantly, because there were no deliveries coming in, and most stations couldn&#8217;t pump the gas they had, because they had no power. One station would fill only cans- no cars, and people were lined up for blocks to get a gallon of gas. There were no traffic lights. Crossing highway 35 to get to a gas station was a frightening experience- a 50 mph, 4 lane road. No police anywhere. The few convenience stores that opened were dark and took cash only. It was like nothing I&#8217;d ever experienced before.</p>
<p>Also on day 3, people started getting in to my offices. Transportation was limited. The subways were mostly closed, tunnels flooded. Two employees walked across the 59th street bridge to get to the city; another employee living in flooded battery park, walked down the 8 flights of stairs in the dark, before wading through water in the basement to get his bike and ride to work.<br />
Hardly anyone came in. There were no trains or busses from NJ or Westchester.</p>
<p>On day 4, a friend texted that busses were running, so I ventured to work for the first time. I was struck by the luxury of getting on a heated bus, after being cold for 3 days. I was relieved to see Times Square and midtown looking normal. It was reassuring to see signs of normalcy- lights and tourists, and open stores. At home, it was all still dark. No stores open. No gas. No ice. </p>
<p>The Jersey shore was completely devastated. Countless beaches, homes and entire towns were destroyed by this massive storm. And so many lives lost. </p>
<p>So, sitting here in the dark, by the fire, with my down coat and scarf and dwindling battery on my iPad, I feel lucky. My family is safe and my home intact. Sitting in the dark just isn&#8217;t so bad, in the context of all that&#8217;s happened. So it&#8217;s a good day. A very good day, indeed.</p>
