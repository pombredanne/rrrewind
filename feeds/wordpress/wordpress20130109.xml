<p><em>In an effort to raise awareness about water conservation among visitors to the Land of Enchantment, the <a href="http://www.santafewatershed.org/" target="_blank">Santa Fe Watershed Association</a> and <a href="http://hospitalitygreen.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">HospitalityGreen</a> have asked me to pen a series of essays about my experiences living off rainwater in the New Mexican desert. Here is my first of four essays, the Weight of Water:</em></p>
<p>Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. If that doesnât sound heavy, youâve never been hiking in the desert with a dayâs worth of drink on your back. I grew up in the <a title="A Jackpot Day at McAfeeÂ Knob" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/11/01/a-jackpot-day-at-mcafee-knob/" target="_blank">Appalachian Mountains</a>, but I didnât learn the weight of water until I moved to New Mexico, where water is rare and precious and worth its considerable weight in blue gold.</p>
<p>In New Mexico, I lived off the map, <a title="Professional housesitter, at yourÂ serviceâ¦" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2011/06/23/professional-housesitter-at-your-service/" target="_blank">caretaking</a> a place in the wide open deserts just south of Santa Fe. This place was more than a house. It was an <a title="AnotherÂ Earthship" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2011/09/14/another-earthship/" target="_blank">Earthship: an off-grid passive solar adobe,</a> adrift on acres of land. The house wasnât connected to the outside world by wires or pipes, only a long dirt road. My power and my water both came from the sky and if I wanted to run out for milk, it was a two-hour round trip into town.</p>
<div id="attachment_7465" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p4243543.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7465" alt="The Road to Town. Santa Fe is hiding behind the Cerrillos Hills. " src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p4243543.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390" width="520" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Road to Town. Santa Fe is hiding behind the Cerrillos Hills.</p></div>
<p>The Earthship was an isolated place, but it afforded rare freedoms. Out there, I could hike in any direction to the horizon, <a title="Galisteo LoveÂ Letter" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/02/15/galisteo-love-letter/" target="_blank">down endless paths across open country</a>. Between the trails, the place was wild, undulating madly in plunging arroyos and tilted sandstone. <a title="Hiking WithÂ Dogs" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/01/12/hiking-with-dogs/" target="_blank">On foot, my favorite way to travel, it was a tremendous, uncharted place.</a></p>
<div id="attachment_7483" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/freckles-panorama.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7483" alt="The Blonde Coyote overlooking our Big Backyard" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/freckles-panorama.jpeg?w=520&#038;h=269" width="520" height="269" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Blonde Coyote overlooking our Big Backyard</p></div>
<p>As well as I came to know the landscape around me â its contours and secrets â so I came to know myself: I knew exactly how much electricity I burned in a day, how much water I let drain in a shower, how quickly I went through a bag of beans, how long I could go before I pined for town, for Santa Feâs bright colors, its rush of voices, the thrill of a menu, a taste of the outside world. Often, weeks would pass without wanting to be anywhere but out there in all that free open space.</p>
<div id="attachment_7462" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p2098058.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7462" alt="The Blonde Coyote &amp; Bowie with the Coyote Skull" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p2098058.jpg?w=520&#038;h=389" width="520" height="389" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Desert Treasure: The Blonde Coyote &amp; Bowie with the coyote skull I found wedged in a dead juniper tree.</p></div>
<p>Living in such a wild, remote place has its challenges, the greatest of which was the lack of free-flowing water. The Earthship had no water source â no water lines, no well â other than the sky. The buildingâs metal roof could collect hundreds of gallons of water during a good rain, the water gushing noisily through the gutters into two 1500-gallon water cisterns buried beneath the house.</p>
<div id="attachment_7486" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/pc034371.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7486" alt="Rare Cerrillos Snow" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/pc034371.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390" width="520" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rare Cerrillos Snow</p></div>
<p>Of course it doesnât rain much in New Mexico, on average less than twelve inches per year,Â <a title="FlashÂ Flood!" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2011/08/20/flash-flood/" target="_blank">mostly in late summer</a>Â (this year, so far, has loosed less than six). During dry spells I called Joe, a Navajo with a big red truck that dragged an old wheeled water tank. Joe charged $40, cash, for 400 gallons of water, delivered. I mostly used the cistern water for the Earthshipâs sinks and shower â the grey water that flowed down the drains went out to water the plants and to fill the toilet â and bought drinking water in 5-gallon reusable jugs. On average, I used around 50 gallons of water a week. The average American household drains more than 350 gallons of water a day.</p>
<div id="attachment_7463" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p4193312.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7463" alt="The Earthship's solar array and rainwater catchment roof." src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/p4193312.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390" width="520" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Earthship&#8217;s solar array and rainwater catchment roof.</p></div>
<p>On three occasions, twice my first winter and once last year, I turned on the tap and nothing came out. That was when I learned the true weight of water. When nothing comes out of the tap but a desperate gurgling noise, the weight of water is crushing. Suddenly, four walls, a roof, and plenty of food all mean nothing. Without water, you have no home. In the desert, without water, you have nothing.</p>
<div id="attachment_7389" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/backyardcliffs_mcmorton.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7389" alt="My backyard cliffs" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/backyardcliffs_mcmorton.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390" width="520" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My Backyard Cliffs, facing the Jemez Mountains</p></div>
<p>Visitors to Santa Fe seldom know the weight of water, but theyâll soon memorize those ubiquitous signs above every sink in the city:Â <em>Water is a finite resource, please conserve</em>.</p>
<p>What effect the signs have on people, as they stand at the sink, washing their hands, brushing their teeth, I donât know. What effect they have once people go home, to places richer in water than New Mexico, is even less certain. I know when I stand at a sink where the water flows free, I am thankful for every drop. Perhaps every now and then, taps in Santa Fe should run dry with an empty, ominous gurgle. Then perhaps more people would feel, know and remember the true weight of water.</p>
<p>I have been away from the Earthshipâs extreme asceticism for nearly nine months now, <a title="Appalachian Trail: First Signs ofÂ Fall" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/09/30/appalachian-trail-first-signs-of-fall/" target="_blank">enjoying a winter back east, closer to my roots</a>. But even here, the sound of rain on the roof in the middle of the night is enough to jolt me out of a deep sleep, anxious to check the gutters on the (now nonexistent) rainwater collection system. Every time I turn on the tap and water flows freely, I think of the desert and the awful, crushing desperation of running out. I hope I will feel the weight of water for the rest of my life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of Grimm&#8217;s fairytales begin with three sisters or three brothers who have a critical task to perform. Â Invariably, the youngest succeeds. Â  Â In her introduction to a story called &#8220;The Golden Bird,&#8221; Maria Tatar, editor of the recently published bicentennial collection says:Â <em>&#8220;If the female protagonists of fairy tales are often as good as they are beautiful, their male counterparts often appear to be as young and naive as they are stupid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrgaTaPWcypojTmFdpLvmpwlsk4l-hSfGafQmfV8pQF21rhs6gXw"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrgaTaPWcypojTmFdpLvmpwlsk4l-hSfGafQmfV8pQF21rhs6gXw" width="225" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Golden Bird&#8221; illustrates the point. Â The youngest son is so hopeless that even his animal guide, a fox, grows frustrated, yet in the end, the boy wins &#8220;complete happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all youngest sons are so dense, and sometimes the stories have great depth, like &#8220;The Water of Life,&#8221; which I discussed here last March (<a title="The Water of Life" href="http://wp.me/pYql4-1OC" target="_blank">http://wp.me/pYql4-1OC</a> and <a title="The Water of Life, Part 2" href="http://wp.me/pYql4-1Pm" target="_blank">http://wp.me/pYql4-1Pm</a>).</p>
<p>According to Marie-Louise von Franz, Carl Jung&#8217;s closest colleague and author of five books on fairytales, the Brothers Grimm published Â 50-60 stories of dumb youngest sons. Â Von Franz thought these stories were so important, individually and culturally, that she started her first book on folklore, <em>The Interpretation of Fairytales</em> 1970, with a detailed study of one Dummling tale, &#8220;The Three Feathers.&#8221; Â The story is one of the better known Grimm stories, present in the new annotated edition as well. Â What follows is a brief synopsis. Â The tale isn&#8217;t long and those who wish can read it on Project Gutenberg: <a title="Dummling and the Three Feathers" href="http://www.reelreality.com/fairy_tales/grimms_fairy_stories/index.html#dummling" target="_blank">http://www.reelreality.com/fairy_tales/grimms_fairy_stories/index.html#dummling</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">*** Synopsis of The Three Feathers ***</p>
<p>Once an aging king had three sons. Two were clever, but the third didn&#8217;t say much and was considered dim-witted. Â People called him Dummling [or "Dummy" depending on the translation]. Â The king decided to test the boys to determine who should rule his kingdom when he was gone. Â  He told them whoever returned with the most beautiful carpet would inherit the kingdom. Â Then he took them outside, blew three feathers into the air and told his sons the feathers would determine which way they should go.</p>
<p>One son&#8217;s feather flew east and another&#8217;s west, but Dummling&#8217;s feather flew straight ahead a few paces and fell to the ground. Â The other brothers laughed and set out, but Dummling just sat down by the feather and waited. Â Eventually he noticed a trapdoor nearby. Â It opened onto a staircase descending into the earth. Â The boy followed the stairs down to another door on which he knocked. Â From inside a voice called:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;">&#8220;Maiden, fairest, come to me,</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;">Make haste to ope the door,</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;">A mortal surely you will see,</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;">From the world above is he,</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:small;">We&#8217;ll help him from our store.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Inside was a fat toad, surrounded by many smaller toads. Â The boy said he needed the world&#8217;s most beautiful carpet. Â The toad called out to the younger ones to &#8220;bring the box for the boy at the door.&#8221; Â Inside was a beautiful carpet. Â Dummling carried it home, his father was astonished, and declared that he should be the next king.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 315px"><img alt="" src="http://www.reelreality.com/fairy_tales/grimms_fairy_stories/images/046.png" width="305" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;The Three Feathers&#8221; from the Project Gutenberg ebook edition of Grimm&#8217;s fairytales.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">The two other brothers, who had simply bought pieces of linen from the first peasant women they met on the road, protested so loudly that the king decreed another test. Â He sent his sons out to find the most beautiful ring. Â Again one feather blew east, another west, and Dummling&#8217;s by the trapdoor. Â The fat frog called for a box in which the boy found a beautiful gold ring. Â The brothers brought rings they had made from Â nails they had taken from cart wheels.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Again the king declared Dummling the winner, and again the older brothers protested. Â The king&#8217;s third test was to bring home the most beautiful wife. Â Dummling won a toad bride who became a beautiful human woman after he took her home. Â The brothers, who had married the first peasant women they met, complained again so the king ordered a fourth test. Â The brides were ordered to jump through a hoop suspended in air. Â Naturally, Dummling&#8217;s wife, who had been a toad, easily won. Â Dummling received the crown and he ruled &#8220;with great wisdom&#8221; for many years.</p>
<div id="attachment_10701" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 297px"><a href="http://morganmussell.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/492406.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10701" alt="Jumping through the hoop by Arthur Rackham" src="http://morganmussell.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/492406.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jumping through the hoop by Arthur Rackham</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>In <em>The Interpretation of Fairytales</em>, Marie-Louise von Franz devoted three chapters to an in depth analysis of this tale. Â She believed Dummling stories reflect the situation of individuals, cultures, and institutions that get stuck when certain rigid patterns and ideas cut them off from sources of renewal.</p>
<p>The first thing she notes is that <em>all</em> the Dummling tales begin with a father and three sons but no wife or sisters. Â The feminine element is missing and regardless of what he sets out to do, the most important achievement of the younger son will be to bring home a bride. Â In abstract terms, that is bringing Eros into a situation overweighted with Logos. Â Von Franz cites cultural examples like the importance of the cult of the Virgin Mary in the medieval Catholic church. Â She also says that third-son stories:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;compensate the conscious attitude of a society in which patriarchal schemes and oughts and shoulds dominate. Â It is ruled by rigid principles because of which the irrational, spontaneous adaptation to events is lost. Â It is typical that Dummling stories are statistically more frequent in the white man&#8217;s society than in others, and it is obvious why that is so.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Once you start thinking along these lines, many characters spring to mind from history as well as the arts. Â Saint Francis, who called himself &#8220;God&#8217;s Fool,&#8221; brought flexibility and Eros to the medieval church. Â A classic movie example from recent times is Â <em>Forest Gump</em> 1994. Â Tom Hanks&#8217; Dummling character succeeded where the smart people failed. Â Gump, who lived in the moment and was close to his emotions, reacted to things as they happened rather than to his own fixed ideas. Â Remember the movie&#8217;s opening shot of a feather? Â If nothing else, that convinces me that <em>Forest Gump&#8217;s</em> creators knew the Dummling stories in detail.</p>
<div id="attachment_10752" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 221px"><a href="http://morganmussell.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/forest-gump.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10752" alt="Tom Hanks as a modern Dummling" src="http://morganmussell.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/forest-gump.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tom Hanks as a modern Dummling</p></div>
<p>Von Franz amplifies the detail of the feather, saying it was a common medieval practice in many countries. Â <em>&#8220;If someone did not know where to go, if they were lost at a crossroads or had no special plan, he would take a feather, blow on it and walk in which ever direction the wind took it. Â That was a very common kind of oracle by which you could be guided.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t as apparent in this Dummling tale as it is many others that the older brothers are modern A-types. Â They don&#8217;t have time to fuss with insignificant creatures like frogs, or dwarves, or old ladies, or any of those helpful beings who guide the youngest brothers on their way. Â Youngest brothers have time to listen because their calendars are clear. Â They sit by their feathers or walk through the forest, paying attention and waiting for new ideas to arrive.</p>
<p>Von Franz used the feather analogy in discussing her method of therapy. Â She said when her patients were stuck, she would listen to their dreams to see which way the winds of the psyche were blowing. Â When I studied psychology, one of my teachers spoke in the same vein, of the importance of listening to the little impulse, the small thoughts that are easy to ignore, like &#8220;Oh, that looks interesting,&#8221; or &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to take a few hours off for a walk beside the river?&#8221; Â Smart older brothers, working on their MBA&#8217;s, don&#8217;t have time for things like that, which is how they get into therapy in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that when he was president, Harry Truman once said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to try X, and if that doesn&#8217;t work, we&#8217;ll try something else.&#8221; Â Our government might not be so stuck if politicians dared to admit that sometimes they don&#8217;t know the answers and need to see which way their feathers blow.</p>
<p>Sometimes being &#8220;smart&#8221; is a greater hindrance than being &#8220;dumb,&#8221; for the key thing is to be teachable.</p>
<p>I came upon the Dummling stories years ago, and they often come to mind when things are stuck in my own life or in what I observe around me. Â &#8221;When you don&#8217;t know what to do, do nothing,&#8221; is a common and useful bit of advice. Â I sometimes restate it and say, &#8220;When you don&#8217;t know what to do, sit by your feather and pay attention.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hockey&#8217;s back. I&#8217;m Canadian and I&#8217;m supposed to be thrilled, but I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I don&#8217;t care either way. I gave up on hockey a long time ago. Rewind fifteen years and you&#8217;d find an avid fan who could rattle off stats, would watch any match-up and vowed to get a <a title="Dallas Stars" href="http://stars.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Stars</a> tattoo should they ever win the Stanley Cup. (Thank GOD I didn&#8217;t follow through on that!) I lived through the glowing puck debacle, but had to draw the line when the point for an overtime loss made the sport sound more like elementary school sports day than a professional men&#8217;s league.</p>
<p>When the strike/lockout/whateveryouwanttocallit started, it was bittersweet for me. On the plus side, no hockey in my house. At the same time, with the drama heightened, hockey was all I heard about at work, with family, on the news, Facebook, Twitter, it seemed endless. At each of what felt like a million points when some spin doctor would reignite the furor by &#8220;leaking&#8221; an ebb or flow in the agreement tide, the shock and indignation was reignited and so was the discussion. Snooze.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://carlyrigby.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1704" alt="photo (1)" src="http://carlyrigby.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/photo-11.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a>Toronto Marlies at Abbotsford Heat</p>
<p>Then this morning, we awoke in our hotel room, still high on <a title="NLL Opening Night" href="http://www.nll.com/news_article/show/208147?referrer_id=389123" target="_blank">the start of the NLL season last night</a> and from different rooms seemed to simultaneously stumble upon the news that an agreement had been reached between the NHL players and the owners. I could see the excitement on Kevin&#8217;s face as he rushed into the room to tell me and he barely hesitated to proudly cap his head with his current favourite Maple Leafs hat. He loves hockey and, for him, I was happy.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was outraged. At his relief, at the enthusiastic tweets, at the short memory of fans everywhere.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/eRYvUUV20TU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It was about a month ago when I realized that the emotion surrounding the labour agreement or lack thereof ran a lot deeper than I&#8217;d expected. I don&#8217;t remember the events that led up to it, but the strike hit a critical point when fans&#8217; frustrations were heightened and there was plenty of talk about fighting back. The nature of the strike/lockout talk turned angry, but made transparent that it was fuelled, in fact, by hurt feelings. I felt like I&#8217;d been really insensitive by brushing it off as no big deal since a lot of people around me were taking the incident very personally. It wasn&#8217;t just a part of history being witnessed, it was something being done <strong>to</strong> them. Just listen to the words used in that <em><strong></strong></em><a title="Just Drop It" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Drop-It/480181678699361" target="_blank">Just Drop It</a>Â video, above. &#8220;You lock me out, I&#8217;m locking you out.&#8221; &#8220;For every game you take from me, I&#8217;ll take one from you.&#8221; &#8220;If we lose ten games then they&#8217;ll loseÂ theÂ first ten game when they return.&#8221; <em>That&#8217;s</em> personal.</p>
<p>With that awareness, I didn&#8217;t welcome today&#8217;s news with open arms. A lot of people had been affected by what happened (just ask <a href="http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/florida-panthers-lay-off-mascot-lockout-just-got-203238047--nhl.html">Stanley C. Panther</a>) but they seemed to have instantly forgotten all the anguish they&#8217;d been through. What was with the buzz of anticipation and elation?!? What happened to the outrage? Where was the indignation? What happened to the vows of pro-hockey celibacy?</p>
<p>I get it. You can&#8217;t stay upset forever, life has to go on. But, for those spoiled athletes and owners to reveal that they&#8217;d haggled over, among other things, the right for <em>millionaires</em> to be treated to private rooms when on the road? And for the people who spent months feeling genuinely deprived by suffering the loss of their favourite form of entertainment to just turn around and embrace the NHL? Well, this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time it could be said I&#8217;m too sensitive to watch (or work in!) sports.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy for me to take this stance. As I mentioned, I don&#8217;t really care. I could have lived without this season. In fact, I selfishly wanted it to be settled a long time ago just so everyone would finally quit talking about it. I won&#8217;t vow never to attend another game because I probably will. However, I&#8217;ll certainly think twice about how I spend my money in the future &#8211; this means tickets AND merchandise. Sure, I wasn&#8217;t hurt by this dispute, but I&#8217;m not so forgiving knowing people I love were.</p>

<p>The photos I&#8217;ve posted were taken at two games we attended during the lockout. Let them be your reminder that there is other hockey going on in your community, that it&#8217;s played by people who love playing the game and by guys who are still grinding for a chance at the spotlight instead of just a portion of profit-sharing. If you&#8217;re in the Lower Mainland, check out the <a title="Vancouver Giants" href="http://www.vancouvergiants.com/" target="_blank">Vancouver Giants</a>, a major junior hockey team that is a part of the Western Hockey League or head out to the Valley to see the <a title="Abbotsford Heat" href="http://www.abbotsfordheat.com/" target="_blank">Abbotsford Heat</a>, an American Hockey League club that serves as the farm team for the NHL&#8217;s Calgary Flames. Both organizations offer AFFORDABLE tickets starting at around $20 each, are housed in great venues (the Giants in the Pacific Coliseum if you&#8217;re feeling nostalgic) and offer the full arena hockey experience. Or take a walk over to your local barn. There are plenty of hopefuls of all ages who are more interested in working than in listing demands.</p>
<p>Better yet, watch <a title="NLL" href="http://www.nll.com/" target="_blank">lacrosse</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_545" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-545" alt="Downton Abbey Women, Clothes, Jewelry" src="http://bluestockingsmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/downton-abbey-women-clothes-jewelry.png?w=300&#038;h=197" width="300" height="197" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Edith, Sybil, and Mary Crawley from Downton Abbey</p></div>
<p>As the new <i>Mad Men </i>season aired last spring, <i>Grantland</i> writer Mark Lisanti wrote &#8220;Power Rankings&#8221; for each weekly episode, ranking the top ten most powerful characters that really held their own, characters that had the nerve do something bold and unprecedented. I set out to do the same with America&#8217;s new favorite period piece television obsession <i>Downton Abbey</i>, a Masterpiece Theater series created by Julian Fellowes. The series depicts the lives of the British aristocratic Crawley family and their servants at their country estate, Downton Abbey. Seasons one and two are set between April 1912 and December 1919, during which great world events shape the lives of the people at Downton and the British social hierarchy in general. These events include the sinking of the Titanic, WWI and the Spanish influenza epidemic.</p>
<p>The series begins with Lord Robert Crawley, head of the Downton estate, receiving news of the death of his heir aboard the Titanic. Lord Crawley sees the preservation of the Downton estate as his mission in life<b>, </b>and feels strongly about the necessity to marry off one of his daughters to the heir of Downton in order to maintain the estate&#8217;s line of heritage. In turn, he bringS a distant cousin, Matthew Crawley, to the estate to act as his new heir. Matthew and his mother, Isobel, are very progressive and socially engaged, and clash at first with Lady Mary Crawley, eldest daughter of Lord Crawley, and the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley, Lord Crawley&#8217;s mother. Meanwhile, the staff members of Downton have intriguing storylines amongst themselves, storylines of dedication, heartbreak, and inner strength, even as they lead most of their entire lives within Downtonâs servants quarters.</p>
<p>Only a total of seventeen episodes in, this television import from the UK has captured the undivided attention of over fourteen million Americansâbut why? Is it because everyone loves watching the Earl of Grantham stomp around the estate in his old military uniform? Probably not. How about watching Carson the Butler all puffed up in a rage, spurting out ridiculous phrases like &#8220;hobbledehoy?&#8221; Definitely not. It&#8217;s really all about the women when it comes to <i>Downton Abbey.</i></p>
<p>The ladies of <i>Downton Abbey </i>are the backbone and the soul of the show, and when it comes down to it, they are the ones who hold all the cards. In a time where most period piece television shows revolve around males (think <i>Mad Men</i>, <i>Boardwalk Empire</i>, <i>Vegas</i>) or if there are female storylines, they&#8217;re always dependent upon the storylines of their male counterparts. No period television drama currently on the air really explores female issues of the time, other than as a secondary or tertiary storyline. Even though <i>Downton Abbey</i> is an ensemble show, it does a fantastic job of showing the nuances of womanhood in post-Edwardian British society, from many generational and socioeconomic viewpoints. If there&#8217;s any women&#8217;s issue taken up in an episode, such as employment for an aristocratic woman or the women&#8217;s vote, you&#8217;ll see the it from all sides, from the perspective of an elderly countess to the perspective of a teenage kitchen maid. Moreover, even issues that aren&#8217;t as gendered as &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; issues, such as the First World War, the changing significance of the aristocracy in British society or adapting to new inventions like the telephone or increasingly modern automobile models, you can bet that elderly countess, that teenage kitchen maid, and every female in-between will have something distinct and poignant to say about it, something that will resonate with you even after the episode&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>So, here it is, the Top Ten Key Female Players on the Downton estate:</p>
<p>1) <b>The Right Honorable Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham (<i>played by Maggie Smith</i></b>)</p>
<p>If you have ever watched even a single episode of <i>Downton Abbey</i>, you know that Violet is the head bitch in charge. The Dowager Countess is always a step ahead of everyone else. Nothing gets by without her knowledge of it, and she has the final word on every decision that is made in the Downton Abbey village and estateâand with good reason! No matter what the moment is, she&#8217;s always got the perfect retort:</p>
<p>-Exhibit A: <i>(on Mr. Pamuk, the Turkish visitor to Downton Abbey, and his sudden death at Downton) </i>&#8220;Of course it would happen to a foreigner.Â  It&#8217;s typicalâ¦No Englishman would dream of dying in someone else&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Exhibit B: <i>(on Lady Edith lamenting her probable future as a spinster) </i>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be defeatist, dear. It&#8217;s very middle-class.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Exhibit C: <i>(on dealing with the blackmailing Sir Richard Carlisle) </i>&#8220;We can&#8217;t have him assassinated, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there you have itâthe head bitch in charge.</p>
<p>2) <b>Lady Sybil Crawley/Branson <i>(played by Jessica Brown Findlay)</i></b></p>
<p>Between her one-piece silk and tulle genie-like dinner party outfit, her desire to work as a nurse, and running off with the socialist Irish chauffeur, Lady Sybil is always challenging the norm. She is not someone who wants to split her time between social engagements and sitting around an estate all day; instead she would rather have a long, frustrating day in a hospital, probably followed by heading to the pub to grab a pint with her co-workers. She is definitively marching to the beat of her own drum, but what is even greater about Lady Sybil is that she wants everyone else to do the sameâthere&#8217;s no criticism of her sister, Lady Mary, who wants her whole life to revolve around Downton Abbey (more on her shortly), nor of someone like Carson the Butler, who lives and breathes to serve the Crawley family in the most traditional fashion. Lady Sybil is, unashamedly, pro-choice (which may or may not come into conflict with her new Irish Roman Catholic husband, whom she marries at the end of season two. To be determinedâ¦).</p>
<p><b>3) Lady Mary Crawley <i>(played by Michelle Dockery)</i></b></p>
<p>Ah, the ever so practical Lady Mary. She is without a doubt the product of her grandmother Violetâeverything has to play out in a business-like manner. Lady Mary has no time to worry about others&#8217; feelings, much less others&#8217; problems of the heartâunless of course, they&#8217;re her own (oh, to love your third cousin, Matthew Crawley!) But Lady Mary is quite virtuous in her loyalty, to Downton Abbey, to her family, and most importantly, to herself. As Sir Richard Carlisle, a newspaper man, tries to blackmail Mary into marrying him by threatening to release information about her out-of-marriage sexual trysts with the Turkish visitor to Downton, Mr. Pamuk, she ultimately decides that it is better to live with a scandalized name than marry a man that already does and will continue to treat her without dignity and without respect. This is something huge for a woman of that time with her status, given the standards for women in the 1910s (no sex before marriage, especially with a foreigner!) and especially the standards for aristocratic women, who were the celebrities of Britain at the time. When it comes down to it, Lady Mary is a principled woman, and nothing can sway her from the rules of life she has set out for herself.</p>
<p><b>4) Gwen Dawson <i>(played by Rose Leslie)</i></b></p>
<p>Gwen is not the typical dreaming housemaid, who spends her spare moments wondering what a life outside of serving an estate would be likeâshe makes things happen! It takes real <i>chutzpah</i> and bravery to decide you&#8217;re going to secretly hide a typewriter in the estate you&#8217;re working in and spend any free time you have learning how to type so that you can ever so slightly move up in the rigid British class system and make a better life for yourself. But Gwen doesn&#8217;t care, because she knows if she sets her mind to it, she will get exactly what she dreams of, some life that is more fulfilling than a life of solely serving others. And look!âat the end of the first season this girl of poor country farming origins secures herself (with a bit of help from Lady Sybil) a position as a secretary for the new telephone installation company. It was a shame to see her leave the show after this happened, because her determination was really something inspirational to us all.</p>
<p><b>5) Mrs. Isobel Crawley <i>(played by Penelope Wilton)</i></b></p>
<p>Isobel is probably the most headstrong character on this show. At one time married to a doctor with whom she sometimes worked, she knows she is just as capable as any man and is always out to prove it. At times her very modern views may come into conflict with Violet&#8217;s (let&#8217;s be real, they <i>always</i> come into conflict) but somebody has to be there to convert Downton Abbey into a very much needed WWI convalescent hospital, or tell Violet that shorter skirts and looser cut dresses are the way of the future for women. That someone is always going to be Isobel.</p>
<p><b>6) Anna Smith/Bates <i>(played by Joanna Froggatt)</i></b></p>
<p>Very much like Lady Mary, whom she attends to as a ladymaid, Anna knows what she thinks is right and what she thinks is wrong, and nothing will cause her to waver. She knows that Mr. Bates is a good man, and refuses to let any naysayers (ahem ahem, O&#8217;Brien and Thomas) say any different. Even when Mr. Bates is indicted for the murder of his ex-wife, Anna sees it only as a moment to stick even closer to him, doing everything in her power to clear his name. Yes, it is because she loves him, but I think it is even more because she knows he is an innocent man who is accused of a crime he did not commitâshe seeks justice to no end, and for that kind of righteous persistence, she is an obvious female favorite on <i>Downton Abbey</i>.</p>
<p><b>7) Mrs. Beryl Patamore <i>(played by Lesley Nicol)</i></b></p>
<p>Mrs. Patamore is the best cook out there, and she will never let you forget it. She runs that kitchen with an iron fist, and I pity the fool that tries to get in her way. It truly is an amazing feat to cook three square meals daily for a family of five, plus their frequent and occasional guests, plus the entire staff of the Downton Abbey estate, and she knows that there&#8217;s no one out there better for the job than her, which is why she leaves Downton Abbey kicking and screaming (metaphorically) when Lord Grantham sends her to a London hospital for eye surgery so that she can regain her sight. Mrs. Patamore is a straight-up lion (she&#8217;s got the hair for it, after all)âproceed with caution.</p>
<p><b>8) Miss Sarah O&#8217;Brien <i>(played by Siobhan Finneran)</i></b><b><i>Â </i></b></p>
<p>Also proceed with caution with O&#8217;Brien: she is the vengeful type and believe you me, you will feel it if and when you cross her. For every kindness she does not forget it, that goes doubly for anyone that does this ladymaid wrong. She is distrustful and obviously a believer in survival of the fittest, which would explain all the horrible tricks she plays on Mr. Bates. But, she carries with her a dignity and respect that, rather than becoming apparent only at certain times, is with her and on display at all times. There is a never-ending list of awful things one could call O&#8217;Brien, but weak is certainly not one of them.</p>
<p><b>9) Mrs. Elsie Hughes <i>(played by Phyllis Logan)</i></b></p>
<p>Yes, Mrs. Hughes is the head housekeeper, and yes, she does a very good job at being housekeeper, but Julian Fellowes has not given his viewers much on Mrs. Hughes to keep us interestedâexcept for the fourth episode of season one, in which a former suitor of Mrs. Hughes&#8217; youth returns to court her and ask her to marry him. As Mrs. Hughes relates the history of herself and this man to Carson the Butler, it becomes clear that her choice between the suitor and continuing to work at Downton was really a question of choosing dependence on another or self-reliance, and Mrs. Hughes, before and then again, could not bring herself to give up her independence. For that, I tip my nonexistent hat to Mrs. Hughes.</p>
<p><b>10) The Right Honorable Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham <i>(played by Elizabeth McGovern)</i></b></p>
<p>Last but not least we have Lady Cora, who, like Mrs. Hughes, usually is not the center of attention of any episode. But she is the wife of the Earl of Grantham, and her family&#8217;s fortune did save the Downton estate, so she&#8217;s got both money and power on her side. More interesting, though, is that her maiden name is Levinsonâis she a part of the tribe? A member of the chosen people? If so, there must be some wild backstory in which she had to square off with Violet in order to get her permission to marry her son, Lord Grantham (I would think the Dowager Countess would want pure Anglo-Saxon blood for her son and her grandchildren). Maybe one day Julian Fellowes will make use of the classic flashback but until then, we can only speculate on the strength and willpower of this Jewish-American countess.</p>
<p>Not ranked: Lady Edith Crawley, Daisy Robinson the kitchen maid, the evil ex-wife Vera Bates, Jane and Ethel the housemaids, Mrs. Bird the other cook, Ms. Lavinia Swire the deceased fiancÃ©e of Matthew Crawley, Lady Rosamund Painswick the sister of the Earl of Grantham, Lady Rosamund&#8217;s ladymaid, the farmer&#8217;s wife from that one time Edith drove a tractor, other miscellaneous maids on the estate, women of the village. Some of these ladies don&#8217;t have enough of a storyline to ever warrant a power ranking (c&#8217;mon, the farmer&#8217;s wife from that one time Edith drove a tractor?). But the real difference between them and the Top Ten Ladies of Downton is that they have not quite found their voice, unlike the most powerful females of the show. The most powerful women of <i>Downton Abbey</i> are the ones that have worked out the extent of their agency over their lives in a strict male-dominated British societyâand are constantly striving for even greater agency over their lives that they know they deserve.</p>

<p>I have attended every book club meeting at my school. I&#8217;ve never missed a National Honor Society meeting, a Math Honor Society meeting, a Social Studies Honor Society meeting, or a Latin Honor Society meeting. But when I tell people that I&#8217;ve never attended a high school football game, I am always asked the same question: <em>what&#8217;s wrong with you?</em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with me? Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s wrong with America&#8217;s schools first. <span id="more-2567"></span>China, Korea, Finland, and numerous other countries are <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/us/july-dec10/education_12-10.html">crushing us</a> in terms of test scores &#8211; especially in subjects like math and science. One out of every three fourth graders is at a below basic reading level, while more than 67% of fourth graders <a href="http://www.studentsfirst.org/pages/the-stats">are not reading at grade level at all</a>. <a href="http://www.fldcu.org/">Athletic scholarships</a> abound while hardworking Honor Roll students earning perfect SAT scores have to work at Walmart and McDonald&#8217;s just to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Tell me how throwing a football will help solve our country&#8217;s financial problems and save us from going over the fiscal cliff. Tell me how kicking a soccer ball will ameliorate our country&#8217;s failing mental health system. Tell me how slamming a tennis serve will solve our country&#8217;s foreign face offs in the Middle East. Tell me how anything related to pure physical achievement will allow our society to make great strides, or how it will propel our country to prosperity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not anti-athletics. I understand the value of sports in that they encourage exercise, promote teamwork, and provide entertainment. As a member of the tennis team and a proponent of several professional tennis players, I see that sports are not inherently evil. But why do we need sports in our education system? As one commenter noted in <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ohio-sheriff-confronts-protesters-football-rape-case-212214094.html">this</a> Yahoo! article, why can we not have Little League teams or Minor League teams to train athletes for professional teams? Why should the star football player be the &#8220;big man on campus&#8221; while the gifted intellectual struggles day and night for successes that could save our country?</p>
<p>I hope this post doesn&#8217;t sound too caustic. I&#8217;m just upset over the<a href="http://localleaks.blogs.ru/"> recent rape case</a> that has overtaken the town of Steubenville, Ohio, where members of their community have tried to cover up for the suspected rapists involved &#8211; beloved football players who have now been labeled the &#8220;Rape Crew&#8221;. Maybe if those guys had read <em>Speak</em> by Laurie Halse Anderson or learned about human dignity after a discussion of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, things would have gone down differently.</p>
