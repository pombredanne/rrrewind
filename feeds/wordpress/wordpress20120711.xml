<em>Sgurr na Bana Mhoraire</em></p>
<p>Four short days in N W Scotland is all Margaret would agree to. I didn&#8217;t press the issue, as the recent weather meant I hadn&#8217;t been particularly looking forward to our short break. I normally have maps printed and list of things to do prior to most holidays. This time I&#8217;d done a few half-hearted web searches and we&#8217;d agreed a vague plan of Torridon for a few days followed by a[n expensive] night in an Airstream caravan at Badrallach. A four hour drive included a quick pitstop at The Scottish Deli in Dunkeld for some posh takeaway lunch. We stopped just outside Contin to devour said lunch and arrived at Torridon mid afternoon. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7602_2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7602_2.jpg?w=900&h=445" alt="" title="_MG_7602_2" width="900" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7642.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7642.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_7642" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2408" /></a></p>
<p>The turn off at Kinlochewe almost immediately presented us with a stunning view of Beinn Eighe. Further on, Liathach came into view and I got all excited. We pitched up in curiously midge-free conditions at the free campsite at Torridon. We nipped into the small NTS visitor centre before driving out to Diabaig to get our bearings. As some of you know I used to work in this part of the world, but was not familiar with this particular corner. The road into Diabaig involves a steep descent with outstanding views across the Loch Diabaig, which in reality is just a bay with craggy hills rising above. A group of four French OAPs appear to have sailed their yacht into the bay and were exploring the village, a most civilised mode of touring the west coast.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7619-2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7619-2.jpg?w=900&h=445" alt="" title="_MG_7619-2" width="900" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2422" /></a></p>
<p>We returned to camp after an excellent meal at The Torridon Inn and wandered down to the hide at the head of Loch Torridon for some wildlife watching. Not a great deal happened until I spotted a couple of young stags nearby and a male sparrow hawk landed right in front of the hide to pick and tear at the remains of a kill. I completely failed to take a decent photo of the latter, despite it spending around five minutes almost completely stationary, only metres away. Not even the kamikaze birds dive-bombing it could put if off it&#8217;s meal. The light eventually faded and we returned to the tent for the night.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7962.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7962.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_7962" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2409" /></a><br />
<em>Slioch</em></p>
<p>Wednesday morning started warm and light drizzle turned to rain as we wandered around the low level walks at Beinn Eighe NNR, just by the Kinlochewe/Gairloch road. I had hoped the rain might cool us down, but it didn&#8217;t seem to make much difference. I persuaded Margaret to MTFU and do the Mountain Trail, a steep and rooty climb through the native forest, onto the open, rocky hillside to just over 560m. It doesn&#8217;t sound much, but in the stifling, muggy heat it seemed a slog, albeit one with amazing panoramas, punctuated by regular stops and prayers for even a faint breeze to cool us down. The rain had stopped and the skies brightened. A the sound of a small stream signalled an opportunity to refill our water bottles and splash our faces with cool mountain water. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7969.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7969.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_7969" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2410" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7895-2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7895-2.jpg?w=900&h=356" alt="" title="_MG_7895-2" width="900" height="356" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2425" /></a></p>
<p>The gradient eased eventually, and as we crested Leathad Buidhe the Beinn Eighe massif rose ahead to dominate the skyline south west of our viewpoint. The sun was shining overhead, but Beinn Eighe had it&#8217;s own little weather system, with cloud rolling over the summits. At that moment, I wanted to be <em>in</em> that scene, <em>on</em> those scree slopes rather than gazing over at them. We photographed and enjoyed 360° views including Slioch across Loch Maree. A perfect spot for some wild camping I thought, and made a mental note to return here to spend the night. Although at 200 miles from home, a longer route would be required, and looking at the map, I&#8217;m not sure stringing together a multi-day route would be easy or straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7869.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7869.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_7869" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2411" /></a><br />
<em>Beinn Eighe</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7911-2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7911-2.jpg?w=900&h=445" alt="" title="_MG_7911-2" width="900" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2434" /></a></p>
<p>Further on, we spotted a damselfly orgy, with a number of couples bumping uglies and showing off by flying around mid-coitus like a sexy chinook, although logistically it was probably more akin an air-to-air refuelling operation. We considered this for a bit then moved on. The path wound past some lochans and then downward alongside a deep gorge and back into the forest on the lower slopes. Back in the woodland, I found myself jogging the last section back to the car. Jogging isn&#8217;t so bad now that I don&#8217;t have a spectacular pair of moobs bouncing around, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to make a habit of it. Unfortunately my undignified lope scared off a rather large, unidentified bird of prey as I approached the lochside. We drove back to the campsite for a much needed shower and some food. </p>
<p>After years of faffing with more convoluted meals, our camp menu is strongly biased toward the simplicity of rice and canned Stagg Chilli these days. Margaret was delighted to see a head net clad camper cutting an Aubergine, that&#8217;s dedication! </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7958.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7958.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_7958" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2412" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7785-2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7785-2.jpg?w=900&h=604" alt="" title="_MG_7785-2" width="900" height="604" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2428" /></a></p>
<p>The following morning we decided on a lazy day and drove up to NTS Inverewe Garden and went on the guided tour. The gardens and woodland are rather nice [and at £9.50 entrance p.p. I should hope so!]. It was another bright and warm day, we sat in the sun and ate overpriced carrot cake. We drove out to Cove in the afternoon, stopping off at the beach on the way. We watched as yonder cumulo congestus erupted in slow-motion and spectral cumulus fractus shape-shifted overhead. I fell asleep in the sun. </p>
<p>At the memorial at Cove we watched as the skies darkened and thunder began over Loch Ewe. A cool breeze picked up but we made it back to the car still dry. We placed bets on when the rain would reach us. I was out by a minute. Lightning struck up ahead, but the storm cleared as quickly as it had appeared. We drove back to Torridon, stopping briefly at Slattadale/Loch Maree to photograph Slioch again. We passed a <a href="http://www.ruraldesign.co.uk/Loch-Maree">rather nice house</a> by the loch.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8027.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8027.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_8027" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2414" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8039.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8039.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_8039" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2415" /></a><br />
<em>Sáil Mhor</em></p>
<p>Friday morning we packed up and drove up the coast to Badrallach by Little Loch Broom. Margaret has had a thing about <a href="http://www.airstreamandco.com/">Airstream</a> caravans for a while, so we had booked up for a night at Badrallch campsite to see what the fuss is about. Frankly, I just don&#8217;t get it. Sure they look quite nice on the exterior, but the interior appears to be just like any other modern caravan. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t buy one, even if I could afford it. Margaret pretty much formed the same opinion. I thought the fit and finish was lacking, it just didn&#8217;t feel &#8216;special&#8217;. Also, whilst showering in it, I had visions of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbi5Zegp55o">Spinal Tap</a> moment, cocooned in a cramped perspex tube. </p>
<p>The sun was out again and I was keen to get out and ride down to the track to the isolated community of Scoraig. As I was adjusting my seatpost I sheared the bolt, leaving my bike unridable. After a bit of an tantrum, I managed to acquire a bolt to bodge the seat clamp with from the site owner, who kindly rummaged around his toolshed until he found one. We set off down to the end of the road and carried on up the track which contours the hillside. Margaret was a bit unhappy with the drop to the left and pushed more than she rode. I was quite enjoying myself and rode onwards, getting off to push a couple of steep/loose sections that were a bit challenging on a rigid bike. The trail was strewn with baby head sized rocks, which threatened to direct you off the cliff edge in places. Not an overly difficult ride, particularly with front suspension, but the drops off the side of the trail upped the stakes somewhat, especially when clipped in!</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7590-2.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_7590-2.jpg?w=900&h=604" alt="" title="_MG_7590-2" width="900" height="604" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2431" /></a></p>
<p>Margaret turned back, but urged me to continue and catch her up later. So I rode on down to just outside Scoraig, before riding back the way I&#8217;d came. We took a stroll down by the shore after dinner and watched the light over the loch. A nice, quiet spot and the campsite itself looked nice, but I&#8217;d skip the Airstream if you plan on visiting.</p>
<p>The following morning we were up and off by 0930. The sky was overcast and it looked like we&#8217;d had the best of the weather. Passing the reservoir at Loch Glascarnoch, the water level was a clear indication of how dry the N W Highlands had been over the past seven weeks. The pier was completely out of the water. At the dam itself, it looked like the water was around half capacity. At the top of the loch, I think I saw remnants of an old road on the exposed loch bed, the sides of the loch devoid of vegetation. As we reached Inverness the rain started and didn&#8217;t stop until home. Actually, it didn&#8217;t stop even then. Normal service resumed.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8078.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mg_8078.jpg?w=900&h=600" alt="" title="_MG_8078" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2416" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of people, I tried several times before I figured out the blogging thing. There are the remains of about half a dozen blogs out there somewhere from my failed attempts, but with <strong>20four12</strong> I&#8217;ve finally managed to figure out the winning formula for me and my blogging style. Reaching 100 posts (which happened a couple of days ago) was a huge milestone for me and I can&#8217;t put into words how excited I was to realize I had finally made it to that mark. I&#8217;m fairly certain I never even made it to 20 posts on any other blog.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT I&#8217;VE LEARNED SO FAR&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, the biggest lesson I&#8217;ve learned is you have to <strong>make goals for blogging and stick to them</strong> because otherwise you will find yourself drifting along trying to find some sort of direction you want to take your blog. The goal that really changed things for me was when I told myself I would write a post for every single day in March. When I made that goal I had no real idea what I would write about each day, but as the month went on I managed to find something, even if it was something small, for each day. And you know what, by the time I was finished I had learned another important lesson&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you are writing about something <em>you</em> find incredibly interesting</strong> or the grind (and a grind is what it truly is sometimes) will wind up taking all the fun out of it. Once I figured out that I wanted to write about books it felt like things all just fell into place for me. All of the sudden I knew what I wanted to write each day and I quickly reached a point where I have <em>too many</em> ideas to get down at any given point.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next lesson: <strong>you have to make sure and keep track of ideas somehow.</strong> After finding my focus for <strong>20four12</strong> I had so many ideas I thought were cool I couldn&#8217;t keep track of them all. I know there are some ideas I&#8217;ve thought of and forgotten because I didn&#8217;t take the time to write them down. I still haven&#8217;t found the best way of keeping track of my ideas, but I&#8217;m getting a lot better at it and I can now comfortably say that I could simply stop thinking and probably have post ideas for at least a month or two, every day, and that is a good feeling to have.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO I WANT TO DO NEXT?</strong></p>
<p>One thing I really want to focus on moving forward with the blog is consistency. I want to tighten up my posting schedule a little bit to make sure I don&#8217;t miss odd days here and there. I also want to get started on some regular &#8220;columns&#8221; that readers can look forward to on certain days of the week or certain times of the month. I&#8217;ve already got a couple of things along those lines, but I want to polish the process a little more.</p>
<p>Another thing I really want to get into soon is the development of a collection of <strong>30 Day Challenge</strong> lists for people to think about using. I think I could come up with some really thought-provoking ones that would result in some very good blog posts for people who wanted to use them. I also really want to figure out that one thing that is going to make me a little bit unique in the big pond that is book blogging. I feel like my idea for BRICKs is pretty solid, but it could probably still use a little work to really make it shine.</p>
<p>A little further down the line I would really like to start getting into the whole guest posting world and have other book bloggers write posts for <strong>20four12</strong> and maybe write a few posts here and there for others as well. It might take a little bit of time to get going on that sort of thing though.</p>
<p>The last thing I really want to do, and soon, is some general sprucing up around the blog. I need to write a better about page, outline a reviewing scale/policy, and a few other small things I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to and haven&#8217;t found the time as of yet.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;ve made it past 100 posts and I&#8217;m looking forward to reaching 200, 300, and beyond in short order. It&#8217;s been great to finally find my stride and I hope I never lose it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://allfivehorizons.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mondays.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211374314" title="mondays" src="http://allfivehorizons.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/mondays.jpg?w=640&h=359" alt="" width="640" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>For the past 20 months or so, Mondays don&#8217;t instill dread the same way they do more most 9-to-5ers. Instead of that Sunday Night Feeling, I get a frisson of hope for the week ahead. It&#8217;s a new leaf. A new start. A chance to do things right this week. Never one to start in the middle, I am no good at making changes mid-week, so Mondays are when I try new things. Mondays are when I think of all the things I want to accomplish and since it&#8217;s the beginning of the week, it all seems so achievable and I have not failed at getting things done (yet!).</p>
<p>In a few weeks, I am sure this will all change. I will be working / studying full-time and I won&#8217;t have the luxury of naptime-quiet hours to blog, read, tidy, watch TV etc. etc. I will have a lot less time and a lot more to do. It&#8217;s a daunting thought. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am really excited about starting my course; but I am also aware of how my life is about to be turned upside down.</p>
<p>It has never been more important for me to live intentionally, using my precious time in the best way possible. I want our house to be uncluttered and easy to keep. I want to cut out all the mental clutter of pointless worries. I want to live a simple, happy life in spite of the excessive workload and stressful new career. I was thinking last night about this blog and about the five horizons, wondering if the <a title="all five horizons simple horizon" href="http://allfivehorizons.co.uk/category/simple/">simple</a> horizon was something I could write about once I start my course. I almost thought of it as an indulgence that I have been lucky enough to tackle with having so much time at home.</p>
<p>This morning, as I wrote out my day&#8217;s tasks, I realised it is more important that ever that I keep my eye on the <a title="Simple Goals" href="http://allfivehorizons.co.uk/simple-goals/">simple goals</a> I have set. I need to refocus on what is really important so that I have the best chance of being successful (and sane) come September onwards.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wander near any of the beaches in Rio de Janeiro and you&#8217;ll be quickly reminded why expats recently voted their favourite aspects of Rio 1) the beaches, 2) the people, 3) the weather, and 4) the quality of life.</p>
<p>The beaches personify Rio &#8211; sun, fun and sport abound at every turn. Whilst the beach promenades are dotted with numerous outdoor multi-gyms, home to rippling muscles, and palm trees form improvised pegs to a network of tightropes. The adjourning cycle path acts like some mass conveyor belt of joggers, skate boarders, skaters, cyclists and walkers. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was 28, I spent several weekends at a Zen Buddhist monastery near the Catskills. It was a serenely beautiful place and I learned how to seriously meditate among the monks, which has only brought good things to my life. (Now if only I would make the time to get back to regular meditation, but that&#8217;s for another post.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be a monk, you&#8217;re going to have to shave your head so as to not get caught up in the vanity of hair maintenance. Much like how <a title="Get Thee To A Nunnery!" href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/get-thee-to-a-nunnery/" target="_blank">I was never going to be a nun</a>, I&#8217;ve never felt the need to become a monk—and I most certainly never wanted to shave my head. Asian hair is usually thick, long and gorgeous and similar to Samson, we women derive a lot of our power and sexiness from the lusciousness of our hair. So no, after a punk-lite phase in high school, I was never going to butcher my hair by doing anything too drastic or crazy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m older, wiser, and two kids later, much, <em>MUCH</em> less vain. There&#8217;s something about getting <a title="Sympathy For The Prego" href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/sympathy-for-the-prego/">hugely fat</a>, followed by pushing a living being out of your nether regions in front of a galley of strangers, that nullifies any obsession with looking good. For about a year now, I&#8217;ve been wanting to shave one side of my hair but then I got pregnant and didn&#8217;t think my <a title="It’s Pregnancy, Bitch" href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/its-pregnancy-bitch/" target="_blank">full-moon preggers face</a> would look so great with a shaved head. I put the thought on the back burner and watched Rihanna, Kesha and other singers/starlets do the shaved-head thing and thought, <em>Oh well, I guess it&#8217;s not for me</em>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Dman (who&#8217;s a rather conservative fellow) has been all for the idea ever since I brought it up but I&#8217;ve kind of gotten used to having long hair again and decided I&#8217;d rather do blond highlights for the summer, which he is not for. (See? <em>Conservative</em>.) Well, our <a title="Long, Beautiful Hair" href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/long-beautiful-hair/" target="_blank">eccentric hairdresser</a> stopped by tonight to give him a trim and, lo and behold, the decision was quickly made to shave me. Even more surprisingly, I didn&#8217;t freak one bit as the razor was brought to my scalp.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<a href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/a-lesson-in-partial-non-attachment/#gallery-2433-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>
<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of the process with my hair stylist yammering away in French:</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/a-lesson-in-partial-non-attachment/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/UTiaspS44pk/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>I LOVE IT! I also love that I feel almost no attachment to my hair, though it&#8217;s true that I didn&#8217;t shave my whole head. It feels liberating not to care about my vanity in that sense—those monks know what they&#8217;re talking about! At the same time, I&#8217;m going to have to put a little more thought into my wardrobe because you can&#8217;t very well rock this hairdo in <a title="Who’s That Girl?" href="http://newyorkinparis.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/whos-that-girl/" target="_blank">mom clothes</a>, can you?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say I lost <em>all</em> my vanity&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, I took an evening and headed down to the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge, along the coast of Texas. It&#8217;s a haven for birds, mosquitoes, and alligators.  I&#8217;ve also seen deer, feral pigs, snakes small and large, butterflies, wildflowers&#8230; It&#8217;s not exactly untouched nature, but it is a haven for critters that don&#8217;t do well in suburbia.</p>
<p>Around sunset, I climbed up on a viewing platform above a pond, to escape some of the mosquitoes and to watch the sun go down.  This alligator was lurking near the platform, so from time to time I&#8217;d snap a shot of him.  Frankly, most of them were lousy.  I don&#8217;t own a telephoto lens, and he&#8217;d always sink under the water if I got close enough to use my short little lens. But as time passed, I was able to edge a bit closer, and he got a bit less wary, and I was finally able to get a decent glamour shot.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 648px"><img title="Gator at San Bernard NWR" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yi6yVDAIV_g/T_ru-aSpKxI/AAAAAAAAIc8/TNnEK8W4zAM/s912/P7070713.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="479" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The original gator</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">There&#8217;s not much processing done on that image. I tweaked the contrast and clarity a bit, to help bring out the details, but I saw some potential to make it even&#8230; detailyer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I turned to Topaz. A while back I got the Topaz Adjust filters as a gift, and one thing I love about them is that they can help bring out edge detail.  I mucked around with the filters until I had something edgy.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 648px"><img title="Grainy Gator" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NrDZO8yp9Zc/T_tw0AI54_I/AAAAAAAAIdQ/1kXEemGzPC8/s912/P7070713-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="479" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The grainy gator</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">I liked that, but it no longer felt <em>real</em>. It felt heavy-handed and over-processed.  It also made some previously invisible elements &#8211; like the pale streak above his head &#8211; very distinctly visible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On to my next tool: Perfect Layers!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I opened the original photo and the Topaz version in Perfect Layers, and dropped the opacity on the top layer until I felt I had enough detail, without all the noise.  The result is, I feel, more realistic-looking.  Finally, I cropped it a bit, to reduce some of the head space.</p>
