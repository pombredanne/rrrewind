			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday may have just been an average, any ole&#8217; Monday for the rest of the world, but for fashion it marked the 63rd annual Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art—otherwise known as the Met Gala, and one of our absolute favorite red carpet events of the year! As per usual, the A-list in attendance did not disappoint. Who stepped out sartorially on top? Read on for all the deets as our PR Manager Alexis dishes on everything from the top trends spotted to the designers behind each fabulous look.</p>
<p>Who do you think most deserves the title of &#8220;Best Dressed?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-823" title="STYLUST_MetGala_1" src="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_1.jpg?w=727&#038;h=773" alt="" width="727" height="773" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BOLD COLOR. </strong>“Love these cheery, upbeat colors—they scream Spring has sprung. Neon pink is my personal lust right now, and I love that Brooklyn went for it in a long sleeve dress. It works perfectly with her straight/short blonde locks. And Dianna… So sleek and polished, she always looks good. Love the red.”</p>
<p><em>Photos, from left to right: Brooklyn Decker wearing Giambattista Valli (Larry Busacca/Getty), Zoe Saldana wearing Calvin Klein (Larry Busacca/Getty), Dianna Argon wearing Michael Kors (Stephen Lovekin/Getty).</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824" title="STYLUST_MetGala_2" src="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_2.jpg?w=727&#038;h=831" alt="" width="727" height="831" /></a></p>
<p><strong>EMBELLISHED NUDES. “</strong>Blake channels a Grecian goddess is this gray &amp; nude lace confection—I&#8217;m ready for a toga party! And Gwyneth…pure perfection. Love the champagne hue, it&#8217;s form fitting shape &amp; subtle shimmer. All three of these ladies prove nude only gets better when embellished.”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em>Photos, from left to right: Ashley Greene wearing Donna Karan (Stephen Lovekin/Getty), Blake Lively wearing Chanel (Larry Busacca/Getty), Gwyneth Paltrow wearing Stella McCartney (Larry Busacca/Getty).</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_4.jpg"><img title="STYLUST_MetGala_4" src="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_4.jpg?w=727&#038;h=852" alt="" width="727" height="852" /></a></p>
<p><strong>CHIC CUTOUTS. </strong>“Love these daring peekaboo cutouts! Shows just a hint of sexiness. Emma Roberts looks so beautiful and sleek in this one-shoulder white dress. And Ginnifer really makes a statement with the bold green—it’s great to see her be more edgy since she generally tends to play it safe on the red carpet.”</p>
<p><em>Photos, from left to right: Kerry Washington wearing Escada (Stephen Lovekin/Getty), Emma Roberts wearing Michael Kors (Larry Busacca/Getty), Ginnifer Goodwin wearing custom Topshop (Stephen Lovekin/Getty).</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_3.jpg"><img title="STYLUST_MetGala_3" src="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_3.jpg?w=727&#038;h=812" alt="" width="727" height="812" /></a></em></p>
<p><strong>GOLD GODDESS. </strong>“You can almost never go wrong with gold. All about the glamour. Kristen and Claire both look so pretty, almost au natural. And Elizabeth working the head-to-toe sequins with the coral lip—such an Old Hollywood glamour moment.”</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Photos, from left to right: Kristen Bell wearing Tory Burch (Stephen Lovekin/Getty), Elizabeth Banks wearing Tommy Hilfiger (Stephen Lovekin/Getty), Claire Danes wearing Calvin Klein (Stephen Lovekin/Getty).</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_5.jpg"><img title="STYLUST_MetGala_5" src="http://bebe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stylust_metgala_5.jpg?w=727&#038;h=828" alt="" width="727" height="828" /></a></em></p>
<p><strong>ORNATE ELEGANCE. </strong>“Ornate as ever, I love it, so glam. Diane, talk about showing some leg! Love that she left little to the imagination in this bold slit—with legs like that, I say go for it! And only our girls Rihanna and Beyoncè could pull off these skin-tight creations… Sasha Fierce is bringing it here!”</p>
<p><em>Photos, from left to right: Diane Kruger wearing Jason Wu (Larry Busacca/Getty), Rihanna wearing Stella McCartney (Larry Busacca/Getty), Beyoncè wearing Emilio Pucci (Larry Busacca/Getty).</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2989" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-front.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2989" title="new house front" src="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-front.jpg?w=500&#038;h=281" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">our new (old) house, the castle of my dreams</p></div>
<p>Today it&#8217;s a turning point in my life. I have been waiting for this since 26 December 1996. On that day Ruurd, my husband, and I walked to the top of our beautiful hill <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/fbx/?set=a.10150099531581962.282596.584516961&amp;l=3cf13f0151">in the snow</a>.</p>
<p>Here we fell in love with the incredible views of Assisi and the surrounding countryside. Despite the dilapidated aspect of the house, we bought it against the judgment of family and friends who thought we were not a little mad.</p>
<p>It took us 5 years of hard work and worries to move here and start Alla Madonna del Piatto <a href="http://www.incampagna.com">B&amp;B and cooking school</a>.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<div id="attachment_1158" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/alla-madonna-del-piatto.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1158" title="alla madonna del piatto" src="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/alla-madonna-del-piatto.jpg?w=500&#038;h=281" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">see my house against the splendid greenery? it&#039;s the light colored half of the building on the left. Now we own the brown part on the right as well.</p></div>
<p><br class="size-full wp-image-1158" />Ours was the bigger half of a very large farmhouse.The rest was owned by someone who did not do much with it except keeping it quite messy.</p>
<p>Of course, from day one, we started to dream the impossible dream, buying the other half and have our island of peace all to ourselves.</p>
<p>For 10 years we have lived here and worked hard to make Alla Madonna del Piatto a dream for us and for our guests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a lot has happened, good and bad.  Today we have finally managed, we have signed the contract, the other half of the house is ours.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-road-side.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2992" title="new house road side" src="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-road-side.jpg?w=500&#038;h=281" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">a road side view of the new house. Note the lovely garden decoration.</p></div>
<p>The house is in reasonable conditions, better than the first half we bought back in 1997, it will however need quite a bit of renovation.</p>
<p>This will hopefully result in one or two holiday apartments, a new and larger cooking school and finally, finally, finally an office for myself! Wow, I haven&#8217;t had an office for 10 years. It&#8217;s maybe time.</p>
<div id="attachment_2993" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-garden.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2993" title="new house garden" src="http://madonnadelpiatto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/new-house-garden.jpg?w=500&#038;h=281" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">new house garden, well,  after &quot;some&quot; pruning.</p></div>
<p>Today I feel like a princess. I own my castle. Tonight I&#8217;ll have a good sleep.</p>

This list involves 10 such individuals who were able to put their last thoughts and wishes on paper. I avoided typical suicide notes because I feel that is in another category from what is included in this particular list. However, I have included a few here that would qualify as such. For the longer letters I included only highlights or shortened versions of the letter.

<div class="itemtitle">The Rosenbergs&#8217;</div>
<div class="itemmore">Last Letter to Their Sons</div>
</div>
<p><img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj190/Blogball/RosenbergSons1953-thumb-468x345.jpg" height="405" width="550" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Rosenbergsons1953-Thumb-468X345" /></p>
<p>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with conspiracy for passing information about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union during a time of war. The Rosenbergs were convicted on March 29, 1951, and on April 5 were sentenced to death. The Rosenbergs remained on death row for twenty-six months. They were eventually executed by electric chair, on June 19th, 1953. The following letter to their two sons was written on the day of their execution. </p>
<p>Dearest Sweethearts, my most precious children,<br />
Only this morning it looked like we might be together again, after all. Now that his cannot be, I want so much for you to know all that I have come to know.&#160; Unfortunately, I may write only a few simple words; the rest your own lives must teach you, even as mine taught me. At first, of course, you will grieve bitterly for us, but you will not grieve alone. That is our consolation and it must eventually be yours. Eventually, too, you must come to believe that life is worth the living. Be comforted that even now, with the end of ours slowly approaching, that we know this with a conviction that defeats the executioner! Your lives must teach you, too, that good cannot really flourish in the midst of evil; that freedom and all the things that go to make up a truly satisfying and worthwhile life, must sometimes be purchased very dearly. Be comforted, then, that we were serene and understood with the deepest kind of understanding, that civilization had not, as yet, progressed to the point where life did not have to be lost for the sake of life; and that we were comforted in the sure knowledge that others would carry on after us. We wish we might have had the tremendous joy and gratification of living our lives out with you. Your Daddy, who is with me in these last momentous hours, sends his heart and all the love that is in it for his dearest boys. Always remember that we were innocent and could not wrong our conscience.</p>
<p>We press you close and kiss you with all our strength.<br />
Lovingly,&#8232;Daddy and Mommy&#8232;Julie&#160;Ethel</p>
<p>Interesting Fact: The photo above shows the Rosenberg&#8217;s sons, Robert, 6, left, and Michael, 10, looking over at a 1953 newspaper concerning the fate of their parents. The brothers were eventually adopted by the lyricist and musician Abel Meeropol and his wife, Anne.  Michael and Robert later agreed that their father was a Soviet spy. The brothers also stated that the atomic bomb information their father passed to the Russians was, at best, superfluous. They also said their mother was convicted on flimsy evidence to place leverage on her husband and neither deserved the death penalty.</p>

<p>Melissa Nathan is a popular comic romantic novelist from the UK. In 2001, Melissa was diagnosed with breast cancer but continued her writing. Despite her courageous fight with the disease, she died in April 2006, just after her son&#8217;s 3rd birthday at the age of 37. Her final novel, The Learning Curve, came out in August 2006. Knowing that she would not live to see the published copies, she used the opening pages of the book as a final letter to her family. &#8232; &#8232;I am in the unusual position of knowing that this book will, in all probability, be published posthumously. And so please indulge me in a rather unusual set of acknowledgements. </p>
<p>First, to my wonderful parents. You have given me a life suffused with love, support and friendship. I have been lucky enough to see eye to eye with you both, and look up to you at the same time. Please never feel that I have had a hard life. I have had 37 wonderful years, and I&#8217;m grateful to you both for giving me that. I am happy and at peace. My wonderful Andrew. I respect you as much as I love you, and that is saying something. You, of all people I know, will get through this. After all, you&#8217;ve got through nearly 12 years of marriage with me, and that&#8217;s no easy feat. I have been so lucky to know you. You have been my steady rock, my gentle giant, my best friend, my everything. I wish you a happy life, full of love and joy. And my amazing Sammy. I wanted to know you for longer, my love, but it wasn&#8217;t to be. Still, at only three years old, you have already left an imprint on my heart that will go with me, wherever it is I&#8217;m going. Motherhood made my life worthwhile. And you gave me that. What does a mother wish for her son? I wish you happiness. You have a wonderful daddy and a family who adores you. Go into the world knowing that while you were everything to your mother, you won&#8217;t have to deal with an annoying woman who can&#8217;t stop kissing you when you&#8217;re 15. I will be in the sky kissing you from afar. </p>
<p>Interesting Fact: The Melissa Nathan Award For Comedy Romance was set up with criteria that Melissa drew up herself, shortly before she died. She wanted to encourage and reward writers who can combine in a novel the magical, life-enhancing elements of humor and love.</p>

<p><img src="http://listverse.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/capkunofinal.jpg?w=548&#038;h=379" height="379" width="548" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Capkunofinal" /></p>
<p>Captain Kuno was a Captain for the Japanese air force during World War II, and a volunteer kamikaze pilot. On May 23, 1945, the eve of his mission, he wrote his final letter in katakana to his 5-year-old son and his 2-year-old daughter. Katakana is a type of script characterized by short, straight strokes and angular corners, and is the simplest of the Japanese scripts. He wrote in this script because a child learns katakana in the lower grades of elementary school.<br />
Translated, the letter reads:&#160;</p>
<p>Dear Masanori and Kiyoko, </p>
<p>Even though you cannot see me, I will always be watching you. Obey your mother, and do not trouble her. When you grow up, follow a path you like and grow to be fine Japanese persons. Do not envy the father of others, since I will become a spirit and closely watch over you two. Both of you, study hard and help out your mother with work. I cannot be your horse to ride, but you two be good friends. I am an energetic person who flew a large bomber and finished off all the enemy. Please be persons who rise above me and so avenge my death.&#160;<br />
From Father</p>
<p>Interesting Fact:  In September 1985, his son Masanori visited Chiran, where his father spent his final night. He saw his father&#8217;s photo displayed at the Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots. A museum director saw Masanori, who was the living image of the photo and said to him, &#8220;You must be his son.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj190/Blogball/277785917_9b3025da7c.jpg" height="482" width="550" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="277785917 9B3025Da7C" /></p>
<p>James Butler Hickok, known as Wild Bill Hickok, was a skilled gunfighter and lawman from the American old west.  Hickok was also a professional gambler, between his law-enforcement duties. On August 2, 1876, Hickok was playing poker at Deadwood, in the Black Hills of Dakota Territory. A former buffalo hunter named John McCall walked in to within a few feet of Hickok, drew a pistol and shouted, &#8220;Take that!&#8221; The bullet hit Hickok in the back of the head, killing him instantly. </p>
<p>Hickok had a premonition Deadwood would be his last camp, and expressed this belief to his friends who were traveling with him at the time.  Shortly before his death, he wrote a letter to his new wife, which read: &#8220;Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife &#8212; Agnes &#8212; and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore.&#8221; J.B. Hickok Wild Bill</p>
<p>Interesting Fact:  Legend has it that before Hickok was shot he had lost all his money and had to borrow $50 from the house to continue playing. When shot, he was holding a pair of aces and a pair of eights, all black. The fifth card had been discarded and its replacement had not yet been dealt. In poker, a two-pair of aces and eights is known as the dead man&#8217;s hand. </p>

<p>On May 19, 1902, an explosion occurred at the Fraterville Coal Mine in Tennessee. The disaster killed 216 miners making it the worst mining disaster in the state&#8217;s history.  A few miners survived the initial blast, living for several hours trapped in the mine, and were able to write farewell letters to their families. Jacob Vowell was with his son, Elbert, who was just 14 years old and wrote a letter of love and faith to comfort his wife, Ellen, and family. He also mentions &#8220;Little Eddie&#8221; who is his previously deceased child. The letter reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ellen, darling, goodbye for us both. Elbert said the Lord has saved him. Do the best you can with the children. We are all praying for air to support us, but it is getting so bad without any air. Horace, Elbert said for you to wear his shoes and clothing. It is now 1/2 past 1:00. Powell Harmon&#8217;s watch is in Andy Woods&#8217; hand. Ellen, I want you to live right and come to heaven. Little Elbert said he trusted in the Lord. The bad air is closing in on us fast. Dear Ellen, I leave you in bad condition, but set your trust in the Lord to help you raise my little children. Elbert said for you all to meet him in heaven, for all of the children to meet us both. Raise the children the best you can. Oh, how I wish to be with you. Goodbye, all of you, Goodbye. Bury me and Elbert in the same grave by little Eddie. Goodbye Ellen, Goodbye Lillie, Goodbye Jimmie, Goodbye Minnie, Goodbye Horace. Oh God, for one more breath. Ellen, remember me as long as you live. Goodbye, darling. It is 25 minutes after 2:00. There are few of us alive yet. Jake and Elbert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting Fact:  Fraterville lost all but three of its adult males. Hundreds of women were widowed, and roughly a thousand children were left fatherless. Some of the families lost as many as eight family members. </p>

<p>Ziad Jarrah was the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed into a field in a rural area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people on board. Jarrah was 26 years old, and was also one of the masterminds behind the September 11 attacks.  On September 10, Jarrah spent the last evening of his life writing a four page letter to his girlfriend Aysel Senguen, in Bochum, Germany, with whom he had made marriage plans. The letter never reached her, because she had moved out of her apartment after entering witness protection shortly after the attacks. The letter was returned to the United States by the postal services, where it was discovered and delivered to the FBI. In the first page translated from German he writes:</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to become sad, I still live somewhere else, where you can&#8217;t see me and can&#8217;t hear me, but I will see you and know how you are. And I will wait for you until you come to me. Everybody has his time and will move sometime. I am guilty that I raised your hopes about wedding, marriage, children and family&#8221; The letter also contains phrases such as: &#8220;You ought to be very proud, because it is an honor and you will see the results and everybody will be happy&#8221;. In another portion he writes &#8220;I did what I was supposed to do&#8221; The last page of the letter (shown above) translates to:  Remember what you are and who would deserve you. I hug you and kiss you on your hands and on the head. And I thank you and apologize for the very wonderful, hard five years that you spent with me. Your patience has a [unreadable] Allah &#8230;I am your prince and I will pick you up.  Goodbye!!</p>
<p>Your man forever<br />
Ziad Jarrah<br />
10-9-2001</p>
<p>Interesting Fact: Before the letter was revealed in November 2001, his girlfriend Aysel knew others thought the evidence was overwhelming that Ziad had been at the controls of the airliner, and a critical component in the deadliest terrorist attack in history. She, nonetheless, told investigators that he was alive; that he would one day come back and show up at her door with gifts, telling her not to worry, that there had been problems, but now everything was fine and they would have the life they had planned. </p>

<p>What makes this letter all the more heartbreaking is that Scott opens his last letter to his wife with the words &#8220;To my widow&#8221; Captain Robert Scott was a Royal Navy officer and explorer who led expeditions to the Antarctic regions. In March 1912, Scott was on his way back from the South Pole in sub-zero, conditions.  The three surviving members of his party were in their tent, suffering from frostbite and malnutrition. The following words below are just a few excerpts from his last letter to his wife Kathleen before his death from the elements. &#8232;<br />
To my widow. Dearest darling. It is not easy to write because of the cold &#8211; 70 degrees below zero and nothing but the shelter of our tent&#8230; We are in a very tight corner and I have doubts of pulling through. In our short lunch hours, I take advantage of a very small measure of warmth to write letters preparatory to a possible end. If anything happens to me, I should like you to know how much you have meant to me.  I must write a little letter for the boy if time can be found to be read when he grows up.  Dearest that you know I Cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage. When the right man comes to help you in life, you ought to be your happy self again. Make the boy interested in natural history if you can. It is better than games. Try to make him believe in a God; it is comforting.  </p>
<p>Oh my dear, my dear, what dreams I had of his future and yet, oh my girl, I know you will face it stoically &#8211; your portrait and the boy&#8217;s will be found in my breast. What lots and lots I could tell you of this journey. What tales you would have for the boy, but, oh, what a price to pay. To forfeit the sight of your dear, dear face.  &#8220;I think the best chance has gone. We have decided not to kill ourselves, but to fight it to the last for that depot but in the fighting there is a painless end, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8232;Interesting Fact: The letter (shown above) was found along with the three explorer&#8217;s bodies several months after their deaths, and just 11 miles from their supply camp. Scott&#8217;s wife Kathleen remarried politician Edward Hilton Young, in 1922, and became Baroness Kennet when he was ennobled, in 1935. His son, then 3, went on to graduate from Trinity College, Cambridge, and have a distinguished career in ornithology. </p>

<p>Milada Hor&#225;kov&#225; was a Czech politician, and was elected a Member of Parliament, where she remained until the Communist coup, in February 1948. Despite being urged by her friends to leave Czechoslovakia, she remained in the country and was politically active. On September 27, 1949, the Communist authorities arrested her and charged her with conspiracy against the state. Despite being tortured, she refused to accept the legality of the current government. She was sentenced to death after a widely publicized show trial. The Communist authorities then offered her clemency in exchange for a confession, but she refused and was executed by hanging.  The night before her execution, her jailers allowed Hor&#225;kov&#225;  to write three letters, one to her husband, one to her sixteen year old daughter Jana, and one to her mother-in-law, who would raise her daughter.</p>
<p>Part of the letter to her daughter reads:  &#8220;The reason was not that I loved you little; I love you just as purely and fervently as other mothers love their children. But I understood that my task here in the world was to do you good &#8230; by seeing to it that life becomes better, and that all children can live well. &#8230; Don&#8217;t be frightened and sad because I am not coming back any more. Learn, my child, to look at life early as a serious matter. Life is hard, it does not pamper anybody, and for every time it strokes you it gives you ten blows. Become accustomed to that soon, but don&#8217;t let it defeat you. Decide to fight.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Interesting Fact: On November 14, 2006, at the Czech Embassy in Washington, D.C., Horakova&#8217;s daughter&#160;Jana accepted the&#160;Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom Award&#160;from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for her mother.&#160;</p>

<p>A list such as this would not be complete without Sullivan Ballou&#8217;s eloquent, heart filled letter to his wife, Sarah. It was written in 1861, one week before the union soldier was killed at the First Battle of Bull Run, which was the first major land battle of the American Civil War. The abbreviated version of the letter below was featured in Ken Burns Civil War documentary.</p>
<p>Dear Sarah: </p>
<p>The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days &#8211; perhaps tomorrow. And lest I should not be able to write you again I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I am no more. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing &#8211; perfectly willing &#8211; to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this government, and to pay that debt. </p>
<p>Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence can break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly with all those chains to the battlefield. The memory of all the blissful moments I have enjoyed with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply grateful to God and you, that I have enjoyed them for so long. And how hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes and future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and see our boys grown up to honorable manhood around us. If I do not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I loved you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name&#8230; Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless, how foolish I have sometimes been!&#8230; </p>
<p>But, O Sarah, if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love, I shall always be with you, in the brightest day and in the darkest night&#8230; always, always. And when the soft breeze fans your cheek, it shall be my breath, or the cool air your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.  Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again&#8230; </p>
<p>Interesting Fact: Sullivan Ballou&#8217;s letter was never mailed. It was found in Ballou&#8217;s trunk after he died, and delivered to Ballou&#8217;s widow by Governor William Sprague, His wife, Sarah, never remarried. She later moved to New Jersey to live out her life with her son, William. She died in 1917, at the age of 81 and is buried next to her husband. </p>

<div class="itemtitle">Mary Queen of Scots</div>
<div class="itemmore">Last Letter to Henri III, King of France</div>
</div>
<p><img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj190/Blogball/MaryQueen.jpg" height="400" width="271" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Maryqueen" /></p>
<p>Mary Stuart was Queen of Scots, briefly Queen of France and aspired to be Queen of England. Her Cousin, Queen Elizabeth, ordered her arrest, because of the threat presented by Mary who was considered the rightful ruler of England by many English Catholics. She was sentenced to death for her alleged involvement in the plan to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. On the morning of February 8th, 1587, with her execution just six hours away, Mary wrote her last letter to Henri III, King of France who was the brother of her late husband. In the letter, Mary claims that she is being persecuted solely for her faith and for her rights to the English throne. She also asks Henri to take care of her servants. Translated from French the last part of her letter (shown above) reads: </p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of sending you two precious stones, talismans against illness, trusting you will enjoy good health and a long and happy life. Accept them from your loving sister-in-law, who, as she dies, bears witness of her warm feelings for you. Give instructions if it please you, that for my soul&#8217;s sake part of what you owe me should be paid, and that for the sake of Jesus Christ, to whom I shall pray for you tomorrow as I die, I be left enough to found a memorial mass and give the customary alms.</p>
<p>Wednesday at two in the morning,<br />
Your most moving and most true sister,<br />
Marie R. Queen of Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting Fact: During her execution it is said that it took at least two strikes to decapitate Mary. The first blow missed her neck and struck the back of her head. At which point the Queen&#8217;s lips moved. Her servants reported they thought she had whispered the words &#8220;Sweet Jesus.&#8221; The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of connective tissue that the executioner cut loose by using the axe as a saw. When the executioner picked up the severed head to show it to those present, it was discovered that Mary was wearing a wig. The former queen&#8217;s head rolled on the floor with the headsman holding just her wig. </p>

<p>This letter doesn&#8217;t quite fit with the other situations on the list because, although sad, it is very inspirational, so I have included it as a bonus. Jack Trice was the first black football player from Iowa State College. Trice majored in animal husbandry, with the desire to go to the South after graduation, and use his knowledge to help black farmers. His wife, Cora Mae was also a student and studied home economics.</p>
<p>On October 6, 1923, he played his first major football game against the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Because of his color, Trice was forced to stay at a different Minneapolis hotel from his teammates. During the game he suffered a broken collarbone. He continued to play until the third quarter when he was thrown on his back and trampled by three Minnesota players. Trice was removed from the game and sent to a Minneapolis Hospital.&#160; The doctors declared him fit to travel by train back to Ames, Iowa, with his teammates. Two days later, Trice died from hemorrhaged lungs and internal bleeding as a result of the injuries he sustained during the game. Before his funeral a letter was found in his jacket pocket that he had written to himself on hotel stationary the night before the game. </p>
<p>The letter reads:  &#8220;My thoughts just before the first real college game of my life: The honor of my race, family &#038; self is at stake. Everyone is expecting me to do big things. I will. My whole body and soul are to be thrown recklessly about the field tomorrow. Every time the ball is snapped, I will be trying to do more than my part. On all defensive plays I must break thru the opponents&#8217; line and stop the play in their territory. Beware of mass interference. Fight low, with your eyes open and toward the play. Watch out for crossbacks and reverse end runs. Be on your toes every minute if you expect to make good. Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting Fact:  Trice&#8217;s funeral was held at the College&#8217;s central campus with 4,000 students and faculty members in attendance. As a result of his death, the college did not renew their contract to play against Minnesota. They would not play again until 1989. In 1997, because of the persistence of the Iowa State University staff, students and alumni, The Universities Cyclone Stadium was renamed Jack Trice Stadium.  A bronze statue (shown above) was later erected of Jack Trice, showing him reading the letter he had written to himself. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m treading water in the space between what pulls me down (chores, disciplining children, loneliness of having no close friends yet in the city we now call home) and what lifts me up (a threshold to cross where every day is a new adventure).</p>
<p>There’s nice enough people here in St. John’s. I see some other moms, and fewer dads, at the playgroups I frequent with my two sons while my daughter is at school. There’s one on Tuesday and Thursday mornings at the Newfoundland Sports Centre, it’s free, and the gym is MASSIVE. My wild child can run until his cheeks are flaming red, kicking and throwing balls, flipping over mats, crawling through tunnels. Several times a week I pack the baby on my back, push the stroller for the wild one (in case he ever tires), and visit various parks perched on the hills of St. John’s. I talk to people in grocery stores. At the library.</p>
<p>Still, I can’t help but think back to our last three moves and know that by this time, two months into it, I had at least one new best friend. Other than my husband, whose job is more demanding than ever, I find I’m very much on my own in a strange and colourful place with no close bonds yet formed.</p>
<p>I despise the sound of myself complaining. And so I focus my attention towards lighter facts. Like the fact that we have a doorframe next to the kitchen table where we can put the baby in his jolly jumper (one of the things we thought to pack ourselves, hence saving it from storage). The floor there is uneven, so we stuff pillows and a blanket over the knobby threshold and he bounces and squeals with delight, part of our family dinners. My kids may not have the huge backyard with play set we had at our old house in Thompson, but wherever we walk in this city, they climb, roll, balance on fences and retaining walls, and stretch their muscles in ways they never did in the flat lands we moved from.</p>
<p>After six weeks, we finally and officially became residents of Newfoundland. We got our driver’s licenses and MCP (medical care plan) cards for this province. Our vehicles registered. Our insurance, bills and mail organized. Sort of.</p>
<p>Let me know if you’ve experienced this before, because I really hope it’s not just us: having to do EVERY SINGLE THING TWICE. Go to City Hall to get a parking permit. Fail to bring one piece of paper with my name and new address on it (because I didn’t have one yet), go home, go back another day with all relevant information. Go to the vehicle registration office, they can’t get in touch with some official or other on their end, have to return another day to finish that process. Pick up forms for MCP, they are the wrong ones. Take the correct forms to the office that the website stated to go to in the Confederation Building, turns out it’s not the right place at all. Start all over again. This time, make a few phone calls (which takes at least an hour on hold) to discover that the office to get the MCP cards is actually located downtown.</p>
<p>The day I did finally get our MCP cards, I also got my driver’s license. It was a Friday. I could hardly believe that I’d finally have my new ID. Of course, both those things had already been attempted previously, but still, to accomplish two things in one day, all three kids in tow, it was amazing.</p>
<p>My husband and I celebrated with a bottle of wine and <em>cheval noire</em>, it’s our new favourite beer out here, Black Horse (not really called by the French name but that’s what we’ve been jokingly calling it, in honour of our daughter whose ability to translate half her English vocabulary into the other official language is growing at a surprisingly fast pace). Then we got a cold.</p>
<p>The weeks have been tinged with drama and drudgery. I am both amused and frustrated by the contents of this furnished rental: six ladles, four colanders, numerous pots with no lids and lids with no pots, and not a single potato peeler (I finally bought one).</p>
<p>And so, eight weeks after moving here, we (well actually, I) evicted us from this grand old home and embarked on a house hunt. Again. After looking at some other rentals, I got nervous.</p>
<p>This week, I changed my mind. I think we&#8217;ll stay put, maybe attempt to get a few more things out of storage. I know some gals who call it a “woman’s prerogative” to change her mind over and over again. I call it one of the fairer sex’s many curses. I think I slip into a bit of a depression every time I change my mind, then change it back again. What a drain of energy. I’d rather think of it as exploring all my options. All little too thoroughly.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the chance to live here in Newfoundland, a place I realize we may never have visited just as a vacation destination (it’s certainly not a cheap place to get to. It’s also, we realize now, the most expensive place we’ve ever lived. Everything does have to get here by ship, and apparently NL doesn’t have its own cows, because milk, for one, costs twice what it does anywhere else we’ve lived). I don’t mean to complain, really I don’t. But in keeping with the main theme of my blog, on relocation, I just want to be very very clear: moving is never easy. More to the point: being displaced is a nightmare. But we find things to enjoy along the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://cclbreck.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_1244.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-149" title="The lighthouse at Ferryland" src="http://cclbreck.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_1244.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>We explored some of the East Coast Trail over Easter weekend. WOW. Stunning. And we visited the lighthouse at Ferryland on a bluebird day. There’s so much hiking out here, and our family is at a stage where we can enjoy these things together, the kids running all over the craggy, moss and heather-covered rocks, the baby in a backpack.</p>
<p>I’m also discovering some of the most amazing writers. I’m reading Lisa Moore’s <em>February</em>, and I’m absolutely blown away by this haunting, touching story. This is Moore’s fictitious tale based on the very real, horrible tragedy that happened off the coast of NL in 1982 when the Ocean Ranger rig sank into the frigid depths of the Atlantic, killing all 84 people who were stationed on it that Valentine’s evening. Perhaps it is my choice of novel, but I’m starting to think that one thing that characterizes Newfoundlanders is sadness. I don’t know how anyone who is from here, could not have been touched in some way by at least one of the many many tragedies that has occurred here. Tidal waves, severe storms, and countless instances of lives being lost at sea. I can see why so many people here have a true love hate relationship with the ocean that surrounds them.</p>
<p>I joined the Writer’s Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador, WANL, and I’m really looking forward to tapping into that group. It seems to be a very strong, active organization here at the most eastern tip of Canada. And perhaps as I do get to meet and know other people here, I will find the humour, and not just the sadness, that I know lives here too.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This DIY, comes from <a href="http://www.polkadotbride.com/2011/04/concertina-photo-album/">Polka Dot Made</a>, and was originally made for a wedding. We thought it would be a perfect gift for any Mother.  Whether it be your mom, your grandma, your children&#8217;s mom or a mother your look up to, here is a great DIY gift for that wonderful lady in your life.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.polkadotbride.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Atypical-Type-A-Concertina-photo-album-1-500x375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thick, coloured card (I recommend going to an art shop instead of a newsagent)</li>
<li>Contrasting satin ribbon, cut in half</li>
<li>Selection of photos from your wedding (an even number such as four or six)</li>
<li>Double-sided tape</li>
<li>Cutting mat</li>
<li>Metal ruler</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Pencil</li>
<li>Craft knife</li>
<li>Scorer</li>
<li>Bone folder<a href="http://socialgracesspringfield.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/diy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1295" title="diy" src="http://socialgracesspringfield.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/diy.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Along the edge of your paper, mark the height of the photo (it should be around 15cm). Along the other edge of your paper, mark out the width of the photo (about 10cm), adding an extra millimetre or two to allow for the fold. Repeat until you have a panel for each photograph (remember: it must be an even number!).</p>
<p>2. Trim your paper to size using the knife.</p>
<p>3. Score your card at each of the markings.</p>
<p>4. Apply a strip of double-sided tape horizontally across the centre of the last panel; remove backing. Repeat on first panel.</p>
<p>5. Lay the end of the ribbon along the exposed tape on the first and last panels and press down.</p>
<p>6. Apply double-sided tape to the edges and centre of the back of each photo.</p>
<p>7. Remove backing from double-sided tape.</p>
<p>8. Carefully stick a photo on each panel.</p>
<p>9-10. Fold over the first panel and press flat with a bone folder. Continue folding the remaining panels, alternating directions to achieve a concertina style.</p>
<p>11. Wrap the ribbon around the middle of the album (I’ve wrapped it around several times as a decorative feature but once is enough).</p>
<p>12. Tie at the right edge into a bow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>i cannot believe that i had all of this blog post DONE and then WP wiped it ALL out, WP ATE my blog post and I have to start from scratch&#8230; i had saved the draft numerous times, but the last time, it decided I needed to sign in again and got back and GONE were all the saves. boo humbug WP&#8230; this is not the first time that WP has done this either&#8230; so I learned my lesson, create the blog post on my computer first, then copy and paste it onto WP, so that this cannot happen again.</p>
<p><a href="http://PETZcheckIN.com"><strong>PETZcheckIN.com</strong></a> is a new web-based service that removes the risk out of home pet care (or using pet sitters). Often people using a pet sitter worry that a pet sitter will not arrive in a timely manner, will forget to provide care or will forget all the instructions. PETZcheckIN.com provides a fully-automated solution.</p>
<p>PETZcheckIN.com allows pet owners to know, in real time, their pet sitter arrived at their home, and the amount of time the pet sitter spends with the pets. In addition, PETZcheckIN provides the security of back-up plan activation should something happen, and a pet sitter not show for reasons such as car accidents, or other human mistakes.</p>
<p>Pet sitters are great people, but they are, like all of us, human and fallible. PETZcheckIN.com takes the human risk factor out of pet sitting, and provides pets with security and safety.</p>
<p>In addition, PETZcheckIN.com provides reminder calls, texts or e-mails to the pet sitter just to confirm. The ePETZid at PETZcheckIN provides an easy way to share all the information about a pet.</p>
<p>Pet owners can sign up today, and give it a try for free! Using a pet sitter for the weekend? Give PETZcheckIN a free try, and see how much more secure you feel when you receive the little e-mail that lets you know your pet sitter is giving care to your dog, cat or horse.</p>
<p>PETZcheckIN.com is owned by checkingIN, inc. This service adds about $14 to your total pet care bill (assuming twice daily pet sitting).</p>
<p><strong>MY DOG,</strong> launched at the Apple Store (FEATURES A PET TRAVEL GUIDE!). Dog-lovers will find it helpful, efficient and economical. MY DOG is FREE, and created by a dog-owner when he when he lost his beloved Dax, (a Terrier Mix). MY DOG holds your pet’s important medical information in addition to offering you the most extensive National dog-service Directory with data about veterinarians, nearby pet hospitals and shelters. MY DOG is the only “pet App” with the capacity to help you find your lost pet.  Please visit <a href="http://www.doginfousa.com">www.doginfousa.com</a></p>
<p><strong>PawTrotter:</strong> Need to find a dog friendly business? This can be a challenge especially when you are traveling and unfamiliar with the area. The PawTrotter app has more than 130,000 pet stores, dog friendly hotels, veterinarians, and dog parks. You do not even need to enter an address, the app uses the iPhone&#8217;s GPS to pin point your location and find businesses near you. Costs $2.99 on I-tunes.<br />
Developed by pet-owner  (<a href="http://www.pawtrotter.com">www.pawtrotter.com</a>) for iPhones that makes taking trips easy and stress-free!   Pawtrotter and its unique, interactive &#8221;Wheel Navigation&#8221; helps pet owners find over 130,000 Pet-friendly places in the following categories: Dog Parks &amp; Beaches, Pet-Friendly Hotels, Pet Grooming &amp; Washing, Veterinarians &amp; Pet Hospitals, Pet Boarding &amp; Sitting, Pet Stores, and more. Pawtrotter also features reviews, addresses and phone numbers for pet-related destinations or businesses.  A pet-owner can quickly call or map them from your iPhone.</p>
<p>Dog owners who like to travel with their best friends can also use <a href="http://FlipKey.com">FlipKey.com</a>, the vacation rental website with the worlds largest collection of guest reviews. FlipKey makes it easy to find pet-friendly travel accommodations around the world with filters and guest reviews, which can be extremely helpful in letting guests know what doggy amenities are available.</p>
<p><strong>Dog-A-Pedia</strong> app created by eighth-grader Preston Oakes lists a dog’s average weight, height, color, life span and whether a dog is hypoallergenic, among other things. It also offers photos. Oakes was concerned about the number of dogs euthanized every year. He though if families did a little more research and found a good match in a dog from the get-go, they would be less likely to abandon it later on. Windows Phone 7 users can purchase the Dog-A-Pedia app through the Windows Phone website, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone">www.microsoft.com/windowsphone</a></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know of any dog owner who doesn&#8217;t love taking pictures of his or her furry friend. Many times iPhone shots are of dogs doing / being adorable or hilarious and Photobucket&#8217;s app makes life easier by streamlining the process.</p>
<p>As the world leader in photo sharing, Photobucket not only gives travelling dogs and their owners the ability to STORE, ORGANIZE, EDIT AND SHARE memories from the road &#8211; but the PATENTED AUTOMATIC (ZERO-CLICK) UPLOADER on the mobile app also makes the experience a completely seamless one.  Available for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Windows phones and more.</p>
<p>This is a great fit for all mobile dog owners &#8211; not only do Photobucket&#8217;s apps allow you to capture and store memories on-the-go, but you also can share them immediately with friends and family all around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Save Money on Gas:</strong> With gas pricing rising, consider ways to save at the pump.  plan ahead to avoid driving more than necessary if you get lost, and use apps that can help you find the best gas prices in your location. <a href="http://TrueCar.com">TrueCar.com</a> has a list of 10 apps, including Gasbuddy (free) which locates nearby gas stations and sorts them by price. Thanks to Kathy Boerner from Hertz for this tip.</p>
<p><strong>Mo’s knows</strong> that kids (and adults) learn organically through all they experience via smell, taste, hear, see and touch. The Mo’s Nose App will incorporate many of the five senses, by allowing users to navigate the world with Mo’s canine sense of curiosity and knowingness; thus, turning their phone into a pet-friendly finding tool and Mo-friendly toy.</p>
<p>The Mo’s Nose App is a fun way to search, find, experience, play and learn. To develop this comprehensive national pet directory Mo’s Nose worked with ProKarma, an international industry leader in IT, ranked fastest growing IT Service Company in the US.  Mo is a rescue dog, but he is such a loyal and loving companion, sometimes we have to ask…who rescued whom?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">Trent’s team played their first game of the playoffs this past Saturday, April 30 against Frankfurt. It was an away game. Because Trent wasn’t playing in the game with his injured elbow, he and I decided to drive to Frankfurt early in the morning and sight-see around the city a while before the evening game. It is a very “Americanized” city in comparison to the others we’ve visited. Frankfurt was bombed out during WWII, so many of the buildings are relatively new. Frankfurt is the financial capital of Germany, so it is largely a banking city. Frankfurt is the only city in Germany with a significant amount of skyscrapers (12). Interestingly enough, there are very few cities in all of Europe with many skyscrapers. Anyways, enjoy our collage from our day in Frankfurt… </p>
