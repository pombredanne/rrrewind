			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;" src="http://ellefeeney.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/wpid-20111209125655.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on my Wreck this Journal for over a year now, and am pleased to share some of the lessons that I have learned from it. One of the more <em>unexpected reflections</em> that I have had is about how far the fruit that I regularly consume has traveled.</p>
<p>Most of the fruit stickers that I remembered to salvage in the past year were added to my journal while I was living in Scotland, yet the locations from those stickers are suggestive of some kind of <strong>round the world tour</strong>. I have stickers from South Africa, Turkey, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Belize, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, Ecuador, Mexico, and the USA, just to name a few. That&#8217;s<em> pretty exotic</em> for a snack, especially when you consider how much fuel has to go into getting those tasty fruits all the way to your refrigerator. This is of great concern to me since I have been trying my best to lower my carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve returned to Canada, I spend a lot more time <strong>looking at where my fruit comes from</strong>.  In the summer and early autumn there were lots of local choices; apples, berries, peaches, pears, or plums, but as the winter draws closer I expect to see more exotic fruit appearing on the menu again. I&#8217;m not saying that I intend to give up fruit, but paying closer attention to travel distance and trying to make more local choices is the best option that I can think of for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>And, of course, making sure that I eat all of the fruit I buy before it goes bad!</strong></p>
<p>Do you pay attention to where your produce comes from? How do you manage to buy locally during the winter months?  I would love to hear your ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elle</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://newenglandsportsreact.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tebow.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-157" title="Tebow" src="http://newenglandsportsreact.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tebow.jpg?w=323&#038;h=242" alt="" width="323" height="242" /></a></p>
<p><em>Next Sunday, the religious quarterback will try to ride his praise and prove doubters wrong by defeating Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.  A victory would give Tebow a 7-1 record since taking over as Denver&#8217;s starting QB.</em></p>
<p>Say what you want about Denver Broncos&#8217; young quarterback Tim Tebow.  He isn&#8217;t mechanically sound as a player, he&#8217;s not very accurate on his throws, and he runs more than he passes.  If you used any of these descriptions to  describe Tebow, you would have made a correct assumption.  His throwing motion isn&#8217;t natural, he often throws bad spirals, and he doesn&#8217;t look comfortable standing in the pocket for too long.  Once again, all of these descriptions are accurate.  Here&#8217;s another description of what kind of player Tim Tebow is: a winning quarterback.</p>
<p>Correct.  Despite all of these flaws in his young, undeveloped game, Tebow has taken the Broncos and willed them to a 6-1 record under center.  He is far from an elite player, but he plays with something that can&#8217;t be observed on the field: heart.  He was quoted saying it in training camp before this regular season, even when it was announced that he would be the third-string quarterback on the Broncos entering the regular season.  Tebow held back his obvious emotions, and simply told the reporters that he would just continue to work hard and play with &#8220;heart,&#8221; and eventually  he would end up where he deserved to be.  Doesn&#8217;t this attitude sound awful familiar, Patriots fans?</p>
<p>Tom Brady, the 199th pick coming out of the 6th round in the 2000 NFL Draft, was scouted as slow, lanky, unathletic, and not mechanically sound whatsoever.  There was something burning inside of him, however, something the general public hadn&#8217;t heard about and many NFL team officials knew nothing about: heart.  Once Brady got his chance to start for the Patriots, taking over for the injured Drew Bledsoe, he struggled early and at times often.  But eventually he got it together, and after closing in on a .500 team record at 4-5, he led the Pats to a perfect 7-0 record in the regular season and the franchise&#8217;s first Super Bowl trophy.  Not saying that Tim Tebow and Tom Brady are anywhere close to the same player, one just beginning to get a taste of the NFL and one who has drank from the coffee cup for years.  But, they both share the same motivation for winning football games in the NFL: a burning desire that resides in their emotionally-charged hearts.</p>
<p>This is the reason why next Sunday&#8217;s game between the Patriots and Broncos should be an exciting one to watch.  Even the  NFL recognized the game&#8217;s significance, attempting to move the game&#8217;s start from 4:15 to 8:20 on NBC&#8217;s Sunday Night Football, a decision I think will still end up happening.  I don&#8217;t expect the game to be a blowout for either team; I expect the game to be close, not so much a defensive struggle  or a shootout but certainly a game featuring significant offensive production.  Brady leads the high-flying offense of the Pats, and even with the Broncos&#8217; talented defense the veteran QB should have little trouble picking them apart.  On the other side, Tebow should have a pretty good game statistically, coming off of a season-high 202 yards, two touchdowns and no picks with a 147.5 quarterback rating and facing a Patriots D that has trouble defending big plays in the secondary and gives up a significant amount of yardage through the air.  Don&#8217;t expect this game to be a catwalk whatsoever, Pats fans.</p>
<p>This game will test both the physical and mental toughness of this team, given Tebow&#8217;s ability to lead comebacks no matter how far his team is down and how late it is in the game.  It will also give the defense a chance to identify itself, as either one that continues to allow tons of yardage through the air and has trouble playing man, or one that gives up some plays early but is able t0 adjust and lock down one solid area of another team&#8217;s offensive game (this is a classic Belichick team strategy, and this year&#8217;s unit has shown signs of playing with this mindset consistently).  If the Patriots can manage to shut down Tebow&#8217;s ability to get clean throws off, they can force him to tuck the ball and run.  By leaving an outside linebacker on each side of the formation along with a middle linebacker in between them, the defense can constantly have an eye on the elusive Tebow, which should allow them to keep containment on him most of the time.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s over a week away, the hype for this game is already building.  Hopefully for Patriots fans, Bill&#8217;s team comes out focused and is able to execute its gameplan.  If not, Brady and his teammates could enter a world on the football field a few teams have been exposed to this season: Tebow Time.</p>

<p>We were getting ready to go to school one cold Tuesday morning. We had the radio on, which was on most mornings. Beatle songs were playing. I think it was my Mum who said it first, “John Lennon’s been shot”.  It was 9th December 1980. I was nearly 10. I listened in for details. Was he going to be ok? What had happened? John had been in the news recently anyway as he’d just released a new LP and single after being hidden away for five years.</p>
<p>Then it was made clear. He was gone. My eyes welled up. I’d been a bit choked when Elvis had died three years earlier, but that was more of just picking up on the cultural feel that was around and watching the news. This was personal. I didn’t want to go to school. It didn’t seem right. Especially as they were playing non-stop Beatles and John’s tunes all day on the radio.</p>
<p>So I went to school on that cold and damp day, depressed and sad, with the tune of Woman playing in my head, thinking about Sean Lennon who was five years younger than me and wondered what he must be thinking.</p>
<p>In 1979 Beatlemania gripped me and my mates as the BBC broadcasted all the Beatles films: A Hard Days Night, footage of the Washington gig in 1964, the 1965 Shea Stadium concert, Help!, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine and Let it Be. (This was the last showing to date for Shea Stadium and Let it Be.) It was amazing. My friend Sean and I formed a band, calling it the Bronze Beatles. I had got a guitar the previous Christmas but couldn’t play yet and we made a drum kit from chocolate boxes, drew guitars and sang songs from Help! (Sean’s Dad had the LP). I wanted nothing more than to be a Beatle and live in Help!</p>
<p>That Christmas my brother and I got a tape recorder for Christmas. We had two blank tapes. I filled them up by recording my dad’s Beatle LPs and singles by placing the take recorder as close to the record player’s speaker as possible and telling my brother to be quiet.</p>
<p>In January 1980 my Mum and Dad hosted a Burns night super. My Dad had got some Highland music records and he wanted them on cassette tape to play in the stereo system they’d borrowed. He had to tape over my copy of Help! It would be five years later later before I’d saved up enough money to buy my own vinyl copy. But my Dad got me a tape of the Beatles Rock ‘n’ Roll Music volume two to make up for it which gave me some new songs I’d never heard before such as I’m Down, Any Time at All and the brilliant Hey Bulldog.</p>
<p>Up until then I’d only had access to a few Beatles tunes. My Dad had three Beatle LPs and I inherited (or rather, I sneaked out of his collection and into mine). There was <em>Beatles for Sale</em> (their 4th LP from late 1964), <em>With the Beatles</em>, their 2nd LP, from 1963 and <em>Revolver</em>, their 7th, from 1966. He also had the EP <em>Twist and Shout</em> which contained four songs stripped away from their first LP, <em>Please Please Me</em> and the singles <em>She Loves You, I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> and <em>Day Tripper/We Can Work it Out.</em></p>
<p>My Dad had a Bush single speaker mono record player. It played 45s, 33&amp;1/3s and 78 rpm records. You could stack up a few singles on the spindle and it would play one and then another would drop into place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aydinstone.com/john68-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="John Lennon 1968" src="http://www.aydinstone.com/john68-1.jpg" alt="John Lennon 1968 by Ayd Instone" width="240" height="251" /></a>I discovered the record player at a very early age and rifled through my Dad’s collection of records. He had a handful of singles, most from the early sixties. Quite a few LPs, mostly Johnny Mathis, Herb Albert, the odd Sinatra and Dylan plus a bit of classical. I ignored all these. I was drawn to those four faces that stared out at me from the gatefold cover of <em>Beatles for Sale</em>. I knew that they were the same faces as those on With the Beatles. I found out they were called John, Paul, George and Ringo, but there was nothing on the sleeve to say which was which so I had to guess. My mind worked out that since they looked younger on With the Beatles and that it was in black and white, it must be the first album, perhaps preceded by <em>Twist and Shout</em> &#8211; also in black and white, but smaller. Then must come <em>Beatles for Sale</em> because that was in colour and a gatefold. But what about <em>Revolver</em>? That was in black and white but looked quite odd. The music was slightly different too. It was 1973. I was nearly 3. I surmised that <em>With the Beatles</em> was the past, <em>Beatles for Sale</em> was the present and <em>Revolver</em> was from the future.</p>
<p>An earlier thought I had about the Beatles was that my Dad was John Lennon. The evidence was the photo on <em>Twist and Shout</em> looked just like him and the message of <em>We Can Work it Out</em>  I felt expressed he ethos of my Dad. That was obviously a short lived theory.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until around 1976 that I found out that the Beatles weren’t still together. The re-issue singles were in the chart, as was Lennon’s solo <em>Stand By Me</em> and <em>Imagine</em> singles. From that point, like every other Beatle fan in the world, I’d been hoping and longing for that reunion.</p>
<p>Years later we learnt that John had planned to visit the UK in early 1981 and the four Beatles had agreed upon a reunion recording, perhaps a performance too, that year and had sworn secrecy on the details. All hope was dashed with the news on that December day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aydinstone.com/john65.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="John Lennon 1965" src="http://www.aydinstone.com/john65.jpg" alt="John Lennon 1965 by Ayd Instone" width="120" height="165" /></a>I’ve read loads of accounts of the Beatles and their lives in the hundreds of books published on the topic. There is a strange feeling reading the details of that fateful day, about John’s sessions at the Record Plant studio, of the killer’s meeting with Lennon earlier in the day where he signed a copy of <em>Double Fantasy</em> (there’s a photo of the two of them together). As I read the details and it all becomes more and more real I start to feel as though I can change the outcome somehow, as if the history of has not been decided. I meet John outside the recording studio and urge him not to go home straight away that night, then I wait near the Dakota building as dusk falls and spot the killer, tackle him, call the police, anything.</p>
<p>But history doesn’t work like that. It felt as though there was so much more of the Beatles story to tell, so much more songs to come. As it must be the same as with anyone who loses someone, anyone, it feels as though we’re cheated by being given an alternative, grimmer history that the one we were promised. People older than me have said that the Sixties finally ended that day and the dreams of their youth were over. You can mourn a man you never met if what he stood for was an important personal idea. It was that idea that died that night.</p>
<p>Some people say the Beatles, and Lennon, aren’t important. They’re wrong. Derek Taylor described them as ‘the 20th Century’s greatest romance’ and he’s right. We still don’t know why or how it all happened, but it did, and for a short while, many, many people in the world shared something. It represented probably the last great collective memory, a potent beam of optimism, hope and fun, that touched so many lives in so many ways.</p>
<p>On 8th December 1980 the world was reminded that we are all mortal, ugly, vicious, spiteful and powerless. But there is still hope. We can still put on a Beatle record and find that the magic is still there, divorced from time and space, separated from the mortal men that created it.</p>
<p>There IS joy to be sought and cherished in life no matter what undesired twists and turns we face.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://abttorres.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/steak-strips-and-mashed-potatoes-photo-by-aileen-torres.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-337" title="Steak strips and mashed potatoes (Photo by Aileen Torres)" src="http://abttorres.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/steak-strips-and-mashed-potatoes-photo-by-aileen-torres.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">For the steak:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">1/2 steak (or a whole one, if you want a larger portion)<br />
1 garlic clove<br />
1/3 large onion<br />
5-7 grape tomatoes<br />
1 chipotle pepper</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Heat up your choice of oil in a medium skillet. Dice the garlic and sauté. Slice the onion into thin strips, and cut the grape tomatoes in half, then caramelize the onions and tomatoes.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Slice the steak into thin strips. Once you see the onions and tomatoes start to brown, add the steak to the skillet. Dice the chipotle and add. Cover the skillet and cook on medium heat for about 20 min. After 10 min., add a dash of red wine.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">For the potatoes:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">3 small red potatoes<br />
2-3 inches of pork belly<br />
1-2 garlic cloves<br />
1/3 large onion<br />
kale<br />
salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Cut the potatoes into quarters and boil them in a small pot. When the potatoes are soft, turn off the heat and mash them.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Dice the garlic and sauté in a large skillet. Slice the onion into thin strips and caramelize.  Slice the pork belly and sauté.  Chop the kale and cook until it wilts, then add the mashed potatoes to the skillet and mix the ingredients thoroughly. Add as much salt and pepper as you like.</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Place the mashed potatoes with kale on a plate and shape into a round platform (see photo), then place the steak strips on top. Pour yourself a glass of red wine, and you&#8217;re good. Serves 1.</p>

<p>2. Express their extreme annoyance at this work day today and hint that it deserves a much needed alcoholic beverage at the end of it. WINK WINK.</p>
<p>3. Thank their hubby for being the best hubby in the world while their hubby is sitting right next to them.</p>
<p>4. Complain about bad service at restaurants. &#8220;Never eating at Applebee&#8217;s AGAIN!&#8221;</p>
<p>5. Express their extreme excitement to see their best friends tonight, Brintney, Whitney, and Sarah!!! Love YOU GIRLS!!</p>
<p>6. Take pictures wearing a lot of makeup and looking really preppy while simultaneously making a &#8220;hard&#8221; facial expression and holding up what they consider to be a gangster sign. Potential caption: &#8216;Straight thuggin.&#8217;</p>

<p>8. Make their status the song lyrics of any Kings of Leon Song.</p>
<p>9. Take a picture of someone they deem inferior to themselves in some way with the question: Really?</p>
<p>10. Write angry letters to companies (Dear EZ PARK, I hate you!), unorganized groups of people (Dear slutty freshmen who think that leggings can be worn as pants..), and non-entities (Dear unseasonably cold weather, WTF?!)</p>
<p>11. Subtly yell at no one in particular while being <em>very specific</em>. &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s hard to believe that you think you know someone and then they turn around and STAB YOU IN THE BACK. Will never make that mistake again. EVER.&#8221;</p>
<p>12. Document exceedingly mundane activites for the day. &#8220;Getting my oil changed today. Then getting much needed groceries. Then it&#8217;s off to the post office to mail some bills. Then stopping by the gyno. Will probably need some gas by the end, so I may stop at the gas station. But I might be tired so I&#8217;ll probably just get it in the morning on my way to pick up a prescription. But if I&#8217;m not very tired I&#8217;ll probably just get the gas on the way home. Again, unless I am tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>13. Express their distaste for facebook on facebook and threaten to leave facebook to their facebook friends.</p>
<p>14. Ask seemingly rhetorical questions. &#8220;It&#8217;s cool to do a bunch of meth and babysit 20 six year olds, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>15. Write a status in another language. Parce que, Je suis tres intelligente!!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Mary. A white girl on facebook, guilty of most of these things.</p>
<p>**My friend Matt Damon (aka Kaitlin) collaborated on the trends of facebook with me. A much more detailed version will be in our book we&#8217;re writing. Which will be published&#8230;.one day&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December 3rd 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written on Day 3 at Velidhoo</strong></p>
<p>A shoal of banner fish glide a few feet away from me. Their striking colours of white and black making geometric patterns in the absolutely clear blue Maldivian waters. I reach out my arm to touch them, but they move away effortlessly. I regret that I&#8217;m only in snorkelling gear and unable to admire the brilliant abundance of sea-life in the depths they live in.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. My diving day will come soon.</em></p>
<p>As a part of <a href="http://www.tinyislandvolunteers.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Island Volunteers, Maldives,</a> we are expected to behave with decorum, and set an example for the island community we are based in. Our mission is marine conservation, but we are also expected to teach English and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Our welcome reception on 1st December on the island of Velidhoo, in the Noonu atoll, left nothing to be desired. Brad Pitt could not have elicited a more pompous ceremony. Our speedboat docked to the sound of loud-speakers and music, school children dressed in their best holding out garlands of sweet-smelling jasmine. Town councillors and other officials all lined up to greet the island&#8217;s first marine conservationists from abroad. Expectations are high but can we live up to it? By &#8220;we&#8221;, I mean Louise, Stefan, Penny and I, all UK volunteers.</p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9" title="The Welcome" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg?w=216&#038;h=300" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10" title="The Welcome 2" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>Getting to this island took all of 2 days from the UK. After a night in Male, Jo (a fellow Tiny Islands volunteer who I teamed up with at Gatwick) and I boarded a speedboat to Naifaru island where she disembarked to join the turtle project there. Another speedboat journey with the other three volunteers finds me on this 2500-populated island with gorgeous yet simple people.</p>
<p>We are put up in a 3 bedroomed house &#8211; perfect for the four of us as Penny and Stefan are a couple. The heat and humidity is made bearable by ceiling fans in every room, but the climate is stuffy and draining. I&#8217;ve settled down to the theory part of my of diving course, but the other three are already experienced divers, particularly Louise. As marine conservationists, we are expected to &#8220;fish-watch&#8221; and this is best done whilst diving at different depths.</p>
<p>The food is mainly Maldivian, with Indian, Chinese and European influence &#8211; it has not been disappointing so far. Incidentally, the restaurant we have our meals in appears to be the favourite meeting place of locals who gather there for coffee and &#8220;faur&#8221; (local snack made from betel leaves, cloves and nuts).</p>
<p>Its our third day, and we have just returned from a day&#8217;s picnic to a little uninhabited island, a reward for our first day&#8217;s hard sessions of snorkelling/diving the day before. Here, we were finally able to shed most of our restrictive clothing &#8211; Maldives as a strict Muslim country frowns on exposure. The reefs around the island are a snorkelers dream; coconuts straight off the tree are fresh and delicious, our fun only shadowed by unrelenting attacks from swarms of mosquitoes.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. Nothing can spoil this gorgeous day.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15" title="IMG_3046" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Back at Velidhoo, we gather tonight with the heads of various clubs for a meeting to brainstorm on ideas on how to celebrate World Volunteering Day on Monday the 5th of December, ways of getting the whole community involved and becoming more environmentally aware. The local heads are eager and surprisingly full of ideas &#8211; an encouraging sign and positive move forward in the right direction.</p>
<p>I am content and raring to make an impact. The community is poised, full of anticipation, and set to advance thanks to the enlightened work of the <a href="http://www.velidhoofuturefoundation.org/" target="_blank">VFF &#8211; Velidhoo Future Foundation</a> who have teamed up with Tiny Islands and the <a href="http://lazygeckomaldives.com/velidhoo.html" target="_blank">Lazy Gecko Diving</a> Centre to raise standards of living and environmental awareness on the island. Together, we are committed to the goal of helping the town make best use its natural resources &#8211; the sea and the sun &#8211; to the optimal. The island has a beautiful future ahead, and can be an example to the rest of the country.</p>
<p><em>Our work is just beginning.</em></p>
