				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/occupy_0.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Occupy anniversary" src="http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/occupy_0.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="272" /></a>I mean: is Occupy now one year old?  Is it still around?  Is it unified?</p>
<p>A year ago on September 17, the Occupation of Zuccotti Park began, with a beautiful poster and far less participation and promise than it soon showed.  Journalists and activists want to make sense of what&#8217;s left now that the Occupations are gone.  There will be commemorations and evaluations everywhere.  (I participated in one yesterday at <em><a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/occupy-wall-st/lasting-legacy-occupy-wall-street-remains-unclear" target="_blank">Marketplace;  </a></em>the 20 minute interview condensed to 5-7, which is how these things go.)</p>
<p>Most evaluations are unlikely to be very optimistic.  Occupations across the United States&#8211;and around the world, were surprising, very visible, disruptive, and unpredictable.  The organization was confusing to outsiders, and the goals of the occupations were hard to <img class="alignright" title="Occupy wall street" src="http://www.enduringamerica.com/storage/blog-post-images/OCCUPY%20WALL%20STREET%20BALLERINA%20BULL.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320144095051" alt="" width="182" height="276" />pin down, not the least because activists differed in both their ultimate objectives and in their visions of how to achieve them.  Occupations saw their diversity as a strength, and were reluctant to adopt organizations that silenced or back burnered anyone.  In the name of democracy and horizontalism, nothing very specific came to the fore.  But critics were reluctant to acknowledge the very clear concerns with political and economic inequality.</p>
<p>The unwieldy and time consuming governance at the Occupations made it hard for Occupiers to agree on anything beyond continuing their encampments, and local governments refused to let them do so. <a href="http://politicsoutdoors.com/2012/04/30/occupy-on-may-day/" target="_blank">Once the occupations ended</a>, Occupy was a lot harder for journalists to cover and to make sense of, and much less visible to a broader public.  To be sure, meetings and actions continued, but without an overarching unity.  And if you weren&#8217;t following the right sites or plugged into an active network, Occupy just slipped from visibility.</p>
<p>Elections crowd out social movements in America, sucking up attention, activists, and money.  Many people redirect their efforts from issues to candidates, compromising a message for a messenger.</p>
<p>The Tea Party, still visible in national politics, mostly through a few Washington-based groups and the Republican Party, has made this move vigorously.  With some disappointment, Tea Party organizations and activists have embraced their 29th choice for the Republican nomination, Governor Mitt Romney because, whatever his flaws, they see him as preferable to another term of President Obama.</p>
<p>Occupy activists were determined not to let this happen, to face a fate like that of the movement that helped provoke them, to wind up sucked in and sold out by a politician who would use them offering only slight reforms.  They refused to build formal organizations, open national offices, or endorse candidates, emphasizing the grassroots as an alternative approach.  But there are risks associated with that strategy as well: lack of a clear message, lack of visibility, difficulties in mobilizing broadly, and difficulties in influencing mainstream politics.  That&#8217;s what we now see.</p>
<p>So, activists are trying to use the anniversary to revivify Occupy&#8211;or at least remind Americans that they and their concerns are still out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://s17nyc.org/schedule/s17/" target="_blank">#S17NYC</a>, representing the 99 percent, will work to resume an Occupation &#8220;with non-violent civil disobedience and flood the area around it with a roving carnival of resistance.&#8221;  Several groups have already turned out to protest, and police have arrested <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/15/occupy-wall-street-anniversary-arrests-ows_n_1887421.html" target="_blank">dozens of would-be Occupiers in New York City and elsewhere</a>.  The authorities will certainly be better prepared and less tolerant of Occupations than they were a year earlier.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Occupiers return" src="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/reuters/2012-09-15t195704z_1372910904_gm1e89g0ary01_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="300" />It will be hard to re-raise a mass movement during the last phase of the electoral campaign, but Occupy campaigns across the country will continue to search for events and issues that will spark the imagination in the same way that the first Occupation did.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thousands of young people cut their political teeth sleeping outside in public spaces around the United States.  They&#8217;re not done, even if we don&#8217;t see what they&#8217;re doing now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, guys.  I realize it&#8217;s September.  The past two months I&#8217;ve been trapped in an anxious aestivation of moving apartments, stolen cameras, and appliances in an endless state of disrepair.  It&#8217;s been rough.  But it hasn&#8217;t been all bad; things have been moving at least, perhaps even too fast to warrant written (or photographed) records of each item eaten, each adventure endeavored.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the muggy weight of Summer had disappeared and I found myself plunged feet-first into Fall.  I painted my new kitchen a comforting shade of verdigris.  I bought pants to replace all those I tore into shorts a few months ago (I still don&#8217;t like pants).  I find myself with a hot coffee between my hands more often than iced.  Such are the signs.</p>
<div id="attachment_647" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/donutbite1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-647" title="donutbite" src="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/donutbite1.jpg?w=500&h=466" alt="" width="500" height="466" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">apple cider doughnuts with maple sugar</p></div>
<p>And the next idea hit me like a well-positioned bag of leaves to the gut: apple cider doughnuts.  Natives to farmers&#8217; markets and apple orchards, why shouldn&#8217;t this delectable dessert/breakfast be immediately available to ME, in my OWN kitchen?  Ian brought back a pound of maple sugar from Vermont, and it was obvious that this would find a home atop them.  With a recipe adapted from Smitten Kitchen, I took a stab at my first fried doughnut, and I&#8217;m confident you could accomplish the same minor feat at home.  All you might need is a pot big enough for a couple quarts of oil, and maybe a doughnut cutter if you live close enough to a kitchen supply store.  Or a big and lil&#8217; cookie cutter if you don&#8217;t.  Make do.  No one should be denied doughnuts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<p><strong>Apple Cider Doughnuts with Maple Sugar</strong><br />
makes 16 doughnuts and 16 doughnut holes</p>
<p>1 cup apple cider<br />
3 3/4 cups flour, plus some extra smatterings for working<br />
2 tsp baking powder<br />
1 tsp baking soda<br />
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<br />
1/2 tsp salt<br />
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg<br />
4 Tbsp butter (1/2 a stick), room temp. or a lil&#8217; melty<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1/2 cup buttermilk<br />
peanut oil for frying</p>
<p>1/2 cup maple sugar (or cinnamon sugar if you want to make it: 1/2 cup sugar + 2 tsp cinnamon)</p>
<p>There are a couple of tricks for successful donuteering:</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t be afraid to smother it with some extra flour to make the dough workable and less sticky.  You will know what I mean when you get there.<br />
- Be patient with the time it needs to spend in the freezer/fridge chilling out.  You will be much happier with the shape and not-falling-apart-ness of your doughnuts.<br />
- Oil.  Peanut&#8217;s kinda not too bad for you, and if you filter all the solids out afterwards you can save it for another frying batch later.  You want 2-3 inches of oil in your pot, so choose a pot that&#8217;s not going to be so wide that this is hard, or an extremely large amount of oil.  I used about a quart and a half total.  When you heat the oil, use a thermometer if you have one, or rip one of the doughnut holes into a piece or two and throw one in periodically to see how it cooks.  You want it to take about a minute to reach the deep golden brown on the outside.  Any faster and it may not cook inside, and any slower and it&#8217;ll be overcooked.  Keep an eye on the heat throughout to make sure the cook time stays constant.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&#8217;re good to go:</p>
<p>1) Put the apple cider over medium-low heat and reduce to a quarter of the volume, about 1/4 cup.  Just let a bunch of the water evaporate until it&#8217;s just concentrated appley goodness.  Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>2) In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg.</p>
<p>3) In a large bowl, combine sugar and soft butter.  Take your spatula and smush them around until they&#8217;re incorporated into a paste.  Add the eggs and beat it around until you have a smooth, yellow soup.</p>
<p>4) Add the cooled reduced apple cider and buttermilk and stir to combine.  Add the flour mixture to the larger bowl a little at a time, mixing with the spatula until a shaggy dough comes together.</p>
<p>5) Set out some parchment paper and toss some flour over them.  BE GENEROUS.  This stuff will like to stick and you do not want it to.  Turn the dough onto your sheet and press with your hands until evenly flat, until a little less than 1/2 inch thick.  Put parchment paper onto a baking sheet and slide into the freezer for 15-20 minutes, until the dough is chilled and firm.</p>
<p>6) Remove from freezer and start cutting out your doughnuts.  I used a 3 inch cutter, but if you have cookie cutters, use a 3 inch cutter and a lil&#8217; 1 inch one (or shot glass???) to cut out the inside.  You should get one hole for every doughnut, unless you&#8217;ve managed to unlock some weird other dimension of doughnutry.  I somehow ended up with 16 doughnuts and 17 holes &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Transfer cut doughnuts to another floured sheet of parchment paper and freeze again 15-20 minutes.  You can re-roll and re-roll your scraps of dough to get as many doughnuts as possible out of this equation.</p>
<div id="attachment_642" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/280966893112277248_14381677.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-642" title="280966893112277248_14381677" src="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/280966893112277248_14381677.jpeg?w=500&h=500" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">all cut up</p></div>
<p>7) Pour oil into your skillet/pot/whatever up to about 2-3 inches.  Heat over medium until it&#8217;s hot and ready, about 350°F.  Or until you plop a little doughnut guy in there and he immediately starts to bubble.  If it sinks to the bottom and nothing happens &#8230; your oil is not hot enough.  If you&#8217;re wary though, get a thermometer.  If it starts to smoke, turn that shit off and do not burn down your house.</p>
<div id="attachment_643" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/280973460444428595_14381677.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-643" title="280973460444428595_14381677" src="http://breakfastbachelor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/280973460444428595_14381677.jpeg?w=500&h=500" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">watch &#8216;em fry (but really don&#8217;t take your eyes off them)</p></div>
<p>8) Plop a few doughnut holes in to start, and to get the hang of it.  You don&#8217;t want to crowd the pan.  Let them cook 45-60 seconds on one side, and then turn them over to cook on the other for 30-45.  Transfer with a slotted spoon or something to a cooling rack equipped with a few layers of paper towel.  Roll in a little dish of your maple sugar while still somewhat hot and oily.  Proceed to cooking the rest of your doughnuts.  YOU&#8217;RE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Goodbye to the beat</h3>
<p>The first “beat reporters” were probably the men sent by newspapers to hang around the criminal courts in the early 19th century. Today almost every news outlet is organized around fixed beats: “financial markets”, “real estate”, &#8220;technology&#8221;, and so on. These are now so ingrained that we see them as an actual description of reality—the things the world is made of.</p>
<p>Yet the <strong>beats aren&#8217;t so much an objective taxonomy as a convenient management tool, </strong>devised for an old technology. When news came in a sheaf of pages it made sense to divide them into sections—domestic, foreign, business, and so on—with an editor and a team of writers for each one, and make each writer responsible for a slice of that section: a beat. Matching people to pages made managing the newspaper easier, and covering all the news in each beat allowed it to be comprehensive—which was how it could appeal to the most readers and get the most sales.</p>
<p>Online, however, trying to be the one comprehensive publication makes no sense. Readers can browse hundreds of news sites at no extra cost. That drives the sites to specialise. Yet most still structure themselves around fixed sections and beats. Slide your mouse across the navigation bar at the top of almost any news site, and there they are, the phantom limbs of the newspaper creatures of old. It hasn&#8217;t occurred to them that <strong>when there are no pages and sections to constrain you, you are free to reframe your description of reality too.</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="http://qz.com" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, we&#8217;ll try to fit the framework to the audience. We want to reach a global, cosmopolitan crowd, people who see themselves as living &#8220;in the world&#8221;. They are keenly aware of how distant events influence one another; their lives and careers are subject to constant disruption from changes in technology and the global economy.</p>
<p>So instead of fixed beats, <strong>we structure our newsroom around an ever-evolving collection of phenomena</strong>—the patterns, trends and seismic shifts that are shaping the world our readers live in. &#8220;Financial markets&#8221; is a beat, but &#8220;the financial crisis&#8221; is a phenomenon. &#8220;The environment&#8221; is a beat, but &#8220;climate change&#8221; is a phenomenon. “Energy” is a beat, but “the global surge of energy abundance” is a phenomenon. “China” is a beat, but “Chinese investment in Africa” is a phenomenon. <strong>We call these phenomena our &#8220;obsessions&#8221;</strong>. These are the kinds of topics Quartz will put in its navigation bar, and as the world changes, so will they.</p>
<h3>Seeing like people, not like organisations</h3>
<p>This is both a practical and a philosophical shift. Practical, because reporting these themes within a traditional beat structure is difficult: they often cut across beat boundaries, taking in politics, economics, technology, and other issues. Our journalists have to be, to some extent, all-rounders, who aren&#8217;t afraid to get outside their usual expertise and track the topic they&#8217;re following wherever it leads.</p>
<p>And philosophical, because it means changing what might (a little pretentiously) be called the phenomenology of journalism. Phenomenology is about how we structure our  experience of the world. Beats provide an institutional structure. Obsessions are a more human one.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is that when people notice a change in the world around them—a phenomenon—they don&#8217;t care what beat it belongs to; they just want to know what caused it. The institutional framework answers the question like the blind men in the Indian parable who are brought an elephant and asked to say what it is. The one who touches the elephant&#8217;s leg says it is a pillar or tree trunk, the one who feels the tail declares it to be a rope, and so on. But to unpack something like the financial crisis you can&#8217;t simply talk about securities, interest rates and banking regulation; to understand China&#8217;s activities in other parts of the world you need to be more than just a China specialist; to comprehend climate change you need science, economics, domestic and international politics, and more besides. <strong>To explain the world&#8217;s big phenomena you need to see (or feel) the whole elephant</strong>.</p>
<h3>Quartz&#8217;s wicked problem</h3>
<p>Doing this is hard, of course. It&#8217;s hard firstly because our institutions—academic, governmental, journalistic—create specialists. It takes time for someone to learn enough about each specialism to do good work that cuts across them. It&#8217;s hard secondly because while beats are pretty well established, reasonable people may disagree on what does and doesn&#8217;t count as a &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; worth paying attention to, or where its boundaries should lie.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s because of a third difficulty: <strong>A lot of the phenomena we want to look at are so-called &#8220;<a href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/tackling-wicked-problems">wicked problems</a>&#8220;</strong>, a term used in policy and management studies. Jay Rosen of NYU, who has written thought-provokingly about how journalists might report on them, outlined the <a href="http://pressthink.org/2012/06/covering-wicked-problems/#p4" target="_blank">traits of a wicked problem</a> thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is hard to say what the problem is, to define it clearly or to tell where it stops and starts. There is no “right” way to view the problem, no definitive formulation. There are many stakeholders, all with their own frames, which they tend to see as exclusively correct. Ask what the problem is and you will get a different answer from each. Someone can always say that the problem is just a symptom of another problem and that someone will not be wrong. The problem is inter-connected to a lot of other problems; pulling them apart is almost impossible. In a word: it’s a mess.</p></blockquote>
<p>Climate change is the archetypal wicked problem, but there are lots of others, like obesity, domestic violence, the drug trade, and certain epidemics. And then there are phenomena that are not necessarily problems, but are complex in the same wicked way: demographic change, the shifting role of the state, the long-term effects of the financial crisis. Even once you&#8217;ve identified a phenomenon worth covering, how do you make it manageable? How do you decide where it starts and ends? How do you follow it as an incrementally evolving news story while also helping your audience grasp the bigger picture?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Quartz will have to figure out. Reframing news in this way is its own wicked problem. Let&#8217;s see how we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bettysbrownies.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/boardwalk-empire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-992" title="Boardwalk Empire" src="http://bettysbrownies.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/boardwalk-empire.jpg?w=300&h=171" alt="" width="300" height="171" /></a>This is a big week for &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221;&#8211;its second season just appeared on Blu-Ray/DVD, and this Sunday will see the premiere of its third season on HBO. I&#8217;m curious as to the direction the show will take at this point, after the murder of one of its leading characters. Jimmy Darmody was no hero, but we saw much of the &#8220;Boardwalk&#8221; world through his eyes. He&#8217;s not easily replaced.</p>
<p>When my Season 2 set arrived from Amazon, I immediately cued up the most notorious episode the show has aired to date: <a title="Under God's Power" href="https://bettysbrownies.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/boardwalk-empire-what-a-ride/" target="_blank">&#8220;Under God&#8217;s Power She Flourishes,&#8221; </a>when all is revealed&#8212;and then some&#8212;about Gillian and Jimmy&#8217;s relationship. What a heartbreak this is, from the very beginning when we hear Angela&#8217;s &#8220;Jimmy, I&#8217;ve got to leave,&#8221; as if in a dream. And then to see Jimmy as a teen-ager, before his service in World War I, before all the killing we&#8217;d already seen him commit. If you&#8217;d like to know what a fine work &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; really is, watch this episode again, this time with the excellent commentary of among others, Gretchen Mol (who for the record was as icked out as the rest of us by Gillian&#8217;s behavior). Then go back and watch Season 1 from start to finish, and you&#8217;ll find that the show&#8217;s creators were amazingly consistent in character development with respect to Jimmy, Gillian and Angela. I suspect they had &#8220;Under God&#8217;s Power She Flourishes&#8221; in mind from the inception of the show, but waited until just the right time to pull that rabbit out of the hat.</p>
<p>Watching Season 1 again is seeing Jimmy lose his humanity, bit by bit, over the course of time. He&#8217;s genuinely contrite&#8212;he even has tears in his eyes&#8212;when he apologizes to Nucky about the booze robbery in the woods gone wrong that left five Rothstein accomplices dead.  After he flees to Chicago and sees his favorite prostitute have her face cut up by a rival gang member, he starts his slide. For the remainder of Season 1, Thug Jimmy and Compassionate Jimmy alternate. He beats the boardwalk photographer, Dittrich, unmercifully while Angela and Tommy look on in terror, yet he takes Angela back after her abortive attempt to run away with Mary Dittrich. Throughout this season and the next, we&#8217;re constantly reminded of what the war did to Jimmy, and when we ultimately learn the full extent of the damage his mother caused, it&#8217;s no surprise to see him welcome death at Nucky&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>After Season 1, &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; lost a good deal of its social scope&#8212;no more WCTU, suffragettes, the original Ponzi scheme, incubator babies or those Margaret Sanger pamphlets on birth control. Season 2 saw Jimmy&#8217;s murder and the loss of an intriguingly complex character whom we could alternately sympathize with and be repulsed by. These are important subtractions from a show that can easily become just a Jazz Age version of &#8220;The Sopranos.&#8221; &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; needs to go back to what made it so intriguing in its first season&#8212;the character development against a strong social and political backdrop. The good news is Chalky White is still on the scene, hopefully along with more discussion of the significant African-American presence in Atlantic City. I&#8217;d like to see more politics, especially since the new season skips ahead in time to 1923, when the Teapot Dome Scandal breaks and Nucky&#8217;s friends in Washington are about to go down. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212;I could watch Michael Stuhlbarg as Arnold Rothstein outsmart everyone for hours at a time&#8212;but I&#8217;d like to see more of Atlantic City in its hey day. In other words, more Eddie Cantor, fewer blood baths.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed for Sunday&#8217;s premiere. I hope I&#8217;m not disappointed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In search of something to read this fine Sunday afternoon, I picked up a book I bought for five dollars the other weekend, a hopefully-not-too dry Anthropology collection from forty-five years ago. Opening it up to a random page, I found that familiar, but increasingly rare fragrance: the scent of old book.</p>
<div style="width:image width px;font-size:80%;text-align:center;">

</div>
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to describe the smell, it&#8217;s just &#8212; old book. My lack of descriptive power tells you all you need to know about why I don&#8217;t make my living as a creative writer. What can I say? It smells good. It&#8217;s a little bit chemical, a little bit dusty. It smells like old paper, old good paper. Old letters smell like that, too. Old newspaper clippings, I think, don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It smells like my grandmother, too, like the smell of her clothes folded neatly and tucked into her dresser way back when I was little, and she still lived with us. It&#8217;s the smell of the drawer of her bedside table, filled with her rosary and novena booklets, prayer cards and usually a romance novel. </p>
<p>Some of my mother&#8217;s clothes had that smell, clothes she had in the Philippines. Little peach dresses and beautiful, translucent camisa blouses, or <em>baro</em>, with their elaborate embroidery. I used to try the camisas on, hoping for a chance to wear them some day. I don&#8217;t think I ever did.</p>

Hers were made of embroidered material like the shirts on the right.<br />The top blouse is made of <em>jusi</em> (silk now, but originally banana fiber); the bottom one is made of piña (fiber from pineapple leaves).

<p>I remember being with a friend a few years ago, as she unpacked a box of goodies sent over by relatives in Punjab. The box was filled with the 2-meter-or-so long bright colorful stoles called <em>dupattas</em>, along with boxes of bangles and packets of bindis, <em>parandis</em> for our hair. I lifted out a multicolored tie-dyed <em>dupatta</em> and waved it open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smells like India,&#8221; another friend commented. I had been thinking it smelled like the Philippines. It was <em>that</em> smell.</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>I used to think of it as the smell as mothballs, I guess because of my grandmother. But it can&#8217;t be that, because why would books smell of mothballs? It isn&#8217;t India, it isn&#8217;t the Philippines. Or I should say, it isn&#8217;t <em>only</em> India, and not just the Philippines. It&#8217;s the smell of Somewhere Else. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also the scent of memories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I applied for a runner position at NBC News for the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I just knew that I had to be one of those 15,000-something journalists getting in on a piece of history.</p>
<p>Getting behind the scenes on a political convention can be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some people. The Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention only happen once every four years and unless you have an in, like a media pass, you might never make it past the temporary concrete boundaries and fences set up by local police.</p>
<p>A runner, according to Manager of News Partnerships for NBC and my supervisor at the RNC, Kim Grabina-Como, is a “glorified intern.” You get paid, you only work for a short time frame (in my case, eight days), and you are able to work with a national news network. Currently, regular interns at NBC News aren’t paid, Grabina-Como said, but the network is changing that in 2013.</p>
<p>For anybody who wants to get into the industry, it&#8217;s a way to see stuff from behind the scenes. “You see the good, the bad and the ugly. It gives you a real, true feel for it in the fact that if this is the industry you want to get into, you can see it for what it is,” Grabina-Como said.</p>
<p>I got assigned to MSNBC’s set at the Channelside District in Tampa for the RNC.</p>
<p>You see on-air talent without their makeup and coming to set frustrated by traffic and the stress of such a large production. Supervisors, production managers, and other runners snap at each other on occasion when they’re overwhelmed and stressed out and you have to let it slide off your back-  it’s not personal. I spent one lunch break in the tiny bathroom in the temporary MSNBC command center at Channelside bawling my eyes out for getting yelled at by a supervisor for not having my cell phone on me, though I’d been upfront with them two days earlier when I broke it. Long days kept me from seeking a replacement- the AT&amp;T store opened after I got on set and closed long before I left. It teaches you to have a thicker skin, which you’re going to need in the industry if you want to make it.</p>
<p>On the flip-side, I got to network with media professionals, pass out some of my new business cards, and goof off at the Goggle+ Hangout at the Tampa</p>
<div id="attachment_2292" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://steampunkjournalist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/google-hangout-irl-rnc.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2292 " title="google hangout IRL RNC" src="http://steampunkjournalist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/google-hangout-irl-rnc.jpeg?w=300&h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dani and myself goofing off in the Google+ Hangout photobooth on a break.</p></div>
<p>Convention Center while I was on break. While there, I took advantage of their photobooth and grabbed some button swag to add to my growing collection.</p>
<p>That week, Tropical Storm Isaac also threatened to rush through with heavy wind and rains. It delayed the start of the convention by one day but ended up being a pretty typical Florida summer rainstorm but you still have to make sure TV screens, speakers, mics and other assortments of equipment are stored and being used where they can’t be damaged. Every gust of wind and hint of rain sent members of the production crew scurrying to cover and relocate equipment. You have to be prepared for weather changes during live shots.</p>
<p>Runners for NBC were required to sign a social media contract agreeing not to post photos, tweets, Facebook statuses or any other form of social communication about the specifics of their jobs. The purpose, Grabina-Como said, wasn’t to dissuade student journalists from using social media as a tool in their work. Unfortunately, while most 20-somethings know how to use social media tools, they don’t always have the discretion to use them professionally and during your time as a runner, you are an employee and representative of the news network you’re hired by.</p>
<p>I got this blog post approved, which I normally wouldn’t do in my day-to-day job as a journalist. However, I knew I wouldn’t be producing any content for the RNC as part of my position and I didn’t expect to even write this blog post.</p>
<p><strong>What you can expect as a runner</strong></p>
<p>Runners are there to assist network news stations in any way they are asked to make sure the production process goes smoothly. Sometimes your responsibilities are as basic as fetching food and coffee for on-air talent, managers and the production crew but every bit of help you offer helps make the production possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_2293" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://steampunkjournalist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/614617_10152093472990195_312315151_o-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2293 " title="614617_10152093472990195_312315151_o copy" src="http://steampunkjournalist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/614617_10152093472990195_312315151_o-copy.jpg?w=300&h=223" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sitting in for the Meet the Press on-air talent so that the production crew could test lighting, audio and camera angles.</p></div>
<p>Since I was a local, I was sent out in the rental car often to purchase and pick up things like studio chairs and supplies. I also dropped off press credentials at various hotels for other NBC employees and sat in for on-air talent before the convention while the photojournalists and production crew tested audio, lighting and camera angles. On my final day as a runner, I assisted with payroll paperwork for freelance production crew employees and helped clean up the temporary command center MSNBC called home for a couple weeks.</p>
<p>In between my assigned tasks, I connected with my fellow runners, students from various fields of study, and journalism professionals like my Twitter friend, Mark Luckie, the Manager of Journalism and News at Twitter.</p>
<p>Omar Jimenez, a broadcast journalism student at Northwestern University, was assigned to work in NBC news studio and to programs like Meet the Press, Nightly News and other specials.</p>
<p>“I had an opportunity to meet and talk to all those anchors,” Jimenez said. “I didn&#8217;t get a chance to do much journalism but just being around the people you want to work for one day, taking out trash, getting drinks and food and running errands, being around those people was great and I made a lot of connections.”</p>
<p>As a freelancer for local newspapers and news sites whose degree focused on print and online journalism, I was clueless as to what it takes to put together a live broadcast, especially for a major event like the RNC. It was eye-opening even for broadcast journalism students like Eric Burse, who studies at the University of Southern California:</p>
<p>“Before going there, I wouldn’t have known what exactly it means for a network to broadcast live from a location,” Burse said. “The technical operations, administrative stuff, workspaces, coordination from network to get everything going, especially with NBC and all their platforms. You can only learn so much from class and this was an opportunity that most college students in their four years don’t get.”</p>
<p><strong>Advice and tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’re going to work long hours, sometimes as many as 14+, so wear comfortable shoes. Dressy, flat baby doll shoes or nice sneakers for the ladies and comfortable dress shoes for men. I made the mistake of wearing dressy sandals one day and had to tend to my blisters for a week afterward.</li>
<li>Bring sunscreen. Many of us had to run errands between the Tampa Convention Center, Tampa Bay Times Forum and Channelside district. With the road closures and wait times for the shuttle, walking is easier but you risk sunburn without protection.</li>
<li>Lug around as little as possible. You won’t have time to keep an eye on your stuff and even a small purse or bag seems to weigh a ton after a long day of running errands.</li>
<li>Keep your phone handy, preferably one with a camera so you can document history in the making, so that your supervisors and fellow runners can touch base with you. Always have a notepad and pen at the ready to jot down notes and instructions and don’t forget to bring business cards to hand out to professionals you network with on your downtime.</li>
<li>Make sure your online portfolio, resume and LinkedIn profile are up-to-date and that all your social media profiles are professional prior to the convention, especially if you’re guiding people there via a business card. As budding journalists, you should be doing that anyway.</li>
<li>Do research about the network you were hired by. This tip comes from Grabina-Como who related a story about a runner being excited to meet Diane Sawyer. “She doesn’t work for us,” Grabina- Como said. Familiarize yourself with the specials and the on-air talent beforehand.</li>
<li>Have an open attitude.  Grabina-Como attended the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan as a runner for CBS News. “I went into the Olympics wanting to be a sports reporter and came out realizing there were so many other things I could do.”</li>
</ul>
<p>While several of the runners, most of whom were college students or recent graduates, were journalism or political science majors, not all aspired to work in politics or cover news one day. Their majors ranged from history to English.</p>
<p>“Even if you&#8217;re not interested in television journalism or political science, we had 52 runners that got an experience that few in your generation get,” Grabina-Como said. “It&#8217;s once every four years that you get the chance to be a part of something bigger.”</p>
<p>I encourage other journalism students and recent graduates to apply for runner positions with major news networks regardless of your journalism track. Expect to work until your legs and back ache, to go without sleep and drink way too much coffee, to be ordered around and yelled at for things beyond your control, and to be overwhelmed beyond imagination. If you can handle all of that, you’ve got what it takes to work in the industry.</p>
<p>Also, journalists are increasingly expected to know multimedia and convergence is no longer the future, but the present. What better way to experience that than as someone who gets to see it from the front line?</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This week the US lost an apparently highly skilled and much-loved diplomat to the vagaries of violent extremism and a weak central government, and, possibly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/us-envoy-to-libya-is-reported-killed.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all">the failure of the Foreign Service to adequately protect its Ambassador in the face of terrible upheaval</a> (including &#8220;a string of assassinations [in Benghazi] as well as attacks on international missions&#8221;).</p>
<p>The Libyan people responded to this horrific turn of events in a genuinely moving way, many spontaneously demonstrating in support of the United States and expressing their sorrow over Ambassador Chris Stevens&#8217;s murder. Signs read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/the-other-protest-in-libya/262308/">&#8220;Thugs and killers don&#8217;t represent Benghazi or Islam&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/emilylhauser/status/246010988892143616">&#8220;USA: We are sorry. We are sad.&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BentBenghazi/status/245948333804384256/photo/1">&#8220;Sorry people of America this is not the behavior of our Islam &amp; Prophet.&#8221;</a>  Words of condolence and statements of grief came pouring out, from the government to journalists to folks on Twitter and Facebook &#8212; these Libyans share our loss, and they wanted to make sure we know that they have no affection for those Libyans who attacked our consulate, ostensibly in reaction to an offensive film about the Prophet Muhammad (<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5irzV3mhzHowp-BNTb1QT4-lEHFng?docId=e292f17c57bf4d068c9c633767eb19bd">though signs are emerging that the attack may have been planned well in advance</a> [UPDATE 9/16/12: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/09/16/libyan-president-attack-on-u-s-consulate-was-premeditated/">US Ambassador to the UN says the attacks began spontaneously; the President of Libya disagrees</a>).</p>
<p>Today, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/world/middleeast/mideast-turmoil-spreads-to-us-embassy-in-yemen.html?pagewanted=all">hundreds of Yemenis stormed the embassy in the capital city of Sana'a</a>, in reaction to that very same offensive film.</p>
<p>You see, it turns out that Arabs and Muslims are as many and varied as any other set of humans.</p>
<p>Many Libyans hold the United States in affection and high regard, because America helped them gain their freedom from a terrible tyrant. We didn't roll in and push people aside, we helped the people already there to do what they wanted to do. Their new government is weak and (as the recent turmoil clearly indicates) not entirely well established, but Libyans can look behind and look ahead and see the potential for better -- and that's thanks to us. That's why <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/156539/Opinion-Briefing-Libyans-Eye-New-Relations-West.aspx">Libya has the highest approval rating for the United States in the Middle East and North Africa</a> outside of Israel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/166265/washingtons-war-yemen-backfires">as Jeremy Scahill reported for The Nation in February</a>, this is what we've been doing in Yemen:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[In the spring of 2011], rather than fighting AQAP [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula], US-backed units—created and funded with the explicit intent to be used only for counterterrorism operations—redeployed to Sanaa to protect the collapsing regime from its own people. The US-supported units exist “mostly for the defense of the regime,” says [Abdul Ghani al Iryani, a well-connected political analyst]&#8230;. President Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, acknowledged late last year that the “political tumult” has caused the US-trained units “to be focused on their positioning for internal political purposes as opposed to doing all they can against AQAP.”</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;Even as demonstrations grew against the Saleh regime, US officials praised his government’s cooperation. “I can say today the counterterrorism cooperation with Yemen is better than it’s been during my whole tenure,” Brennan declared in September.</em></p>
<p><em>But US counterterrorism policy is extremely unpopular in Yemen&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em>By last summer, the Obama administration had begun construction on a secret air base on the Arabian peninsula, closer than its base in Djibouti, that could serve as a launching pad for expanded drone strikes in Yemen. The September [2011] drone strike that killed US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki was reportedly launched from that new base, which analysts suspect is either in Saudi Arabia or Oman, both of which border Yemen&#8230;. The Americans have also provided real-time intelligence, obtained by drones, to Yemeni forces in [the hotly contested province of Abyan]. “It has been an active partnership. The Americans help primarily with logistics and intelligence,” [Gen. Mohammed al-Sumali] says. “Then we pound the positions with artillery or airstrikes.”</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;Some of the unilateral strikes have killed their intended targets, such as the CIA attack on Awlaki. But others have killed civilians—at times, a lot of civilians. And many of these have been in Abyan and its neighboring province of Shebwa, both of which have recently seen a substantial rise of AQAP activity. President Obama’s first known authorization of a missile strike on Yemen, on December 17, 2009, killed more than forty Bedouins, many of them women and children, in the remote village of al Majala in Abyan. Another US strike, in May 2010, killed an important tribal leader and the deputy governor of Marib province, Jabir Shabwani, sparking mass anger at the United States and {then-President] Saleh’s government. “I think these airstrikes were based on false intelligence from the regime, because that is the nature of the contractor,” [opposition leader Mohammad] Qahtan charges. “The contractor wants to create more work in return for earning more money.”</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;The October drone strike that killed Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, a US citizen, and his teenage cousin shocked and enraged Yemenis of all political stripes. “I firmly believe that the [military] operations implemented by the US performed a great service for Al Qaeda, because those operations gave Al Qaeda unprecedented local sympathy,” says [Abdul Rezzaq al Jamal, an independent Yemeni journalist]. The strikes “have recruited thousands.” Yemeni tribesmen, he says, share one common goal with Al Qaeda, “which is revenge against the Americans, because those who were killed are the sons of the tribesmen, and the tribesmen never, ever give up on revenge.” Even senior officials of the Saleh regime recognize the damage the strikes have caused. “People certainly resent these [US] interventions,” Qirbi, the foreign minister and a close Saleh ally, concedes.</em></p>
<p><em>For the United States, the most serious question that lingers over Yemen after [President] Ali Abdullah Saleh is: Did US counterterrorism policy strengthen the very threat it sought to eliminate? “It was a major fiasco,” Iryani says of the past decade of US counterterrorism policy in Yemen. “I think if we had been left alone, we would have less terrorists in Yemen than we do now.”</em></p>
<p>(Note: This is only a small portion of a truly excellent piece of reporting. I highly recommend that you read the whole thing &#8211; <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/166265/washingtons-war-yemen-backfires">click here</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>And just to be clear: President Saleh may have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/24/yemen-ali-abdullah-saleh-resigns">resigned last November</a>, but his family and cronies <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/24/yemen-ali-abdullah-saleh-resigns">still retain a firm grip on power</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/yemen-protests-continue-after-saleh">which is why Yemenis are still protesting</a>.</p>
<p>So it turns out that Yemenis and Libyans are autonomous actors, human beings who respond to others in a manner that reflects their relationship with those people.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many, many differences between the two countries, not least Libya&#8217;s much higher level of education and much lower rate of poverty, and all the complex, domino results that such factors create in two societies that are already very different. The position of women, life expectancy, the function of tribal alliances &#8212; all of these play different roles in each country.</p>
<p>But one simple thing may still be said: Help a nation topple a tyrant and reclaim their own power? They&#8217;ll probably like you. Help a tyrant kill his own enemies and then allow his power base to stay in control? The people he ruled might not like you so much. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142631/Worldwide-Leadership-Approval.aspx">To the tune of an 18% approval rating</a>.</p>
