			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186770.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1991 aligncenter" title="ireland 1" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186770.jpg?w=500&#038;h=337" alt="ireland 1" width="500" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>The summer after I graduated from college, I went to Ireland with two girlfriends. We rented a flat in Galway for three months and, from there, traveled all around. It was an excellent and hilarious trip, mostly because because Cara and Marisa were a lot of fun. Whenever St. Paddy&#8217;s rolls around, I think of them and the country we traveled together. Here are some things I learned while there:</p>
<p>That it can actually be quite sunny in Ireland &#8211; it didn&#8217;t rain for our first 10 days there. Lots of pale people (myself included) flocked to the beach. I probably got more of a tan there than I have ever gotten since. The news reported lots of cases of sun poisoning and first degree burns. This photo was taken at Salthill beach in Galway:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186788.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1992" title="Salthill Galway" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186788.jpg" alt="Salthill Galway" width="500" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a preponderance of stones and rocks and they do impressive things with them &#8211; this photo was taken on the Aran Islands:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186786.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" title="Aran Islands" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186786.jpg" alt="Aran Islands" width="500" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>They let you walk all the way to the edge of cliffs! We wondered: <em>Would they let you do this in America or would there be a fence</em>? (And I wonder now: should I have been that close to the edge? Sorry Mom.) Also taken on the Aran Islands:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186784.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" title="Aran Island Cliffs" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186784.jpg" alt="Aran Island Cliffs" width="500" height="738" /></a></p>
<p>The road signage is brilliant. These kinds of intersections would surely drive anybody to drink:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186772.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" title="signage ireland" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186772.jpg" alt="signage ireland" width="500" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Funghi, the Friendly Dolphin, who resides in Dingle Bay was exactly as friendly as promised but I failed to catch a picture of him with my disposable camera (I was probably winding it) when he made an appearance &#8211; Anyway, this photo was taken on the boat, while in hot pursuit of him. (Notice that my love of polka dots was well underway even at this young age):</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186782.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1996" title="dingle bay" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186782.jpg" alt="dingle bay" width="500" height="739" /></a></p>
<p>The castles, abbeys, and forts are simply stunning &#8211; this was taken at Kylemore Abbey in Connemara. (This is, for me, the iconic photo of the trip &#8211; I have kept it framed on my shelf for all these years):</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186776.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1997" title="Kylemore Abbey" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186776.jpg" alt="Kylemore Abbey" width="500" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Understanding the rules of cricket is not exactly a cinch for tourists who are passing through (in other words, not even remotely possible) &#8211; taken at Trinity College in Dublin:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186774.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1998" title="cricket dublin" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186774.jpg" alt="cricket dublin" width="500" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>Three things about Guinness &#8211; 1. It does actually taste better the closer you get to the source 2. It&#8217;s so thick that a match will indeed stand up in the foam 3. One pint of it will fill you up more than 47 milkshakes. Taken at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186778.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1999" title="guinness signs" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186778.jpg" alt="guinness signs" width="500" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>You can only carry so many souvenirs (and hand-knit sweaters) in your backpack. But I did pick up this little<em> tchotchke</em> in County Cork. The back says: &#8220;Triple Spiral from New Grange, Co. Meath, 3000 B.C. (Symbol of three: male, female, child: birth, love, death; the flowing continuity of life.)&#8221; I keep this on my office shelf all year, but just brought it out to our living room in honor of March 17:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/img_0272.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2002" title="Triple Spiral" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/img_0272.jpg" alt="Triple Spiral" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And finally, the coast of Ireland is simply breathtaking:</p>
<p><a href="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186780.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2000" title="coast of ireland" src="http://thehometome.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fs_1186780.jpg" alt="coast of ireland" width="500" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>What an incredible country and an amazing trip. Have you ever been?</p>
<p>Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">A few months ago, I featured a post titled<a title="Ten Things I Learned From My Mom." href="http://findingravity.com/2012/02/10/mom/"> &#8220;Ten Things I Learned From My Mom.&#8221;</a>  I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks reflecting, and decided that I also wanted to feature a similar post dedicated to my father.  I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have two loving parents that I am very close with, and I hope some day that I can take everything I&#8217;ve learned from them, and apply it to my own parenting techniques.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Kick ‘Em Where It Hurts</strong><br />
<br />
In first grade, I came off the school bus hysterically crying. My dad met me at the top of our driveway, and wrapped his arms around the sobbing little human peeking timidly up at him from underneath her bangs, while clutching her ninja turtle lunch box. After he asked me what was wrong, I explained that another boy on the bus had been saying mean things to me. My dad told me to nicely ask the boy to leave me alone, and to tell the bus driver if he didn’t listen<br />
<br />
The next day, Dad met me at the top of the driveway. Again, a sobbing little human stormed across the street and flew into his arms. When my dad asked me what happened this time, I told him that the boy on the bus had put his hands around my neck and squeezed really hard. Infuriated, Dad told me the next time the little boy touched me in a way that made me uncomfortable, I had his permission to drive my foot between his legs as hard as I could.<br />
<br />
A few days later, my dad was sitting at his desk at work when the phone rang. It was the principal of my elementary school, calling to tell him that I had kicked a little boy between the legs on the playground. After confirming that it was, in fact, the boy from the bus, he told the principal that he had given me permission to do so, after the little boy had tried choking me.<br />
<br />
My dad’s reasoning? In a world where strangers are constantly hurting and even abducting little girls, why should I teach my daughter to politely ask a boy trying to blatantly choke her, to leave her alone?<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the principal and the little boy both understood the message loud and clear.<br />
<br />
My dad hung up the phone and whispered, <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s my girl.&#8221;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2. Take your time getting where you’re going</strong><br />
<br />
I graduated college when I was 22, and after four years of college I racked up enough student loans to keep me in debt until I’m 70. After returning to Australia to complete my student teaching, I came back to America, and did what most college graduates are forced to do upon entering “the real world”…I moved back home.<br />
<br />
In what “real world” are we living in, where nobody is hiring, college grads are sitting on top $80,000 dollars in student loans, and people expect us to snap our fingers, and magically come up with these figures? Keep in mind that I wasn’t sitting around eating Cheetos, and watching reruns of Americas Next Top Model. I worked three jobs, paid my own bills, and on top of that, made student loan payments every month. I was fortunate to have a very understanding father, who was comfortable letting me live at home until I built up enough of a financial pin cushion, where I could afford my bills, my loans, AND rent. Rather than giving me the boot when it was convenient, he gave me time, encouragement, and understanding. Now I’m living the good life in an apartment, close to the center of town, and I consider myself to be very financially stable and independent for a 24 year old<br />
<br />
<strong>3. There IS a man worthy of your attention&#8230;just not that one…OR that one…</strong><br />
<br />
Dating.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Every father’s nightmare. I always joke that I am going to have a son, so I can teach him how to treat women. He’ll go out there and show all of his friends how to properly treat women, thus starting the domino effect of great future boyfriends and husbands. You’re welcome, world.<br />
<br />
Huddle in close, I have a secret to share with you. I’ve had my fair share of relationship horror stories. I know this seems far fetched because after a lot of wrong turns and poor dating choices, I finally stumbled across my equal. The truth is, I dated some doozies. I might be getting some phone calls after this, because I&#8217;m still good friends with MOST of my exes.<br />
<br />
My dad referred to one of my relationships as “the thing that wouldn’t die,” because it just kept going, and going, and going. Every time my family thought it was over,  I decided it was a good idea to forgive and forget.<br />
<br />
Most of my male friends growing up were afraid of my dad, and I didn’t blame them. My dad must have a jerk radar, and he definitely emits a <em><strong>“mess with my daughter, I DARE YOU”</strong> </em>vibe. I wouldn’t want to date me if I were a guy, and I’m glad I never had to go through the process of shaking my dad’s hand the first time.<br />
<br />
Blake and I spent our first three months dating in different countries, so Dad definitely had his guard up. After watching his daughter SPRINT across the airport, with tears in her eyes, toward the foreign mystery boy in the black pea coat, I think he knew it was a done deal. Blake melted my father’s heart with a combination of stellar decisions…Somewhere between giving my dad a tall Irish beer mug from Dublin for Christmas, and shooting hoop with him in the driveway, Dad gave me the nod of approval that every daughter hopes for when it comes to their boyfriends.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Just keep digging.</strong><br />
<br />
My senior year of high school, I was chosen as one of the volleyball captains. You would think the captain would have it all together, right? Wrong. During a particularly important game, every ball that came my way hit the ground. I couldn’t blame it on anyone but myself. I just couldn’t get it together. My coach made the decision during the first game to sit me on the bench, something he hadn’t done all season. I wasn’t upset with him. I completely understood, and it’s what I would have done had I been in his position. However, I was devastated with my performance. A very large part of me wanted to run to the nearest locker room and hide inside one of the tallest lockers until the game was over, but instead, I watched the rest of the game from the bench.<br />
<br />
The next day at school, I was called down to the main office midday. Sitting on the secretary’s desk was a beautiful bouquet of flowers. Our secretary giddily told me that my father had dropped the flowers off for me. I opened the note, and only once sentence was written on the inside:<br />
<br />
“Just keep digging.”<br />
<br />
I still have the note from that bouquet of flowers, and I look at it from time to time. It helps me remember that sometimes you’re not going to be able to pass every ball that life throws on you, but you HAVE to keep digging<br />
<br />
The next game was my best game of my entire high school career, and it just so happened that two college scouts were visiting to watch me play.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Make your free throws.</strong><br />
<br />
Basketball was one of the first things my father and I really bonded over. Well, aside from playing NSYNC on repeat in his car for three weeks straight, those were real bonding moments as well. Growing up, we spent countless hours shooting a basketball around in the driveway. It was OUR thing. You know that game horse? You have to make the shot that the person before you made, and if you miss, you get a letter. The first person to spell h-o-r-s-e, loses. Well, Dad and I changed it to L-O-S-E-R, that way the winner could victoriously call the other person a loser, while making the letter “L” with their pointer finger and thumb, and posting it on their forehead. Before there was horse, and loser, there were free throws. I remember Dad meticulously explaining the importance of making your free throws. We stayed out in the driveway for hours, practicing concentration, holding the ball, lining up, and following through. When I played for my first Seacoast travel team, my dad was my coach. Sometimes it was not easy, and it felt like he was harder on me than the rest of the team, but I know it was only because he wanted me to succeed. Sometimes, we’d arrive before the rest of the team, and I’d stand there practicing my free throws.<br />
<br />
When you step up to the line to make a free throw that is YOUR moment. The gym hushes, everything stills, and it’s just you, the ball, and the hoop. It’s a lot like grasping once in a life time opportunities. It taught me to always focus on my dreams, to line myself up with what I want out of life.<br />
<br />
It taught me to follow through.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Memories Are Greater Than Things:</strong><br />
<br />
My father has always been a man of simplicity and efficiency. He’s never needed the nicest car or the biggest house, or the smartest phone. Growing up I didn’t necessarily understand this. Why buy a smaller house, if you can afford to buy a bigger house? What’s interesting is at the ripe age of 24, if you ask me what my favorite parts of growing up were, I couldn’t even tell you what kind of car Dad drove. What I can tell you, is that he took me on the most AMAZING family trip to Hawaii when I was fifteen. It’s where I learned to surf, it’s where I saw my first beautiful sunset, and it’s where I first realized how emotionally and mentally connected to the ocean I was. When I was 17, Dad took me on a trip to Universal Studios. Aside from my <a title="Selachophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of sharks." href="http://findingravity.com/2012/02/24/384/">traumatic experience on the Jaws</a> ride, it was spectacular. It was just the two of us, best friends, exploring a park of make believe and movie magic.  When I was 21, Dad flew to Australia for two weeks to visit me while I was living abroad. After a month and a half without my family, the excitement I felt when I walked out of my apartment and saw him walking toward me was so uplifting. We spent an incredible weekend in Sydney, where we actually climbed the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Three months later, broken hearted, I returned back home. I had not seen the rest of my family in five months, and I hadn&#8217;t seen my dad in three months, but I was crushed to be leaving Australia. Little did I know, that my father had flown out to surprise me in San Francisco. Instead of enduring a 5 hour lay over, he and I would spend the next three days exploring California together.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, I would rather have the memories of every single special moment with my father, than any materialistic item in the world. Things are often tossed aside. Things cause us to be wasteful. Things break.<br />
<br />
The experiences we’ve had together are stored safely in the deepest spaces of my heart, not a moment was wasted, and they are truly unbreakable.<br />
<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">Fresh off the boat in San fran</p>
<p><strong>7. The Value Of Money</strong><br />
<br />
I have always worked hard to earn the things I want in life, because I grew up watching my parents work hard. I have never allowed ANYONE to make me feel like I don’t deserve the things I have, because that would be directly insulting the people in my life who taught me how hard I would have to work to make them possible.  At the age of 20, when most kids were spending their summer vacation on the beach or at house parties, I was working 70 hours a week to pay for the traveling I would be doing while studying in Australia. During my senior year, when most of my friends were out having fun, I spent every night Monday through Saturday waiting tables at a ski lodge to pay for my airfare and expenses, so I could return to Australia to teach. I pay my own rent, I pay my own bills, and every month I make student loan payments to pay for my education.<br />
<br />
Is that to say my parents don’t help me when they feel it’s necessary? Of course not. I am so fortunate to have parents who recognize when I need a boost, and I also realize that is a privilege, not a right. However, I am also proud of how hard I’ve worked, and have never let anybody make me feel like I shouldn’t be.<br />
<br />
<strong>8. Family will always be there to make you laugh</strong><br />
<br />
I have a huge family, and we’re all a bunch of pranksters. We all share the same sense of humor, which makes family gatherings a blast. There is never a dull moment at Christmas. Every year, we add new hilarious tales to our repertoire, and every year, we tell and retell these stories.<br />
<br />
They never stop being funny.<br />
<br />
-There’s the one with the colostomy bag<br />
-There’s the one where my grandmother put vanilla pudding on her hamburger thinking it was mayonnaise.<br />
-There’s the one where my cousin and I turned all of my aunts pictures upside down because we know how neat she likes to keep things.<br />
-There’s the one where my dad finally told his sister that he hates the chocolate covered cherries she always gives him at Christmas.<br />
-And there’s the one where EVERYONE gave my dad a box of chocolate covered cherries for Christmas, because we now all know how much he hates them.<br />
<br />
My dad has raised me with a great sense of humor, and as much as he dishes it out, he can definitely take it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://findingravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dad4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1029" title="Dad4" src="http://findingravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dad4.jpg?w=449&#038;h=573" alt="" width="449" height="573" /></a>Giving each other a hard time post college graduation^</p>
<p>
<strong> 9. Give Back To The Community.</strong><br />
<br />
While working full time, my dad also managed to somehow be at every single one of my athletic fund raisers. In a sea of volleyball and basketball moms, there stood my dad in the middle of the pack, selling cookies to raise money for our volleyball gear. Some kids might have been embarrassed to see their dad at their high school with a bunch of moms selling baked goods, but I loved it! Every time that I saw him there selling cookies like the proceeds would be going toward his new big screen TV, I&#8217;d walk up to him and high five him. I was so proud to be able to point over to the table and say, “Look! That’s MY dad.”<br />
<br />
After having raised a handicapped son, my dad volunteers every year for the Special Olympics. Last year, Blake, Dad, and I all volunteered together. Blake and I took turns keeping score, I photographed the event, and Dad kept the clock. His dedication to the community has inspired me to volunteer at multiple places, including the Special Olympics, and at a local homeless shelter making bagged lunches.<br />
<br />
<strong>10. That’s life.</strong><br />
<br />
Sometimes, things happen in life that you just can’t change. It’s a hard pill to swallow when you’re seventeen and your boyfriend cheats on you, or you need a full brake replacement that ends up costing more than your rent. It’s easy to bury your head in your pillow and scream for two hours, but it doesn’t accomplish a whole lot. Things happen that we have no control over, and that’s part of life. You can sit around feeling sorry for yourself, or you can get out of bed in the morning knowing that there are people out there who are in worse situations than an ended relationship or a car repair. My parents have said to me thousands of times, “Your brother would have traded one of his good days for one of your bad days,” and sometimes I have to remind myself of that.<br />
<br />
You have to take control over your own life, because if you don’t, your hardships will cause you to lose your mind all together.<br />
<br />

<p>Despite spending most of his time behind the camera capturing other people, Gordon Parks&#8217; personal style is certainly worth remembering.  Parks was a true renaissance man of the mid twentieth century, working as a photographer, director, writer, and musician.  During this period Parks traveled throughout the country photographing everyone from the rural poor to celebrities, documenting the many different stories and faces of American life.  Later in his career Parks began directing films, most notably Shaft, the 1971 blaxploitation film that embodied urban cool.  Through his work, Parks captured how an individual&#8217;s appearance can tell so much about them.  Parks&#8217; personal style conveyed a sense of relaxed complexity that reflected his own personality.  Parks often wore thick turtlenecks with houndstooth blazers and faded button downs with golden button double breasted blazers, embodying his comfortably formal style.  Parks&#8217; trademark pipe, distinct patterns, and well worn pieces  expressed his distinct personality through his wardrobe.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit of Irish green for the St. Patrick&#8217;s Day weekend&#8230;.pictures from Ireland taken a few years ago that I scanned into my computer.  Not as pretty as the originals, but they&#8217;re still green and gorgeous and worthy of a Guinness  for a toast to Ireland!</p>
<p><a href="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730003.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2558" title="Scanned Image 120730003" src="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730003.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="210" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Ring of Kerry near Waterville, Ireland</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730006.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557" title="Scanned Image 120730006" src="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730006.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="227" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dingle Peninsula and Dingle Bay were our unanimous favorites.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556" title="Scanned Image 120730004" src="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730004.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="210" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sheep country on Dingle Peninsula.  And yes those are my two little sheep&#8230;.although they&#8217;ve practically doubled in height since then.</p>
<p><a href="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555" title="Scanned Image 120730002" src="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730002.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">How many shades of beautiful can there be&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" title="Scanned Image 120730001" src="http://funandfabulousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/scanned-image-120730001.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The view from Blarney Castle.  The &#8220;gift of gab&#8221; is the reward for kissing the stone&#8230;.my kids thought it wasn&#8217;t necessary for me to try it&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Central vein in a leaf skeleton" href="http://johnmichaelphotos.smugmug.com/Nature/Skeletal-Remains/21748375_nfZ5dg#!i=1733776549&amp;k=LLmfQMT&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" title="Central vein in a leaf skeleton" src="http://johnmichaelphotos.smugmug.com/Nature/Skeletal-Remains/i-LLmfQMT/0/L/DSC00039-1-L.jpg" alt="Central vein in a leaf skeleton" /></a></p>
<p>So no sooner had I reveled in the warmth of spring than the winds changed and brought chilly air.  It&#8217;s one degree above freezing right now.  And it&#8217;s all my fault.  This is why I don&#8217;t go to Cardinals games.  They always lose when I go.  I went to a Cards-Brewers game last year and it was one of their worst losses of the entire season.</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t go outside and take pictures of precocious early bloomers (literally) today.  I wanted to.  I had my macro equipment all set up.</p>
<p>Instead, I shot two leaves in my little studio.  The skeletal remains of two leaves, actually.  I used just one strobe, with nothing but a simple reflector on it.  I just needed enough light to shoot at f/22, f/25, and f/45 at ISO 100 and 1/160 or 1/200.  And I wanted it off camera, to make sure the background would be black.  So I used a strobe.</p>
<p>I love macro photography.  There are literally other worlds all around us that we never see.  Honestly, you don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to see some of these worlds.  There are a <strong>lot</strong> of bugs.  And other disgusting things.  Even so, I love it.  You can see fascinating new landscapes full of alien flora and fauna, if you just look closely enough.</p>
<p>Take these images, for example.  Skeleton leaves are cool at normal size.  But blow one up to greater than life size and you see so much more.  You see the circulatory system of the leaf in great detail.  You see how the remaining bits of leaf were attached to the circulatory system.  The vein running down the middle of the leaf becomes a giant tree trunk.</p>
<p>These sorts of things just enthrall me.  I hope a few of you are as amazed as I am.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4973" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://turbotodd.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tech-crunch-sxsw-2012.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4973" title="Tech Crunch @ SXSW 2012" src="http://turbotodd.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tech-crunch-sxsw-2012.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A picture from the SXSW show floor coverage from TechCrunch at SXSW Interactive 2012. Be sure to keep an eye here on Turbotodd.com for more interviews conducted by Turbo and Scott Laningham through the course of this year's event.</p></div>
<p>Well, SXSW 2012 is finally over… And over 25,000 computer geeks from around the world were probably about ready for it be over, fun as it was.</p>
<p>There was lots to be said about this year&#8217;s SXSW, both good and bad, but I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and say it was the best SXSW interactive ever, and I&#8217;ve been to quite a few.</p>
<p>I was there for the Mark Zuckerberg and Sarah Lacy interview debacle several years back… I was there for the yawner Twitter interview with Evan Williams a couple of years back… I was even there when Christopher Locke introduced <em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em> in 2000, just before the bubble burst, and burst hard.</p>
<p>And despite the insane and torrential rains that we had in Austin, which we had been waiting on for well over a year, in the midst of our atrocious drought, it didn&#8217;t surprise me at all that the rain clouds followed the digerati to Austin before the heavens would completely open up.  Geeks bring rain!</p>
<p>There really wasn&#8217;t any huge new new thing at this year&#8217;s SXSW… It was really a lot of the same old thing with a few new ingredients mixed in. But lingering in the air, there was an optimism and sense of opportunity that transcended the often selfish inclinations of SXSW past, one that was more worldly and altruistic in nature.</p>
<p>A spirit that attempted to bring people closer together in small networks to be able to meet and to get to know one another and to get things done. I ran into Robert Scoble, the renowned tech blogger whom I&#8217;ve never before met, and he explained to me on the expo floor that the big deal of the event was “Highlights,” an iOS-based application that helps do just that, bring people together in the most serendipitous of ways based on their location and data from their Facebook graph.</p>
<p>Assuming one can get past the privacy implications of such a tool, it&#8217;s actually very cool. And I certainly wish I had had it once upon a time in my virtual dating life.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of almost Beckett-like absurdity, including the registration badge pickup line that seemed to linger all the way into South Austin this year. I spent over an hour waiting in that line for my badge, when it seems to me, it would have been just as easy for SXSW to have mailed it to me well in advance. Ever heard of RFID tags??</p>
<p>I did use that waiting time productively, and met someone from a startup whom I spoke with about the mobile boom for most of our time in line. But I&#8217;m sure somebody from IBM&#8217;s smarter cities initiative would be <em>more</em> than happy to sit down and discuss with SXSW the opportunity that a smarter queuing solution might present.</p>
<p>There were more companies at SXSW this year than ever before, and by companies I mean enterprise companies, not just startups. I saw attendees from the likes of Oracle and Microsoft and IBM in more numbers than ever, just to mention a few, and so the former digital divide between startups and developers and the enterprise seems to have started to close at this year’s SXSW, which I think is a good thing: We need them, and they need us.</p>
<p>The keynotes from the likes of Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Wolfram seemed to suggest we’re on the brink of breaking through in AI and speech recognition — the former invented core speech recognition technologies being used today in product’s like &#8220;Dragon Dictation&#8221; (which I used to assist me in writing this blog post), and both mentioned Watson as demonstrating this new direction. I’ll be looking forward to the day soon when I can run most of my computing devices, smartphone and otherwise, through voice and facial recognition.</p>
<p>But we also saw some nods to the past, including on the SXSW expo floor. There was a machine that presses vinyl records (I’m sure most of the attendees had never seen a long-play record!), along with a killer jet black keyboard from “Daskeyboard” that mimics the clickety-clack spring action of the old IBM Model M keyboard.</p>
<p>What’s old is new, even in technology.</p>
<p>Be sure to come back and visit turbotodd.com in the days and weeks ahead, as I’ll continue to post the fascinating interviews that Scott Laningham and I recorded with a garden variety of digital thought leaders in the IBM “Future of Social” lounge.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll be preparing for SXSW Interactive 2013.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t miss it for all the Austin rain in the world!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align:center;">One of the best parts of the tournament format is the do or die nature of every single game. One loss and you are eliminated. This leads to excruciatingly lengthy final minutes of games and unrivaled drama. These buzzer beaters change the fortune of a teams in an instant, and allow anonymous names to etch their mark into NCAA lore. There is nothing quite like the unbridled joy or pained despair the teams on the following list went through.</h6>
<p><strong>10. Northwestern State- 2006, First Round vs. Iowa</strong><br />
While most fans know that Northwestern has never made the tournament, the Demons of Northwestern State managed to win a game as a 14 seed.  In a tight game throughout, they found themselves with the ball down two.  After forcing a bad three point shot, the ball bounced out to the corner to Jermaine Wallace, who was forced to launch an even worse shot.  Fortunately, it went in as Wallace faded out of bounds and the Demons had their first NCAA tournament win.  This video also features the nostalgia of unique courts, as the NCAA has gone to a standard logo-less floor in the past few years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQH2UvnHLTE" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/TQH2UvnHLTE/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></a><br />
<strong>9.  Maryland- 2003, First Round vs. UNC Wilmington</strong><br />
Sure, it is not as fun when a major conference team hits a buzzer beater to avoid an upset, but the degree of difficulty gives this shot a place on the list.  Trailing by one with 5 seconds left, Maryland went to their tough senior guard Drew Nicholas after Wilmington denied Steve Blake the ball on the inbounds.  Nicholas sprinted past half court and ran toward the Maryland bench. Falling away, he launched a three pointer to avoid the upset and push Maryland into the second round.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/LQhNDWnlflE/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
<strong>8. Michigan St- 2010, Second Round vs. Maryland</strong><br />
Michigan State continued their remarkable run of tournament success under Tom Izzo in this classic 4 vs. 5 seed second round game.  After Greivis Vazquez gave the Terps the lead with 6.6 seconds to play, the Spartans neglected to use their final timeout and quickly came up court. Draymond Green found Korie Lucious who drilled the game winning three. Michigan State continued on to defeat Northern Iowa and Tennessee in the regional to advance to their sixth Final Four under Izzo’s guidance.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/h3_bcJyAaI4/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p><strong>7. UConn- 1998, Sweet 16 vs. Washington</strong><br />
The Huskies of Connecticut have had the Washington Huskies number in the NCAA tournament.  It began with a scramble at the end of this game that had Washington fans cursing to themselves.  UConn had three tries at the game winning hoop with a lot of contact in the lane.  Finally, right before the buzzer sounded, Richard Hamilton gathered the ball and was able to hit the game winner while falling away.  UConn would go on to win their first championship the following season.  In 2006, led by Brandon Roy, Washington hoped for their revenge against Connecticut, but they would again fall short in overtime.</p>

<strong>6. Valparaiso- 1998, First Round vs. Ole Miss</strong><br />
Despite being a 13 seed, Valpo actually featured two players who would have brief NBA careers in Bryce Drew and Jamie Sykes.  Despite this fact, they found themselves trailing by two with just 2.5 seconds remaining.  Coach Homer Drew called for a play titled “Pacer” to get his son a shot at the win.  Ole Miss correctly put a man defending Sykes, who was inbounding the ball.  The ball was caught and Drew received it on a touch pass, just in time to launch a game winning three.  His dive to the floor has been one of the iconic images of March Madness since.</p>

<strong>5. UCLA- 1995, Second Round vs. Missouri</strong><br />
This buzzer beater ended up being extra special when UCLA continued all the way to a national championship following it as this game showed just how fragile a one game elimination tournament can be.  UCLA point guard Tyus Edney used every bit of the 4.7 seconds remaining on the clock to sprint the length of the floor and bank in the winning shot.  Edney showed rare control in a sprint up the floor and hit a harder shot than it looks falling away.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/eKrWAeYGRrg/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
<strong>4. UConn- 1990, Sweet 16 vs. Clemson</strong><br />
It is hard to believe today, but back in 1990, UConn was just coming onto the scene as a national title contender under Jim Calhoun.  The Huskies found themselves trailing by one point late against Clemson in the third round at the Meadowlands and needing to go the length of the floor.  A near full length of the court pass found Tate George in the corner with one second on the clock.  George shot a quick turnaround which propelled UConn into the East regional final, where they would lose to Duke by 1 point.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/1dGKtjcwn8U/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
<strong>3. Arkansas- 1981, Second Round vs. Louisville</strong><br />
Although hard to imagine, there was no 3 point shot back at this time.  Arkansas was trailing by one with just under 5 seconds remaining.  U.S. Reed took the inbounds pass in the backcourt and pressured by stifling defense by defending champion Louisville, was only able to make to about half court.  Reed launched a desperation shot that somehow went down and advanced Arkansas.  A five seed, Arkansas would go on to lose to one seeded LSU in the next round.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/4bM_TVed168/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
<strong>2. Duke- 1992, Regional Final vs. Kentucky</strong><br />
Even the most zealous Duke haters cannot ignore this one.  Remembered by most basketball fans as the best college basketball game ever played, the East regional final featured two of the premiere programs in college hoops.  Trailing by one with 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime, Duke had to go the length of the court.  Ironically, coach Rick Pitino, who emphasizes pressure defense, chose not to guard Grant Hill, who was throwing the ball in.  Hill threw a beautiful baseball pass to Christian Laettner, who still had enough time to dribble once and sink the winning turnaround jumper.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://ath-lists.com/2012/03/14/ncaa-tournament-buzzer-beaters-top-10/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/AY-iq58_oz4/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
<strong>1. NC State- 1983, Championship Game vs. Houston</strong><br />
Did you really think that the Dukies would be number one?  Instead the top spot is occupied by the shot that sent NC State coach Jim Valvano running around the court looking for somebody to hug.  After getting through as a 6 seed, the Wolfpack entered the final as a big underdog to the University of Houston, who featured Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler.  Trailing by one late, Derek Whittenburg threw up a bad shot that was way short.  Fortunately, Charles was right there to slam it up in alley-oop fashion and NC State had drawn up a blueprint for future Cinderellas in the tournament.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<p>I saw these colorful mini sweet peppers at the store the other day and I wanted to photograph them but I had to come up with some sort of recipe so that Yes! Chef! would make them for me and then I could photograph them. Lo and behold there was a perfectly great recipe right on the back of the bag.  I brought them home and waved them in front of Yes! Chef!  He said something like, &#8220;Yes, they are pretty&#8221;.  He knows my propensity for Crow Photography (photographing any pretty, shiny or colorful thing that I see), so he wasn&#8217;t culinarily very interested.  Then I showed him the recipe on the back of the bag and said things like, &#8220;Mmmmm.  This looks great&#8221; and &#8220;I sure do love capers, olives and peppers&#8221; and finally, &#8220;Could you please make this for me and we could put it on steaks tonight.&#8221;  That did it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/recipe-mini-pepper-salsa_web.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 aligncenter" title="Recipe Mini Pepper Salsa_web" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/recipe-mini-pepper-salsa_web.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First he oiled up the peppers with olive oil and roasted them in the oven.</p>
<div id="attachment_94" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4678-edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-94 " title="20120220-_MG_4678-Edit" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4678-edit.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Roasted Sweet Mini Peppers</p></div>
<p>He put them in brown paper bags to steam a little so that the skins would come off easily.  Then he ran down to the little country store because we were out of olives.  (My bad.)</p>
<div id="attachment_102" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 677px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4686-edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102" title="20120220-_MG_4686-Edit" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4686-edit.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="1000" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peppers come out of the oven and into the bags</p></div>
<div id="attachment_103" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4721-edit_web.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103" title="20120220-_MG_4721-Edit_web" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4721-edit_web.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big pile o&#039;roasted peppers</p></div>
<div id="attachment_104" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4727-edit_web.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104" title="20120220-_MG_4727-Edit_web" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4727-edit_web.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peppers peeled and julienned</p></div>
<p>Then he chopped up olives and cilantro, threw in capers (my personal favorite) and added the appropriate oil, vinegar and seasoning. We both tasted and proclaimed it a success.</p>
<div id="attachment_105" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4751-edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105" title="20120220-_MG_4751-Edit" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4751-edit.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mixing it all together</p></div>
<p>Of course, then I got to photograph it.</p>
<div id="attachment_95" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4754-edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-95" title="20120220-_MG_4754-Edit" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4754-edit.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Finished Sweet Pepper Salsa</p></div>
<p>Finally, he cooked the steaks and I photographed the finished product quickly because it was time to eat!</p>
<div id="attachment_107" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1010px"><a href="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4833-edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107" title="20120220-_MG_4833-Edit" src="http://callhimyeschef.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/20120220-_mg_4833-edit.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Finished T-Bone Steak, Sweet Pepper Salsa and Green beans</p></div>
<p>And THAT!, my friends,  is what dinner is like around here with Yes! Chef!</p>
