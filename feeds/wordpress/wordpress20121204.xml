				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Another year, another novel that hasn&#8217;t quite been finished but has the requisite number of words.&#8221; My muse, a blatant appropriation of Stephen King&#8217;s concept thereof as expressed in <em>On Writing</em>, cracks open the fridge and retrieves a cold beer. I keep it on hand for guests, being a de facto teetotaler myself; I don&#8217;t know where he got the Cuban cigar that billows smoke all over my single-room downstairs.</p>
<p>Since my muse is an insubstantial personification of my creative drive, albeit one ever so slightly ripped off from a more successful author, I don&#8217;t suppose it really matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just the number of words,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;ve takes one of the stories I wanted to tell and given it a good start. It barely existed before and now it&#8217;s 300k on my hard drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;300 unfinished k, you mean.&#8221; My muse emerges from the fridge with beer and leftover barbecue chicken strips. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s about time you finished the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What others?&#8221; I bristle. &#8220;There&#8217;s only the project at hand, nothing else.&#8221; </p>
<p>I mean it as a metaphor, but it&#8217;s taken literally. &#8220;The story about those kids finding alternate dimensions with giant landsquid for one,&#8221; my muse says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the unfinished noir detective novel about a librarian, and the comic wish-fulfillment tale of the assassin and the accountant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get to them in time,&#8221; I say, a little defensive. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re finished. What matters is that I wrote something that didn&#8217;t exist before. It&#8217;s good even if it&#8217;s a little rough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The muse sits down heavily on my couch and fires up the Xbox. &#8220;What about the one from 2008, where you tried to stretch that 500-word short story into a tale ten times its length, and wound up so desperate for wordcount that you undid all your contractions a half-hour before midnight on the last day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bring that one up,&#8221; I snap. &#8220;It was an election year and I had a new job. Too many distractions!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa there, killer,&#8221; my muse says without looking up from the first-person shooter he&#8217;s working away at. &#8220;Did I touch a nerve? Don&#8217;t forget that it was a failure for me too. Or do you think part of a novel each year and a blog post a day is nothing for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I say. &#8220;It&#8217;s a stressful time even without the novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re glad you did it again this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; my muse says, wreathed in smoke and barbecue beer fumes. &#8220;That&#8217;s all that matters.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s<strong> <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/daily-prompt-hindsight/">Daily Prompt Challenge</a> </strong>is called <strong>Hindsight</strong> and is described as follows: <strong>Now that you’ve got some blogging experience under your belt, re-write your very first post.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I wrote this post in September of 2011. It&#8217;s amazing what 15 months will do to your perspective. I changed some sentences around and corrected some punctuation, hopefully making it more readable&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Vanilla Ice Cream</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://johnsblogs.com/2011/09/17/vanilla-ice-cream/img_1659-1-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-79"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79" alt="IMG_1659-1" src="http://societyred.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_1659-12.jpg?w=590"   /></a>Four-year-old eyes peer out from the supportive mask and scan the area. Her face is a puzzle of scar tissue; her ears are shriveled and curled. Her arms and legs are bound, rigid, and hidden. Though the burns are not new, the healing process; slow and painful, has yet to allow what is left of her limbs to be exposed to the world. Her eyes lock on mine and examine me. There is no visible fear, no restless darting typical of a four-year-old, and no overwhelming curiosity. Instead there is serenity, an intensity, and a careful absorption of all in her immediate visual world. She does not speak or make noise at all. Perhaps she is refusing to announce her presence with any sound; acknowledging existence in what is gradually becoming her reality. Does she feel frightened and alone? How does the world sound to her?</p>
<p>She is eating vanilla ice cream. I watch her being fed by the nurse; the spoon is placed into the scarred, taut opening that is her mouth. Her pink undamaged tongue touches the cold spoon while her eyes are staring, locked on mine. “Would you like to share your ice cream with him?”  asks the nurse. She nods and I open my mouth and pretend to eat. I watch her and I do everything I can to avoid thinking about her road to this place.</p>
<p>The boundaries of her pain, reestablished and extended beyond most human tolerance, seem to have cultivated within her a confidence; approaching life from a calmer vantage point. She experienced her past without knowing what it was or why she endured it. From a life naturally full of questions she now lives in silence. Observing. Learning patience. Her survival depends on patience. Her future will be built on endurance and tenacity.</p>
<p>The nurse is called away and I take her seat. With questioning eyes my new friend examines me in a different light. She seems unsure and perhaps no longer feels as safe as before. I pick up the spoon and softly speak her name. “Emily….Emmmilieee”. She takes a spoonful of ice cream in her mouth, never removing her gaze. She doesn&#8217;t blink. Questions form in her eyes. I am no longer an observer but an active participant. I realize I am much more comfortable to her as a sideshow and I begin to feel uncomfortable as I continue to talk softly to her. I would do anything to make her feel as safe as she felt two minutes ago. I look at her and push away the feelings of pity that want to take over, the feeling I have trained myself to suppress. In the quiet hospital twilight, I feel as if she can read my every thought. The nurse returns and Emily dismisses me with a look and a nod. She is visibly comfortable again, and looks back only once as I step away. She opens her mouth for another spoonful of vanilla ice cream. I walk away and imagine how it tastes.</p>
<p><em>(I spent several years as a volunteer at Children&#8217;s Hospital in Seattle. Among the many brave and amazing kids I met was &#8220;Emily&#8221;. Our relationship lasted all of five minutes; I will always remember it.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_124" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://popgoesthecharts.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/frank-ocean-mumford-grammys/focean/" rel="attachment wp-att-124"><img class="size-full wp-image-124" alt="Thinking bout some GRAMMY wins." src="http://popgoesthecharts.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/focean.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thinking bout some GRAMMY wins.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s almost time once again for the <em>GRAMMY Awards</em>, &#8220;Music&#8217;s Biggest Night&#8221;, celebrating the best in music from the past year of many musical genres. The ceremony will take place on February 10, 2013, but on Wednesday night, December 5, CBS will be broadcasting the <em>GRAMMY Nominations Concert Live!!</em>, a one-hour event beginning at 10 PM Eastern and featuring performances by <strong>Dierks Bentley</strong>, <strong>Fun.</strong>, <strong>Hunter Hayes</strong>, <strong>Luke Bryan</strong>, <strong>Maroon 5</strong>, <strong>Ne-Yo</strong>, <strong>The Band Perry</strong>, and <strong>The Who</strong>. Now, obviously, not every award will be announced during the telecast, but many where these performers are actually nominated in will be presented in full, and the complete list is usually updated online shortly afterwards. This means that&#8217;s it&#8217;s time to make some predictions. Continuing a trend over the past few years, I&#8217;m thinking that the nominations will trend more commercial as a whole, though there could be surprises as usual. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m anticipating for the Big Four Awards: Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year and Best New Artist.</p>
<p>(The actual eligibility period for the releases in contention for nominations is October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012, so keep that in mind as you read these predictions.)</p>
<p><strong>ALBUM OF THE YEAR</strong><br />
Bob Dylan &#8211; Tempest<br />
Coldplay &#8211; Mylo Xyloto<br />
Frank Ocean &#8211; Channel ORANGE<br />
<strong>Mumford &amp; Sons &#8211; Babel</strong><br />
The Black Keys &#8211; El Camino</p>
<p><em>Close Calls:</em><br />
Bonnie Raitt &#8211; Slipstream<br />
Dave Matthews Band &#8211; Away From The World<br />
Drake &#8211; Take Care<br />
Fun. &#8211; Some Nights<br />
Lionel Richie &#8211; Tuskegee</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been nominated for six awards and lost all of them, so I&#8217;m thinking this will be the year for <strong>Mumford &amp; Sons</strong> to finally clinch a big one with Album Of The Year for <em>Babel</em>. With the second-best opening of 2012 on the Album Chart (600,000 copies sold), it&#8217;s a commercial and critical success, the perfect storm for them to receive the win. <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> is my backup choice to win the Award. Ocean, who made waves in July when he came out in a blog note, has done alright commercially, but has been a huge critical effort, with glowing reviews from a number of writers. A win would push the album past Gold status and possibly to Platinum, while at the same time, make a huge statement for the R&amp;B and hip-hop community. Past GRAMMY nominees for Album Of The Year <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> and <strong>Coldplay</strong> will most likely secure nominations once again, and <strong>The Black Keys</strong>, who won Best Alternative Album for <em>Brothers</em> in 2011, will most likely get their first nod for Album Of The Year with <em>El Camino, </em>which gained them an even bigger audience.</p>
<p><strong>RECORD OF THE YEAR</strong><br />
Adele &#8211; Set Fire To The Rain<br />
Drake featuring Rihanna &#8211; Take Care<br />
fun. featuring Janelle Monae &#8211; We Are Young<br />
<strong>Gotye featuring Kimbra &#8211; Somebody That I Used To Know</strong><br />
Mumford &amp; Sons &#8211; I Will Wait</p>
<p><em>Close Calls:</em><br />
Bruce Springsteen &#8211; We Take Care Of Our Own<br />
Carly Rae Jepsen &#8211; Call Me Maybe<br />
Frank Ocean &#8211; Thinking Bout You<br />
Katy Perry &#8211; Wide Awake<br />
The Black Keys &#8211; Lonely Boy</p>
<p><strong>Gotye</strong> and <strong>Kimbra</strong> are pretty much a lock for winning with their international smash. <strong>Mumford &amp; Sons</strong> would be a backup as &#8220;I Will Wait&#8221; is another solid single for the band and would only ensure them winning Album Of The Year. The other three nominees were all commercial successes but even <strong>Adele</strong>, who swept at last year&#8217;s ceremony, won&#8217;t see a win this year in the category, though she&#8217;ll probably easily get a win for her <em>Live At The Royal Albert Hall</em> DVD in the Long Form Video category.</p>
<p><strong>SONG OF THE YEAR</strong><br />
Bruce Springsteen &#8211; We Take Care Of Our Own<br />
Carly Rae Jepsen &#8211; Call Me Maybe<br />
<strong>Frank Ocean &#8211; Thinking Bout You</strong><br />
Katy Perry &#8211; Wide Awake<br />
Mumford &amp; Sons &#8211; I Will Wait</p>
<p><em>Close Calls:</em><br />
Drake featuring Rihanna &#8211; Take Care<br />
Kelly Clarkson &#8211; Stronger (What Doesn&#8217;t Kill You)<br />
Phillip Phillips &#8211; Home<br />
The Black Keys &#8211; Lonely Boy<br />
The Lumineers &#8211; Ho Hey</p>
<p>This one is a tough choice because &#8220;Set Fire To The Rain&#8221; and &#8220;Somebody That I Used To Know&#8221; weren&#8217;t submitted by their respective labels to be considered for this Award. That being said, I think <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> will be walking away with this one. It&#8217;s been a slow burner at Urban radio and a win would probably guarantee at least a minor CHR radio crossover. The Boss, <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>, would be my second choice, which was included in the soundtrack to President Obama&#8217;s successful reelection campaign and saw notable gains because of it. Though <em>Wrecking Ball</em> won&#8217;t likely be nominated anywhere near the top tier of awards, the single is strong enough to hold its ground in this category. <strong>Mumford &amp; Sons</strong> is another obvious nominee and would probably have an easier time winning Song Of The Year, but they&#8217;ll be denied. The two poppier releases by <strong>Carly Rae Jepsen</strong> and <strong>Katy Perry</strong> could pull off a surprise, but I have serious doubts about it. They would be lucky enough to be nominated.</p>
<p><strong>BEST NEW ARTIST</strong><br />
Frank Ocean<br />
<strong>Fun.</strong><br />
Gotye<br />
Hunter Hayes<br />
One Direction</p>
<p><em>Close Calls:</em><br />
Alabama Shakes<br />
Carly Rae Jepsen<br />
Christina Perri<br />
Ed Sheeran<br />
Ellie Goulding</p>
<p>Best New Artist is for sure going to be a competitive category this year. <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> is a given, so is <strong>Gotye</strong>, but I&#8217;m predicting the Award goes to <strong>Fun.</strong> as they have two big hits under the belt and I&#8217;m pretty sure this category is going to skew way more commercial this year after two consecutive years of wins by artists far outside the mainstream, <strong>Esperanza Spalding</strong> in 2010 and <strong>Bon Iver</strong> in 2011. <strong>Hunter Hayes</strong> will be the token Country nominee, and yes, <strong>One Direction</strong> will get a nominee for Best New Artist. Even <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> got nominated for the category in 2010. The boy band has a better chance of collecting it than Bieber did, but they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Come back on December 5 to see how I did! If you have any alternative predictions for these four categories, let me know in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By ‘absolutely must’ I mean ‘might like to’, of course.</p>
<p>The long winter draws in, brittle and dry as a glamour model’s hair extensions.  A chill wind fumbles with forlorn Christmas decorations that punctuate the street like misplaced apostrophe’s.  The book sits on my shelf staring at me, reproach in its spine, reminding me that I promised to lend it out and yet have consistently failed to do so.  The book is a Victorian orphan peering sadly through the toyshop window, abandoned and alone.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, book.  Would you forgive me, book?</p>
<p>The Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out Of His Window And Disappeared is the debut novel by Jonas Jonasson.</p>
<p>Allan Karlsson is 100 years old.  But rather than celebrate his centenary in the warm, fuzzy confines of his nursing home he clambers out the window and begins a journey across his native Sweden the book’s blurb describes as ‘picaresque’.  This maundering and murderous voyage is interspersed with an account of Allan’s life to date, in which it turns out that he was present at a number of the 20<sup>th</sup> century’s key moments.</p>
<p>Picaresque, in case you were as unaware of its meaning as I was until right this second, means: <i>of or relating to rascals or rogues</i>.</p>
<p>The professionals claim that the rules are simple: edit, edit some more.  Be prepared to kill your darlings; avoid clichéd turns of phrase like ‘kill your darlings’.  Adjectives are not your friends, nor are similes or puns.  Especially not puns – the only thing less acceptable than a pun is an exclamation mark!  Metaphors should be treated, at best, with suspicion and sentences should be succinct and to the point.  One subject to a sentence, please.  On the subject of succinctness, writing is not an excuse to show off the breadth of your vocabulary, and likewise you should resist the temptation to write in jargon, dialect or <i>argot</i>.  Your characters say things, sometimes they may shout if the circumstances are appropriate: they do not exclaim, intimate, demand or do anything else that suggests you’ve engaged in the act of writing, which is gauche.</p>
<p>‘The professionals’ may never have heard of Gustave Flaubert or James Joyce but they would approve of Jonas Jonasson if writers weren’t all consumed by paralysing envy.</p>
<p>Hundred Year Old Man’s prose style is straightforward and almost child-like in its simplicity, which neatly reflects the character of the protagonist.  This is not to say the book or its hero is/are simple-minded – there is a difference between simplicity and stupidity.  Rather, the book aims at, and achieves, the sort of utilitarian legibility that Ikea instruction manuals tend to lack.  I&#8217;m assuming that it was faithfully translated into English.</p>
<p>For those of you who are less pretentious than <i>moi</i>, Hemingway’s iceberg theory of writing runs that the words on the page should be the tip of the iceberg; most of the meaning lies beneath the surface and should be inferred by the reader rather than explicitly stated by the writer.  Hundred Year Old Man is that sort of novel,  although it&#8217;s arguably a bit too irreverent for that sort of chin stroking analysis (give that  man a Booker prize).</p>
<p>The plot zips along as quickly as the body count mounts, its gentle (if a little black) humour obscuring the serious points &#8211; cotton candy with a hook in it.</p>
<p>It’s a holiday read you won’t need to hide on an ebook.  For best results, team it up with a tall glass of something alcoholic that isn’t some form of banana liquor and doesn’t come with an umbrella.  Preferably vodka based.</p>
<p>Scandinavian books, films and tv shows often tend towards dark and gloomy – bleak affairs that can weigh a little heavy.  Hundred Year Old Man is not that – in fact if there’s a criticism it’s that it risks coming off as rather lightweight; impressive flights of imagination that quickly become a little self-conscious, even repetitive at times.  In a word: superficial.</p>
<p>That’s not how I read it, though.</p>
<p>If you go to bed every night clutching an F Scott Fitzgerald collection to your bosom, the prose might not suit your taste.  If you like your fiction to come with lashings of overt literary pretension, likewise.  For everyone else it’s easy on the eye, it’s got a lot of charm and you might learn something without once feeling like you’re being lectured.</p>
<p>Take me for example: I learned the meaning of the word ‘picaresque’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thegreenstudy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/canstockphoto3669563.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3537" style="margin:0;" title="canstockphoto3669563" alt="" src="http://thegreenstudy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/canstockphoto3669563.jpg?w=255&#038;h=255" height="255" width="255" /></a>I&#8217;ve finally recovered from an injury called &#8220;turf toe&#8221;, a common injury for athletes who quickly change directions, jump and push off of rigid surfaces, like football players and martial artists.  I did it while sparring in taekwondo with a large and formidable opponent, an unmoving wall of Axe deodorant and teenage defiance.</p>
<p>Thinking of myself as an <em>athlete</em> feels only slightly less pretentious than calling myself a <em>writer</em>. If who we are is what we do, then perhaps both appellations apply, but sketchily. I&#8217;ve only begun to get a little more comfortable with <em>writer</em>, since it is so often interrupted by other titles: chauffeur, accountant, nurse, volunteer and the &#8220;what&#8217;s for lunch?&#8221; lady.</p>
<p>It is human nature to label and compartmentalize &#8211; especially one&#8217;s self.  Enlightened and self-actualized people may live as an integrated whole and never question themselves by label. I am not far enough along the path of enlightenment, having made several picnic and rest stops along the way at Self-destruction, Laziness and Apathy (there&#8217;s a lot of people parking at that stop).</p>
<p>Beyond the labeling of occupations and hobbies, we also have a more adjectival way of naming ourselves. Negative labels that come and settle in as we&#8217;re growing up, or during times when we are vulnerable to unkind messages &#8211; as children, after a relationship breaks up, a job ends, lapses in self-esteem. For many years, the negative tapes in my head (I know, I&#8217;m dating myself &#8211; maybe yours is a data chip) would play in a loop.</p>
<p>The most effective tool I&#8217;ve ever learned was in a parenting book and it&#8217;s a cliché: Characterize the behavior, not the person. We don&#8217;t just need to do this with children, but with ourselves. I started to pay attention to what I called things. When I dropped something, I was clumsy. When I gained a couple of pounds, I was a gi-normous whale. When I forgot to do something, I was an absentminded jerk. We wouldn&#8217;t do this to someone we cared about &#8211; could you imagine calling a friend a clumsy, fat jerk?</p>
<p>I was taking a universal approach to negative or even neutral occurrences that did not apply to me as a whole person. I had to unlearn that behavior. Kids must learn that failure and mistakes are not what defines a person, but how they react to those errors does. It&#8217;s a skill that impacts our entire lives.</p>
<p>How many adults do you know that don&#8217;t have that skill? They are unlucky or &#8220;shit magnets&#8221; and full of tales of injustices, transgressions and bitterness. They can&#8217;t let things go or move forward. They look older than they are &#8211; you want to find another water cooler, checkout lane or playground just to get away from them. If it&#8217;s exhausting to hear, imagine living it.</p>
<p>I came across Dr. Martin Seligman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/1400078393/ref=la_B001ILOB78_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354535671&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life</a>. One of the labels I had heard applied to myself, and had internalized, was that I was a pessimist, so naturally this book title appealed to me.</p>
<p>It turns out that I was already doing many of the things that an optimist would do. People were characterizing my occasional very dry, dark sense of humor as pessimism, when it was an effective coping mechanism. I tend to get up pretty quickly when I&#8217;ve been knocked down, believing <em>optimistically</em>, like Scarlett O&#8217;Hara, that tomorrow&#8217;s another day.</p>
<p>So my friends, have a good Monday! Or maybe Tuesday. There&#8217;s always Wednesday&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#003300;">What do you call yourself when no one&#8217;s listening? </span></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Y&#8217;all, the past two days have been two of the weirdest days of my life. As you probably saw, the picture below has been floating around the Facebook and the internet for the past few days.</p>
<div id="attachment_1861" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/p1000383.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1861" title="P1000383" alt="" src="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/p1000383-e1354065384960.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The picture that will live in infamy</p></div>
<p>Why is that weird? Well, <a title="The one that isn’t funny – Flying Pig Marathon Weekend, Part 2" href="http://trexrunner.com/2012/05/08/the-one-that-isnt-funny-flying-pig-marathon-weekend-part-2/">I TOOK THAT PICTURE back in May</a> at the Flying Pig Marathon (which turned into a half marathon for me). So imagine my shock when I see that familiar looking picture being shared by not one but several of my Facebook friends, who had gotten it from other people. My first thought was &#8220;What a coincidence! Someone else took a picture of that guy too!&#8221; And then I checked my files and nope&#8230;it was ME. Seriously, the amount of shock cannot be overstated. And then I found out it was shared on <a href="http://www.happyplace.com/19452/how-to-shame-everyone-behind-you-during-a-marathon">HappyPlace</a>, and Stumbleupon, and by running groups all over Facebook! All of a sudden, a picture from my blog had gone viral after being posted seven months ago. And in typical T-Rex luck, it wasn&#8217;t even of me, but I was willing to let that slide since OMG.</p>
<p>With the help of <em>many</em> of my readers, I was able to get credit for the picture from many different sites. <a href="http://fiftyinfives.com">Halbert</a> somehow bullied the people from HappyPlace into <a href="http://www.happyplace.com/19452/how-to-shame-everyone-behind-you-during-a-marathon">giving me photo rights</a> (it even says my name on it! LOOK!) and everyone else who saw it was very proactive about sharing the link to the original race report. All of a sudden, the questions starting pouring in and it seemed like everybody and their mother wanted to know who this guy was. The only problem? Well, from that picture, you guys have as much information as I do.</p>
<div id="attachment_1863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/128749662775983341.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1863" title="128749662775983341" alt="" src="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/128749662775983341.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stalking isn&#8217;t funny, but this picture is.</p></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the epic stalking took place. I seriously creeped myself out while looking for him, but I was tireless. I HAD to find him! This is not meant to give stalkers ideas, but I recognize that it probably does. Sorry I&#8217;m not sorry &#8211; the people needed to know.</p>
<p>1. I knew my approximate finishing time for the half marathon, and I knew he was a 5o year old man. That&#8217;s it. So first, I filtered through all of the Flying Pig&#8217;s half marathon results for men ages 50-54.</p>
<p>2. Because everyone starts in different corrals, I knew his finishing time could be a good bit faster or slower than mine based on whether he started ahead of or behind me, so I focused on people within a half an hour of my approximate finishing time (I have blocked the actual time from memory).</p>
<p>3. I then cross referenced the bib numbers in the results with the race photos and searched through them. The problem? Grey is a very popular shirt color in the 50-54 male demographic&#8230;and so are black shorts. So then I had to find other identifiers- in this case, the headband and headphones.</p>
<p>4. Finally, I came across a picture that matched. I audibly shrieked.</p>
<div id="attachment_1862" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 436px"><a href="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/thomas.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1862" title="thomas" alt="" src="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/thomas.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ladies and gentleman, allow me to introduce you to Thomas!</p></div>
<p>Now, if Thomas had Facebook, the search would have been over&#8230;but Thomas does not have Facebook, at least that I could find. The next step was therefore to search for everyone with his first and last name on Whitepages.com. I didn&#8217;t know what state he was from, but I figured Ohio would be a good start since that is where the race is and most participants are local. I got 4 matches with his first and last name and his age. Finally, I started searching the results by entering in the random cities that those 4 Thomases were from until I got a match! I&#8217;m sorry, I know you guys are so creeped out right now, but this was NECESSARY.</p>
<p>I was literally shaking when I called him because honestly, I was afraid he was going to be either a) really mad that his picture is everywhere b)  really creeped out that I found him (can&#8217;t say I would blame him) or c) that it wouldn&#8217;t be the right Thomas and all my efforts would be for naught. Obviously, no one answered when I called and I left what was surely a very frantic sounding message on his voicemail. An hour later, I was on the phone with my grandma and the number called me back. Sorry, Nana! Gotta go! IT&#8217;S THOMAS!</p>
<p>And sure enough, I had found the right guy. Pretty much the first question he asked me was &#8220;Did my son put you up to this?&#8221; Fortunately, his son had called him just an hour before I did and told him that his picture was everywhere. Thomas thought it was a joke and when I called, he thought I was in on it. Nope! As you might expect from someone who made a shirt like that, he has an awesome sense of humor and was more than happy to talk to me about the race and the picture that has made him famous! Here&#8217;s the pseudo-interview (again, the kind of <a title="Interview with the Race Director: Baton Rouge Beach Marathon" href="http://trexrunner.com/2012/11/13/interview-with-the-race-director-baton-rouge-beach-marathon/">hard hitting journalism</a> you&#8217;ve come to expect from me), during which I was so nervous that I am sure I sounded like an 11 year old girl meeting Justin Bieber. As always, italicized text indicates my enlightened thoughts and are not Thomas&#8217; fault.</p>
<div id="attachment_1864" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/article-1313994-0b28bfc8000005dc-677_468x341.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1864" title="article-1313994-0B28BFC8000005DC-677_468x341" alt="" src="http://trexrunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/article-1313994-0b28bfc8000005dc-677_468x341.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Biebs has nothing on Thomas.</p></div>
<p><strong>Was this your first half marathon? </strong></p>
<p>No, it was my second. I ran the Pig in 2011 with my daughter also. My goal this year was to beat my time from last year.</p>
<p><strong>Did you do it?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I did, but I was a little ticked off. My finish time was somewhere around 2:45, but I thought I could finish in the 2:30-2:39 range. My main goal was to beat 2:40. Well, I ate one of those GU gel things around mile 10 and started wretching (<em>OMG! Sounds just like me!)</em>. I had to stop and catch my breath for about 5 minutes, during which time I saw the 2:45 guy run past. I was so mad! From that point on I made it my goal to catch up with that pace group, and then I made it my goal to beat them, which I did.</p>
<p><strong>When and why did you start running?</strong></p>
<p>I ran in high school and college, but life gets in the way. I started running again about 4-5 years ago as a way to get back in shape and spend time with my daughter, who is also a runner. We have run both half marathons together and we&#8217;re talking about running the full marathon next year, but I don&#8217;t know about that yet. <em>(It was at this point that I pointed out to Thomas that if I have finished 27 marathons and I was running behind HIM, then clearly, he could do a marathon too.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Where did you get the idea for the shirt?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I thought about what would piss me off the most if I read it on a shirt that was in front of me. (<em>I&#8217;m still laughing about that. Best reason ever.</em>) I wanted to needle people as much as possible, kind of get to them, you know? I know it would motivate <em>me! </em>In 2011, my shirt said &#8220;Finish or Death,&#8221; and the front of my shirt said that this year, but I added the rest onto the back for this year.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best comment anyone has made to you about the shirt?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m very hard of hearing and I wear two hearing aids, plus I always have my ipod and my headphones on, so even though I know people say things to me about it during the races, I don&#8217;t always hear them. A lot of people slap me on the back as they run past, though. This year, after the race, I was walking back to my car when a lady stopped me in the parking lot and said &#8220;I saw that damn shirt in front of me the whole race and I tried like anything to beat it and I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; My response was &#8220;How did that make <em>you </em>feel?&#8221; <em>(I died. Then he asked me if it was me that spoke to him in the parking lot, and I said no. He did beat me, though!)</em></p>
<p>When I explained to Thomas how I found him (including my results/picture cross referencing), he actually laughed and told me that HE DOES THAT to people that he finds in his finisher photos! He remembers people that he crosses the line with and then goes back and looks for their bib numbers in the pictures so he can see if he beat them or not. I about lost it. Thomas is officially my hero/new best friend. I told him that I am determined to conquer Flying Pig after my epic failure this year, and he said he would think about running the full too. He couldn&#8217;t believe that I travel and run as much as I do, but I couldn&#8217;t believe I was talking to <em>the </em>guy in the most talked about shirt on the internet.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is the story of the man behind the best race shirt you&#8217;ll ever see. I hope you enjoyed meeting him as much as I did!</p>
