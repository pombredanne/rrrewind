Will you remember everything you wanted to say, or get so discombobulated that you skip over major points? Will the audience be receptive to your ideas, or will you notice a guy in row three nodding off to sleep?</p>
<p>Presentation expert <a href="http://www.duarte.com/" target="_blank">Nancy Duarte</a>, who gave the TED Talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks.html" target="_blank">“The secret structure of great talks,”</a> has built her career helping people express their ideas in presentations. The author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/slide-ology-Science-Creating-Presentations/dp/0596522347/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2" target="_blank"><i>Slide:ology</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Resonate-Present-Stories-Transform-Audiences/dp/0470632011" target="_blank"><i>Resonate</i></a>, Duarte has just released a new book through the Harvard Business Review: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Persuasive-Presentations-Harvard-Business-Reveiw/dp/1422187101" target="_blank"><i>The HBR Guide to Persuasive Presentations</i></a>.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span>The TED Blog talked with Duarte in her California office about what makes a killer presentation, as well as about how giving her own TED Talk shaped her thoughts on presenting.</p>
<p><b>What would you say are the three keys to giving a great presentation?</b></p>
<p>The number one thing, I think, is to be audience-centric. To take the time to think through who the audience is and develop all your material from a place of empathy toward them. You’re asking them to adopt your idea, which means they may have to abandon a belief they hold as true &#8212; and that’s hard. So, know your audience &#8212; take a walk in their shoes. What keeps them up at night? How are they wired to resist your message? Most presenters are consumed with preparing their content rapidly, which makes the material about their own narrow perspective. By flipping that paradigm to an audience-centric approach, your material will resonate and the audience can feel a deeper connection to you and your material.</p>
<p>Number two, you need to understand your role in the presentation. So many people feel like they&#8217;re the central figure &#8212; kind of like the hero of the story &#8212; because they’re the one talking the most. But in reality, your role is that of a mentor &#8212; you should be giving the audience a magical gift or a special tool, or helping them get unstuck in some way. You have to defer to your audience. When you put your idea out there for an audience to contend with &#8212; if they reject your idea, your idea will die. You have to think of it as, &#8220;The speaker needs the audience more than the audience needs the speaker.&#8221; Then you’ll start to approach a material with your audience in mind – you’ll have more of a stance of humility than one of arrogance. That will help you create the kind of movement needed to get your idea to spread.</p>
<p>And then the third thing &#8212; wrap your content in story. A story serves like the sugarcoating on the outside of a pill in some ways &#8212; it just makes it go down easier. If you look at preliterate generations for thousands and thousands of years, stories would pass down for generation after generation after generation &#8212; and stay almost completely intact. Yet, a lot of people can&#8217;t remember the last presentation they sat through. So, using principles of story &#8212; the tension and release that happens in a story &#8212; that’s what will help persuade the audience toward your idea.</p>
<p><span id="more-64445"></span></p>
<p><b>I’m curious &#8212; what do you feel like you learned from giving your own TEDTalk?</b></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='530' height='329' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/UfQF3DXG-S4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I learned so much. Being the &#8220;Presentation Lady,&#8221; I knew I couldn&#8217;t suck at it. The hardest part was getting [my talk] to fit within this finite amount of time. So I trimmed and trimmed, keeping in mind that you still have to nail <i>why</i> this is important to the audience. I had a person coach me and point out places where I could trim. &#8220;You took too long here, and that made this part of emphasis too long.&#8221; I worked with the timer counting up until I knew I was within the time window &#8212; then what I did was work with the timer counting down so I’d know, &#8220;When I&#8217;m a fourth of the way through, I should be on this slide. When I&#8217;m halfway through, I need to be on this slide.&#8221; I created markers in my mind so I would know how I was running on time. Sure enough, I finished the talk and I had six seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>It was a great experience for me because I hadn&#8217;t gone through it myself. I’d coached people through it but &#8212; wow &#8212; to actually be a victim was interesting. I learned the power of rehearsing. If you rehearse really, really, really well &#8212; it looks improvisational. Some people rehearse to a point where they&#8217;re robotic, and they sound like they have memorized their presentation and didn&#8217;t take it to the next level. Going from sounding memorized and canned to sounding natural is a lot of work.</p>
<p><b>So, the classic advice for stage fright is to imagine the audience in their underwear. What do you recommend people do to calm their nerves?</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually get nervous, but when I got on [the TED] stage, I was nervous because it&#8217;s pretty high stakes. I recommend doing some breathing exercises &#8212; breathe in as deep as you can, and then take a couple more big gasps. Then, release it really slowly. That calms my heart down. But my favorite piece of advice isn&#8217;t my own &#8212; it&#8217;s from a guy named Nick Morgan. He said, &#8220;What you need to do right before you walk on stage is think of someone that you love dearly.&#8221; Doing that, I felt the chemistry in my whole body change. My shoulders relaxed and my heart melted. That feeling of affection makes your body calm itself down. That&#8217;s a really great way to stop stage fright.</p>
<p><b>What is the best way to start creating a presentation?</b></p>
<p>My best advice is to not start in PowerPoint. Presentation tools force you to think through information linearly, and you really need to start by thinking of the whole instead of the individual lines. I encourage people to use 3&#215;5 note cards or sticky notes &#8212; write one idea per note. I tape mine up on the wall and then study them. Then I arrange them and rearrange them &#8212; just work and work until the structure feels sound. And from that sound structure, you start to fill it in using a presentation tool.</p>
<p>[For visuals], I think people tend to go with the easiest, fastest idea. Like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put a handshake in front of a globe to mean partnership!&#8221; Well, how many handshakes in front of a globe do we have to look at before we realize it&#8217;s a total cliche? Another common one &#8212; the arrow in the middle of a bullseye. Really? Everyone else is thinking that way. The slides themselves are supposed to be a mnemonic device for the audience so they can remember what you had to say. They’re not just a teleprompter for the speaker. A bullseye isn&#8217;t going to make anyone remember anything. Don&#8217;t go for the first idea. Think about the point you&#8217;re trying to make and brainstorm individual moments that you&#8217;re trying to emphasize. Think to the second, the third, the fourth idea &#8212; and by the time you get to about the tenth idea, those will be the more clever memorable things for the audience.</p>
<p><b>One thing that is really different about giving a TEDTalk is the fact that you know it will be filmed. How do you think about the difference between live presentations and ones that will exist on video?</b></p>
<p>On stage, it feels really awkward to do large movements because &#8212; normally in life &#8212; we&#8217;re talking to someone in a more intimate setting and moving your arms really big feels melodramatic. But on the stage, you have to move your body in really big gestures. It feels awkward at first if you&#8217;re not used to it, so you have to kind of close your eyes and get used to it. Say things and move largely. Take big bold steps forward, big bold steps backward. You have this grand stage and people don&#8217;t use the space enough. I think one of the great things that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html" target="_blank">Jill Bolte Taylor</a> did was how she used her body. Her arms stretched all the way up when she talked about nirvana. Then she when she talks about her whole soul feeling constricted, she brings her hands down and folds her arms down in front of her. She’s using her body as a prop. That&#8217;s an important way to create meaning.</p>
<p>Also, with video, a tech rehearsal is important. Your audience on video is exponentially larger than the people in the room. So by familiarizing yourself with the cameras, you can at least look in that general direction. You know how you&#8217;re supposed to look around the audience &#8212; look and hold for five seconds, look and hold for five seconds? You should look at the camera as if it’s a human. Get used to seeing that circular lens as a face. Feel like it&#8217;s a person you&#8217;re talking to, because that audience on camera needs to feel like they&#8217;re there and that you&#8217;re looking right at them.</p>
<p>To me, presentations are the most powerful device. You can&#8217;t really name a movement that didn&#8217;t start with the spoken word. TED was once this exclusive, amazing event where ideas were exchanged, but you’ve moved to treating presentations as a media type. You guys have been so refined at it, that what it&#8217;s done is created a movement. What TED has done is made a platform for introverts, for scientists, for inventors &#8212; to share their ideas in a way that&#8217;s clear and appeals to a broad audience so that their ideas spread and get adopted. It&#8217;s completely changed how people present. It&#8217;s created this desire to be excellent in communication.</p>
<p>When you look at even how businesses communicated in the &#8217;30&#8242;s, &#8217;40&#8242;s and &#8217;50&#8242;s &#8212; they were so much clearer and well-crafted. I recently went to the Stanford Library and I got a bunch of old GE Board meetings from, like, 1957. And I thought, &#8220;These are so beautiful!&#8221; Their presentations referenced history, they quoted things, they crafted their words in such a beautiful way. Then PowerPoint entered into the mix and suddenly there wasn&#8217;t any desire to craft anymore. I think TEDTalks have brought the desire for the craft back.</p>
<p><b>Your new book is from the Harvard Business Review. Is it intended for someone who is in business, or for anyone?</b></p>
<p>All of my books are for anyone who has an idea that they need to communicate! I loved working with Harvard Business Review and I think because of the publisher, business professionals may be more interested in this book. But anyone with an idea can benefit from it. It’s a guidebook, so that people can think, &#8220;Oh, I need to know how to do this specific thing. I&#8217;m going to go get this book and find that one thing.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Halloween! I know we promised the recipe for the Cuban black beans and rice, but we&#8217;re not going to post that today. That&#8217;s the trick. But don&#8217;t worry, we have a treat in store instead &#8211; Pumpkin French Toast with Apple Cider Syrup. And yes, this latest challenger for our <a title="French Toast Madness" href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.com/2012/02/18/french-toast-madness/" target="_blank">French Toast Madness</a>, is as good as it sounds.</p>
<p>We started by soaking the slices of brioche in the batter &#8211; a mixture of milk, half and half, vanilla, pumpkin, eggs and spices. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5107.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5218" title="pumpkin battered toast" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5107.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>You can soak the bread overnight, or if you don&#8217;t want to wait that long, 30 minutes did the trick. So while our bread soaked we toasted some pecans in a mixture of butter, sugar, cinnamon, all spice, chili powder and other seasonings. The nuts roasted in the oven at 400F for about 8 minutes. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5111.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5219" title="toasted pecans" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5111.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>We also used this time to prepare the apple cider syrup. We boiled sugar, cornstarch, apple cider, lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg while stirring constantly. After the syrup boiled for a minute we stirred in some butter and the syrup was ready to go. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5113.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5220" title="apple cider syrup" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5113.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>Finally we toasted the French toast in a greased skillet until golden brown on each side. Then we topped the pumpkin treat with the syrup and nuts and were ready to go. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5114.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5221" title="IMG_5114" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5114.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>This was probably one of the fastest French toast recipes we&#8217;ve put together (either that or this is becoming old hat). It was sweet, it was flavorful and the nuts provided that salty contrast. Oh yeah, and the apple cider syrup&#8230;like apple pie. Mmmmmmm! It was good. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5118.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5222" title="pumpkin french toast" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5118.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>It is a strong contender for the championship and earned a good 3-1/2 spoons from me. Mr. N also enjoyed the French toast, especially the syrup. It was 3 spoons for him. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5121.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5223" title="pumpkin french toast with toasted pecans" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5121.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>Miss A didn&#8217;t care for this one too much. She lapped up the syrup of course, but the toast itself didn&#8217;t garner her top marks. She claims it was a 9 spoon recipe, but then admitted she didn&#8217;t really like it. So in this case 9=2. (Only because the sauce was good.) <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5127.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5224" title="pumpkin toast" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5127.jpg?w=529&#038;h=352" height="352" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>Now how did Mike rank this one? As you may recall he is a harsh critic when it comes to his French toast and doesn&#8217;t hand out top marks for just any recipe. The pumpkin French toast though &#8211; this one earned the full 4 spoons from our toughest breakfast food critic. <a href="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5132.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5225" title="pumpkin french toast with apple cider syrup" alt="" src="http://ourfamilyfoodadventures.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_5132.jpg?w=529&#038;h=330" height="330" width="529" /></a></p>
<p>This one is definitely worth a try and just might go the distance come March Madness time. Until then, Happy Halloween. I&#8217;ve got a princess cowgirl and a scary werewolf who can hardly contain their excitement for tomorrow. I hope you all enjoy the day as well. And for our East Coast friends and followers &#8211; stay safe and know that you&#8217;re in our thoughts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the news that the Rochester show has been <a title="www.brucespringsteen.net" href="http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2012/rochester-show-postponed-to-october-31-due-to-hurricane-sandy">postponed to Wednesday</a> brings the first Halloween night show for Bruce since 1992.</p>
<p>History and past performances tell us that this is one of Bruce&#8217;s favorite holidays.  Now that Halloween festivities at his house are no longer an annual event &#8211; a victim of &#8220;catastrophic success&#8221; and too many visitors in his neighborhood, as he wrote on his website a few years ago,  here&#8217;s hoping he has something up his sleeve for the fans in Rochester instead.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce has had four prior special performances for Halloween:</strong><br />
1. October 31, 1980 &#8211; Los Angeles Sports Arena</p>
<p>Bruce is carried on stage in a coffin and starts the show with a cover of &#8220;Jumpin&#8217;&#8221; Gene Simmons&#8217; &#8220;Haunted House.&#8221;  Youtube (audio) link is <a title="Haunted House (Youtube Audio)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsOUjoYIy8s">here</a>.  This performance was previously discussed on this site as one of <a title="Springsteen’s Best “One Time Only” Covers" href="http://stayhardstayhungry.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/springsteens-best-one-time-only-covers/">Bruce&#8217;s best one-time-only covers</a>.  Lesser known about this show is that Bruce also did a special cover this night to start the show&#8217;s second set: the instrumental &#8220;Out of Limits&#8221; (a takeoff on the &#8220;Outer Limits&#8221; television show theme), originally done by the Marketts in 1964.</p>
<p>2. October 31, 1984 &#8211; Los Angeles Sports Arena</p>
<p>The show starts with a skit about &#8220;midnight in Dr. Frankenstein&#8217;s laboratory,&#8221; and how &#8220;they were trying to awaken the monster.  They tried all sorts of scientific methods, such as the mystery of electricity&#8230;then they tried to awaken his sexual perceptions&#8230;and then they performed an attack on his auditorial system (as &#8220;Louie Louie&#8221; is blasted)&#8230;but nothing seemed to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But then they tried Professor Frankenstein&#8217;s foolproof monster-wake-up, and then out of the darkness came a mystery man&#8221; &#8211; and Bruce  is presented a guitar, leaps out of the coffin, and starts playing &#8220;High School Confidential.&#8221;</p>
<p>(A further description of the night&#8217;s proceedings can be found in Dave Marsh&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Glory Days</span>).</p>
<p>3. October 31, 1992 &#8211; Target Center, Minneapolis</p>
<p>A special keyboard introduction by Roy leads into a rare &#8220;Spirit in the Night&#8221; opener.</p>
<p>Bonus &#8211; October 30, 2007 &#8211; Los Angeles Sports Arena</p>
<p>No special song this time, but back at the Sports Arena (this time, the night before Halloween), Bruce is again carried on stage in a coffin.  Steve presents him a guitar and he asks &#8220;Is there anybody alive out there?&#8221; as he starts the standard &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; opener.  Video of these events was originally shown on Bruce&#8217;s website and can be found on Youtube <a title="Youtube link (video)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YweY5JtFZH4">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: there was also a Halloween show during the <em>Born to Run</em> tour in 1975 but there is no known tape and no known details about anything &#8220;special&#8221; for the holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Special Songs for Rochester?</strong></p>
<p>What might Bruce break out on Wednesday night?  There are many possible choices, and not just the ones discussed above:</p>
<p>5. &#8220;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&#8221;.  Yes, it&#8217;s obvious.  Yes, it&#8217;s cliched.  But that didn&#8217;t stop Bruce from playing this rarity in Paris this past July 4, either.</p>
<p>4.  Wages of Sin.&#8221;  This Nebraska era-outtake may only have a tenuous  connection to Halloween &#8211; one particular lyric about &#8220;the devil snapping at my heels&#8221; (a line that was also used in &#8220;My Father&#8217;s House&#8221;) &#8211; but the general mood of the song and the verse about the narrator trying to make it home through the woods before darkness falls are plenty spooky on their own. Never before performed live, this song resides on the famous Disc 2 of <em>Tracks, </em>well known to be a favorite of  Steve Van Zandt.   The past three tours have included the live premieres of &#8220;Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own,&#8221; &#8220;Restless Nights,&#8221; and &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World,&#8221; all from that same Disc 2, so perhaps this one&#8217;s not totally out of the question.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Monster Mash.&#8221;  Novelty songs have their place, and that the crowd will know it certainly helps its chances.  The band (in particular, the backup singers) should have no problem with this.  A possibility for the encore, particularly if there&#8217;s a sign requesting it.</p>
<p>2.  &#8220;Werewolves of London.&#8221;  Part of what has made Hurricane Sandy so big of a storm is the high tides associated with the full moon.  Technically, the full moon is today but that&#8217;s close enough for some howling on Wednesday night.  Even without the connection to the storm, this classic by Bruce&#8217;s friend Warren Zevon would perfect for the occasion.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;A Night with the Jersey Devil.&#8221;  Notable as the first time Bruce released original material on his website, this composition was made available on Halloween 2008 as an MP3 download with an accompanying video.  Halloween night in Rochester seems as likely a time as any for the live debut of this composition, which gave writing credits to &#8220;Bruce Springsteen / Robert Jones / Gene Vincent.&#8221;  Check out the <a title="Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6leNRGhOqA">official video here</a> and keep your fingers crossed for Wednesday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://weprofessionalliars.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/star-wars.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-345" title="Star Wars" alt="" src="http://weprofessionalliars.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/star-wars.jpg?w=584&#038;h=365" height="365" width="584" /></a></p>
<p>Today, George Lucas sold <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it feels inevitable. The real story of <em>Star Wars</em> for a long time now has been the story of a business enterprise (Lucasfilm, to be more precise). It has been the saga of merchandising rights, of toy lunch boxes, of animated spin-offs, of poorly-conceived prequels. So of course the end of this chapter would be its sale for a staggering amount of money ($4 Billion, if you&#8217;re counting). Has one story ever made an artist as rich as <em>Star Wars</em> has made George Lucas?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to feel about this news. While <em>Star Wars</em> has transformed into an enormous, sprawling franchise, we still care about it. I know I do. That&#8217;s because, at its core, there is a great story there. A young warrior, an impossible quest, a charming rogue, a beautiful woman, a wise teacher and a fallen hero turned villain, set in a universe that was unique and inspiring. <em>Star Wars</em> has been THE mythology for our times &#8211; it&#8217;s as omnipresent in our culture as the Labours of Hercules or the Trojan War were for the Ancient Greeks and Romans. We care about <em>Star Wars</em> because, at a certain point, we&#8217;d begun to think it was ours.</p>
<p>Today is a reminder that it isn&#8217;t. Hell, perhaps it never will be, given how determined the copyright lobby (led by <em>Star Wars</em>&#8216; new owners, Disney) are to prevent proven money-makers ever entering the public domain. <em>Star Wars</em> is a commodity to be bought and sold, and now we&#8217;re guaranteed new films to ensure the money keeps rolling in.</p>
<p>On one hand, it&#8217;s hard to imagine Disney could commodify the saga any more than George Lucas already has. How many more animated parodies or toy lines could they possibly create? The sale does open up a door that I thought would have remained shut until Lucas passed on &#8211; other filmmakers will have a chance to play in the <em>Star Wars</em> sandbox. A glance at Disney&#8217;s stewardship of Marvel, who have operated with relative independence and have been increasingly open to collaborating with exciting talent (Joss Whedon, Kenneth Brannagh, Shane Black, Edgar Wright, to name a few directors on Marvel&#8217;s books) suggest this might not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>And there will be no shortage of filmmakers ready to raise their hand to make a <em>Star Wars</em> film. It will remain to be seen whether they have a worthy story to tell. Is there anything more to be said in the saga of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader? Would they be brave enough to use the universe they&#8217;ve been given to try something daring and new?</p>
<p>The sale of <em>Star Wars</em> is a stark reminder of how art today, and especially blockbuster filmmaking, has become about certified franchises and continuing revenue streams. In that sense, it feels like we&#8217;ve never been further away from sharing stories over a campfire. And yet part of me can&#8217;t help but hope that, by freeing <em>Star Wars</em> from the clutches of its creatively-waning creator, the possibilities for exciting storytelling in this world built on lightsabers, cooky eastern religions, planet-destroying space stations and unapologetic heroism have never been greater. Despite all the times I&#8217;ve sworn off <em>Star Wars</em>, I know I&#8217;ll be eagerly watching what happens next. Which is, of course, what the money-men are counting on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_835" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://rebeccacao.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dayaftertomorrow-full.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-835" title="Not Hurricane Sandy" alt="" src="http://rebeccacao.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dayaftertomorrow-full.jpg?w=480&#038;h=204" height="204" width="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Day After Tomorrow or Hurricane Sandy? It&#8217;s hard to tell.</p></div>
<p>This morning, after I dutifully churned out 1294 words for the day, I had a couple of minutes to spare before my first class. My email informed me that I was one of 1000 participants selected to take a survey. No, I&#8217;m not special or anything &#8212; Michigan students were randomly chosen. The drawing for a $50 e-certificate from iTunes, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble piqued my interest and I decided to click on the link. The next 15 minutes and 20 or so questions proceeded to make me feel like a horrible human being.</p>
<p>Was I aware of the university&#8217;s ongoing efforts to protect the Huron River? No.</p>
<p>Did I set my thermostat 65 degrees or below in the winter months? Definitely not&#8230;can I blame bad circulation and extreme sensitivity to cold?</p>
<p>How often did I purchase grass-fed beef? Um, how do you know the difference?</p>
<p>How often do you purchase locally grown or processed foods? Oh, hey, I went to the farmer&#8217;s market a few weeks ago. And I buy from Trader Joe&#8217;s! They&#8217;re local, right? Uh-oh, I&#8217;m pretty sure my mustard was imported from France.</p>
<p>Do you use motion sensor outlet plugs? What the hell are those?</p>
<p>Needless to say, on my way to Spanish Linguistics lecture, I had plenty to ponder. Generally, I consider myself someone who&#8217;s concerned about the environment. I wholeheartedly believe global warming/climate change is real. Heck, look at the East Coast right now. Sometimes, though, I lose faith in humanity and it&#8217;s so hard to believe that me &#8212; just one person &#8212; could ever make a difference. I feel like for every pound of carbon I don&#8217;t produce, a hundred more pounds are emitted from building the next <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/21/the-ultimate-knock-off-a-fake-apple-store/">Apple knockoff store</a> in China. How can I ever compete?</p>
<p>Yet all social movements were begun with a few lonely souls. Not to say that I&#8217;m striving for the Nobel Peace Prize or anything, but it&#8217;s a fact that individuals can make a difference. Upon further thought, I decided to adhere to the following rules throughout my lifetime:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Never own a car.</strong> Well, I kind of already own a car. I guess my goal is not to use a car on a daily basis. I aspire to live in an area where I can either walk, bike, or take public transportation to school/work/grocery shopping.</li>
<li><strong>Never use air conditioning.</strong> I can&#8217;t stand the cold, but Americans are really babies about summer heat. No, it doesn&#8217;t make your company cool (in the figurative sense, of course) to set the thermostat at 65 degrees all summer long. Most buildings in Europe don&#8217;t even have AC installed.</li>
<li><strong>Buy organic, bio-based, local, and hormone-free products. </strong>Although they may be slightly more expensive, the health and environmental benefits far outweigh the additional cost.</li>
<li><strong>Plant my own garden.</strong> This is something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do anyway, but now I&#8217;m more motivated.</li>
<li><strong>Keep my own chicken coop.</strong> I don&#8217;t think I could eat a bird I&#8217;d killed myself, but fresh eggs sound delicious.</li>
<li><strong>Buy secondhand appliances and furniture.</strong> I love antique shops and flea markets anyway, but now I&#8217;ll also hit up Craiglist or Ebay for appliances. No wedding registry for me!</li>
<li><strong>Procreate at most twice.</strong> Overpopulation is a serious imminent problem and people should seriously consider the morality behind having more than two biological children. If you, like me, want a large family, go the Jolie-Pitt route.</li>
<li><strong>Instill love of nature in children.</strong> A real childhood is spent outdoors, without electronics or Internet. It always makes me sad how toddlers these days <a href="http://youtu.be/6W1Nmm6rjho">need technology</a> to function.</li>
</ol>
<p>How often do you think about the environment? Does it affect the daily lifestyle decisions you make? How are some ways you sacrifice for the global good?</p>
<p>Salut,</p>
<p>R</p>

<br />
THINGS WE LEAVE BEHIND</p>
<p>About seven years ago my in-laws moved into a small apartment and began purging unnecessary items from their lives.  Besides getting rid of needless junk, they sorted sentimental keepsakes from the past and then divided them up between their sons.  </p>
<p>At the time we weren’t too happy about it.  It seemed morbid, and what’s worse, we were suddenly stuck with boxes of mementos from my husband’s childhood, and had nowhere to store them either.</p>
<p>But after my in-laws’ deaths this past summer, we realized how wrong we were.  It turned out that what his parents had done was not just practical, it was incredibly thoughtful as well.  Because of their sorting and purging, my husband and his brother had little left to deal with, and for that we were all very grateful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even with their planning, his parents left behind two items that we didn’t know what to do with.  Nobody wanted them, yet nobody wanted to part with them either. </p>
<p>I am now the proud owner of both.</p>
<p>The first is an unusual painting of a man walking to an outhouse in a pounding rainstorm – a painting that was prominently displayed at my husband’s childhood home and in all others that his parents lived in since.  The second is Chopper, my in-laws&#8217; 150-year-old deaf, arthritic, one-eyed, trembling, foul-smelling mutt.  (Oh, he bites too.)</p>
<p>When my in-laws first moved down to Southern California to be near their grandchildren they struggled with loneliness. They had left their life and circle of friends back home in Northern California, and, besides occasional babysitting, had little to do.  I was worried about them so when I read somewhere that pets were good therapy for the elderly, I suggested that they get a dog.</p>
<p>It took some convincing, but ultimately they agreed.  I began an internet search for the perfect second-hand dog.  Eventually I found an adorable Jack Russell Terrier (just like the one on <em>Frasier</em>) that was available for adoption at the local Humane Society.</p>
<p>I called my in-laws and had them rush to the pound before someone else could snap him up.  Only a few hours later they arrived at our house to introduce us to their new dog.  </p>
<p>But when we opened the door there was no adorable Jack Russell terrier.  Instead, there stood an old quivering wiry-haired mutt.  This dog looked like a German Shepherd had mated with a hedgehog and the hedgehog won.  </p>
<p>“What’s this?  Where’s the adorable Jack Russell Terrier that I found?”  I demanded.</p>
<p>My in-laws explained that they chose this little dog, oddly named “Chopper” because the humane society worker said he was a better match for them.  Also, he was free with their “Seniors for Seniors” program.</p>
<p>I could not hide my disappointment.  This dog was a shoo-in to win an ugliest dog contest, and what’s worse he smelled like a dirty old fish tank.</p>
<p>But my in-laws loved him, as did my kids.  In fact, my children thought I was a horrible person for not seeing his appeal. </p>
<p>My in-laws catered to that dog like he was a newborn baby.  They bought him a cozy new bed and a car seat and let him rule their house.  They gave him a steady diet of table scraps even though their vet reprimanded him for his weight gain.  Over the years they spent thousands of their limited dollars on his ever-increasing medical problems, including an expensive surgery to remove his cancerous eye.</p>
<p>My husband and his brother often joked that their parents treated Chopper like the child they never had.  They adored that little mutt.</p>
<p>But after my father-in-law passed away from a brief illness in July, and my mother-in-law died from a stroke two weeks later, Chopper was left alone.  My brother-in-law stepped up to take care of him for the short term, but then found an apartment that conveniently did not accept pets.  Chopper was orphaned once again.  </p>
<p>We tried to find him a home.  I posted a picture of him on Facebook, but I think my description was a little too accurate and likely scared off any takers.</p>
<p>Friends suggested that it might just be best to put him down.  After all, they said, he’d lived a long full life.  But my husband and I just couldn’t do it.  We didn’t think that he was in pain and it seemed wrong to put him down just because having him would be inconvenient.  Also, my kids were still getting over the loss of their grandparents.   Chopper is the last connection they have to them.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why we inherited that painting &#8211; the depressing one of the guy trying to get to the outhouse.  Neither my husband nor his brother wanted to have it up in their homes, yet neither wanted to get rid of it either.  It’s a connection to their parents that they’re just not ready to part with.  </p>
<p>When I look at that painting I wonder what my mother-in-law saw could have possibly seen in it.  She had such a positive outlook on life, and to me that depressing painting didn’t fit.</p>
<p>My husband suggested that maybe she liked the dreariness of it.  Maybe when she was feeling low she could look at that bleak painting and say, &#8220;Well, life could be worse.   I could be this guy having to walk outside in a pounding rainstorm just to use the toilet.”</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s what appealed to them about Chopper?   As the years took their toll and their list of ailments grew, they could look at him with his even longer list of problems and figure he had to feel worse.  “Here’s a dog in worse shape than us.  We love him!”</p>
<p>Hopefully, I’ll grow to embrace our new dog Chopper somehow.  I have to admit, it is hard to look at him with his one eye and his shaking arthritic legs and not think, “Life could be worse.”  The fact that he’s still eager to chase a ball boggles the mind.</p>
<p>And I suspect that my in-laws are staring down at me now and having a hearty laugh at my expense.  “So you wanted us to get a dog, did you?”</p>

<p>The author of <a href="http://bipolarblogging.wordpress.com/about/">bipolarblogging.wordpress.com</a> is a 50-something person who writes candidly about their struggles living with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar Disorder</a>. The language is plain, direct, unadorned, and above all, human:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I decided I didn’t want to live.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The blogger relates the depth of their despair in careful, reflective detail: the cyclical inability to engage at work, to find satisfaction in leisure time, and their diminished appetite, energy, and motivation to live. What struck us most is the silence with which the blogger endures the pain of depression. It made us stop and reflect: how many people have we encountered in our lives who have seemed distant or distracted, who weren&#8217;t quite themselves? What was really going on? How can we and how must we react differently when we sense something wrong? </p>
<p>English author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene">Graham Greene</a> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/95994-writing-is-a-form-of-therapy-sometimes-i-wonder-how">once said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Writing is a form of therapy; sometimes I wonder how all those who do not write, compose or paint can manage to escape the madness, melancholia, the panic and fear which is inherent in a human situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the process of writing, bipolarblogging.wordpress.com&#8217;s author realizes their death would devastate the ones that they love. The simple act of writing brought clarity and planted the seeds of hope. The blogger&#8217;s strength and courage are inspiring:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
My life is hard, and is about to get harder, but it is life after all.  As hard as it may be, it’s still better than the alternative.  If I can only hold on I have to believe it will get better.  I’ve survived worse, and I can survive this.  I have to, for myself and for those I love.</p>
<p>I have decided I want to live.
</p></blockquote>
