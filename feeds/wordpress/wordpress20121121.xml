				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://memilliken.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-19-at-2-08-22-pm.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-487 aligncenter" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-19 at 2.08.22 PM" alt="" src="http://memilliken.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-19-at-2-08-22-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=162" height="162" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to suggest something seemingly outrageous: <i>GIRLS</i> isn&#8217;t that great.</p>
<p>Hear me out.</p>
<p>No one was looking forward to <i>GIRLS</i> more than me. Actually that&#8217;s probably not true (hyperbole strikes again!) but I was definitely looking forward to it.</p>
<p>The first few episodes were a delight. Look at these <i>GIRLS</i> in all capitals! They&#8217;re my age!<i> </i>Sometimes they say juvenile regrettable things and make mistakes and try to act cool when they&#8217;re really shattering to pieces inside! Hannah has a normal body! They masturbate! I can relate! I can relate to it all!</p>
<p>And then I couldn&#8217;t anymore.</p>
<p>Perhaps I don&#8217;t have enough experience with girls my age even though I am one or maybe in the time I lived in Brooklyn as a 22 year old I missed out on the lifestyle the show depicts. By the fifth episode of <i>GIRLS</i>, I was forced to admit it was nothing more than a <i>Sex and the City </i>wolf in an edgier, younger sheep&#8217;s clothing most likely from Free People.</p>
<p>The show is a great show. It&#8217;s entertaining, it&#8217;s well written, it&#8217;s starkly and sometimes frighteningly honest. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air. I really just think the title is inaccurate.</p>
<p><i>GIRLS</i> isn&#8217;t girls. It&#8217;s stereotypes of girls, specifically of white girls living their white lives whitily. I don&#8217;t think <i>GIRLS</i> is representative of post-college &#8220;girls&#8221; at all. In fact, as a post-college person with lady parts, I find the title almost insulting. Hannah is 24 years old and she expects her parents to support her living in Brooklyn. She has an emotionally and often sexually abusive boyfriend whom she tolerates for reasons unknown to me (that face!). Marnie, the responsible one, is uptight and filled with anxiety. Shoshanna&#8217;s &#8220;biggest baggage&#8221; is that she&#8217;s a virgin (THE HORROR!) and wait&#8230;did I just hear that &#8220;all adventurous women&#8221; have HPV? Here I pictured adventurous women volunteering at orphanages in western Africa or jumping out of planes. Silly me?</p>
<p>Is that, as Peggy Lee once crooned, all there is? Do we just have <i>GIRLS </i>to represent us as females living in our twenties? We&#8217;re not women, you guys. We&#8217;re girls! We&#8217;re just taller children with hips and tits navigating our twenties &#8220;one mistake at a time.&#8221; We don&#8217;t support ourselves. Responsibility isn&#8217;t fun. We don&#8217;t make decisions based on what would benefit us in our future or what would impact others. Boys our age are either intimidating or unfuckable wimps. Oh, and we live in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I have often heard Lena Dunham described as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lena+dunham+voice+of+a+generation&amp;rlz=1C1CHFA_enUS484US485&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=lena+dunham+voice+of&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=5&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">&#8220;the voice of our generation.&#8221;</a> I hope that&#8217;s not true, because I can say with certainty that she doesn&#8217;t speak for me. To me, the image <i>GIRLS</i> paints of actual girls is a little muddled. I know &#8220;girls&#8221; who help support their families. Girls with children. Girls in the military. Girls who own houses. Girls who <i>build </i>houses. Teachers, girlfriends, mothers, engineers, wives, single girls, artists, volunteers, pilots, daughters, nurses, virgins, sluts (hey, no bad thing to regularly have sex when a girl isn&#8217;t in a relationship), etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>We aren&#8217;t girls, HBO. We&#8217;re women. I&#8217;m fairly certain we&#8217;ll be navigating our lives &#8220;one mistake at a time&#8221; for the rest of it. Let&#8217;s give <i>GIRLS</i> the credit it deserves as a TV show, but let&#8217;s not forget it doesn&#8217;t necessarily represent all twenty-something females (people with lady parts, if you will).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a lot of Americans, Thanksgiving isn&#8217;t so much about the good food and time off of work (hopefully. If not, sorry! I’ve been there). It’s really about the anticipation and build-up to what has become the main event: Black Friday.</p>
<p>Listen, if you love Black Friday, cool. If you love standing in long lines with family and friends, trampling down old ladies and biting children for the shiniest Xbox* in the store, and the thrill of feeling like you got a screaming deal, I can respect that.</p>
<p>But I have never, nor do I plan to ever, participate in Black Friday. Here’s why I prefer sleeping off my turkey hangover at home.</p>
<p><span id="more-600"></span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kyiv_traffic_jam.JPG" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Traffic jam on Okipnoj str in Kyiv" alt="Traffic jam on Okipnoj str in Kyiv" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Kyiv_traffic_jam.JPG/300px-Kyiv_traffic_jam.JPG" height="199" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Traffic jam (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p><b>The traffic</b><br />
First of all, I live in a pretty small city. So it’s not a little town, but it’s no Chicago or New York. Generally, the traffic is on a spectrum from no-one-on-the-road to annoying-but-tolerable. But I have made the mistake of venturing out for some groceries on Black Friday before. And even in my small city, traffic is BACKED UP, y’all. I’m talkin’ cars stopped in intersections, further slowing traffic on the cross streets. No available parking spaces at any store, anywhere. Stop and go conditions, even on the side roads. No thank you.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DCUSA.Gallery11.BB%26BBlackFriday.Wikipedia.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="English: DC USA, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Black Friday" alt="English: DC USA, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Black Friday" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/DCUSA.Gallery11.BB%26BBlackFriday.Wikipedia.jpg/300px-DCUSA.Gallery11.BB%26BBlackFriday.Wikipedia.jpg" height="225" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DC USA, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Black Friday (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p><b>The crowds</b><br />
This one really goes hand-in-hand with the traffic. As noted before, I once ventured out for groceries on Black Friday, reasoning that all the people were going to be in retail stores, not markets, and that no one but me needs groceries the day after Thanksgiving. WRONG. There was no pushing my cart down the aisles. Let me paint a picture for you: old, confused ladies comparing different types of rice in the middle of aisle three; overly taxed mothers wrangling sugared-up toddlers who are running under others’ cart wheels in aisle seven (bless their souls!); that <i>one person</i> who just lifted the wrong tomato in the pile of produce, sending the rest of them tumbling to the floor. No getting around that place whatsoever.<br />
And once I finally obtained whatever it was I was looking for, the line at every. available. register. stretched clear up to Terre Haute (in the words of my favorite Christmas movie narrator).<br />
Why deal with all of that? There’s a reason I didn&#8217;t move to a large city. Crowds aren&#8217;t for me.</p>

<p><b>The money</b><br />
OK, I realize that some stores do put things on a legitimately good sale on Black Friday. However, most items are not anywhere near as good a bargain as Big Marketing wants you to think they are. USA Today reported <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2010-11-15-walmart-toys-r-us-black-friday_N.htm">here</a> that “very few customers are actually the beneficiaries of Black Friday deals,” meaning that those awesome “doorbusters” are actually in extremely short supply, and if you don’t get your hands on one (and you probably won’t), you’re not getting a deal at all. And, it’s been proven time and again that the prices on everything else in the store are probably actually higher than at other times of the year.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black-friday-walmart-bfcom.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Black Friday shoppers at Walmart" alt="Black Friday shoppers at Walmart" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Black-friday-walmart-bfcom.jpg/300px-Black-friday-walmart-bfcom.jpg" height="263" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Black Friday shoppers at Walmart (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p><b>The consumerism</b><br />
I’m just plain old fed up with typical American consumerism. I refuse to buy into the idea that my family needs Christmas presents piled as high as the ceiling, or that we need to buy for everyone in our extended family to express our love for them, or that we need the latest electronics/toys/home decorations/etc. I did buy into that for awhile, and of course I do have wants. But the crazed pushing and shoving (over a tickle-me-Elmo for goodness’ sake) is not okay with me. I won’t add to it or take part in it in any way.</p>
<p>In short, I think that the intent behind Black Friday, which is to buy as much crap as possible, as fast as possible, with as few dollars as possible, is just not for me. I prefer to be careful and thoughtful with my purchases. I prefer to spend money on experiences rather than things. And I prefer to pare my Christmas celebrations down to enjoying my family’s company and a nice meal. So I won’t be participating in Black Friday this year, or any year (probably. I also never say never).</p>
<p>What about you? Do you line up at the mall doors on Black Friday (or Thursday)?</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h6>*I just want to note that Microsoft Word recognizes the word “Xbox”. Does that tell you anything about the regard to which we now hold our electronics? Is it beautiful? Is it sad? I don’t know. That is a question for another day, apparently.</h6>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dearest buddy,</p>
<p>Yesterday, after a protracted battle over television rights, you managed to negotiate a one-hour deal for the afternoon. We obliged and retired to our room to read. I came out for a drink of water and was surprised to not hear the usual raucous sounds of Curious George or Yo Gabba Gabba. Instead, there was silence. A beam of afternoon sunshine streamed in through the window illuminating a small patch of floor where you sat quietly. Reading a book. Whispering each word along your steady and determined progress through the sentence. I remember not paying attention to what the book was about, I was simply transfixed by the sight I&#8217;ve just described. In a few short moments you took me back to some of my childhood&#8217;s happiest memories.</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t realize what an important moment this is, for you and for your parents. We started to get you to read words a short while ago. It was gratifying to see you work your way up from letters to sounds to rhyming words. Your grandparents were here when they taught you those. Everyone would be delighted when you&#8217;d shout out the word to the accompanying picture. Cat, mat, rat. But today, is something truly special. You&#8217;ve realized the power these innocuous groups of letters can summon when they become groups of words. Every word a small, yet stable stone that&#8217;s leading you over a marsh of ignorance to the safety of land.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in books I&#8217;ve found entertainment, solace, learning, discovery and intrigue. And this was even before I turned ten. I devoured books at a rate that alarmed my parents. I remember spending summer vacations at my grandfather&#8217;s place in Mumbai, waking up every morning with the eager anticipation of a trip to the local library. Let me assure you that the library was the closest thing to paradise I&#8217;d ever seen. It was full of musty books, the best kind in my opinion. Withered pages bearing colors of rust and overuse. And behind those wilting spines a treasure of juvenile adventures. The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Agatha Christie (I still love Poirot, by the way), Famous Five. I used to start reading the book on my way back home, bumping into the merciless sea of humanity that is Dadar. Dad would be at the end of his tether by the time we returned. I&#8217;d bring back a book and be done with it by night. This went on for a week until dad decided to check if there was a point to wading through crowds every morning for my books. He picked up a Poirot I&#8217;d acquired that morning, randomly chose a page and asked me questions about the plot. I answered correctly. He was stunned. He never questioned me again and cheerfully accompanied me to the library after that.</p>
<p>Over time, that glorious habit has been replaced by staring at excel sheets and writing concise one-liners in a short span of time for important people with even shorter attention spans. I stare at screens all day and it seems books have kept pace with our robotization, for they too are an integral part of those screens. I stay informed through thousands of words flitting across my screen, neatly organized into 140-character morsels. I educate myself and analyze through longform articles or by reading the musings of some very smart people I&#8217;m privileged to know. But once in a while, I&#8217;ll shut down those screens, settle into bed with a glass of scotch, a reading light and open a book. Not turn it on, or switch it on. Open it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d like you to read your books too. You&#8217;re no stranger to iPhones and iPads and you even asked me what a &#8220;Kindle&#8221; is. It&#8217;s only a matter of time. But there are some things about the books I knew that I want you to know. They are what we aspire to be. Books have a spine, and they give you one. Books are opened, and they do that to your mind. Each turn of a page is a symbolic act of moving onto something new and undiscovered, but never forgetting where you&#8217;ve come from. When you encounter a difficult word, I&#8217;ve taught you to &#8220;break it up&#8221;, so you make a chopping gesture and bring your little hand down on the offender. But it stays there, resolute, challenging you to get through it. Remember, you cannot destroy words, so be careful of what you write and what you allow yourself to read.</p>
<p>A few days ago you came across the word &#8220;comfortable&#8221; and struggled to pronounce it. Eventually you settled on &#8220;confontable&#8221; and asked me what it meant. I told you it meant &#8220;warm and cozy&#8221;. Tonight as I tucked you into bed you kept shuffling around restlessly. When I impatiently queried your motives, you stopped for a second and said you&#8217;re &#8220;trying to get confontable&#8221;. What made me feel very confontable was that you learned that from a book.</p>
<p>I want to share so many books with you. I&#8217;m delighted at the prospect of debating motives, the sanctity of events, the morality of characters in books both of us have read. Like I did when dad handed me a copy of Allen Drury&#8217;s Advise and Consent. For a short while, I fell in love with politics because we debated it. Dad may not remember that conversation, but I do. I look forward to creating many such memories with you.</p>
<p>And so I hope a book always accompanies you wherever you go. Because those thousand miles always begin with a single page.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Dad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This post could be seen as a self-narrating zoo-exhibit with bonus spot-the-theory-of-mind. I hope you&#8217;ll take it as a follow-up to The Obsessive Joy Of Autism, as equally about the experiences of visual processing impairments and synesthesia as about ~autism, and as a case study in the inadequacy of traditional verbal language. If I&#8217;d been taught earlier that experiences which exist independent of words are still meaningful and sufficient, I never would have had to write this.)</p>
<p>(This whole essay represents a dozen years of heartache, a fractured self-image knit back together, and the entire reason why I will never, ever talk about the instinctive simplicity of video editing.)</p>
<p>(Note: as is typical of my writings, pieces are rarely finished in the same day they are started. The voice lesson I refer to as &#8220;today&#8221; is in reality long past; in fact, due to circumstances regrettably beyond my control, it turned out to be my last. I have been unable to further explore the discovery my voice teacher and I made, and it aches.)</p>
<p>(This entire piece is written in a voice I don&#8217;t very much care for. My apologies.)</p>
<p>(I can either keep apologizing in parentheses for a lifetime, or just tell it to you.)</p>
<p>A fifth is two sine curves, and this is the most beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a dozen years of classical musical training, and I&#8217;ve been playing with calculus for about the same amount of time. I don&#8217;t talk about either of these things with much frequency. I don&#8217;t like to sing in front of people, and I have a passionate love affair with math but hated and barely passed my classes in high school. I drink up <a href="http://io9.com/5947852/this-is-a-hexaflexagon-its-about-to-blow-your-mind?fb_action_ids=4695156737637%2C10151465733434097&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%7B%224695156737637%22%3A114534322033392%2C%2210151465733434097%22%3A114534322033392%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%224695156737637%22%3A%22og.likes%22%2C%2210151465733434097%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map">geometry videos on youtube</a>, and once a week I go to my voice teacher&#8217;s house and sing for the best hour of the week, and these things are secrets. Very few people know how important music and math are to me, and that&#8217;s been a deliberate choice on my part.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t talk about the most sacred things, because it&#8217;s the fastest way to destroy them.</p>
<p>I have an intense and embodied relationship with music. Music is a lot like people, and songs are linguistic and therefore social exercises. Music teases and tells and remembers and reflects and transforms and encodes and transmits. I experience music kinesthetically, emotionally, and intimately. It is shattering.</p>
<p>I know a lot about music. I hate talking about it, because the things I know aren&#8217;t the same as the things you know.</p>
<p>My left hand doesn&#8217;t have enough coordination to permit me to play any instruments. I can, and do, sing, and I&#8217;ve spent 12 years learning to do so with surgical precision. I can&#8217;t sight-sing&#8211;I can peel apart the layers of a piece for theory, no problem, but identifying pitch and tempo and dynamic and a note&#8217;s place in the overall piece, and integrating those elements, factoring in timbre and placement, and singing them, in realtime, is simply not possible with my visual processing impairments. I rely on an ear I&#8217;ve spent years training&#8211;if there&#8217;s one other singer, or a pianist accompanying, I can do a passable imitation of first-time sight-singing even pieces I&#8217;ve never heard before. </p>
<p>Ever since I first joined an (auditioned, highly-selective, then-prestigious) youth choir at age eight, I&#8217;ve known that I do music wrong. At first, that took the form of being shamed for moving when I sang&#8211;music shouldn&#8217;t be a physical, embodied, tactile experience. In later years, my inability to process visually rapidly enough to sight-sing, and my difficulty holding a harmony, made rehearsal a living hell. Yet I was never kicked out, because I could still sing circles around 2/3 of the other singers, and it wasn&#8217;t that I couldn&#8217;t harmonize, just that I might sing any one of a range of acceptable harmonies and not necessarily the one I was arbitrarily assigned (or the one the composer had written,) and as long as I didn&#8217;t talk about it, no one knew I couldn&#8217;t sight-sing. (I did, of course, talk about it; lying didn&#8217;t occur to me until later years.) I trained my ear, led the 1st sopranos because the melodic options are necessarily restricted and usually sensical, kept my joy at things I had the wrong words for to myself, and kept singing.</p>
<p>(My life goes on<br />
in endless song<br />
how can I keep from singing?)</p>
<p>It destroyed me. I loved this, I was so good at it, it <em>felt</em> good and right and perfect, and yet any attempts to communicate about this were miserable failures. Singing is the only time I ever feel at home in my body, and yet I felt like a fraud; sure I could learn a new song faster than anyone using only my ear, but I couldn&#8217;t sight-sing. Clearly this was some elaborate hoax I&#8217;d engineered, clearly I didn&#8217;t have any real aptitude, and clearly, my decision not to pursue college or career in music or performance was the only ethical option.</p>
<p>Despite this, despite the guilt and shame and confusion, I&#8217;ve kept going to weekly lessons. It&#8217;s an hour, just me and my teacher and a piano, and as we pull songs apart and test what my throat can do, the songs resonate between my ribs. It is, essentially, an hour of breathing exercises,  so it&#8217;s the most effective therapy I&#8217;ve ever had. And I&#8217;ve kept going, and today, finally, after 12 years, we figured it out.</p>
<p>There were signs. The music teacher at my high school had almost worked it out; he&#8217;d play two notes, and I&#8217;d hear a third, and not every student could. He talked about harmonics and melodic structure; I listened, and adored him, but had trouble talking to him. With my voice teacher, I complained that the standard system of music notation was nonsensical, bearing no correspondence to the way music actually worked, and relied on a flagrant disregard for basic arithmetic. I struggled with the idea that a fourth is supposed to sound &#8220;smaller&#8221; than a fifth, and though I could sing any note back perfectly, I couldn&#8217;t tell you which notes were higher or lower. None of the language used to communicate about music made any kind of sense to me. The spatial metaphors simply would not map. I had my own rich, dynamic, embodied and  visiospatial experience of music, I could feel and see the music <em>move</em>, and sheet music couldn&#8217;t come close.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you what my teacher and I learned today, but first I need to give away my other secret: math.</p>
<p>My history with mathematics is, if possible, even more tortured and rapturous and bewildering than my relationship with music. As a small child, I was in love with arithmetic; my mental calculation abilities are noted on my earliest evaluations (and dismissed, of course, as splinter skills.) One of my earliest memories is of not being able to explain to a concerned teacher <em>why</em> 2+3=5. &#8220;Because it is,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s beautiful. It just fits.&#8221; Manipulatives were meaningless for me&#8211;my eyes couldn&#8217;t process them easily, and they didn&#8217;t bear any relation to the ladders and scales of numbers in my head. I simply had to close my eyes, and think of an equation, and I would feel myself swing from number to number, landing effortlessly and securely on the answer. Easier than walking.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s a hint to the eventual reveal, there.)</p>
<p>While I had some small troubles learning the language for arithmetic (especially for fractions, which are fun and clever enough as pointless rituals but <em>beautiful</em> when you realize that they actually signify multiplication and division, that you are performing meta math,) mathematics was an easy joy. Note, please, that I am talking about the <a href="http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">art of mathematics</a>, not the drivel and formulas we&#8217;re drilled on in school. Mathematics really <em>is</em> an art, and it&#8217;s inherently playful. It&#8217;s a game of &#8220;what if&#8221; and &#8220;how can I.&#8221; And when I was eight years old (and still now,) what I wanted most to figure out was how I could model, and therefore predict, events in the world around me. In particular, I was fascinated by the rate at which raindrops crossed and accumulated on my car window as my mom drove me to therapy.</p>
<p>So I invented the fundamental theorem of calculus. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know I was doing this at the time, of course. I didn&#8217;t know what algebra was yet; if I&#8217;d heard of calculus, I thought it was about calculators, which I found woefully inefficient. I&#8217;d never heard of Liebnitz, and Newton had only been hit on the head by a terrifying apple, as far as I knew. I didn&#8217;t use the greek alphabet or sigma notation; I didn&#8217;t use any notation at all. I just ran some dimensional transformations in my head, checked my model for accuracy, and had a nice visual to keep myself comforted when my hands needed to be still.</p>
<p>Eight years later, my AP Calculus/Physics class was asked to prove the relationship between derivatives and integrals, and I got up and drew the model, and not a single one of my classmates understood. After a moment of studying what I did, Mr. Morris said, &#8220;spoiler alert, Julia just skipped to the end of the lesson and proved the fundamental theorem of calculus.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t draw it for you now; I lost the image, along with some of my more unusual human-calculator prowess, when my psychiatrist put me on the anti-psych medication regimen that ended in me dropping out of college. But I could then, and before that day, I hadn&#8217;t realized that my classmates couldn&#8217;t see that basic, innate relationship, the reason why calculus is beautiful enough to ache. I didn&#8217;t have the language for it, had never even heard of the fundamental theorem until my teacher told me that was what I&#8217;d done. I&#8217;d just been amusing myself with models and transformations, when I should have been paying attention in class.</p>
<p>See, that&#8217;s the thing. I struggled in math class from Algebra 1 on. I never actually took the AP calculus exam&#8211;Mr. Morris thought I&#8217;d do fine, but since I was technically auditing his class, I didn&#8217;t want to try and sit for it. And this is where the agony comes in.</p>
<p>Much like music, the way I experience and represent mathematics cognitively is fundamentally different from the conventional language we are taught for it. With arithmetic, this difference only really caused difficulty when new terms were being introduced. But 2+3 is always 5, and I had enough innate understanding and motivation to preserver through even the most ridiculous name choices. </p>
<p>This all fell apart when I got to algebra. It&#8217;s not that I lacked understanding&#8211;I&#8217;d been solving for the missing number since I was nine, and the only hardship I&#8217;d had there was, again, in comprehending the linguistic absurdity of mixing letters and numbers and shifting the missing piece to the left side of the equation. As soon as I got over that, I immediately started attempting to teach the game to anyone around me, including my four-year-old sister. Algebra wasn&#8217;t the issue. The way we represented it, modeled it, and talked about it? That was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Graphs on a cartesian plane have a lot of meaning for me&#8211;for another purpose (clue.) They also bear absolutely no relation to the kinesthetic and visual models I see when I craft algebraic equations. Zero. None. And I couldn&#8217;t articulate this in high school, anymore than I could make myself care about pitch or slope whether the equation came in point-slope or some other form. I didn&#8217;t understand why we were talking about graphs at all. It wasn&#8217;t until algebra 2 that someone explained to me that all of our equations were supposed to be models for those lines.</p>
<p>I was enraged.</p>
<p>I still am, thinking about it. What a <em>stupid</em> waste of my time. Who the fuck cared about <em>lines</em>? I wanted to know how to model the age distribution of my peers around me and how it shifted in relation to me as we moved through the grades, how to fit equilateral triangles with a side length of 2in inside a hexagon with 6in sides as efficiently as possible, how to predict prime numbers. Why on <em>earth</em> would I make an equation for a line I couldn&#8217;t even make my hands draw reliably half the time?I wouldn&#8217;t! This possibility had never occurred to me! I had better things to do!</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t care about graphs. Later, in college, my math major friend would teach me the theory behind linear algebra in half an hour, and I would concede that graphs were pretty fucking intense, but in high school, all I knew was that I was being asked to humor, to <em>indulge</em> teachers who were never sure if I was a genius or in the wrong class in their fetish with graphs that my eyes, more often than not, couldn&#8217;t even process as a whole.</p>
<p>It did not go well.</p>
<p>There were parts of algebra, of course, that I loved. I enjoyed modeling numeric patterns (&#8220;series,&#8221; I was told, and &#8220;summations,&#8221; I just called it numbers) like 2n + 7, and there were moments when the graphs for these, or for my favorite exponents, lined up with the stacks of numbers I saw in my head, and the graph became, fleetingly, meaningful. (It was argued that graphs themselves were by definition simply visual models of numeric patterns, and therefore should have been my favorite thing. I defy anyone to look at something like THIS</p>
<p><img src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/crown_of_weeds/36853894/22795/22795_1000.jpg" alt="graph of 2n + 7"></p>
<p>and honestly tell me that they instinctively see either 2n + 7 or 9, 11, 13, 15, etc. in that.) Systems of equations were a game that made me laugh and resembled the way I&#8217;d play with numbers in my notebook margins when we were supposed to be caring about matrices. Matrices were for our calculators; I was a human calculator, insulted by their existence. </p>
<p>My first three algebra teachers understood none of this. I did well in algebra one, as long as I wasn&#8217;t asked to graph anything; as far as I was concerned, I was doing slightly fancier arithmetic and then humoring Mr. Morris by labeling things as he wished. Algebra 2 was all about graphing though, and it made me want to die&#8211;and now, in an exciting plot twist, the equations had gotten long enough, and the graphs complex enough, that my visual process started undermining me, scrambling letters and transposing numbers and fragmenting graphs, and with it, my grade. But I passed, by the skin of my teeth, and had a brief reprieve in geometry, and then got a better teacher for precalculus who, in the last two weeks of class, realized I had a language processing problem. We stayed after school one day and hacked enough accommodations that I could FINALLY start to use the conventional vocabulary and start training my eyes to read equations like stories again, the way 2+3=5 is, and then graph the story out accordingly. Just in time for the bonus unit on calculus.</p>
<p>I looked at a derivative for the first time, and my models and raindrops and joy came rushing back, and I was in heaven.</p>
<p>Derivatives and integrals made sense because the transformations they undergo are multi-dimensional, just as the ones I assign my models are. But I didn&#8217;t ace calculus. I took an introductory course at Stanford the summer before my senior year of high school and passed on sheer intuition despite missing 1/3 of the classes, but the first few tests I took in my AP class came back with failing grades.</p>
<p>My teacher and I worked it out. It was, as always, a visual processing issue: permitted to solve an equation on a white board, standing up, with more space than I could possibly use, colored markers, writing as large as I needed, and only one problem presented at a time, I could earn 100%. Give me the same test, <em>after I&#8217;d already taken it on the whiteboard,</em> but this time package it as a two-page test on an 8&#215;11 inches sheet of paper, and I&#8217;d get a 40%. </p>
<p>It seemed easy enough to accommodate: let me take my tests on a whiteboard, with my teacher dictating each problem to me one at a time, and I could be the best in the class. The beauty of reasonable accommodation! But it wasn&#8217;t that easy; the teachers were working to contract in protest of their current salary, so my teacher couldn&#8217;t stay after school or come in early to test me. If I&#8217;d had an IEP I would have been protected, but my parents were told that students with IEPs weren&#8217;t permitted to take AP classes. The solution, the administration declared, was that I would audit the class. I could sit in on every class, do every lab and homework, receive no credit, have my motivation and self-esteem destroyed by a year of failing every test but doing any in-class problem on the board perfectly, teach my class the fundamental theorem of calculus but be humiliated every day by my inability to correctly read and copy equations off a sheet of paper, and everybody won.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of the class. I was an anxious, humiliated, depressive mess, unable to concentrate, still haunted by graphs. It was a combined calculus/physics class: I loved the modeling, but my language processing made the word problems we were given for physics exhausting. There are bright memories, of course&#8211;drawing out the fundamental theorem, hacking labs, solving problems at the board, practicing integrals with Tommy for fun, tutoring a classmate over Facebook chat for a test that I failed with a record- breaking amount of transcription errors but she got an A+ on. But I hesitate to call myself mathematically inclined now, and that needlessly hellish year is why.</p>
<p>Math and music are some of the most sacred and meaningful things in the world to me. I don&#8217;t talk about them, because that requires a 12-year trauma history and interfacing with a language that treats these two things exactly opposite of how the should be.</p>
<p>(Do you know the secret, yet?)</p>
<p>This is what I learned, at the last music lesson I ever took: I see musical compositions as the graphs I spent years being tortured with perversions of, and I move through numbers like a song.</p>
<p>The spatial metaphors we traditionally use for music (notes are higher or lower; a second is a whole step, a third is two whole steps, etc.) fall apart for me not only because of their flagrant disregard for basic mathematics, but also because my primary concept of music lies in harmonics: in the spaces between tonic and supertonic, in the beats of the frequency of a given pitch, and all the different ways we can stretch and collapse and layer and color them. This is what I see, this is what I hear (and the two are, in this instance, the same,) every time music plays. Sheet music is as pale an imitation of this as a graph of y=3x is of the multiplication table. And yet, the transformations I drag my models through, the process of solving an equation (and I&#8217;ve never been much of one for solving, really; just give me a model and I&#8217;m happy, and maybe that was the problem with algebra all along,) is actually perfectly encapsulated by the language and metaphors musicians use to interpret sheet music.</p>
<p>And I just wish that once, at some point, just <em>once</em> during those long twelve years, someone said to me &#8220;this language isn&#8217;t working for you. Let&#8217;s find a new one.&#8221; Because then I could have told you, at eight years old, before I could even conjugate reliably or deviate from my scripts, that:</p>
<p>this is what C sounds like:</p>
<p><img src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/crown_of_weeds/36853894/23721/23721_1000.jpg" alt="sine curve"></p>
<p>this is what G sounds like:</p>
<p><img src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/crown_of_weeds/36853894/23214/23214_1000.jpg" alt="sine curve"></p>
<p>this is what a fifth sounds like:</p>
<p><img src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/crown_of_weeds/36853894/23445/23445_1000.jpg" alt="two overlapping sine curves"></p>
<p>and this, Mrs. Lowenthall,  is why 2+3=5:</p>

<p>I finally made it out to Breezy Point on Tuesday, which was 15 days after hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. Although I had seen many photos of the area where over 100 homes burned down from downed power lines and gas leaks, I was unable to grasp the massive devastation until I was standing amidst the ashes and charred metal, and breathing in the air that smelled strongly of burned materials. One can only describe the scene as post-apocalyptic, with blocks of homes now in shambles, and only a few chimneys still standing amongst the rubble:</p>

<p>As I was taking photos of the homes that burned down in Breezy Point, a lady approached me and we started chatting. She ended up telling me that if I walked just down the beach from that area, I would come across multiple homes that were also destroyed during the hurricane. She said that the media has been so focused on the homes that burned down, that many people don&#8217;t realize how much destruction there also was in the rest of Breezy Point. I decided to head down that way, and was amazed at what I saw.<br />
Other than the homes that had burned down, this was the most devastation I have seen yet. Many homes had completely collapsed. Others were pushed off of their foundations and shoved up against other homes. I have seen some of this in other areas, but not on as large of a scale as this:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://redemptionsbeauty.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rbaccident.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3844" title="rbaccident" alt="" src="http://redemptionsbeauty.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rbaccident.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Jolted awake by the vibration of my phone on the nightstand, I grab it off the charger, see that it’s Murielle calling. I assume she is letting me know she’s on her way home from the movie. Then I notice the time. Its 12:40 am, later than I thought. When I answer, <b>she screams through a garbled cacophony</b>, “Mommy, I am so sorry,” over and over and over again. That’s when I wake up from the dream I thought I was having, and join her nightmare.</p>
<p>I hold the phone away from my ear and look at it. I can’t understand her, like I’m walking through pudding in thick fog. Until the voice of a stranger pours cold water over all my senses and wakes me up.</p>
<p>She tells me she is a nurse, staying with my daughter until emergency crews arrive. That <b>Murielle was just hit by an 18-wheeler near the grocery store</b>, how she is lucky to be alive. I spring out of bed, throw off my pajamas, push legs and arms into clothes lying over the bathroom stool, will my mind to think through details, walk out of the house holding the phone and car keys, and leave my son behind to sleep.</p>
<p>Streets lay blanketed by stillness, dark and vacant. As I pull onto the highway, blue flashing lights in the distance bounce off pine skyscraper soldiers standing at attention. I gasp for breath. Dial H awake from slumber in a Denver hotel room.</p>
<p>As I approach, lights dance between an ambulance, fire truck and police cars blinding my vision. When I circle around to park, I see it, the mangled mess of metal that was once the shiny hood of her car. <b>Fragments of the engine strewn in a million tiny pieces over the road for yards.</b> And it’s hard to run fast through pudding.</p>
<p>She sits in the driver seat, black boots resting on pavement. An EMT crouches in front of her, strapping a brace around her neck and over her sweater printed swans. She tilts her watery eyes toward me, and says it again, “I’m so sorry Mommy.”</p>
<p>I clutch her shoulder, tell her not to be sorry because she is alive and that is all that matters. And when I ask them what happened, I watch a muted movie scrolling stilled frames of frenzy. <b>All I hear is “It’s a miracle she is alive.”</b></p>
<p>She narrowly escapes falling through the hole in the veil between heaven and earth and I find myself hanging on to the broad arm of a fireman, steadying my uncontrollable trembling. When I ask him what happened he says, “It doesn’t matter. One more inch and this would be a different scenario. You don’t want to go there, all you need to know is she is a miracle.”</p>
<p>As the ambulance pulls away, I crawl back inside the car, rest my forehead on the steering wheel, shaking like a washing machine off balance, wonder who I can call. <b>Who do you call at 1:30 in the morning when you are alone in the middle of trauma?</b> After I can&#8217;t reach a friend, I take a deep breath and call on God. Because with Him I can do all things. And H, he talks me through to peace on the hour drive to the hospital.</p>
<p>I find her alone in a sterile room, strapped to a board on a table, head haloed by orange plastic, and arms lying up at her sides with needles sticking out in the bends. When she sees me standing over her, she says it again teary, that she is sorry.</p>
<p>She is sorry that she woke me up. That she wrecked the car we sacrificed to buy when someone totaled the first one. Sorry about my having to be up all night, to deal with all of this alone. Sorry that she wasn’t more cautious, that she made a mistake, that her brother was alone, that she might have to miss school because people are counting on her.</p>
<p>I watch the daughter I bore sixteen years ago love her neighbor as herself. And I have seen the face of God’s compassion. <b>When I think I need to know why, find answers to life’s mysteries, I will remember that to have breath is a miracle. And that’s all that matters.</b></p>
<p>She walked to the car, crawled in her bed, and fell asleep. We don&#8217;t know who that nurse was but we do know God saved her life and for that, we are sobered thankful.</p>

<p><i>Thank you so very much for your prayers over the past few days. They have buoyed us and we are grateful for each one of you. I know this post is longer than my usual. I had to write it out for me this time. But my prayer is that it will be for you too. We’re on this pilgrimage together, yes?</i></p>
<p>Linking with <a href="http://aholyexperience.com">Ann</a> today in thanks for my daughter’s life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love social media. I enjoy Twitter and Pinterest. I read dozens of blogs. I ditched Facebook but certainly used it for several years.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t love is how corporations are weaseling their wares into my personal conversations. And I really don&#8217;t love how complicit some of my online friends are in this process.</p>
<p>Long ago, in a world where there were newspapers and magazines and three television channels, ads came for paid sources. Companies would buy space or time on conventional media to promise us that we&#8217;d be richer, thinner, taller, hairier, less hairy, smarter, and more popular if we bought their products.</p>
<p>People grew weary of these approaches. Companies tried new tactics. They put their cereals quietly on a shelf in Seinfeld&#8217;s fake kitchen. They had celebrities use their sun lotion on a lovely Malibu beach. </p>
<p>The goal and basic message was the same. &#8220;Pay us money and you&#8217;ll be happier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, with social media, companies are paying regular people to shill their products. But they&#8217;re paying much less than they ever paid newspapers and they&#8217;re changing the way we read what friends write.</p>
<p>The basic premise? &#8220;&#8216;Like&#8217; our Facebook page and get a coupon. Then all your friends see that you like us. You&#8217;re advertising to 100 or 200 or 800 people, and all we give you is $5 off a sandwich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same tune, different channel. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a great recipe using all our crappy products as ingredients. Pin it on your Pinterest boards and all your friends will do the same. In exchange, you get a delightfully transparent adverecipe. Free!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanting to get their brand trending on Twitter, which gets them a front page advertisement on every screen using the site, companies come up with ridiculous contests. &#8220;Tweet our name a lot and we&#8217;ll enter you in a drawing. The winner gets a few dollars. You give us free advertising and there might be a trinket in it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of seeing blogs and boards and feeds get covered in corporate slime, especially when I know the people (whom I used to trust) only got a few pennies, if anything, in exchange for interrupting my social media day.</p>
<p>Today was the last straw. I just got a form email from an author whose books I really respect. Paraphrasing, he said, &#8220;My new book is coming out. Think you&#8217;ll like it.&#8221; Fine. Makes sense. Advertise to the people who already like your work. That&#8217;s an ad I welcome. </p>
<p>But the email continued. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put together a marketing team of really smart people like you. If you&#8217;re selected for this highly respected team, you&#8217;ll conceive of and execute my marketing for me. And I&#8217;ll give you a free book!&#8221;</p>
<p>So I do all the work and you give me&#8230;a book. Son, people get paid tens of thousands of dollars to come up with marketing campaigns. I&#8217;m not doing one for you for a token of appreciation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4197" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://naptimewriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/imag2286.jpg"><img src="http://naptimewriting.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/imag2286.jpg?w=590" alt="" title="IMAG2286"   class="size-full wp-image-4197" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a long walk off a rotten pier.</p></div>
<p>Aside from being mad at being undervalued, though I am, I&#8217;m really angry at how these marketing schemes cost relationships. I see a blogger I really like and respect start shilling diapers. Or books. Or pumpkin pie filling. Doesn&#8217;t matter what the product is. I stop reading as often, I stop trusting what I read, and I stop visiting their blog.</p>
<p>One reader isn&#8217;t a big deal. One online relationship dead is not, either.</p>
<p>What matters is that the companies are playing us like fiddles. They get free advertising *and* a sneaky inroad into places marketing isn&#8217;t expected.  I follow people on Twitter because I want their voices. Not their ads for credit cards.</p>
<p>The companies think they&#8217;ll benefit from the trust I have in my social network. I&#8217;ve been reading Sue&#8217;s blog for five years, so when she sells out to Frozen Fish Sticks Company I&#8217;m supposed to be more likely to trust FFSCo as much as I trust Sue.</p>
<p>But I see through you, Frozen Fish Sticks marketing team. I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t trust Sue less because of her deal with Frozen Fish Sticks Company. I know Sue wants to be heard and wants to be paid. But I&#8217;m also pretty sure they&#8217;re not paying Sue what she is worth. I&#8217;m pretty sure all she got out of the chance to annoy me and make me think about visiting her blog less often is a box of frozen fish sticks.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re better than that, Sue.</p>
<p>I understand the draw. A lot of people want to feel needed. They want their writing seen by more people and they want to get paid.</p>
<p>Excellent goals.</p>
<p>But getting a nickel to do work that should be paid two hundred dollars isn&#8217;t a win for anyone except the corporation that just saved $199.95.</p>
<p>But who am I to tell people to stop writing two-cent ads on Twitter? I forward links to books and magazine articles. The authors and publishers don&#8217;t ask me to. They don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m going to do it. But if I blog that I liked a book, that&#8217;s advertising, too. Why draw a distinction between (nominally) paid ads and personal opinion that might drive sales?</p>
<p>Intention. </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m grumpy. Or feeling guilty. Soon I&#8217;m going to try the aggregating-commercial-site thing that all the kids are doing these days. I&#8217;m going to put some of my posts on other sites for free to see what happens.</p>
<p>But I wonder how much that process cheapens what I&#8217;ve stood for all these years. I know better than to let my work get away for less than I&#8217;m worth.</p>
<p>So why do it?</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know. I can say that the ads on the sites where most bloggers are aggregated are standard, expected, and usually ignored. It&#8217;s like performing on a street corner and being surrounded by billboards. This is simply our online landscape.</p>
<p>But I think it&#8217;s really because writers are, at heart, applause whores. We&#8217;ll sell our soul to be told we&#8217;re good. That&#8217;s why we sell ourselves short by selling products, ideas, and companies for far too little.</p>
<p>And in agreeing to have my posts on aggregating sites I&#8217;m probably doing exactly that for which I&#8217;m thinking of unfollowing other people: shilling crap that nobody needs in exchange for less than I&#8217;m worth.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Here&#8217;s some Lloyd Dobler to enjoy while you eat your fish sticks. Remember when we were this idealistic? Yeah. Me, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2601.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1487" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2601.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p>“Can we take a look at the old theater?”</p>
<p>My friend and I were in downtown Detroit and had ventured into the lobby of something called the Michigan building. Visitors to town, we were unsure what kind of cajoling would be needed to let us into the crumbling theater that we&#8217;d heard was hidden inside.</p>
<p>“$20,” said the guard.</p>
<p>“Really?” Too high.</p>
<p>“$10.”</p>
<p>More like it—</p>
<p>“$5”</p>
<p>Sold—</p>
<p>“Just messing with y’all. It’s free—take the elevator the third floor, go right, then through the exit sign.”</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>I’d read about this place on the Detroit blogs, blogs that sported cool urban-explorer names like “<a href="http://fadeddetroit.blogspot.com/">Faded Detroit</a>,” and “<a href="http://detroitfunk.com/">detroitfunk</a>.” These sites specialize in what’s become known as “ruin porn,” wistful photography that glorifies deterioration and degeneration. I’m a sucker for that sort of thing, <a href="http://theater-words.com/2011/04/08/going-dark/">especially when it comes to theaters</a>, so upon learning of this faded palace, I knew I had to make a visit.</p>
<p>The blogs had laid out the basics: Once a palatial, 4,000-seat house featuring the likes of the <b>Marx Brothers</b>, <b>John Philip Sousa</b> and <b>Bob Hope,</b> the Michigan had barely skirted demolition in the late ‘70s, but was converted into a garage when workers in the office building it&#8217;s in whined about inadequate parking. The result was a faint echo of the former glory, but some of the old magic, I heard, could still be found.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>As directed, my friend and I headed up, went right, made our way down some steps, through another door, and—</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh—!!!!!!!”</p>
<p>There she was! A brick and plaster cavern, a frozen Rococo tent, the most absurd and fantastical parking lot known to man. The walls rippled Mars brown and red, grey and cement, faded gold and seasick green.</p>
<p>Heaven, in other words.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1489" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>Navigating the 15-odd cars in hibernation, we found a spot in the center of the shell and pieced together what we could of the theater’s history. Three levels of parking had been installed at some point&#8212;we were on the top floor&#8212;so that explained our proximity to the glorious ceiling. Glancing up, we could see the gorgeously spoiled plasterwork almost intimately—a glyph here, a fleur-de-lis there.</p>
<p><a href="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2596.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1482" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2596.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>We turned around, taking in the back of the house. There stood the stub of what must’ve been the balcony. There were the old corridors leading patrons to their seats. And there was what used to be the rooftop of the lobby.</p>
<p><a href="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2597.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1483" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2597.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2602.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1488" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2602.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1481" style="border-style:initial;border-color:initial;cursor:default;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border-width:0;" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2595.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>The curve of the ceiling directed our eyes forward, to the proscenium. The concrete floors had cut off both of its legs, but the rounded top sat mostly undisturbed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1484" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2598.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p><a href="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2599.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1485" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2599.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Beyond it lay the gap of the stage itself, a vast maw untouched by the parking lot, if not by the elements.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1486" title="The Michigan Theatre in Detroit" alt="" src="http://theaterwords.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_2600.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>The water dripped and the sun shone through and flanks of rust and mold continued their slow crusade and I couldn’t imagine anything more beautiful. Why? Decay creates a mystical regret that makes us (or me, at least) feel curious and humbled and part of the Bigger Picture, no less guarded from the steady, wearying forces of time than the buildings around us. It’s like looking at the stars and feeling small and big at the same time, and knowing that The Answer, the simple answer, is <em>right there</em>, embedded in something physical just beyond your touch.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong></p>
<p>Detroiters, of course, are starved for this kind of transcendence. We all know how the city has turned into a brittle chrysalis, how the jobs and the factories and the prosperity have vanished, how the public trust has gone sour. How plywood fills the windows of downtown office buildings. How traffic lights, if they work at all, blink the same eternal pulse: red black red black redblackredblack. How homes lost to foreclosure sprout trees like so many nursery gardens.</p>
<p>This is the roiling landscape <strong>Lisa D’Amour</strong> chose for her Pulizer Prize finalist of a play, <b><i>Detroit</i></b>, seen earlier this fall at <b>Playwrights Horizons</b>.</p>
<p>Walking around the Michigan Theater it was impossible not to think of D’Amour’s play, a play that culminates in the destruction of a house. Taking in the Michigan&#8217;s slow demise, I wondered, are its remains so different from the charred beams and joists of D&#8217;Amour&#8217;s play?</p>
<p>Not really, if only for the delightful happenstance that theaters are often referred to as, well, houses. I love this: What word could be more appropriate for spaces that soothe and rattle, welcome and surprise, nurture and madden?</p>
<p>So there we stood, my friend and I, in a crumbling Detroit house, acting as its small, temporary family.</p>
<p>Of course, a family turns a house into something else entirely.</p>
<p>A home.</p>
<p>There might only have been two of us, but in that moment, we filled the Michigan. She was a full house. A full home.</p>
