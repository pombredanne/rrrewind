		<description><![CDATA[I woke up yesterday morning and told my husband that I was considering a move to Silicon Valley. He shook his head and said that this week's research for my blog had made me obsessed with excessive numbers completely detached from the real world. Since Klout changed their algorithm this week, my Klout score went up and now I've reached 50. (For you who read yesterday's post, you know rumour says that score 50 is the magical number for even being considered for a job-interview in the valley).<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=1066&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a memorable turnaround story in the making.</p>
<p>For years, Melky Cabrera bounced around the league, bringing nothing but his mediocre statistics with him.</p>
<p>Then his fortunes began to change last season. He batted .305 with 18 homers and 87 RBIs last season. All of a sudden, Melky Cabrera was “The Melk Man.”</p>
<p>His encore performance in 2012 was even better &#8211; an MVP-caliber season, second in the NL batting race, an All-Star game MVP, and offensive leader for a division leading ball club &#8211; until it hit a little snag: the truth.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Melky Cabrera tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, and was suspended for 50 games.</p>
<p>From his teammates to his supporters and to baseball fans everywhere – he deceived us all.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 251px"><a href="http://straightouttawestwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/melky1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image  " src="http://straightouttawestwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/melky1.jpg?w=241&h=165" alt="Image" width="241" height="165" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What should never have been&#8230;</p></div>
<p>It was all a lie. A lie caught up in more lies.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a Giants reporter caught whiff of a rumor that Cabrera tested positive for PEDs and asked him if it was true. Cabrera denied ever using them, and the reporter issued him an apology in his next column.</p>
<p>You have to ask – Why Melky, just why?</p>
<p>Why take the chance of your reputation being tarnished forever?</p>
<p>Why bring the steroid era out from under the rug?</p>
<p>Why disgrace the game of baseball like that?</p>
<p>The answer seems obvious – money. Cabrera was set to be a free agent this offseason, and putting up noteworthy numbers were sure to lead to a life-changing payday.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the way, it all came crashing down on Cabrera.</p>
<p>Behind him, he left a shameful, tainted mess. The All-Star game. Home-field advantage in the World Series. The Giants win total so far.</p>
<p>“My positive test was the result of my use of a substance I should have not have used. I accept my suspension under the Joint Drug Program and I will try to move on with my life. I am deeply sorry for my mistake and I apologize to my teammates, to the San Francisco Giants organization and to the fans for letting them down,&#8221; Cabrera said.</p>
<p>Okay Cabrera did own up to the truth so I’ll give him credit for that. But Cabrera&#8217;s not sorry for using PEDs. He&#8217;s only sorry he got caught.</p>
<p>The steroid era plagued the game for years, and in hindsight, for decades. It was supposed to be a handicap of the past.</p>
<p>In the past five to ten years, baseball has cleaned up the game pretty well. Still some players are still using PEDs, and a few of those are making monumental impacts on the game because of it.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://straightouttawestwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/david-ortiz_x2004.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image " src="http://straightouttawestwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/david-ortiz_x2004.jpg?w=190" alt="Image" width="190" height="190" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Maybe it&#8217;s just a dominican republican thing? Manny, then Ortiz, and now Melky.</p></div>
<p>Imagine if Melky didn’t use PEDs? The Giants offense, already on life-support with him, would sputter and leave the Dodgers with a considerable lead in the NL West.</p>
<p>Let’s go further back to 2008/2009. What if Manny Ramirez, scorching hot at the time, didn’t use them? The Dodgers probably don’t make it to the NLCS in 2008 and another team gets a chance to make the World Series.</p>
<p>Let’s raise the stakes. What if David Ortiz didn’t use them? Maybe the Red Sox don’t win the World Series in 2004 because they don’t even get past the ALCS, where the Red Sox needed numerous late game heroics from Ortiz to win the series.</p>
<p>It’s time to make the punishments for PED use more stringent so even less players will think about using them.</p>
<p>The current standard is a 50 game suspension for a first time offense. That’s not enough anymore. This is a big boy league, and now it’s time for big boy consequences. How about a season? Let’s add community service during that downtime too.</p>
<p>The current standard for a second offense is 100 games. Second chances are fine, but third chances aren’t. A second offense should be a lifetime ban from the game.</p>
<p>Baseball has done a superb job of ridding the game of PED use in the last five years, but now it needs to finish that job.</p>

<p>I love making things when i&#8217;m bored, and thankfully everyone loves watching clouds move quicly, and people darting around like mosquitoes on speed. So with all the nifty little gadgets like GoPro cameras and iPhones (with some special applications) you too can make awesome timelapse movies at home with ease. But why stop there – this cheap and easy DIY method of turning a kitchen egg timer into a reliable panning base to add some motion to your timelapse, and all for the price of a mocha-frappe-latte-chino or whatever you cool kids are drinking these days?</p>
<p>You can get the timer at any supermarket or kitchen store, then with some household tools and a bit of bodging you will be animating the skies for your facespace buddies to watch in no time.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" title="Egg-Time-lapse Build-Kit" src="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-kit.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="349" /></a><br />
<strong>What You Need:</strong><br />
1 – Craft Knife<br />
2 – Hacksaw<br />
3 – Strong Glue (Araldite is perfect)<br />
4 – Drill with ¼ inch bit (that’s 6mm in the Queens English)<br />
5 – Watchmakers Philips head screwdriver<br />
6 – ¼ inch bolt with flat wide top (This is 6mm too)<br />
7 – iPhone Tripod adapter (We got ours from <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/iphone-telephoto-lens/" target="_blank">Photojojo</a>)<br />
8 – Egg timer</p>
<p><a href="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229" title="Egg-Time-lapse Build-Main-1" src="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-1.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="349" /></a><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
First prise open the plastic casing of the timer using a flathead screwdriver or your craft knife, then pull off the dial handle from the top of the actual timer inside. Next remove the screws from the bottom of the metal bell casing to release the timer unit. You will probably want to take out the hammer from the bell section as it stops vibrations when your using the unit. This is normally a small metal part that slots onto a plastic arm. If you can’t find it, wind the timer on then when the bell tries to ring you will see it flipping about.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="Egg-Time-lapse Build-Main-2" src="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-2.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="712" /></a><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
With the drill, bore a hole in the dial handle for your bolt to go through ready to mount your camera to. Make sure to do this carefully; as if you make the hole too big the bolt won’t sit in the handle.<br />
Drill another hole in the bottom of the bell casing, smack-bang in the middle. This is so you can screw your timer to a tripod later when your filming some sweet clouds!</p>
<p><a href="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231" title="Egg-Time-lapse Build-Main-3" src="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-3.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="349" /></a><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
With your trusty Araldite on hand, or whatever fancy glue you have, fix the bolt into the hole in the dial handle, using the glue to make sure it stays in place forever. With most good glues you want to leave them for about 8-hours, or overnight to set as strong as possible.<br />
While the handle dries, cut off any protruding bits of plastic that might catch on the head of the bolt under the dial handle using the hacksaw or craft knife.</p>
<p><a href="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232" title="Egg-Time-lapse Build-Main-4" src="http://lookaroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/egg-time-lapse-build-main-4.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="349" /></a><br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong><br />
Now you are ready to piece it back together. Reattach the bell casing using the screws in the bottom, and when your dial handle and bolt are dried you can push it back onto the top of the timer. But make sure that sucker is stuck good before putting the handle back on.<br />
Give it a test-twist to make sure the bolt doesn’t catch on anything, then you are ready to attach the iPhone tripod mount and go lapse some time!</p>
<p><strong>Extra tips:</strong><br />
- There are a bunch of timelapse applications for your iPhone, but our favourite is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/itimelapse-pro-time-lapse/id335866860?mt=8" target="_blank">iTimelapse</a><br />
- Because the timer runs to regular time, for the smoothest videos you should shoot at 1 frame per second, and export your videos at 24fps in either 720p or 1080p for the best resolution.<br />
- Use your timer where there is loads happening in a wide location to make the most of the panning feature. Have fun kids!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">A cold, windswept astroturf. Rain falls not heavily, but persistently, soaking to the skin all who brave it. This is the setting for the quintessential experience of my school sports career. I take a deep breath, and bellow across the field:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate this game, sir! I really hate it! And it&#8217;s cold and wet and I&#8217;m miserable!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was in response to the quite reasonable request of my poor PE teacher that I actually engage in the game of football happening around me instead of wandering disdainfully up and down the pitch. Clearly by the time I was 15 I had not developed a deep-seated love of competitive sport. Had I grown up with the Olympic legacy, as envisioned by David Cameron, would this have been different? If anything, I think my attitude would have been even worse.</p>
<p>Cameron<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/11/david-cameron-compulsory-competitive-team-sports?newsfeed=true"> is going to make competitive sports compulsory</a> for all primary age school children. He is very clear that he means traditional sports like football and hockey, and not &#8220;things like Indian dance or whatever.&#8221; Boris Johnson has gone further, saying that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/09/boris-johnson-pm-school-sport?newsfeed=true">two hours of compulsory sport a day</a> would give the nation&#8217;s children some backbone. Sport is important not because it keeps you fit and healthy, but because it fosters the competitive spirit and stamps out an &#8220;&#8216;all must have prizes&#8217; culture&#8221;. The Tories love neoliberal values more than a hockey stick loves a clumsy child&#8217;s face &#8211; exercise is apparently only valuable when it teaches you how to climb to the top by trampling on the proverbial pile of bodies. Or a real one, depending how violent your game of basketball gets.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think sport is bad, and I don&#8217;t think competitiveness is bad, as anyone who has played Scrabble with me will testify. I think children should be introduced to a wide range of sports, and other non-competitive forms of physical exercise. That way, they are more likely to find something they like and will do outside school. Narrowing the PE curriculum this way &#8211; getting rid of Indian dance or whatever &#8211; will only make kids who aren&#8217;t good at sports hate doing exercise even more.</p>
<p>How many people dreaded PE lessons at school? If you are not good at sport, it can produce some of the most humiliating moments of your life. Kids are judgemental and cruel, we all know that. If you can&#8217;t kick a ball &#8211; or worse, if your inability to kick a ball snatches glory from the grasp of the sporty ones on your team &#8211; then you are ridiculed, and shouted at, and made to feel utterly inadequate.</p>
<p>This is not the way it has to be. Steve Redgrave <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9475959/Sir-Steve-Redgrave-Competitive-sport-is-all-very-well-but-helping-every-child-reach-their-potential-must-be-Britains-Olympic-legacy.html">has a different vision</a> for changing the culture of sports in schools. You don&#8217;t win five gold medals without valuing competition, but he doesn&#8217;t think Cameron is right to promote it above everything else. Not everyone can win, and if people are made to feel bad about not winning then they&#8217;ll feel bad about sport in general. As he puts it:</p>
<p>&#8220;It concerns me, too, that by over-stressing the competitive side, we might be scaring off people who struggle with coordinated skills&#8230; their abilities still need to be maximised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spot the difference between him and Cameron? Redgrave thinks sport is fun, and wants as many people as possible to think sport is fun and benefit from it. Cameron thinks that by making it all about the winning and not the taking part, more kids will want to take part in sport. Hm.</p>
<p>When we were allowed to choose what we did in PE lessons, I realised that the main reason I hated sport wasn&#8217;t because I was bad at it &#8211; it was because I was embarrassed by being bad at it. I chose options which were either entirely non-competitive, like going to the gym, or sports I could do just with my friends, like badminton. To my surprise, I was both having fun and doing exercise instead of sullenly standing around for an hour. Under Cameron&#8217;s plans, that would never have happened.</p>
<p>This government has already displayed an astonishing ability to get their priorities wrong. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/blog/2012/jan/16/welfare-reform-bill-cuts-to-disability-benefits">Taking money from disabled people</a> while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12828434">cutting corporation tax</a>. Denouncing the fact that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15875390">young people are at a disadvantage</a> while planning to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18567855">scrap housing benefit for under-25s</a>. And of course, banging on about sport while <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/keep-the-flame-alive/9475984/Keep-The-Flame-Alive-School-playing-fields-at-risk-as-ministers-relax-building-rules.html"> getting rid of the minimum requirement for outside space at schools</a>. With this misguided policy, which risks making some children even more sport-averse than they are already, the Tories have done it again.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Is Cameron wrong on sport or am I just bitter about not being able to throw and catch?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is in response to the </em>Weekly Writing Challenge<em> from WordPress. This week&#8217;s</em> Mind the Gap<em> post is about a trending topic in the media. This is my opinion of how much social media influenced how I watched the &#8220;Socialympics.&#8221;</em></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oscar_Pistorius-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="English: South African Paralympic runner Oscar..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Oscar_Pistorius-2.jpg/300px-Oscar_Pistorius-2.jpg" alt="English: South African Paralympic runner Oscar..." width="300" height="482" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">South African Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>I was on vacation for most of the Olympics. Still, I watched the Olympics and was swept up in the fever. I live in Canada so watched most of my Olympic coverage on CTV and followed Canadian athletes. (I was not frustrated by the NBC tape-delay or pre-empting of results before broadcast.) I also watched international athletes: world records being set and broken, a record number of medals being won by a single individual, the first amputee competing in the Games, and athletes of all nations &#8220;inspire a generation,&#8221; as the London Games slogan suggested. The names of Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Oscar Pistorius -to name only a few- were conversation topics more than once.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the dedication and training and stories of athletes leading up to their appearance at the Games. Knowing what an athlete had gone through to get to the Olympic stage created a more personal connection for me and I found myself more invested in that athlete than just watching an event of international participants. I didn&#8217;t blog about the Olympics directly, though I was motivated by the spirit of Olympic challenges. I <a href="http://irunibreathe.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/lift-your-sole-project-talaria/">wrote a post</a> about two local athletes (aka <a href="http://projecttalaria.com/">Project Talaria</a>) who are running the Leadville 100 to raise money for an <a href="http://www.liveitloveit.org/">organization</a> that helps provide outdoor adventure activities for disabled persons. The dedication of Project Talaria was more personal and more directly inspiring to me than the international competitions I was watching.</p>
<p>For two weeks, the world turned away from itself. I didn&#8217;t watch the &#8220;news&#8221; or any regular programming I might have otherwise; I watched events, races, presentations, stories about the Olympics and checked results. After having the TV on for six hours one day (I didn&#8217;t sit there the entire time, it was more like background music where I could turn into something that specifically interested me), I wondered what was so captivating to me about the Olympics. I wasn&#8217;t influenced by what I was reading or seeing on any social media sites; I was watching out of my own interest.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36239960@N04/7699804374" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Olympic Flag" src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7271/7699804374_1d8778b0f0_m.jpg" alt="Olympic Flag" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Olympic Flag (Photo credit: SouthEastern Star ★)</p></div>
<p>As a runner and sometimes swimmer, I was inspired to watch how an individual at the peak of their athletic ability can perform. The Olympics are a fishbowl of pressure, spectators, emotions and anticipation. You do not participate in the Olympics because you are a rookie in your sport, however the amount of international attention and pressure is likely not a common experience at other events.</p>
<p>I did not post on Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, Google+, or Tumblr about what I was watching on the Olympics. I only subscribe to Facebook, but it seemed irrelevant to post what I was watching on TV to my &#8216;friends.&#8217; I did talk about the Olympics to people in person, people who were also watching the Olympics with me. But I did not feel the need to relay what everyone else had either already seen (or tweeted, blogged, etc) again. It&#8217;s fair to say that almost anyone with an inclination towards the Olympics now knows that Usain Bolt is being considered a Living Legend for his back-to-back wins.</p>
<p>The Olympics are a biennial collective social focus: we are not all athletes, but we are all easy spectators. Team GB had their best showing of an Olympic Games, yet the population is still more content to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/08/10/f-vp-parry-olympics-wrap.html">sit and watch</a> than be motivated to move. Social media seems to have the same influence on how I viewed the Olympics. According to <a href="http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news/article/twitter-takes-centre-stage-london-2012.html">news reports</a>, we may have been sharing and tweeting a lot more than ever before (athletes and spectators alike). However, how I watched and what I watched were not affected.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32119772@N03/4392980588" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Anti-Social Etiquette" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4392980588_c2ffcb724a_m.jpg" alt="Anti-Social Etiquette" width="240" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I am not a #Twitter #user.   (Photo credit: Intersection Consulting)</p></div>
<p>Perhaps because I&#8217;m not on Twitter I was not as involved in the stories behind the results. I think Twitter can make these stories more personal, or political, or draw more attention to what may not have been an issue before. I watched what interested me, not what someone had suggested, or what was &#8216;trending.&#8217; Maybe my Olympic viewing was somewhat removed that way, simply seeing what was presented without the athletes&#8217; or audience input. Maybe I just wanted to keep my distance.</p>
<p>I chose to watch the events as a moment in time, and then stepped back to my own reality: the nightly news, my own running schedule, and occasionally watching summer re-runs on TV.</p>

<p>When people find out my liquor of choice is tequlia, they tend balk and proceed to ask one or more of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;WHAT?!!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;How does tequila not put you on the floor?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t tequila make you [insert debaucherous activity here]?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;LET&#8217;S DO SHOTS!&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>My responses to these exclamations usually go something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Tequila just doesn&#8217;t do that to me.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Thanks but no thanks.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>When I&#8217;m out with friends, they tend to order the standard G&amp;T (like <a title="Blog of 1,000 Awesomes" href="http://www.blogof1000awesomes.com/2012/08/876-awesomes-to-go.html" target="_blank">Molly</a>!) or vodka soda.  Well, there&#8217;s nothing about gin nor tonic I enjoy, and vodka and I didn&#8217;t get off a great start so I don&#8217;t even entertain the Grey Gooses and Absoluts and Ketel Ones of the world when ordering a cocktail &#8212; I go straight to the tequila. Perhaps I love tequila because it&#8217;s the first liquor I tasted in the classy, non-shot, non-jungle juice form of my mama&#8217;s margarita (rightmost photo above).</p>
<p>I prefer my margaritas with silver tequila, on the rocks, no salt (unless it&#8217;s chili rock salt on a hibiscus margarita), with extra lime juice and no sour mix ever, fresh lime slices, and maybe an orange slice if I&#8217;m feeling sassy.  Margaritas are great, but sometimes I&#8217;m in the mood for something different &#8212; something over crushed ice in a massive ball jar, something citrusy, something lime-y, not-too sweet, extra points for jalapeño-infused something, topped off with a little bubbly natural soda. Violá!  A refreshing summery cocktail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Spritzy &amp; Spicy Grapefruit-Lime-Tequila Gem</strong></span></p>
<p>1 gigantic Mason jar (in our house, we use Mason jars exclusively as drinking glasses and they&#8217;re the best thing ever)</p>
<p>crushed ice</p>
<p>4 oz. (2 shots) silver tequila</p>
<p>1 lime, halved</p>
<p>1/2 jalapeño, thinly sliced, deseeded and deveined (the more seeds and veins you leave, the fierier the cocktail)</p>
<p>1 can grapefruit (pompelmo) San Pellegrino OR 1 bottle grapefruit Izzie soda</p>
<p>Fill Mason jar with crushed ice, add tequila.  Squeeze half the lime over tequila and ice and add jalapeño slices.  Top off with grapefruit soda of your choice, shake or stir as desired, and garnish with the remaining lime.</p>
<p>Cin cin! (P.S. &#8212; it&#8217;s pronounced &#8216;chin chin&#8217; and you better damned well look people in the eye when you say that, or else. )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought the idea raised in the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/weekly-writing-challenge-mind-the-gap/">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> of London being called the social Olympics was quite interesting.</p>
<p>I think the description of 2012 as having been the social Olympics was pretty apt, not as is suggested in the prompt because of Twitter or social networking, but because it brought the nation out in a fit of the good old-fashioned kind of socialising.</p>
<p>Twitter may have registered more Tweets in one day during the London Olympics than during the duration of Beijing 2012, but that&#8217;s hardly a surprising statistic when you consider that in 2008 it had just 6 million accounts. During this Games a significant proportion of its 140 million registered users were collectively live tweeting the events.</p>
<p>And yet London 2012 never felt like a social media affair to even the same degree as an episode of <a class="zem_slink" title="Question Time (TV series)" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/default.stm" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Question Time</a>. It may be down to the sample of people who I&#8217;ve chosen to follow on Twitter, but there&#8217;s a definite sense of people settling down to debate, or just plain argue, during certain current affairs programmes. Tweets are crafted to interact with the content of the show and to form a part of the online conversation.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the same thing with the Games. For all the huge volume of Tweets that they generated the content was, perhaps necessarily limited to commentary, updates and either praise or commiseration for favoured athletes. An extension really, of the massive, seemingly national conversation that was taking place in real life. And most definitely secondary to the consumption of the traditional media, television and radio.</p>
<p>For me the Olympics demonstrated how wrong those who posited social media as the death of television, radio, print media and even local community were.</p>
<p>The Olympics were a very visual spectacle. From the magnificent opening ceremony, through seventeen days of fantastic sporting events, to the world&#8217;s biggest after-party which London put on last night, the only way to truly appreciate the Olympics was to park yourself in front of the nearest television screen and watch them.</p>
<p>Failing that you could listen to the commentary on the radio.</p>
<p>But the drama, the competition, the achievement, the disappointments, the gripping tight to the edge of your seats anticipation of the greatest sporting spectacle on earth could not be even semi-adequately conveyed through the medium of Twitter. Or Facebook, or any other website.</p>
<p>And this all comes from a woman who hadn&#8217;t used her TV to watch anything other than DVDs, Blu-rays or iTunes for well over a year before the Olympics came round.</p>
<p>Even newspapers did a better job of capturing the spirit of the Games with their daily medals tables and full pages spreads of action shots and beaming winners.</p>
<p>And it was this traditional media consumption that the real &#8216;social Olympics&#8217; centred around. For the last two and half weeks there has been a palpable vibe across the country. The Olympics seemed to have made us collectively happier. Reminded that it&#8217;s no bad thing to be British, and that we can actually be good at something when we put our mind to it.</p>
<p>Danny Boyle&#8217;s opening ceremony remade Proud Britains of people who hadn&#8217;t thought that we had anything to be proud of any more. Or who had somehow thought that national pride was no longer allowed for us.</p>
<p>In addition to that it put on a high that saw us all primed and ready- invested in the sporting drama that was to come, courtesy of Team GB.</p>
<p>And it got everybody talking.</p>
<p>And I mean everybody.</p>
<p>Something good was finally happening and we wanted to actually talk to each other about it.</p>
<p>People who I&#8217;ve never spoken to in three and a half years of working in the same office have over the last fortnight provided me with a full update on whatever events they&#8217;d just been watching every time I walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Strangers in queues have passed on news of new medal wins that their friends have just texted to them.</p>
<p>And I have completed a single financial transaction that hasn&#8217;t involved someone asking if I&#8217;d seen Jess Ennis, Mo Farah or Bradley Wiggins&#8217; wins.</p>
<p>It as generated loads of conversation amongst the people I actually know as well.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember talking about much else at a friend&#8217;s birthday party on Super Saturday.</p>
<p>And I think it has been a first. Or at the very least the first in a long time. The three previous Olympics barely registered with me. There was none of the big national conversation that&#8217;s made this Games so special.</p>
<p>Which is why I was pleased to see that the results of the WordPress <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/weekly-writing-challenge-mind-the-gap/">survey</a> are so far overwhelming supporting the view are that the Olympics was not a social media event. It would be a shame to reduce the magic to just another Twitter story.</p>

<p>In keeping with my summer of death theme, I left my building yesterday morning to find a cluster of neighbors talking.  A neighbor had died in his apartment, estimated three days earlier, and was found yesterday morning when others on his floor complained about the smell.</p>
<p>This was another fringe character, though not a friend.  If not for the &#8220;low&#8221; rent apartment, I&#8217;m guessing he would have been homeless.  This is purely conjecture, for all I know he had three million dollars in the bank. I don&#8217;t know his story, maybe he was a veteran, maybe he was sick, maybe he had been deserted by a cheating wife and ingrate children.  He was a hard and serious drinker, who could be spotted regularly parked in one of three neighborhood restaurants, drinking for hours until his cash ran out or the manager of the restaurant got enough complaints from other customers.</p>
<p>Naturally, as I walked Big Senile Dog and Little Incredibly Dumb Dog, I was thinking about all of this. Now I may not be happy here in New York, may not want to live here anymore, but I am a New Yorker.  Therefore, after tallying how many people I know who have died this summer, I had the traditional New York mourning thought.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21938343@N06/3291949108" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Apartment for Rent on E 61st St, NYC" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3644/3291949108_be1a24bbdd_m.jpg" alt="Apartment for Rent on E 61st St, NYC" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Apartment for Rent on E 61st St, NYC (Photo credit: cathleenritt)</p></div>
<p>Really, it isn&#8217;t just something made up for a Seinfeld episode.  Combing obituaries is a time honored way to find a rent controlled apartment. Much trickier than it used to be, as rent control laws have changed, but still valid.</p>
<p>I brought the dogs back and immediately stopped one of the workers in my building to ask him what size apartment the man had lived in. He laughed at me and told me I&#8217;m going to Hell with gasoline drawers on.  I had never heard that saying before, but it&#8217;s now my new favorite.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering, no.  This didn&#8217;t turn out to be an opportunity for me and mine.  His apartment is the same size as ours.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Apparently activity on Twitter reached some kind of peak during the recent Olympics, and WordPress has posed the question of whether our own appreciation of, or engagement with, the Games was impacted by this or other social media.
