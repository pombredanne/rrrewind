<p><em>A tongue-firmly-planted-in-cheek ode&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The love affair began with that dinosaur &#8211; <strong>A</strong><br />
An aging mail maid with suspect kin<br />
She danced before EJ’s novice eyes and signed her up without a sigh<br />
Soon that chime-y voice announced &#8220;you&#8217;ve got mail&#8221; a hundred times.<br />
EJ loved <strong>A</strong> back with vim and vigor, she was her first email provider, you know, go figure!<br />
Over time, EJ felt the itch, to spread her wings for some new trick<br />
She ventured off to meet other email folk; Opt on, Opt out, even MSNot now&#8230;<br />
But soon found them all wanting and not quite her style</p>
<p>One day, EJ met that (lovely) <a class="zem_slink" title="Hotmail" href="http://www.hotmail.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Hotmail</a> chick &#8211; A provider so hot it&#8217;s the <a class="zem_slink" title="United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">UK&#8217;s</a> biggest hit<br />
And she soon signed up for her daily fix<br />
Twas a slow day on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Internet</a> and <strong>A</strong> was acting like she needed a probe<br />
For a cheap date, Hotmail sure did deliver, easy mail across the globe<br />
They kissed and hugged and became hot new friends<br />
Connecting, uploading, loving and surfing<br />
But soon, they tanked from too much schmoozing<br />
Or was it the glitch from too much &#8230; downloading?</p>
<p>Fishing around for some tasty Wahoo<br />
EJ scored a date with a dude on Yahoo<br />
Soon she’d joined the throngs on <strong>Y</strong>et <strong>A</strong>nother <strong>H</strong>ierarchical <strong>O</strong>fficious <strong>O</strong>racle<br />
And hung in there after her dude high-tailed it for some new miracle<br />
When the going was good they’d listened to the sounds of <a class="zem_slink" title="The Who" href="http://www.thewho.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">The Who</a><br />
And sent lovey dovey e-mails up the wazoo<br />
She shoulda known that dude was just another yahoo<br />
He had a nasty temper and a lousy tattoo<br />
But soon she was back with that stinkin&#8217; dude<br />
Who made the lady act like a dog in a zoo</p>
<p>More below on this nonsensical, tongue-in-cheek email post inspired by the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/weekly-writing-challenge-mail-it-in">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> from WP <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif' alt=':lol:' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><code><span id="more-25502"></span></code></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m a longtime <a class="zem_slink" title="AOL" href="http://www.aol.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">AOL</a> subscriber and I love the whole thing. I&#8217;m an email junkie and I love the internet, though <a class="zem_slink" title="7th Heaven" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Heaven" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">7th Heaven</a> doesn&#8217;t give me much free time to surf these days.&#8221; <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen Collins" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Collins" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Stephen Collins</a></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_25512" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://eof737.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spammed-mail-folder.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-25512" title="Spammed-mail-folder" src="http://eof737.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spammed-mail-folder.png" alt="" width="500" height="276" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Musings: Ode to an Email Junkie&#8230; I can&#8217;t stand Spam email</p></div>
<p>Not one to be discouraged, EJ tuned out the fool<br />
She’d found a new love on good ol’ Google<br />
He courted her first with tunes on Youtube<br />
Then uploaded vlogs to woo and impress her<br />
She was quite touched that he vlogged on <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">WordPress</a><br />
For she thought he’d write her a Blogger post first<br />
EJ hooked up a <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" href="http://google.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Gmail</a> account and found all the features quite overwhelming<br />
She wasn’t sure she wanted a Gmail profile&#8230;<br />
Let alone make friends with strangers with + signs</p>
<p>One day EJ turned to a friend at the mall and said<br />
“I miss the days when we only made phone calls!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I can’t stand the Viagra hawkers, the scammers with dead rich relatives.<br />
I can’t stand the thieves, the lying penile extenders.<br />
I can&#8217;t stand the work-at-home liars and the virus spreaders!”<br />
“Don’t despair,” said the friend, to her dejected buddy,<br />
“One day they’ll invent a chip to plant in your head<br />
And zap out the s**t that comes through email. Be grateful your Gmail captures the scum.”</p>
<p>EJ considered her <a class="zem_slink" title="Friendship" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">good friend</a>’s sage advice<br />
As up popped an instant message from her Gmail lover&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Hey babe, tonight is the night&#8230; so please be nice!&#8221;<br />
EJ sent a wink to her lover <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  and then to her good friend she replied,<br />
“I guess it’s not bad to keep this account, and my Y, H and A email accounts.<br />
<strong>You</strong> never know who might try to reach you… I’d rather talk now than wait for a chip …&#8221;</p>
<p>So EJ has kept all her email accounts<br />
And checks them quite often to chat and to frown<br />
Maybe one day she’ll choose only one, delete the others, and toss the junkie crown&#8230;<br />
Forever. We hope. And I&#8217;m tempted to say &#8211; whatever. Oy vey! <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Have an awesome weekend! <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Thank you for stopping by! What are your thoughts? What approach did you use for the challenge? Was it easy/hard to email your post? Did you attach photos for the prompt? Do share? Thank you!</p>
<p>*Please bear with me as I continue to catch up on your blogs and commenting… Thank you all for your patience! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This post was inspired by a prompt from WP Daily Post: <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/weekly-writing-challenge-mail-it-in">Weekly Writing Challenge: Mail It In</a> For this week’s challenge, use the Post by Email tool to create a new post touching on email, communication, and online correspondence. Go beyond how email may have changed how you communicate and dive into a specific example of a funny interaction, specific trends, or a detailed, comedic account of your email obsession.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Motivation Tip:</strong> Email is a helpful tool for quick communication&#8230; but nothing beats reaching out and making physical contact with friends and family&#8230; Reach out and touch someone!  Didn&#8217;t AT&amp;T say that? <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif' alt=':lol:' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-by-email/">Post to Email </a>challenge issued by WordPress, I now have only one unread message in my e-mail folder. How wonderful is that!</p>
<p><a href="http://wrightonthebutton.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greenshot_mailbox.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1046" title="greenshot mailbox" src="http://wrightonthebutton.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greenshot_mailbox.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>I cleared out the box while thinking about what I wanted to say today.</p>
<p>So, having already given myself a pat on the back, I decided to make a list of other observations.<br />
Each one of them will be given a mark, by way of weighting. Total marks awarded to myself: 100.<br />
I think it is a nice round number, percentage-wise.</p>
<ol>
<li>I still have far more e-mail friends and contacts than I do Facebook friends. <strong>23</strong></li>
<li>I have 50 folders with subfolders for clients, friends, memberships and so on. I could make some improvements. <strong>-3</strong></li>
<li>I have sorted the Sent Items into their respective folders too. It is easy to follow correspondence this way. <strong>20</strong></li>
<li>I last wrote a letter (via e-mail) to my parents in Australia 8 days ago. That is longer than one week. <strong>-10</strong></li>
<li>I have flagged one minor task to attend to (revision of the second verse of a translation of a poem I did for fun, following the kind parsing in the source language by a friend). My integrity is at stake (&#8220;Don&#8217;t start something you have no intention of finishing&#8221;). This attracts a modified negative grading, since only two people care. <strong>-8</strong></li>
<li>All administrative tasks associated with my freelance business are up-to-date. <strong>25</strong></li>
<li>I have replied to all e-mails received (except of course, junk mail). <strong>18</strong></li>
<li>I have removed flags from items I have dealt with. <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have deleted outright things I know I will not read, even though they may be of some benefit, knowledge-wise. Too much information is too much information. <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have one e-mail I ought to write (as the initiator of private correspondence). Slap on the wrist for procrastination weighed against its relative importance: <strong>-5</strong></li>
<li>I have not been able to figure out how to mute the volume on annoying adverts with sounds (or get rid of the adverts altogether) on the Internet, while still turning up the volume on my laptop so that I can hear when new mail arrives. This is annoying. I use a number of online dictionaries and other resources. I have trained my eyes not to look at the adverts, but cannot stand the Grim Reaper laughing at me with a written message in Portuguese asking me, &#8220;Do you know when you are going to die?&#8221;. Even thinking about that tiny question would provoke a huge rant from me. I shall be kind to myself in this case. Firstly, I am suffering and secondly, I do not know if it is possible to achieve the desired removal of adverts. Total penalty: <strong>-2</strong></li>
<li>With my volume on zero, I lost out on a job from a translation agency today because I did not check my inbox for over 30 minutes. I give myself 12 points for working for 30 minutes without being distracted at all, and have deducted 5 for losing out on potential income. Net result: <strong>7</strong></li>
<li>While clearing out my mail box, and sorting into folders, I discovered three e-mails which I had received and replied to, but had no recollection of the names of the people who had sent them to me. <strong>-5</strong></li>
<li>At this rate, I shall never get to 100 points. Points for stamina, then: <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have had the same e-mail name since I got my first e-mail account in 2000. Note: I did not really need an e-mail at home until then. Besides which, you needed a telephone line to have an e-mail account, and I did not have one of those at home either. Times have changed, service providers have changed, but the name before the @ is the same. Points to stability, I would say: <strong>15</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It will be interesting to see how WordPress copes with the numbered list, and the font colours for the points (blue for positive; red for negative).</p>
<p>One curious little note on a slang term (which I seldom used myself, not being very slangy by nature): In Zimbabwe years ago, if someone was really entertained with what you had just said, or pleased with the news you had just given them, they would say, &#8220;Ah, 10 points!&#8221;. This awarding of points may have come from the fact that the only really interesting thing on television in the 1970s or so was the &#8220;inter-schools quiz&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know; I am guessing.</p>
<p>A related expression was &#8220;100%&#8221;, which signified agreement, and again, pleasure at the receipt of good news. This came into fairly widespread use around 2000. The expression soon changed to &#8220;Ah, hundred&#8221;, or &#8220;Ah, hundreds&#8221;, or simply, &#8220;Hundreds&#8221;. One other theory I have on the shift from &#8220;10 points&#8221; to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; is that it was a reflection of the all-pervasive hyperinflation, and perhaps people thought that 10 was no longer a significantly grand number.</p>
<p>In any case, I have scored 100 points. Hundreds.</p>
<p>Allison</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong><a title="Interesting Times" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">May you live in interesting times</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As I sat in my 6th grade classroom, making every appearance of listening to the Social Studies lesson of the day, my peripheral vision caught a folded piece of notebook paper making a dangerous journey forward from the rear right corner of the room. As the teacher looked down at her book, or turned to use the blackboard, a student might tap the person ahead and hand the paper up, or slide it carefully onto the desk at the left. At last the paper reached its intended recipient, whose name was block printed on one of the exposed sides. Her task was to open it, near the front of the classroom, without attracting the notice of the teacher. The message had to reach her during class, or she would pass into the halls and on to her next class without the urgent information in the note.</p>
<p>By ninth grade, I regularly carried messages (usually just verbal) from a friend in my gym class, to her boyfriend in my English class. When we went on high school or scouting field trips, we were given regular hourly intervals at which each meandering group would &#8220;meet back&#8221; with the rest at a common point to allow the group leaders to count heads. If we went out from home and were late returning, our parents worried and called around to our friends&#8217; homes to find out where we were last spotted. (We were always scolded for not calling in on these occasions, as well.)</p>
<p>Now, all of these things are handled using cell phones which can text, tweet, or email, in addition to just outright calling another person, to make sure no important communication is missed. We indeed live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Now, in fact, electronic communication is so pervasive that we are seeking ways to limit it. Folks barely look up from their handheld devices as they cross a street, email boxes are full of &#8220;spam&#8221;/electronic junk mail, and we are rudely interrupted by phones ringing (and subsequent personal conversations) in restaurants, elevators, and other public places. Phones light up at the movies, distracting other theater goers, as an impatient recipient reads a text message that just can&#8217;t wait. Television commercials warn against the serious dangers of texting while driving.</p>
<p>Today, I read that Apple has received a patent to <a title="ipod limits" href="http://myscienceacademy.org/2012/09/17/apple-granted-patent-to-disable-iphone-recordings-near-government-buildings-or-political-events/">restrict iPhone recordings near government buildings and political events</a>. There is an outcry over this limitation of a freedom that, fifty years ago, was pure science fiction. So many benefits, so many issues.</p>
<p>When I first had email, I rushed home to check my &#8220;mailbox&#8221; every night. Ten years later, I was so battered by the constant barrage of emails at work, and demands for immediate responses, that some nights I didn&#8217;t even turn my personal computer on. Now I have a phone with texting and IM-ing, a laptop with email (three addresses for different purposes, neatly sorted by Outlook), Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn on both these devices and my Kindle Fire, and the ability to create and email a blog post from anywhere any time.</p>
<p>These are all wonderful conveniences, but sometimes I just need to unplug. For the last five or six days I&#8217;ve been travelling. I popped into my email and Facebook twice to &#8220;keep up,&#8221; and if a family member had needed to reach me, I had a cell phone. I didn&#8217;t feel the immediate need to use another device or program. Of course, during that time I neglected my blog, but it was sort of restful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t Tweet, Facebook, or text my every move (I don&#8217;t care for it when other people do this, so I won&#8217;t burden them either.) I don&#8217;t post my opinions on Facebook (after all this is meant as <em>social media -</em>and weren&#8217;t we taught not to discuss religion or politics socially?) I have my blog for my random thoughts and opinions (which I post to a separate Facebook page for those who care.) I truly appreciate my friends and followers, and will try to get caught up this week &#8211; but I unapologetically enjoyed my e-vacation.</p>
<p>So, in the event that I&#8217;m somewhere away from home, perhaps on a prolonged trip, and I have an urgent need to communicate something on my blog, it will be wonderful that I have that ability from all of my electronic devices through email. I&#8217;m giving that a try for the first time with this post, including using some “shortcodes” – for example to tag it. However, just because I <em>can</em> do something with one of these marvelous devices doesn&#8217;t mean that I necessarily should, or will.</p>
<p>Time will tell how useful some of these new tech advances will be for me, but who knows? These are, after all, very interesting times.</p>

<p>No one will ask if we can listen to someone other than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgEhj4edj4Y&amp;feature=related">Björk</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1vtr9fXdg8">Natasha Khan</a>. And no one will tell you that stopping the car six times in twenty minutes to take pictures of sheep is exorbitant.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1919" title="Iceland sheep" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland12.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>
<p>And if you want Icelandic lobster soup for dinner three nights in a row, then by golly, you will have Icelandic lobster soup for dinner three nights in a row (and it will be perfect each time).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1916" title="Sea Baron lobster soup Iceland" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland9.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>
<p>Travelers and locals alike will open up easily to you; a solitary woman traveler always rouses questions and good manners. A group of <a href="http://endemi.is/">Icelandic artists</a> will invite you to lunch. The head priest of Iceland&#8217;s ancient <a href="http://asatru.is/">earth religion</a> will drive you to the site of their future temple. A car full of travelers (none of whom are from the same country) will take you out for a beer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1913" title="Reykjavik street art Iceland" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland6.jpg?w=600&h=398" alt="" width="600" height="398" /></p>

<p>You will find it hard, harder than you imagined, to completely unplug from the internet. You will connect to wifi where you can, checking email and sharing photos on <a href="http://instagrid.me/thekitchenwitch/">Instagram</a>. It&#8217;s habit, not loneliness, that prevents you from letting go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1935" title="Reykjavik Iceland house" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland21.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>

<p>But once you&#8217;re on the road with only mountains on the horizon, you will disconnect from the outside world for three whole days. You would never have believed a day could be so long and could hold so much.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1925" title="Geysir Iceland" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland18.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="904" /></p>
<p>You will park your car by the ocean, protected by cliffs and sea birds, and sleep in the back seat of your car in the light of the almost-full blue moon. You will feel completely safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1947" title="Dyrholaey Iceland" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland26.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>

<p>You think you might die when you&#8217;re driving through the arctic desert and the wind toys with your tiny car like a cat plays with a mouse, bobbing side to side, palms sweaty against the wheel. You will not die.</p>
<p>Instead, you will see this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1910" title="Jokulsarlon Iceland" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland3.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>

<p>And on your last day, you will drastically change your itinerary because of a recommendation from a stranger, and you will see 10 rainbows within two hours on this unplanned venture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1937" title="Iceland country rainbow" src="http://witchinkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/iceland23.jpg?w=600&h=397" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something strange that&#8217;s been happening in the world of tech as hotly anticipated products (primarily of the Apple variety) near launch: the world finds out about them long before they&#8217;re unveiled.</p>
<p>I think the entire phenomenon is so strange. When kids are young and looking forward to a hot new toy, they sometimes try to approximate its presence in their lives by creating an <em>ersatz</em> model to take the place of the real thing until they can actually touch, hold, and use the real thing. Strangely, this is happening with increasing frequency to the iPhone. The tech world is so hungry for <em>anything</em> iPhone that they will contract graphic designers to create 3D models of the new gadgets, and even go so far as to build full physical models.</p>
<p>The noise is deafening.</p>
<p>Post after post featuring blurry component photos hits the interwebs, and the tech press gobbles them up like bacon-stuffed donuts. Most folks don&#8217;t follow tech blogs, don&#8217;t really have a pressing desire to know the internal layout of new gadgets, feel no need to really seek this stuff out. They read what falls in their lap and, usually, are better and more sane because of it.</p>
<p>Then the device hits, and it elicits &#8220;yawns&#8221; from the peanut gallery because they&#8217;ve already seen it all. They make sweeping (often literally global) statements about the reception of the product, about the excitement it&#8217;s generated, etc. Their actions are, again, childish, just like the kid whose favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs really early and starts claiming that no one likes [<em>insert sport here</em>] anymore, anyway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they&#8217;re embarrassed.</p>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t be? Their phones are either knock-offs or faked. The real deal is just that, and consumers know the difference. Companies will try to <a title="Not on the list: &quot;Runs the Best Mobile OS on the Market (iOS)&quot; (nope), &quot;Works with the App Store&quot; (nada), or &quot;Hasn't Shixpped Yet&quot; (check!)" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212328/lenovo-thinkpad-tablet-2-features-specifications" target="_blank">illustrate</a> how their products &#8220;stack up&#8221; against Apple&#8217;s iPad, or iPhone, or whatever, but it ultimately just makes them look, again, juvenile. I can make a checklist that makes me look like the best human being ever compared to random people on the street. I could create a checklist of the features of a raw, uncooked potato, and compare it to all the features of a slice of deep-dish Chicago pizza, but comparing those two things would make no sense. &#8220;Grows in the ground&#8221;, &#8220;Has eyes&#8221;, &#8220;Will sprout if placed in water&#8221; are all &#8220;features&#8221; of the potato that the pizza doesn&#8217;t have, but who really cares? I&#8217;ll take the pizza thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>Which leads me back to my point. The leaked specs, the feature parity, the checklists, etc. are all meaningless in the face of true user experience and the whole package.</p>
<p>A guy I know had his iPhone run over by a car. It was absolutely destroyed, which was sad for him. He was contemplating purchasing a replacement, but decided to wait it out until his contract was up for renewal so he could purchase a new iPhone 4S. In the meantime, someone gave him a Motorola Droid RAZR (or whatever it&#8217;s called&#8230;these things have the weirdest names). He ditched the Droid in favor of an iPhone 3G. You read that right. He disliked the Droid user experience so much that he went with a molasses-slow (comparatively) phone, simply because the overall user experience was so superior. When you&#8217;re on the losing team, shouting really loudly and making a lot of noise is still fun, sure, but it doesn&#8217;t win you ball games. Just ask Cubs fans.</p>
<p>At any rate, it&#8217;s clear that people are jazzed about the iPhone 5, and all these &#8220;yawn&#8221; reactions are just the tech news equivalent of Cubs fans getting uppity. People will choose good design and a fluid, beautiful user experience over checklists and noise.</p>
<p>As they say, it doesn&#8217;t take a genius.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[An interview with Paul Grist about his career and most famous creations.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=2794&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2798" title="Let's put our bacon on the table. Paul Grist art from Kane." src="http://pentimento.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nelson.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="381" /></p>
<p><em>(This interview with Paul Grist was originally destined for another venue and presented here as-is, house style and chronology intact. <a href="http://timhayes.eu/2012/09/19/paul-grist-review/" target="_blank">See also this companion post</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The first port of call for a lesson in why readers respond to simplified art and non-realistic drawings in comic strips is still Understanding Comics, in which Scott McCloud digs into the matter and ends up on his knees worshipping the power of cartoons.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can read Paul Grist comics.</p>
<p>Since 1986 Grist has produced a steady, if sometimes erratically scheduled, sequence of inventive and deceptively low-key British comics, developing his combination of expressive cartoon figure work, energetic layouts and dense plotting into a striking personal style.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wear my &#8216;I am a cartoonist&#8217; badge with pride,&#8221; Grist says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never really understood why cartoony is used as a derogatory term by some comic readers. Are there people out there who think that the only thing that stopped Bill Watterson being successful was that he didn&#8217;t draw a realistic tiger? I just try to generate a readability, an immediacy, something that can be recognized and identified with.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a childhood following artists such as Mike Noble, Frank Bellamy and Gerry Haylock, Grist broke into comics via the UK&#8217;s small-press scene. His first effort, Short Stories, came to the attention of DC Thomson&#8217;s girls&#8217; comics group, and the publisher offered him work within a week – a contrast to his failure to catch the eye of Marvel and 2000AD, which were proving to be tougher nuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the lesson is that it&#8217;s a lot easier to get into those comics that not many other people are aiming for. DC Thompson were great and kept me busy for a couple of years, working primarily on Nikki. I did short humour strips, quiz illustrations, and drew the cover strip for a year or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>A higher profile arrived in 1989 when Grist illustrated Grant Morrison&#8217;s St. Swithin&#8217;s Day, originally for Trident and later reprinted by Oni Press. Morrison&#8217;s deliberately provocative mix of youthful unrest and anti-Thatcherite bile grabbed some headlines, but at least as much impact comes from the ink-heavy art and its unnerving high contrast. Grist&#8217;s cartooning does exactly what McCloud describes, turning the troubled protagonist into an ambiguous, queasy mirror.</p>
<p><strong>LIVING IN EDEN</strong><br />
Kane, the self-published story of New Eden&#8217;s 39th Precinct and its officers, is where everything clicked. A long-form police procedural, with constant flashbacks to trip up the unwary and sub-plots that looked all set to tumble on forever, the shadowy past of Detective Kane was a sprawling canvas for Grist&#8217;s imagination to work with.</p>
<p>When it appeared in 1993, the comparisons were with David Lapham&#8217;s Stray Bullets and Frank Miller&#8217;s Sin City &#8211; Grist affectionately ribbed Miller&#8217;s stories several times as he went along &#8211; but Kane was a chillier, more humane, and more effective strip. And for readers who found that New Eden&#8217;s moustachioed SWAT team leader and his taste for excessive violence rang a bell, the strongest influence was clearly from another medium altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hill Street Blues is very much the template for Kane: multiple storylines with a wide-ranging cast, and a mix of drama and comedy,&#8221; agrees Grist. &#8220;I loved doing Kane. I think in general if you&#8217;re not working on your favourite comic then you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong, and it certainly helped get me noticed within the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grist&#8217;s storytelling efforts in Kane were certainly noticeable, since he worked the page hard. One issue is told from a fixed vantage point on the rear seat of a patrol car; another makes do without speech or captions. A gangster speaks in a style on loan from Marlon Brando&#8217;s Don Corleone, via phonetic speech balloons to be unpicked at leisure; Kane himself often says hardly anything. Officer Kate Felix, ever the voice of reason, gets one of the great stand-alone issues of any comic, a childhood incident and present-day crisis running in parallel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just try to make the page visually interesting,&#8221; comments Grist. &#8220;Comics are a visual medium, so when people just put one square panel after another, I think they&#8217;re really not using the medium to its full potential. To me that seems like dancing but not moving your feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kane was the definition of a cult hit, with vocal champions but not a huge readership. The book&#8217;s narrative became extended by publication delays and threatened to grind to a halt, and some felt that the flashback structure was too hard to follow. &#8220;Kane was very popular with the people who liked it, but sadly there weren&#8217;t that many of them,&#8221; says Grist looking back. &#8220;Ultimately it just wasn&#8217;t selling enough for me to be able to continue.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>THE PAST IS NEVER DEAD</strong><br />
As Kane showed signs of fatigue, Grist responded with Jack Staff, originally aiming to attract readers and then draw them over to Kane. Hence a change of tack: from an American cop to a British superhero. But the tone was recognisably from the same pen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tend to see my comics as being a mix of the sombre and the humorous,&#8221; explains Grist. &#8220;Serious funny books. Or funny serious books. Jack Staff is all about cause and effect, rather than nostalgia, but it&#8217;s also about ageing and death. Jack Staff is someone who is alive forever; Becky Burdock, vampire girl reporter, is dead forever. And together they&#8217;re facing the End of Everything. But that doesn&#8217;t have to be a bad thing. You can still have a bit of fun along the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Kane was Americana, then Jack Staff is British to the core, loosely formatted in the style of past British action weeklies and seasoned with business from the UK&#8217;s collective memory. A flashback to 1940 allows for a walk-on by the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, while the ambiguously spectral Helen Morgan addresses the reader from limbo and views the world through the Play School windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just throw in things that amuse me, really,&#8221; comments her creator. &#8220;None of the in-jokes or references to old British comic characters are important in terms of the story, it&#8217;s just an extra layer for British readers of a certain age. I hope the story holds up in and of itself, and the fact that readers elsewhere can get it gives me some confidence that it does.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Americans at Image Comics got it, and picked up the book as a continuing series, leading not only to greater visibility for the strip, but also to a transition into colour.</p>
<p>As it turns out, colour transforms the effect of Grist&#8217;s art. The black-and-white Jack Staff is a contemplative, moody strip, sometimes given to introspection. The Image version is a full-colour Hellzapoppin&#8217;, in which anything goes, the layouts fizz, and the next figure around the corner may be demon, ghoul or giant talking goldfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric Stephenson contacted me out of the blue and asked if I had ever thought about publishing Jack Staff at Image, to which the only honest answer was no. It  was only when they said that they wanted to publish it as a full-colour comic that it made sense to do it, since that gave me an opportunity to do something that I couldn&#8217;t do with my own resources. Image also allows me to have everything in print at the same time, which as a self-publisher was something that was proving a bit of a juggling act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grist had always wanted to include colour in Jack Staff: &#8220;After all, it&#8217;s a superhero comic, and superhero comics are always in colour. I like to think of the original series as being a colour comic with a lot of black-and-white pages. But I do still find myself in the mindset of drawing black-and-white pages which are then coloured in. I don&#8217;t think a black-and-white page is simply a colour page without colour. That&#8217;s a common mistake in comics, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A PAPER MEDIUM</strong><br />
&#8220;In 1993 when I started doing Kane there were two big distributors plus several smaller ones, and there were less people actively making comics, so it was a bit easier to get noticed,&#8221; says Grist. &#8220;Now there is a single distributor which has tightened up a lot on what it will distribute, and which expects bar codes and all sorts of other professional malarkey that wasn&#8217;t asked for in my day. I&#8217;m not saying it is a bad thing that Diamond expects to approve the comics that they solicit for, but it makes it just a bit more difficult to get a new comic out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the rise of the internet means it has become easier to get work seen by potential readers &#8211; whether or not the work is any good, or profitable. But fittingly for an artist with a taste for wrangling the fixed dimensions of a paper page, Grist feels no great urge to decamp onto the internet or create a web comic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as I&#8217;m concerned, comics are a paper medium,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This may well be an age thing. I don&#8217;t find reading comics on screen to be that interesting, so web comics are not something that I&#8217;m really planning on exploring in the near future. I did serialise a comic I published, The Eternal Conflicts of the Cosmic Warrior, in a blog, but that was more a case of putting a paper comic on-screen than actually doing a comic for the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;After years as an active self-publisher, I&#8217;ve now been published by Image for longer than I spent putting out my own books, so I’m really out of the loop as far as self-publishing goes nowadays. But one of the encouraging things about going to comic shows around the UK is that there are new, young people putting out their own comics. Twenty years ago you&#8217;d go to the London Convention and the small-press section would be in a corridor leading through to the main hall. Now they&#8217;ve become a main event in their own right. There&#8217;s a lot of creativity out there, which is very encouraging to see.&#8221;</p>
