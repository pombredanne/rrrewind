			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where to begin…</p>
<p>In the past three weeks I have learned one thing about sustainability in Europe: It is deeply ingrained in the culture, almost to the point where they do not know of any other way. It is a place where a move toward sustainability is not in order. They have already arrived.</p>
<p>In the States, we find ourselves wanting to move towards more sustainable practices. Many have ditched their gas-guzzlers for hybrids or have moved back to the city to reduce the morning commute. Some might bring their own bags to the grocery or change their light bulbs to fluorescent. Whatever the case may be, it is certain that sustainability is gaining popularity in the U.S. One day, I hope it rises to the level of European standards because here, things are much, much different.</p>
<p><a href="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0517.jpg"><img title="IMG_0517" src="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0517.jpg?w=280&#038;h=300&#038;h=374" alt="" width="280" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>Transportation is a big issue surrounding the ideas of sustainability and energy use. In Scotland and throughout Europe, getting around without a car is easy . In Amsterdam, more than a third of the city travels by bicycle. Imagine your morning commute across the city on the seat of a bike, riding next to the canals, sun and wind at your face. Romantic. Amsterdam may be an exception, as it is a very flat place. However, I have seen a hell of a lot more bikers here than in the States.</p>
<p><a href="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0219.jpg"><img title="IMG_0219" src="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0219.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Another way of getting around with ease is public transportation. The bus system here in Edinburgh is unbelievable. You can get to any corner of the city by bus and having a bus pass is the best tool in terms of accessing all of what Edinburgh has to offer. The buses are prompt and the routes are logical. It can be said that Edinburgh would not operate efficiently without its fantastic public transportation (bus) system.</p>
<p><a href="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0434.jpg"><img title="IMG_0434" src="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0434.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to leave the city, you can always hop a train. The train system here is also fantastic. There are a number of rail systems (<a href="http://www.scotlandrailways.com/maps/ScotRailMap_en.gif">ScotRail</a> is Scotland’s own system. BritRail is another) connecting the entire island. Basically, you can get anywhere in on the island in 5 hours or less. No cars, no gas stations. Just a few pounds and a ride through beautiful scenery. This is energy efficiency at its best.</p>
<p>However, if you really need to drive, you can always get a car. Good luck finding a pick-up truck or a giant SUV. The cars in Europe are tiny and only manual transmission. This means less gas, less money spent at the pump, and less harmful emissions in the air. Sure, you might have to sacrifice the feeling of riding in an armored tank, but at least your pockets won’t be hurting. What is really interesting about cars in Europe is that you will often see American cars (Fords, Chevys, etc.) that you have never seen in America. Take this Chevy for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0433.jpg"><img title="IMG_0433" src="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0433.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Have you ever seen anything like that in the States? Its a Chevy! I bet that thing gets well over 40mpg. But why don’t we see more cars like this zipping around our streets? Is it the American mentality? Is bigger really better or are we just simply unexposed to the smaller option?</p>
<p>Another thing I’ve noticed in terms of energy use and sustainability is appliance size. My program director, Dr. Geoff Buckley, is staying with his wife and three children in a townhouse on the west side of the city. The group has been over a few times for dinner and I have always taken note at the size of the appliances in the house. The refrigerator is no bigger than what we would call a “mini-fridge”. The oven is the size of a microwave. The washer fits nice and eloquently under that counter in the kitchen as well. No dishwasher. No dryer. Small appliances.</p>
<p>Bathrooms are another interesting evidence of sustainability in Europe. The first one I used was in the University’s library. I was amazed by this:</p>
<p><a href="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0328.jpg"><img title="IMG_0328" src="http://karltear.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0328.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Conservation and sustainability has even made its way into the bathroom. Unbelievable. The concept here is simple: if you think you <em>need</em> to fully flush the toilet, please do so. If not, simply press the small button and you are doing your part in saving the world. But I don’t think Europeans think that way. I think that it is a part of their culture to be sustainable and to use less energy. They don’t know any other way.</p>
<p>All of these examples boil down to one thing: conservation of energy. You don’t need to spend much time in Europe to understand that they take their energy use very seriously. Perhaps us Americans can adapt some of these techniques. Maybe then some of our energy problems will disappear.</p>
<p>It will require a paradigm shift, however. We live in a culture of consumption. Big Macs, big houses, big cars. But thats <em>our </em>culture. Europeans are opposite. Thats whats makes it <em>their </em>culture. Have I seen the light? Perhaps. I know that when I return home I will think of energy use much differently. It is frustrating, however, that it takes a trip to Europe to see the better way. It shouldn’t be that way.</p>
<p>One day, I think America will move to a more sustainable, energy efficient lifestyle. It may take drastic measures or (hopefully not) a catastrophic event to lead us in that direction, but I am confident that it can happen.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was younger I was in a book club. I was the only member. We read the entire Goosebumps Series, the Boxcar Children and the Babysitters Club.</p>
<p><a href="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/goosebump_books_23_total_15_pekin_il_7585616.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1847" title="goosebump_books_23_total_15_pekin_il_7585616" src="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/goosebump_books_23_total_15_pekin_il_7585616.jpg?w=150&#038;h=113" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></a>  <a href="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/boxcar-train-1-2411.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1852" title="boxcar-train-1-241" src="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/boxcar-train-1-2411.jpg?w=150&#038;h=118" alt="" width="150" height="118" /></a>  <a href="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bsc011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1853" title="bsc01" src="http://focusonthelittlethings.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bsc011.jpg?w=150&#038;h=90" alt="" width="150" height="90" /></a></p>
<p>I never really liked discussing books with other people. I found the experience of reading a book and the way that each story made you feel to be a very personal thing. Even to this day, I still don&#8217;t love sitting around and debating which character is my favorite or what the author might have been implying when they wrote a particular passage. People debate for hours over whether or not Dumbledore from Harry Potter is gay, or if Edward or Jacob should end up with Bella from Twilight, or who is the most admirable character in Atlas Shrugged, Dagny Taggart, John Galt, Francisco d&#8217;Anconia or Hank Rearden.</p>
<p>I joined a book club back in 2007. I went to the events for the food, wine and to chat with my friends. And while I read the books and certainly had opinions on them, I never felt like standing in front of the group and defending my perspective. Needless to say, my attendance in the book club wasn&#8217;t very good and I ended up dropping out after a year.</p>
<p>So when my friend, Erica, asked me to join her &#8220;dinner club&#8221;, I was immediately intrigued. What she wants to do is take the best of what book clubs have to offer (food, wine and good company) and remove the whole reading part. Genius! I knew there was a reason I liked this girl.</p>
<p>So while I certainly enjoy reading, I definitely think of it as an individual sport as opposed to the team sport that is eating, sipping wine and gossiping. So glad that I have friends who agree. Cheers to dinner club and all of the good memories that are bound to come out of it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.&#8221;  Aristotle</p>
<p>I am a small town girl.  My lovely little hometown has a population of 1500 or so in the town limits and around 25,000 in the whole county.  To give you a little perspective, on a any given Saturday in the fall there are over 100,000 people in <a title="Neyland Stadium" href="http://www.utsports.com/sports/m-footbl/neyland_stadium.html" target="_blank">Neyland Stadium</a> in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>So, I am used to knowing everyone and everyone knowing me.  In fact, I am gifted in license plate memory.  I can identify the cars of many friends, family, and acquaintances at home by looking at their plate.  Scary.  I know.  Being the product of a small town means that you also have to get used to people knowing a lot about you.  I went to high school with people whose parents went on dates with my parents before they were married.  There are no secrets in a small town.  And, hey, if some people do not know something for sure they probably will just make it up.</p>
<p>It is different in the “big city” &#8211; only a small group of people know everything about you rather than the entire town.</p>
<p>When I lived in Charlottesville, Virginia I got my first taste of anonymity.  No one cared what I looked like at the grocery store, no one knew me at the Rite Aid, and no one told me that they remember me when I was a baby.  Next was Richmond, Virginia &#8211; arguably a real city with a million people downtown.  This was a bit different.  No one knew me but I began to see how small communities developed within big ones.  I may not know anyone across town but the 100 people who I work around and go to church with know all about me, or they think that they do.  Same difference, I suppose.  Enter the home of Neyland Stadium.  I was in Knoxville three glorious years.  Of course, law school being what it is &#8211; like high school &#8211; I was back in the fish bowl.  Where everyone that you interact with on a daily and regular basis knows you.  Then I moved on to a small Virginia town to practice law (where I happily met and bonded with the Cosmic Sisters, more on that later) and we are right back to knowing everyone in the grocery store and seeing people who knew you in diapers.  But, as I said, I am a small town girl and I get it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2011, I voluntarily left my tiny little town to set up shop in FW, a city of 250,000 in a state of six million or so (I am guessing).  I knew no one.  But as you have seen I have made a bit of a life of experiencing new things and the culture of the place that I now call home.  And one of the neat things about it is, despite being overshadowed by Chicago to the northwest, Detroit to the northeast and Indianapolis to the southwest, FW really has the feel of a big city.  No, not NYC or Chicago or Houston.  The skyline does not tower and the streets are not stinking and crowded, but it has a lot of big city-ness to offer.  I shall elaborate . . .</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of hosting one of my Cosmic Sisters for her first FW visit.  Sunshine arrived on a Friday bearing gifts from an Amish stop and the <a title="Lehman's Orchard" href="http://www.lehmansorchard.com" target="_blank">Lehman&#8217;s Orchard</a> (hello, tasty cider) in Michigan.  The Cosmic Sisters are adventurous too.  Shocking.</p>
<p>An important fact to note is that Sunshine is a city girl.  She was raised in the Bay area near San Francisco, California.  She tells of growing up with kidnapping warnings that kept kids form playing in their front yards and small lots and just general city-ness.  Basically the complete opposite of my childhood experience.  (Also note, Sunshine is now living in a house with a yard, near a park so her babies can play in grassy fields and frolic in streams &#8211; she is a convert).  I was a bit nervous of what she would think of FW.  Would it be interesting enough?  Would she have expectations?  Would she be disappointed that the interstate does not run through downtown forcing you to drive 20 minutes to downtown?  Would she be a fan of my favorite parks and restaurants?  I am high strung, please understand.</p>
<p>After her arrival (love her heart, she drove in from Chicago), she rested up and then we spent the weekend hitting the town to cover my favorites . . . <a title="The Oyster Bar" href="http://fortwayneoysterbar.com/directions.html" target="_blank">The Oyster Bar</a>, <a title="JKO" href="http://www.jkodonnells.com" target="_blank">J.K. O’Donnell’s</a>, Granite City Brewery.  Oh, the fun of having your cosmic sister around.  There was of course constant communications with the remaining sisters, Daisy and Ruby Falls and one random email to a random dude in Wisconsin (long story).  We also covered a long walk with The Queen at my favorite park &#8211; Foster Park.  En route to the park, driving down Broadway, Sunshine proclaimed “you DO have a panaderia”.  Huh?  What?</p>
<p>For days before her visit Sunshine had been counting on being able to go into Chicago and find a traditional Hispanic bakery that reminded her of the ones she used to visit as a kid California.  Unfortunately, she decided to abandon that plan when she arrived in Chicago at 7:00 a.m. on Friday morning.</p>
<p>I, of course, had never really been in a panaderia.  I once walked through one in San Antonio, Texas, but I did not realize it at the time.  So, Sunshine took me on a cultural experience in my own town at a place that I have driven by tons of times on the way to the park or to drive around and look at the pretty homes on Rudisil.</p>
<p>George’s La Baguette located at Broadway and Taylor has traditional pastries, breads, and other treats.  All are made in-house and they are pretty and pretty tasty. Here is some of the fabulousness that we tasted, me for the first time.  It was great.</p>

<p>Post bakery, we hit up the <a title="Fireflies and Coffee" href="http://coalfieldstocornfields.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/fireflies-and-coffee/" target="_blank">Firefly Coffee House</a> (Sunshine even scored some prizes for her babies and herself) where my prediction that it would be a favorite of the Cosmic Sisters was confirmed!  Then we went to a festival.  Another shock &#8211; a festival in the Midwest on a Saturday?  Of course, we did.  The Taste of the Arts is an event hosted by Arts United and takes place in downtown FW.  You can check out cool art and taste the food from all of the coolest places in FW.  One of the fine offerings was from The Harp Condition.  Who doesn’t love artists that travel in the “Cool Bus” and play the kazoo.  Sunshine took home a shirt.   Other artists of note were <a title="Dan Gagen" href="http://www.facebook.com/gagenart" target="_blank">Dan Gagen</a> from Albion, Indiana.  Mr. Gagen did the most gorgeous painting of Keith Richards (my favorite Rolling Stone) that I have ever seen.  Altra Design 2000, Inc. out of Huntington, Indiana made some super cool yard art (including the corn stalks below).  Also, Elizabeth Balzer, Ph.D., the owner of <a title="Elizabeth Balzer" href="http://3rgallery.com" target="_blank">3R Gallery</a> in FW on Three Rivers East.  All pretty and interesting work.</p>
<p><a href="http://coalfieldstocornfields.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/the-big-little-city/img_9199/" rel="attachment wp-att-460"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-460" title="FWMoA" src="http://coalfieldstocornfields.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_9199.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><a href="http://coalfieldstocornfields.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/the-big-little-city/img_9200/" rel="attachment wp-att-461"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-461" title="Altra Design 2000 Inc.  - Huntington, Indiana" src="http://coalfieldstocornfields.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_9200.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://coalfieldstocornfields.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/the-big-little-city/img_9202/" rel="attachment wp-att-462"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-462" title="The Harp Condition Cool Bus!

<p>All my concerns about her opinion of FW were answered when on her way out she happily said that she was initially scared that she would find me amongst “strip malls and chain restaurants.”  She was happily wrong.  Alas, she was pleased to find me among interesting events, fun places, cool eats, and nice people.  She was won over by FW and is happy that I am here.  That is a big deal.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?  There is more than enough here in FW to please a bona fide city girl and just enough to make a small town girl comfy and cozy.  That, my dear readers, is pretty.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I understand where Elbow is coming from? Easy. Because what you see below these lines will drive me to do everything but write. I will clean my house. I will walk my brother&#8217;s dog. I will catch up with friends that moved away long ago. I will rearrange my furniture. Anything but write. And in reality, it&#8217;s not the blank page that&#8217;s driving me to do so. It&#8217;s the people that will see this page in all of it&#8217;s printed glory (or horror) when it&#8217;s all said and done.</p>

<p>Peter Elbow begins “Closing My Eyes as I Speak: An Argument for Ignoring Audience” by outlining the ways in which considering audience from the very beginning of the writing process can, in fact, inhibit audience. Essentially, Elbow outlined the way I’ve approached creative writing so far this semester. Given an exercise in class, knowing that I will not <em>have</em> to read what comes out, I can write pages and pages. Sitting in front of the computer, determined to get to work on my story idea, the blank page reminds me that this is a <em>graduate</em> writing class, that there are people (besides the professor) who have been published, that some of them are second years, and some of them are Ph. D. students. My resolve to write crumbles because it does make me nervous for them to read my work. Elbow has a point.</p>
<p>As a teacher of freshman composition, I think we will have to face this hurdle. Students think they have nothing to write about or are so concerned about mechanics that every sentence they produce is subsequently deleted because it’s not perfect. Elbow outlines what I think is a useful approach to thinking about audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when. An audience is a field of force. The closer we come—the more we think about these readers—the stronger the pull they exert on the contents of our minds. The practical question, then, is always whether a particular audience function as a helpful field of force or one that confuses or inhibits us. (336)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ignoring audience, for a time, can lead to better writing. Uninhibited writing is, as Elbow says, often the strongest. While I have no doubt that some students will find audience helpful, I find Elbow intriguing because a writer is not at fault for not appreciating the ominous presence of a vague audience. He even says, “What most readers value in really excellent writing is not prose that is right for readers but prose that is right for thinking, right for language or right for the subject being written about” (339). We want our students to be thoughtful writers first.</p>
<p>The challenge becomes, then, to figure out when and how an audience fits into the teaching of composition. It would be unfair to begin with audience does not matter and then later say that it does. It would also be unfair to ask them to create an audience, because that makes “audience” vast and vague, which is not useful. The best advice I received in undergrad was to “make [my paper] relevant.” I was not asked to think about the teacher, or the masses that will not ever <em>actually</em> read my paper. I was asked to make a point. In a way, it made the world my audience, but at the same time,  it removed the personal element of audience for me. I was writing about Joseph Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em>. My paper focused on the antithetical rivers. In the conference, my professor read my draft, set it down, turned toward me with folded hands and said “so what?” <em>So what?</em> I thought. <em>So what! I made a pretty awesome connection is what!</em> In thinking about it later though, I did find a “so what” that challenged the reader to consider why this little book that is one hundred years old can still be useful. The impersonal audience approach worked for me, and I think that is what Elbow is getting at, but like I said, the challenge is how. How do we find the balance of audience relevancy in the classroom?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we get ready to start our blogging journey, we decided to host a special event in our classroom. We invited my last year group to share their <a title="Jumping into a Blogging Adventure with My Students" href="http://gret.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/bloggingadventure/" target="_blank">blogging adventure</a> with us. What would be more motivating for my students than to learn about blogging and commenting from other kids?</p>
<p>It was amazing to see how engaged in the conversation every kid was. It was powerful to see how everyone wanted to participate either to ask questions or to answer them. There were no shy kids, no quiet kids. Everyone had something to say or ask. Blogging is meaningful not just for my former students but also for my group, which is surprising since they haven&#8217;t even started to blog!<br />
Since, I can’t share the video, I carefully picked some of the things they said, which show how much blogging means to them and how important it is for our kids to learn things which they are really passionate about.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was awesome. I wrote stories and <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/milir/our-vacation-in-punta-del-este/">Marcos, my uncle who lives in Spain</a>, read them and left comments for me!</em>&#8220;<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/MiliR/"> MiliR</a> said proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>People READ our blog. Greta read our blog too, but we got comments from all over the world,</em>&#8221; said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Alex189/">Alex</a> &#8211; &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t forget,<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/our-blogging-buddies/"> the map</a>!</em>, interrupted <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Tody/">Tody</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Oh yes! We had <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/our-blogging-buddies/">a map</a> and we marked all the places we got comments from. It was full of colorful marks</em>&#8220;, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Marti/">Marti</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I loved to write on the blog. I got comments from all over the world. We are famous now</em>&#8220;, exclaimed <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>Then one of my students raised his hand and asked, &#8220;<em>What did the blog mean to you?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was the best, I blogged all the time, when I was happy, sick, bored&#8230; all the time!</em>&#8220;, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was amazing. We learned and had a lot of fun</em>&#8220;, expressed<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/MiliR/"> MiliR</a>.</p>
<p>Just then, another boy inquired: &#8220;<em>Where did you get your ideas to write?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I wrote stories. I wrote adventure stories</em>&#8220;, shared <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Marti/">Marti</a>. &#8220;<em>Yes, she also <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/marti/i-will-tell-you-a-story/">drew a map</a> on her story</em>&#8220;, added <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>, looking proudly at her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I blogged about everything I like: my friends, my pet, my thoughts. I even blogged when I was sick and couldn&#8217;t come to school</em>&#8220;, mentioned <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I blogged about <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/pipita/rugby-is-my-passion/">my passion: rugby</a>,</em>&#8221; voiced<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Pipita/"> Pipita</a>.</p>
<p>“<em>I <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/ber/my-new-song/">wrote a song</a> and then sang it in our <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/singing-fridays/">Singing Fridays</a>!</em>”, <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Ber/">Ber</a> said joyfully.</p>
<p>“<em>I sometimes didn’t know what to write, but I read my friends’ posts and left them comments</em>”, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Lalo2/">Lalo</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I wrote about <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/alex189/argentina-2/">our country</a> and things that were important to me</em>,&#8221; expressed <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Alex189/">Alex</a>.</p>
<p>I was totally speechless&#8230; I just let them lead and do the talking. I savored each and every minute. It has been one of my most inspiring moments as a teacher. Kids teaching kids. Kids encouraging kids to blog. It absolutely blew my mind.</p>
<p>What the kids said speaks for itself. These are my former students’ voices. Seeing them laugh and share proudly their work was priceless. Seeing my students’ beam as they heard the older kids advice and experience was incredible. Needless to say, my students can&#8217;t wait to start blogging and to be honest, neither can I.</p>
