				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">In the past, most things that you owned were built to last. Household goods were expensive, and you looked after what you had, repairing things and maintaining them. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, new industrial processes and new materials – plastic especially – began to change that. One of the first and best known examples is the Dixie cup, invented in 1907 in response to a health scare about shared tin cups used at public water fountains. Vending machines with paper cups were a much more hygienic solution. Today, we get through billions of paper and plastic cups every year, 146 billion in the US alone.</p>
<p align="left">It’s a funny thing, disposability. One-use items are often more convenient. You don’t need to wash them and put them away, or worry about breaking them, and they’re more hygienic, especially for medical equipment. On the other hand, it’s far cheaper to own real things and re-use them. Objects built to last are always more satisfying to use, they have weight and body and we can take pride in owning them. You don’t really own a disposable item, you just use it. Then there’s the waste. Sometimes it’s a palpable sense, when you gather up paper plates at the end of a party perhaps. Usually it’s not, and the problem of <a href="http://makewealthhistory.org/2007/11/11/the-landfill-problem/">landfill</a>, off-gas and<a title="The North Atlantic garbage patch" href="http://makewealthhistory.org/2008/03/31/the-landfill-continent-that-dwarfs-the-united-states/"> sea plastic</a> happen far away and without thought.</p>
<p align="left">Each of us has negotiated our own compromises here. I take my mug with a lid to the coffee shop at the station, but I gather from the friendly Welsh man who serves me that this is unusual. We use real nappies on the boy. And yet I will read a newspaper and it won’t cross my mind that I’m consuming a one-use disposable item. I don’t take a plate to the pizza place down the road, although it’s less than a minute’s walk away and the thought has crossed my mind.</p>
<p align="left">We all draw our lines somewhere, deciding what is acceptable and what is wasteful. The idea of ‘disposable fashion’ seems a step too far for most of us. Or perhaps one-use <a href="http://www.wineinnovationsltd.com/" target="_blank">prefilled plastic wine glasses</a> with tear-off foil lids – surely that’s crossing a line somehow.</p>
<p align="left">I’ve been thinking about disposability because I read a reference recently to a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xlYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=throwaway+living+life+magazine+1955&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHXujAGwx8&amp;sig=49S9FfiD1CXQz5SFxSkJiFrlp3Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FTHQUNWsLKm00QWjqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=throwaway%20living%20life%20magazine%201955&amp;f=false" target="_blank">1955 article in Life magazine</a> called ‘Throwaway Living’. I was curious and I looked it up.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10770" alt="disposability" src="http://makewealthhistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/disposability.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p align="left">It’s a neat cultural artefact, evidence of the excitement around plastic (see also <a href="http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.html" target="_blank">Disney’s plastic house of the future </a>exhibit). The article is all about liberation, “the objects flying through the air in this picture would take 40 hours to clean – except that no housewife need bother. They are all meant to be thrown away after use.”</p>
<p align="left">The picture includes familiar items like cups, foil trays, paper tablecloths and disposable barbecues. Other things didn’t catch on, like throwaway vases and flowers, buckets, or disposable guest towels. The picture also includes disposable duck and goose decoys in the bottom right, and I couldn’t tell you if those still exist or not.</p>
<p align="left">What’s interesting to me is how our attitudes towards disposability have changed and continue to change. Here is a carefree, celebratory feel to throwing things away that might make many of us feel uncomfortable now. It looks naive, maybe even reckless. The idea of being able to eat off disposable plates and throw them away was thrilling and futuristic. Now it seems lazy, although only if we were cooking for ourselves and serving it up onto paper plates. (If it’s a takeaway, it’s okay to eat off disposable dishes – that’s one of the unspoken moral codes of disposability.)</p>
<p align="left">Plastic bags are one of the areas where our attitudes are changing at the moment. There is a growing awareness that our plastic bag use is excessive, and that we throw away far more than we need to. In the last few years supermarkets have started offering recycling services. More of us take our bags to the shops, or chastise ourselves for forgetting. Enlightened places like Wales and Ireland have banned the use of free plastic bags and cut the use of them dramatically. Tabloid newspapers have run campaigns on plastic bags, a sure sign of a changing moral norm.</p>
<p align="left">We still throw away too much, but our attitudes towards disposable things are changing and maturing. I may shake my head at those pre-filled wine glasses, but a glance back at that Life article shows where we might have been.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="il_fi" alt="" src="http://www.brennanletkeman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2007UglyGift.jpg" width="640" height="457" /></p>
<p>Now that we are all gathered together under this lovely photograph, there is something you need to know.  About me.  About you.  About us.</p>
<p><strong>Picture yourself</strong> holding a cup of java, in your PJ&#8217;s on Christmas morning when a sweet, adorable, bed-headed wild child with sticky fingers passes you a box that has been wrapped in three different types of wrapping paper, 5 different types of ribbon, and it smells like drool.  After it is handed to you, some of the wrapping paper sticks to the child&#8217;s fingers.  You stifle nausea and fain joy as you reluctantly pull the gift towards yourself and some of the wrapping paper tears away prematurely.  The child looks at you expectantly.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Do you like it?</em><br />
<em>Are you going to open it?</em><br />
<em>Are you happy?  </em></p>
<p>As you behold the (<em>can-this-be-called-a</em>) gift in your hands, you try to find a word or two to do <em>*authentic justice*</em> to it.</p>
<p>Finally, because you are a really good person&#8230;you utter a sleepy, <em>&#8220;This is supposed to be for ME?  Gee, thanks&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The room is quiet because everyone is <strong>dying to know:</strong>  <strong>WHO is THIS THING from anyway?!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Well, it&#8217;s from <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ME</span></strong>, of course!  </em> (Consider yourself fore-warned.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you like it?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can just hold it for a while, if you want.  I understand the hesitation.  Really, I do.  You don&#8217;t have to open it right away. After all, we all know that if a gift looks good on the outside, something good is on the inside.  Right?  Especially if you like gifts (<a title="Post:  When a Gift is More than a Gift" href="http://persuaded2go.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/when-a-gift-is-more-than-a-gift/">ahh, the language a good gift speaks</a>).  And if no effort were put into the gift-wrap, well then&#8230;let&#8217;s all just say, &#8220;<strong>You&#8217;re ssssssssss-p-e-c-i-a-l&#8230;.</strong>&#8221; ha ha ha&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s me.  <strong>I&#8217;m that special gift.</strong>  It&#8217;s me.  In all my glory.  I <del>don&#8217;t apologize</del> learning not to apologize for my wrapping.  But it makes me self-conscious sometimes, so please excuse me if I waver in my attitude from time to time.  But&#8230;IT&#8217;S ME!!</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>1.<strong> giving the gift of &#8220;ME&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This Christmas, my life could have turned out <em>so much different</em>.  I sometimes let myself experience the thought of the nightmare of <strong>OPTION B</strong> had I chosen it when my affair was discovered.  <strong>IF</strong> my choices had been different, this year I wouldn&#8217;t even be with my family.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say that out of a sense of fear or shame, I say it out of my own sense of <strong>AWE</strong>.  Like it dawns on me that I am:  <strong>One choice away from HAPPY and one choice away from SAD</strong>.  One choice away from VULNERABLE and one choice away from SHAME.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m NOT SAYING that &#8220;my family should be glad I chose <em>them</em>.&#8221;  I am saying that I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m here.  In all my glory.  They get me:  All my mistakes.  All my messed upedness.  All my newly invented words.  Because this is a part of who I am.</p>
<p>They have me.  And this Christmas I am pouring all my energy into being me.  Imperfectly.  So that I can encourage others to embrace who <em>they are.  </em></p>
<p><em>Which brings me to&#8230;</em></p>
<p>________________________</p>
<div><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>giving the gift of &#8220;YOU&#8221;</strong></div>
<p>Oh frick.  Don&#8217;t stop reading now just because I&#8217;ve made this about <strong>YOU</strong>.  I&#8217;m sure your wrapping paper and gift presentation looks a lot nicer than mine does.  Ha.</p>
<p>If your family is larger than ONE, you may be dealing with the very same people you love to hate.  People who are messed up, broken packages.  You may even feel like the broken package is you.  Welcome here.  Let&#8217;s gather ourselves together under a tree, and pretend we are alive.  Or actually be alive.  Whichever you choose.  Being alive means living in the moment.  And this year, if your gift looks a little broken, let others see you.  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>REALLY see you.</strong></span></p>
<p>Scary, isn&#8217;t it?  Well, that&#8217;s another post.  In the meantime&#8230;<br />
<em><strong>give your broken gifts a kiss for me.</strong></em></p>

<p>Social media proves its worth when it comes to spreading news across the world but occasionally it can create it too. Yesterday (18 Dec 2012) it seems everyone was talking about Instagram and what they plan to do with users&#8217; photos.</p>
<p>Instagram announced a few changes to their T&amp;Cs and most people did the same thing they do with all T&amp;Cs, speed-reading through them not really understanding or caring what had changed. A few however decided that they&#8217;d delve deeper and apparently uncovered an evil plot&#8230;</p>
<p>Instagram are going to sell our photos and make millions from our personal property!</p>
<p>What surprises me most about this is that I seem to be amongst the very few who weren&#8217;t outraged by this news and didn&#8217;t even consider deleting my account in protest. Many others though took to their Facebook accounts (the irony) and Twitter to complain about this sudden infringement on their privacy, copyright, freedom, human rights, the Geneva Convention, the Rome Statute, and all the other laws that have nothing to do with posting on social media sites but have been cited as laws that Instagram is now breaking.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set the scene a little. In April 2012, <a title="Facebook buys Instagram)" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17658264">Facebook bought Instagram</a> for $1bn. That&#8217;s quite a lot of cash and no doubt they made all the money they needed for the purchase from all the subscriptions they charge Facebook users. No, wait, hold on, Facebook is free. So how did they have all that money? Oh yeah, selling advertising. Despite Facebook being free for the user, every time its T&amp;Cs are amended there is outrage. Posts about how Facebook is now going to start owning our homes, sell our children or kill our pets surface and users start citing those laws mentioned previously and threaten to close their accounts. Yet things die down and everyone carries on as normal because really nothing much actually changes. Facebook does not sell your photos. What it can do though, if your settings allow, is use your information to send you targeted advertising. It can read our data and use it to tell advertisers how many of us like a certain type of chocolate or what TV programmes we watch. It can use our profile picture to show our friends what brands we like but, if our privacy settings are configured correctly, it won&#8217;t show profile pictures to people we don&#8217;t know. All in all, besides some trailblazing data capture methods, Facebook is no different to any other clever marketing tool that is designed to research customer trends for the purposes of selling advertising.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you still don&#8217;t trust Zuckerberg and co but still want to use Facebook. That&#8217;s fine, just don&#8217;t share things you don&#8217;t want them to know about and make sure your privacy settings are up to date. It amazes me how many people have their mobile numbers and personal emails on their contact pages and still have open accounts for the world to see, yet complain when they hear that once again Facebook threatens to tell everyone what colour underwear they are wearing.</p>
<p>So back to Instagram. $1bn, that really is a lot of money to pay for a company that at the moment isn&#8217;t making money. It might shock you, and <a title="Social Media: You do realise it’s free don’t you?" href="http://hutchpr.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/social-media-you-do-realise-its-free-dont-you/">I&#8217;ve blogged about this before</a>, but Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, Google+, Instagram, and all the other social media sites around today and coming in the future are not developed for fun. They are developed to make money. I know, how dare they!</p>
<p>When this news surfaced one tweet that was reprinted by the media at large said &#8220;This is Instagram&#8217;s suicide note.&#8221; I agree and it would be if Instagram were actually doing what these news reports claimed. Lets say a company was to suddenly say they were now going to use our photos, even the ones from users whose accounts are made private, to make money. I would fully expect that all but the very narcissistic of us would leave, it would indeed be commercial suicide. But that&#8217;s not what they said.</p>
<p>What Instagram, well Facebook, is doing is amending its T&amp;Cs to bring them into line with Facebook&#8217;s. It wants to be able to offer its new platform to businesses to make money. It means that as time goes on, they may use our data to show what brands we are associated with and it may mean that we get targeted advertising. This might decrease the user experience slightly but it&#8217;ll be no worse than watching a tv programme on a commercial channel rather than the BBC, even then you can try to ignore the adverts.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s co-founder, Kevin Systrom, confirmed this in a <a title="Thank you, and we’re listening" href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening">statement</a> on their site&#8217;s blog late yesterday and also added:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8221;Instagram users own their content and Instagram does not claim any ownership rights over your photos. Nothing about this has changed. We respect that there are creative artists and hobbyists alike that pour their heart into creating beautiful photos, and we respect that your photos are your photos. Period.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some have called this backpedaling, I&#8217;m not so sure. I think perhaps what happened is what usually happens in a situation like this. A few people got the wrong end of the stick, they ran with their paranoia and others caught on. Meanwhile Instagram sat back and watched and got a lot of free international publicity out of it. Probably about $1bn worth.</p>
<p>Again if you still don&#8217;t trust Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all the others that you enjoy all the benefits of for free, then as The Independent&#8217;s, Deputy Editor, Archie Bland says: <a title="Still irritated by Instagram selling photos to advertisers? Time to move on " href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/still-irritated-by-instagram-selling-photos-to-advertisers-time-to-move-on-8424397.html">maybe it&#8217;s time to move on</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/40748396/The_End_Of_The_World_by_MrTake.jpg" width="538" height="430" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>This is part two of a series (<a href="http://abrahamthinkin.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/how-the-world-will-end/">Part 1</a>) (<a href="http://abrahamthinkin.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/how-the-world-will-end-pt-3/">Part 3</a>) covering several ways that humanity&#8217;s time on Earth could conceivably come to an end. The study of the apocalypse, known as eschatology  has been a pervasive force in religion, science, and popular culture since the development of the first cultures on Earth. Some of the theories about the end of days are more plausible than others, but all are thought-provoking nonetheless. In Part Two, I describe a few of the most likely ways in which the world as we know it could end due to <strong>Natural Disasters from Space</strong>. Cheers to the end of the world!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We&#8217;ve all seen the movies: asteroids and comets, earthquakes and volcanoes, solar flares and gamma-ray bursts&#8230;all natural ways in which our world can come to an end. And while the most popular films are also the <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/armpitageddon.html">least scientifically accurate</a>, the events that they portray are rooted in fact. Follow the break to read about a few of the most common apocalyptic natural disasters, as well as a few you probably have never heard of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-403"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Death by Cosmic Collision</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.astrowhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/44089.jpg" width="277" height="221" />We&#8217;ll get the most obvious one out of the way first. This has been the topic of the most popular disaster movies within the last two decades, and reasonably so: the thought of a giant piece of rock smashing into Earth is horrifying. After all, we were all taught from a young age that a comet or asteroid likely caused the extinction of all dinosaurs on Earth about 65 million years ago. Even though we have not directly observed a major impact event on Earth, we know quite a good deal about the effects that they have had based on geological and archaeological evidence. Not only this, but <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/impactearth/">advanced models</a> have been developed that predict the precise details of an impact based on our knowledge of physics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though we live close to a massive asteroid field and comets regularly come through our solar system, the odds of an impact are incredibly small &#8211; about one in 100,000,000 for a disastrous collision in any given year (there is a meaning behind the phrase &#8216;astronomical odds&#8217;). NASA currently runs a program designed to spot and catalog &#8220;near-earth objects&#8221;, and there is a high degree of confidence that all 736 such objects have been found. However, in 2004, a discovery was made that had possibly apocalyptic implications: Asteroid <a href="http://earthsky.org/space/asteroid-apophis-due-to-pass-close-in-2029">99942 Apophis</a> was believed to have as high as a 2.7% chance of impacting the Earth in 2029, creating intense interest in this and other near Earth objects. However, after more observation, it was concluded that Apophis would only have a 1 in 250,000 chance of impacting Earth, and that it could happen in 2036 instead of 2029.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2006/01/apophis_keyhole_300.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For curiosity&#8217;s sake, I used the impact calculator to see what would happen if an iron asteroid the size of London hit land while travelling at 11km/s. Needless to say, the effects would be devastating. The impact crater would be roughly 45 miles deep and 136 miles in diameter. The energy released by the impact would be equivalent to almost 340 billion of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It would cause an earthquake of magnitude 11.1 on the Richter scale, and the displacement of air would cause winds in excess of 1,500 miles per hour. Nearly everything and everyone on the Earth would be destroyed. Don&#8217;t worry though &#8211; an impact event of this size will likely never happen on Earth, ever ever ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Gamma-Ray Bursts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Gamma_ray_burst.jpg" width="518" height="362" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This phenomena is well known in astronomical circles but rarely discussed anywhere else. Basically, when a huge star is dying, it reaches a point when the mass of the star no longer has enough gravity to hold itself together, leading to a spectacular event known as a  supernova. During this process, most of the outer material of the star is thrown out into space in a brilliant explosion, and the rest of the star collapses to form tiny neutron stars or even black holes. Because this collapse typically takes the form of a spiral, the events can be accompanied by a massive blast of gamma radiation shot in a thin &#8220;jet&#8221; in both directions along the star&#8217;s axis of rotation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Were the Earth to lie in the path of a gamma-ray burst, the effects would most likely lead to mass extinctions; the ozone layer could literally be pealed away, and any living thing on the side of the world exposed to the burst would simply be fried or succumb to acute radiation poisoning.  Mass starvation and food-chain depletion would likely follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://startswithabang.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/gammarayburst.jpg" width="202" height="260" />Should you be worried? Probably not &#8211; these events are very rare, and the <a href="http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/odds.html">odds</a> that Earth will lie in the path of one are even more remote. Astronomical satellites detect about one gamma-ray burst a day, but most are billions of light-years away. A burst originating from a star in the Milky Way is estimated to happen only about once every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years. Unfortunately, since these bursts travel up to 99.95% of the speed of light, we probably would not know it was coming until it was already here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Here Comes the Sun&#8230;Seriously</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/sol_10_13/sol17.jpg" width="475" height="317" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether or not the Earth is able to outlast the extremely improbable events listed above, we do know for sure that one day, all life on Earth will likely cease to exist. Ironically, the object that currently sustains life on our planet &#8211; the sun &#8211; will also be the object that will end it. Allow me to explain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, our sun is about <a href="http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Space-Revealed/Sci-Media/Images/Lifecycle-of-the-Sun">half-way</a> through its primary life cycle. As mentioned before, stars are so massive that they are able to virtually hold themselves together by the force of their own gravity; however, as the fuel within the sun is slowly converted to light and sent out into space, it will inevitably lose mass, and therefore, gravity. The result of this is the gradual expansion of the sun into what is called a &#8220;red giant&#8221;. In this phase, the radius of the sun will increase 250 times &#8211; well beyond Earth&#8217;s current orbit. The loss of gravity, however, could also mean that the orbits of the planets will drift further and further away from the sun, essentially sparing them (except Mercury, which will likely be swallowed by the sun).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, none of that will matter. In the past billion years, the sun has become about 10% brighter and its surface temperature has increased as a result of the natural processes described above. It is likely that billions of years before the sun starts turning into a red giant, the surface temperature on Earth will increase to 60° C (140º F), causing our oceans to virtually evaporate into space. At that point, life on Earth will no longer be able to exist in the natural environment. We will be better off than Venus though &#8211; the sun will be so intense that its atmosphere will be blown off into space.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Should you be worried? Hardly: the earliest that the &#8220;<a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=908">ocean evaporation</a>&#8221; scenario is estimated to begin is in around 500 million years. Still, this means that we came a little late to the party because we could now be inhabiting Earth during the last 10% of its habitable life. There is a bright side, however &#8211; assuming that humans spread throughout the galaxy long before this starts to happen, we would probably have the technology to come back to Earth in cool spaceships or something. So, billions of years from now, after the sun has thrown off its outer layers to form a nebula, a human could stand on a cold, rocky Earth, look up into the sky, and see it filled with an image just like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Is your mind at ease, or did you discover even more things here that send chills down your spine? Let us know below! Also, don&#8217;t forget to look our for the next installment in this series where I take a look at some ways the world could end due to natural disasters caused by our very own planet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The medium known as Twitter used to be a piece of the puzzle I didn&#8217;t get. I am not interested in famous people doing things I cannot afford or the hygiene habits of anyone&#8211;celebrity or civilian. Then Twitter was at the heart of of the Arab Spring, political debate, and of course, food culture.</p>
<p>Now I’m on Twitter all the time.  Twitter has been the form of social media where my following has grown the fastest.  It is a virtual cocktail party where people say pithy things and make and break friends on the daily.  It’s so important that Tweets are archived.  The billions of words uttered on Twitter are not just part of an endless digital feed, they are records of our civilization as we currently live, experience and digest it.</p>
<p>So why throw an enslaved cook in the mix?  Meet @antebellumchef</p>
<p>There are other anachronistic Twitter accounts to be sure, but very few like mine which deal with the day to day existence of a person from the past.  @antebellumchef on Twitter is my way of bringing to life another side of myself that has a lot to say about food, cooking, the past.  On Twitter unfortunately, people expect @Koshersoul to be a clearing house for all things kosher and Black/soul food, etc…..For me, I don’t really feel that…@Koshersoul is a nickname, kinda like when I say “Chocolate Chosen,” that embraces two sides of my current self that are spiritual, historical, ethnic, cultural, “racial,” etc.  It’s supposed to be the whole me, but I find myself limited and a bit fenced in by people’s perceptions of that branding and name.  People don’t want me to talk about certain things&#8212;namely anything “trayf,” or non-kosher food..and that’s hard when you’re trying to be in the flow of all things food related.</p>
<div id="attachment_1776" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 692px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_2588/" rel="attachment wp-att-1776"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776" alt="The Punkah at Melrose" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_2588.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" width="682" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Punkah at Melrose</p></div>
<p>@antebellumchef doesn’t have these dilemmas.  He is an unmarried (and there are reasons for that), 30 something Black male living in about 1858-1859 leading up through the Civil War.  He covertly reads under cover of darkness and on Sundays, he notes the intrigues of the Big House and talks (tweets) about the world around him with its mundane colors and infrequent crises.  His dream is to run away and become a wealthy caterer in the North.  For now he has no name but that may reveal itself in time.</p>
<p>@antebellumchef is a way for me to express how I view food.  It’s easy as a person who does living history to become wrapped up in replication of traditional or historic foods and recipes.  I think of myself as an untrained but educated chef whose education is right out of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  That’s not really a job that markets itself in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  My mind is fixed on 18<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century foodways of Africa, the West Indies, South America, and South and early America with the eye of at 21<sup>st</sup> century food person.  I am limited to the ingredients and methods of the time, but with a contemporary eye and with contemporary advantages. I want be so anchored in the wisdom and experience of the historic and global kitchen to the point where I can channel the recipes we&#8217;ve forgotten.</p>
<p><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/11/02/the-cotton-kingdom-a-photographic-essay/dent/" rel="attachment wp-att-1713"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" alt="dent" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dent.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>@antebellumchef allows me to bring some of that energy out.  It’s a very lonely place to be otherwise.  Food and culinary historians, contemporary chefs and food writers, academics, food producers, and the like do not have all of those identities in one person.  I don’t fancy myself a culinary savior.  I suppose I am a culinary preservationist, but at the end of the day I guess one of my dreams is to not just create recipes in the image of the past but to bring to those ingredients a contemporary life they have not yet known.  I get great pleasure out of the minutiae that you need to know to do what I do, and an even greater pleasure teaching those facts to others.</p>
<p>This is where I think as a cook and not just as a food person absorbing other people’s energies.  Because I don’t have a restaurant or cookbook where I demonstrate that product for you as of yet, this account allows me to let you into my mental gymnastics as I try to figure out “What’s for dinner?”  But I also have to think about power, ethics, control, food injustice, discomfort food and culinary plagiarism…both with an contemporary and an antique mind.  It’s the nature of ingredients, their story, their relationship to each other, to the land, to me, to the eater.  Outside of my kosher/soul and antebellumchef identities I’m more of an culinary voyeur, but with them I have agency, choice, discretion and an opinion.  How ironic that they are on two opposite poles of ways to enjoy and understand food.</p>
<div id="attachment_1779" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_3037/" rel="attachment wp-att-1779"><img class="size-large wp-image-1779" alt="A Cowhorn Cayenne" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_3037.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" width="1024" height="682" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Cowhorn Cayenne</p></div>
<p>@antebellumchef is also a place where I can vent my spiritual energies.  I’ve been to a lot of plantations and sites where enslaved people live.  From a spiritual place, it’s a very lonely place to be.  Many people are afraid of this part of our history—apologists hate it because it is part of our American original sin.  Many people of color shy away because it brings up inarticulate anger, shame, disbelief and conflicted feelings.  Others disassociate, don’t know what to ask, don’t know what to say.  I was extremely insulted when an Internet troll said they felt sad for me because I was so fixed on the pain and anguish of slavery.  The reality is I know that the plantation was the proving ground for the culture I am heir to.</p>
<div id="attachment_1778" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_3035/" rel="attachment wp-att-1778"><img class="size-large wp-image-1778" alt="Cowpeas in Louisiana " src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_3035.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" width="1024" height="682" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cowpeas in Louisiana</p></div>
<p>I am the most attached to these Ancestors—from Africa to America to the Civil War because they are most easily forgotten.  I dream of them, and the mere thought of them brings me to tears. I often feel as though we have not loved them enough.  As moderns we have tended to pity them, while I put my pride in them.  I want to teach their songs, their folk beliefs, their medicines, their foods, their aesthetics, their cosmology, their infinite wisdom and @antebellumchef is my way of ensuring that as many 21<sup>st</sup> century people as possible will know that heritage and pass it on.  It is my great fear that those who want to forget, those who want to ignore and those who don’t know how to ask or don’t care to will condemn these Ancestors to the ultimate death—national amnesia.</p>
