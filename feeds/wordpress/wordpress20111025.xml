			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bistrobess.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/onion-rings-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" title="Onion Rings" src="http://bistrobess.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/onion-rings-3.jpg?w=584&#038;h=387" alt="" width="584" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Anyone who grew up an Army brat has developed a real love/hate relationship with Burger King.  For those who don&#8217;t know, basically every Army post has a Burger King, and it was generally the only food option.  Posts now have Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Taco Bell and more.  We always had a free standing Buger King, and a PX foodcourt full of generic fast food knockoffs like Anthony&#8217;s Pizza and Robin Hood Sandwiches.  Burger King was the way to go&#8230;but that often meant getting sick of it, and quickly. But I loved Burger King for one reason&#8230;the onion rings option.  I love onion rings, and almost always opted for those instead of fries. </p>
<p>When I saw a recipe for <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/03/low-fat-baked-onion-rings.html">&#8220;skinny&#8221; onion rings</a>, I knew I needed to try it.  Personally, I don&#8217;t fry things at home.  It&#8217;s messy, it&#8217;s greasy, it&#8217;s generally a pain.  Not to mention it produces some very unhealthy food.  So, this baked option, using onions, low fat buttermilk, panko and not much else, really jumped out at me. </p>
<p>The recipe was a success for sure; the onion rings were crunchy and quite good.  The process was a bit messy, though not hard.  There are two parts of this process that are integral to success:</p>
<ul>
<li>One, LINE THE BAKING SHEETS WITH PARCHMENT.  Don&#8217;t skip it, don&#8217;t think you can just sprayy them with Pam&#8230;rings on an unlined sheet will burn.  Trust BistroBess. </li>
<li>Two, BREAD THE RINGS IN SMALL BATCHES.  My breading got wet and clumpy really fast, and once that happens, nothing sticks.  I had to toss out my first batch less than halfway through the process and start over.  My suggestion would be to mix up the breading in one bowl, and add it to a seperate breading bowl a small amount at a time. Put in about enough breading for 2 or 3 rings, bread those, wipe out the bowl, and add fresh breading crumbs for the next few rings.  It takes more time, but your results will be dramatically improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these two guidelines, the reward is crispy, hot onion rings that you don&#8217;t feel bad about eating.  But don&#8217;t worry, Burger King, your onion rings will always be my nostalgic fave.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Onion Rings</strong></p>
<p><em>Adapted slightly from <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com/">SkinnyTaste.com</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>1 medium onion</li>
<li>2 1/4 cups low fat buttermilk</li>
<li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
<li>1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
<li>1/4 cup crushed corn flake crumbs</li>
<li>salt to taste </li>
<li>Pam cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p>Slice onion into ¼ inch rings.  Separate the rings (I discarded the tiny middles), and place in a shallow baking dish.  Cover in buttermilk, and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450. Combine the three types of crumbs and salt to taste in a small bowl.  Have another bowl nearby for breading.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove onions from refrigerator.</p>
<p>Put a small amount (¼ cup or less) of the breading mixture into your breading bowl.  Remove the onion rings one at a time from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off.  Quickly dredge in the breading mixture and place on the baking sheet.  Repeat with all onion rings, replacing breading as needed.  Wet, clumpy breading will not stick to the rings!</p>
<p>Spray the onion rings generously with cooking spray, and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Serve hot.</p>

<div>Dear Free-Range Kids: Thought you might like  this old list I found in a drawer yesterday.  When I read the first sentence, I thought immediately of Free-Range! These were the travel rules we used with our kids when they were smaller.  They are now 15, 19, and 21, and travel independently and joyfully around the world. (You can tell from the rules that it wasn&#8217;t always this way!  Hang in there, parents!)  &#8211; Darreby, in Maine</div>

<div><strong>Ambler Family Travel Rules and Responsibilities</strong></div>
<ol id="yui_3_2_0_41_1319508188730179">
<li><strong>It’s good to talk to strangers.  The outside world is full of them.  The place you don’t have to deal with them is <em>at home, </em>which is where people who can’t cope with strangers will stay next time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Each traveler is responsible for finding things to be excited about, and sharing that enthusiasm.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the enthusiasm of others embarrasses you, pretend otherwise.  Being cool is dull, except in a sports car.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unusual foods are part of the point.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Staying home is usually more comfortable than traveling, but traveling is more interesting.  Prioritize well.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Travel disruptions are normal and a good way to show your readiness for more challenging adventures.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Remember that your dislikes do not make interesting conversation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wash your hands.  You have no immunity to foreign germs.  Throwing up is not interesting.</strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>You have travel in your future that you can not even imagine.  Adhering to these guidelines makes you eligible for such travel.</strong></strong>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 360px"><img title="Naomi Wolfe" src="http://www.curvyfoodiehungry.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/naomi-wolf.jpg" alt="Naomi Wolfe" width="350" height="210" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Naomi Wolfe</p></div>
<p>Last night I was arrested in my home town, outside an event to which I had been invited, for standing lawfully on the sidewalk in an evening gown. Let me explain; my partner and I were attending an event for the Huffington Post, for which I often write: Game Changers 2011, in a venue space on Hudson Street. As we entered the space, we saw that about 200 Occupy Wall Street protesters were peacefully assembled and were chanting. They wanted to address Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was going to be arriving at the event.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://occupycyberspace.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/how-i-was-arrested-at-occupy-wall-street/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pt7pIhapo1o/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>They were using a technique that has become known as &#8220;the human mic&#8221; &#8211; by which the crowd laboriously repeats every word the speaker says &#8211; since they had been told that using real megaphones was illegal. In my book Give Me Liberty, a blueprint for how to open up a closing civil society, I have a chapter on permits &#8211; which is a crucial subject to understand for anyone involved in protest in the US. In 70s America, protest used to be very effective, but in subsequent decades municipalities have sneakily created a web of &#8220;overpermiticisation&#8221; &#8211; requirements that were designed to stifle freedom of assembly and the right to petition government for redress of grievances, both of which are part of our first amendment. One of these made-up permit requirements, which are not transparent or accountable, is the megaphone restriction.</p>
<p>So I informed the group on Hudson Street that they had a first amendment right to use a megaphone and that the National Lawyers&#8217; Guild should appeal the issue if they got arrested. And I repeated the words of the first amendment, which the crowd repeated. Then my partner suggested that I ask the group for their list of demands. Since we would be inside, we thought it would be helpful to take their list into the event and if I had a chance to talk with the governor I could pass the list on.</p>
<p>That is how a democracy works, right? The people have the right to address their representatives. We went inside, chatted with our friends, but needed to leave before the governor had arrived. I decided I would present their list to his office in the morning and write about the response. On our exit, I saw that the protesters had been cordoned off by a now-massive phalanx of NYPD cops and pinned against the far side of the street &#8211; far away from the event they sought to address.</p>
<p>I went up and asked them why. They replied that they had been informed that the Huffington Post event had a permit that forbade them to use the sidewalk. I knew from my investigative reporting on NYC permits that this was impossible: a private entity cannot lease the public sidewalks; even film crews must allow pedestrian traffic. I asked the police for clarification &#8211; no response. I went over to the sidewalk at issue and identified myself as a NYC citizen and a reporter, and asked to see the permit in question or to locate the source on the police or event side that claimed it forbade citizen access to a public sidewalk. Finally a tall man, who seemed to be with the event, confessed that while it did have a permit, the permit did allow for protest so long as we did not block pedestrian passage.</p>
<p>I thanked him, returned to the protesters, and said: &#8220;The permit allows us to walk on the other side of the street if we don&#8217;t block access. I am now going to walk on the public sidewalk and not block it. It is legal to do so. Please join me if you wish.&#8221; My partner and I then returned to the event-side sidewalk and began to walk peacefully arm in arm, while about 30 or 40 people walked with us in single file, not blocking access. Then a phalanx of perhaps 40 white-shirted senior offices descended out of seemingly nowhere and, with a megaphone (which was supposedly illegal for citizens to use), one said: &#8220;You are unlawfully creating a disruption.</p>
<p>You are ordered to disperse.&#8221; I approached him peacefully, slowly, gently and respectfully and said: &#8220;I am confused. I was told that the permit in question allows us to walk if we don&#8217;t block pedestrian access and as you see we are complying with the permit.&#8221; He gave me a look of pure hate. &#8220;Are you going to back down?&#8221; he shouted. I stood, immobilised, for a moment. &#8220;Are you getting out of my way?&#8221; I did not even make a conscious decision not to &#8220;fall back&#8221; &#8211; I simply couldn&#8217;t even will myself to do so, because I knew that he was not giving a lawful order and that if I stepped aside it would be not because of the law, which I was following, but as a capitulation to sheer force. In that moment&#8217;s hesitation, he said, &#8220;OK,&#8221; gestured, and my partner and I were surrounded by about 20 officers who pulled our hands behind our backs and cuffed us with plastic handcuffs.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Naomi Wolfe  in Cuffs" src="http://readersupportednews.org/images/stories/article_imgs5/3960-author-naomi-wolf-is-arrested101911.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="195" />We were taken in a van to the seventh precinct &#8211; the scary part about that is that the protesters and lawyers marched to the first precinct, which handles Hudson Street, but in the van the police got the message to avoid them by rerouting me. I understood later that the protesters were lied to about our whereabouts, which seemed to me to be a trickle-down of the Bush-era detention practice of unaccountable detentions. The officers who had us in custody were very courteous, and several expressed sympathy for the movements&#8217; aims.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my partner and I had our possessions taken from us, our ID copied, and we were placed in separate cells for about half an hour. It was clear that by then the police knew there was scrutiny of this arrest so they handled us with great courtesy, but my phone was taken and for half an hour I was in a faeces- or blood-smeared cell, thinking at that moment the only thing that separates civil societies from barbaric states is the rule of law &#8211; that finds the prisoner, and holds the arresting officers and courts accountable. Another scary outcome I discovered is that, when the protesters marched to the first precinct, the whole of Erickson Street was cordoned off &#8211; &#8220;frozen&#8221; they were told, &#8220;by Homeland Security&#8221;. Obviously if DHS now has powers to simply take over a New York City street because of an arrest for peaceable conduct by a middle-aged writer in an evening gown, we have entered a stage of the closing of America, which is a serious departure from our days as a free republic in which municipalities are governed by police forces.</p>
<p>The police are now telling my supporters that the permit in question gave the event managers &#8220;control of the sidewalks&#8221;. I have asked to see the permit but still haven&#8217;t been provided with it &#8211; if such a category now exists, I have never heard of it; that, too, is a serious blow to an open civil society. What did I take away? Just that, unfortunately, my partner and I became exhibit A in a process that I have been warning Americans about since 2007: first they come for the &#8220;other&#8221; &#8211; the &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, the brown person, the Muslim, the outsider; then they come for you &#8211; while you are standing on a sidewalk in evening dress, obeying the law.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/upcoming-changes-to-reader-new-look-new.html" target="_blank">announced yesterday</a> that they&#8217;re removing the social features from Google Reader. They&#8217;re pitching this as an attempt to &#8220;clean things up a bit.&#8221; They also claim that, &#8220;the end result is better than what&#8217;s available today.&#8221; They acknowledge that removing the ability to friend or follow other gReader users, among other non-specified &#8220;things like&#8221; those social features, might cause people to &#8220;feel like the product is no longer for you.&#8221; Their proposed solution: export your data from gReader. The end.</p>
<p>When talking about this announcement with people, I get the impression that most people don&#8217;t really understand or use gReader&#8217;s social features, so I can see how this wouldn&#8217;t seem like a big deal. For me, this is the destruction of the only online space I truly give a shit about. (Sorry Twitter, Facebook, etc.) I&#8217;m actually really upset about this, as it&#8217;s eliminating a social space I&#8217;ve been participating in for several years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to explain how RSS readers work, as I think you can solve that part for yourself. The part that makes gReader great is that as you read your feeds, if you come across a post that you find interesting, worthy of discussion, full of kittens, whatever, you can hit &#8220;Share.&#8221; OR you can even click &#8220;Share with note,&#8221; if you want to add a little blurb at the top with your feelings or thoughts about the post you&#8217;re sharing.</p>
<p>But who is seeing this stuff, right? For me, it&#8217;s a small group (I think the largest it&#8217;s been is around 40 people) who can view all of my shared items, can view my comments, and can comment on my shared items. All three of those things, btw? Configurable. I have the ability to make groups from my Google contacts and control their rights when accessing my content. Those people also have control over who sees what of their stuff. You can follow people, which means you can see their shares &#8212; and if that person is super private, it means they&#8217;ll have to give you rights to see their stuff in order for that to work.</p>
<p>What this means is that I have several RSS feeds that, rather than a site&#8217;s posts, are items shared by other people. They have their own section, &#8220;People you follow.&#8221; When I&#8217;m in a hurry, I often mark-as-read my &#8220;normal&#8221; RSS feeds and just read and comment on the shared items of my friends.</p>
<p>The coolest part of gReader, for me, is the Comment View. This also lives in &#8220;People you follow,&#8221; and it displays any item, either shared by me or someone I follow, that has new comments on it since the last time I clicked on it. Not just stuff I&#8217;ve personally commented on, but anything that my friends are discussing. If two of my friends comment back and forth on a shared item, I will keep seeing their discussion, even if I haven’t contributed yet. As new comments appear on items, they get bumped to the top of Comment View, so I don’t miss anything and can jump in if a discussion works its way around to being something I want to participate in.</p>
<p>When I started using gReader, my community was about half the size it currently is. However, there would be people commenting on my friends&#8217; shares, people I didn&#8217;t know, who were funny, or who mentioned stuff I liked, or whatever. And so over the first year or so, there was a lot of, &#8220;Oh hey, friend from art school who loves modern novels and hipster fashion, you should TOTALLY be friends with this friend-of-a-friend who works in the fashion industry and is awesomely intellectual,&#8221; type of stuff happening. It was, and continues to be, the only social network where I interact with people with some semblance of normal real world humanity. (And by that, I mean it’s like we&#8217;re all at a mutual friend&#8217;s house party.)</p>
<p>We discovered that if you click on &#8220;Shared Items&#8221;, you could write an original post and share it with the group. (Topics covered in that manner: job interviews, buying houses, getting engaged, moving across the country, pregnancy, child care, cancer scares, deaths in the family, holiday-related family drama, and the occasional &#8220;this day is the absolute worst, someone please remind me I&#8217;m a valuable human being&#8221;.)</p>
<p>We visit each other and go out to dinner together when we&#8217;re passing through town. We travel to stay at each other&#8217;s homes for a mini-break. About twenty of us rented a house and took a vacation together last summer. This community is the primary way I stay in regular contact with many of my closest friends, it&#8217;s the network I tell first about things that happen in my life, and it&#8217;s often the only place I vent when I&#8217;m upset enough about something that I don&#8217;t want to risk mis-speaking in highly public spaces like Twitter. I am a more sensitive person, a more aware person, a more progressive, more feminist, more sympathetic and more open-minded person because of the years spent reading things I&#8217;d never have read, seeing things I&#8217;d never have seen, and getting to discuss these &#8220;new&#8221; ideas with people I respect.</p>
<p>This is the community I&#8217;m losing.</p>
<p>One of the most important things for me about gReader is that it balances the two primary uses of the internet: information and communication. Discussion that follows the sharing of information &#8211; blog posts, news items, opinion pieces, editorial images, book reviews, pictures of Zoe Saldana, etc &#8211; is more meaningful, directed, and interesting to me than post after post of people talking about themselves. I like that the primary verb of gReader is &#8220;share&#8221; &#8211; but not about you; about content that&#8217;s meaningful to you. I like that I have to click on a specific tab in order to get the little window that allows me to post only about myself. I like that gReader provides a single interface to both read content on the internet AND discuss that content with my friends.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new alternative to Reader&#8217;s social features is Google Plus. Apparently, if I share something that I see in Reader, it will generate a post to whatever circles I select and display it on my Plus account. If you&#8217;ll recall from a few paragraphs ago, Google is pitching this as, &#8220;better than what&#8217;s available today.&#8221;</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at what&#8217;s available today. I read a post in a design blog&#8217;s RSS feed on gReader featuring a house I think looks really cool, so I share it. Here&#8217;s what that share looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://kirbybits.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/reader-chart.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-222" title="reader-chart" src="http://kirbybits.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/reader-chart.png?w=490&#038;h=392" alt="" width="490" height="392" /></a><br />
(Credit for the fancy numbers and images goes to <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/" target="_blank">Darius Kazemi</a>)</p>
<p>The majority of the page (66%) is dedicated to the content the user is viewing, and you can scroll down in the pink section of the page to read the entire content of the item being viewed. Google&#8217;s using about 1/3 of the page (31%) with layout and various features. The navigation section to view other peoples&#8217; content is 3% of the page. The mechanism for sharing items (not pictured) is a button at the bottom of every post that says &#8220;Share&#8221;, and it&#8217;s so small that I didn&#8217;t measure it.</p>
<p>Some things I love about this:<br />
- Content shared by my friends is automatically collected as feeds labeled with their name, making it easy to navigate to any person&#8217;s shares quickly.<br />
- Most of the page is dedicated to displaying information and whatever comments are connected to that information.</p>
<p>And now let&#8217;s look at the &#8220;better&#8221; end result. I read a post in a design blog&#8217;s RSS feed on gReader featuring a house I think looks really cool, so I click the share button and generate a post in Google Plus. Here&#8217;s what that post looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://kirbybits.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/plus-chart.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" title="plus-chart" src="http://kirbybits.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/plus-chart.png?w=490&#038;h=392" alt="" width="490" height="392" /></a><br />
The majority of the page (57%) is dedicated to layout and various features. Other peoples&#8217; content is automatically displayed, and that takes up 25% of the page. The content I shared gets 14% of the page, and the mechanism for sharing items takes up 5%, front and center.</p>
<p>Things I love a lot less:<br />
- This is an entirely different site, so in order to read items shared by my community, I have to leave gReader, go to Plus, and then I guess make a circle for the people whose shares I want to see? And then either read all of their shares en masse, or click through to each of their profiles and scroll through to see what they&#8217;ve shared since the last time I checked?<br />
- I have no way of easily keeping up with discussions going on in my community (compared to the way Comment View currently works).<br />
- Posting links to Plus does not display the content of the item you&#8217;re sharing. Notice that in order to read the full post, you&#8217;d have to click the link and open a new page or tab.</p>
<p>In short, this is not a workflow designed around sharing information and communicating about it. This is a workflow designed to make people click on things.</p>
<p>Taken in hand with the earlier announcement from Google that they&#8217;re shutting down Buzz (another quirky social network that didn&#8217;t achieve Facebook-level popularity), part of me suspects that someone in Google corporate looked at the Buzz and gReader communities, looked at Plus&#8217;s less-than-vertical adoption &amp; use rates, and concluded that by killing Buzz and gReader&#8217;s social elements, these communities would migrate over to Plus.</p>
<p>That is, however, a ridiculous idea. Buzz operates in your Gmail inbox and gReader is an RSS feed reader. The majority of employers don&#8217;t block email or RSS feed readers. You know what a lot of employers do block? Self-described social networks like Google Plus. In addition, guess what gReader lets you call yourself? You guessed it: anything you damn well please. I have friends who refuse to join Plus because they&#8217;re worried that if they get griefed as a &#8216;nym, they&#8217;ll have all their other Google services (like Gmail) frozen. How am I supposed to interact with these people the way I do now?</p>
<p>Also, where is it written that because a large number of people form one internet community, that must be how all online communities are organized? I don&#8217;t care if Google wants Plus to get bigger, I care about me and my friends who seek to read and discuss the entire internet every day. Is there really no space for different kinds of people to form different kinds of social spaces in Google products? Are they really that fucking stupid about how communities work?</p>
<p>Or, as I suspect, is it just that Buzz and gReader aren&#8217;t nearly as effective as Plus at collecting data about my internet use?</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some times you have to let go of things to allow new, more useful things, into your life. Letting go can be difficult, but it can also be very positive and rewarding. Here are a few things you <em>MUST</em> let go of if you truly hope to live a happy and positive life&#8230;<img class="alignleft" style="border-color:white;border-style:solid;border-width:10px;margin:10px;" title="Just Let Go!" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2474/3809613545_b67e593e3d.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Let Go Of&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guilt</strong>: Does <a class="zem_slink" title="Guilt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt" rel="wikipedia">guilt</a> ever change the situation? Can it reverse time and change the past? The answer is <em>NO!</em> Guilt has no use what-so-ever. Let it go and get on with living. Take whatever it is that is making you feel guilty and use it as a lesson learned.</li>
<li><strong><a class="zem_slink" title="positive thinking" href="http://www.realage.com/tips/reduce-stress-through-the-power-of-positive-thinking" rel="realage">Negative Thinking</a></strong>: Negative thinking is one of the worst things you can do to yourself. One negative thought leads to another, which leads to a <a class="zem_slink" title="Snowball effect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_effect" rel="wikipedia">snowball effect</a> of thinking that you can&#8217;t control. Pay close attention to your thoughts by noticing your feelings, if you are thinking something that is potentially negative turn it around immediately and replace it with something positive. This simple act will make a world of difference to your mood, and your life over all.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Approval</strong>: Stop trying to get approval from others. Accept that you can not please everyone and focus on pleasing yourself. What others think doesn&#8217;t matter, your life is about how &#8216;you&#8217; feel, accept that and enjoy it.</li>
<li><strong>Anger/Heartbreak</strong>: Everyone has suffered at some point. We have all had our hearts broken or been hurt in the past. Let it go and allow yourself to move forward. Holding grudges and being bitter does not change the past, but it can have a great impact on your future and can even prevent happiness from entering your life.</li>
<li><strong>Fake <a class="zem_slink" title="Just Friends" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/just-friends1994" rel="rottentomatoes">Friends</a></strong>: Having 438 friends on <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage">Facebook</a> does not mean you have 438 friends. Chances are you have a few people online and in your life that are not &#8216;real&#8217; friends, or that don&#8217;t really add to your life in any way. Break the negative connection and let these people go, true friends are hard to find but they add substance to our lives and they are always there when we need them.</li>
<li><strong>Procrastination</strong>: Stop <a class="zem_slink" title="Procrastination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination" rel="wikipedia">procrastinating</a>, just stop. If there is something that needs to be done, just do it. Period. Procrastination is a bad habit and the longer you practice it the harder the habit is to break.</li>
<li><strong>Envy</strong>: Envy is another one of those things that gets you nowhere. Why aspire to be someone else when your life is perfect just the way it is? Stop trying to <a class="zem_slink" title="Keeping up with the Joneses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses" rel="wikipedia">keep up with the Joneses</a> and be happy with the way things are.</li>
<li><strong>Self-<a class="zem_slink" title="Doubt" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/doubt" rel="rottentomatoes">Doubt</a></strong>: A negative self-image can have a huge impact on your well-being, let go of your self-doubt and embrace self-love. Forget the ten pounds you think you need to lose, look past the flaws you see in yourself, and stop thinking you are not good enough. You are what you create in your mind, so point out 10 fantastic things about yourself right now and start sharing those great things with others. Chances are the more you love yourself, the more others will appreciate and love you as well.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Your limitations are what you make them, if you doubt you can do something you will fail in your attempts. Stop putting limitations on yourself and reach for the sky. Your self-imposed limitations are the only thing holding you back from accomplishing your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: Stop focusing on the clock. In today&#8217;s modern world everything we do revolves around time. Time for work, time for dinner, time for meetings, calls, and rest. Outside of work let go of the time restraints and simply do what feels right for you, stop living life by the minute and start living the life you want.</li>
</ul>
<div>It can be difficult to break these habits listed above. There is challenge and obstacles each of these examples presents, but overcoming these challenges will help you achieve the balance and positivity you want in your life and is well worth the effort. Choose one, two or a few of the examples above and make the choice to change your actions today. One <a class="zem_slink" title="SMALL CHANGE (LITTLE THINGS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE)" href="http://www.amazon.com/SMALL-CHANGE-LITTLE-THINGS-DIFFERENCE/dp/1567318037%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1567318037" rel="amazon">small change</a> now can mean big changes in the future, consider what is most important to your life and live accordingly.</div>

<p>These incredible posters were created by the student organization at Ohio University called <em>Students Teaching Against Racism</em> (STARS).  Amazingly, these posters became popular over Tumblr on their president&#8217;s blog site (<a href="http://saucy-sarah.tumblr.com/page/2" target="_blank">here</a>). Their mission is &#8220;to educate and facilitate discussion about racism and to promote racial harmony and to create a safe, non-threatening environment to allow participants to feel comfortable to express their feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a statement about the posters from the organization:</p>
<p>Any questions about the posters can be sent to <a title="mailto:ohioustars@gmail.com" href="mailto:ohioustars@gmail.com" target="_blank">OHIOUSTARS@gmail.com</a>. We are so proud of all the support but it’s overwhelming; we have less than 10 members in our group. We ask that you <strong>do not</strong> personally email any of the exec’s or message their personal Tumblrs. <strong>Thank you guys so much for the love!</strong> The purpose was to educate and create dialogue and it did. We have a meeting with a lawyer on Monday so we can protect our posters, and the posters will be all over Ohio University’s campus this week! Again, thanks for the support and have a happy Halloween!</p>
<p>&#8212; <em>Executive Board of STARS from Ohio University</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks STARS for sending out this important, truthful message.</p>
<p>These posters act as a public service announcement for colored communities. It&#8217;s about respect, human dignity, and the acceptance of other cultures (these posters simply ask people to <em>think</em> before they choose their Halloween costume). Although some Halloween costumes aren&#8217;t as racist as the blackface minstrel shows back in the day, they harken to similar prejudices. What these costumes have in common is that they make caricatures out of cultures, and that is simply not okay.</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a brief update:</em></p>
<p><em></em>1.) I had to disable comments for this blog post since there are some rude, racist people out there.</p>
<p>And 2.) Interestingly, I received over 3,000 views on this blog post alone.</p>
<p>I had no idea I would get this many views on my blog because I wanted to share an important message created by STARS. I&#8217;ve been thinking all night why this message was such a firecracker, and I think I may have an answer. On HIMYM, Barney jokingly said that Halloween was the day where women could bring out their inner sluts. All jokes aside, Halloween is also the day where people can bring out their inner whatever, and their inner racism is an unfortunate thing that comes out on Halloween. I&#8217;ve received a lot of racist and hateful comments on my blog post because of these important posters. Some people say the posters are trivial, petty, contrived, and stupid. Another person said, &#8220;Fuck you . . . grown up asshole.&#8221; I can only assume they meant, &#8220;grow up asshole,&#8221; but the Freudian slip is a little too funny. These messages are for grown ups who care when people cross the line between costumes that are similar to blackface minstrel shows and costumes that are just for fun. Another person brought up the scenario of a sad Caucasian person holding up a picture of a cowboy. There&#8217;s a difference between cowboy costumes and, say, slutty geisha costumes. Cowboys are viewed reverently in American society while geishas are viewed as the Japanese high-class version of prostitutes, which isn&#8217;t necessarily correct. When people let these images slide, there&#8217;s a perpetual and incorrect prejudice that becomes permeated in American society. It is simply not okay for people to compartmentalize colored communities. This is why I wanted to share these posters on my blog; they have something important to say that strikes a difficult string in people. What amazes me more about these posters is the kind of negative responses I received from people. These posters only send out a message of, &#8220;It&#8217;s not okay to compartmentalize my culture,&#8221; and people respond with hate and anger. I don&#8217;t know why so much people responded that way, but I realize now when imperative messages about human dignity and respect get out, people get angry.</p>
<p><em>Another update: </em>3.) This blog post has now reached +8,000 views.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who understands this important message. Again, <strong>a big thank you</strong> to STARS at Ohio University for this very important campaign. Also, read this newspaper article by Kristine Bui at Arizona University. She gives an important point on why certain Halloween costumes are so disturbing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Finally. The “we’re not a costume” campaign may be timed for Halloween, but it’s a reaction to an attitude that’s accepted every day as normal.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It’s hard to explain exactly what is so wrong about being a geisha or a sheik for Halloween. It’s unsettling. It’s a feeling I’ve always struggled to articulate — a discomfort that sort of just sits in the place between your heart and your stomach, quietly nagging. It’s a sense of being wronged without knowing exactly what was done to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">People who think racism is dead think so because they don’t see active discrimination. They think, “But minorities are allowed to do everything I’m allowed to do, so where’s the harm?” STARS’ poster campaign calls attention to another problem: Minorities are often made into caricatures.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And that’s why Ohio University’s Students Teaching About Racism in Society exists. STARS aims to “educate and facilitate discussion about racism and to promote racial harmony and to create a safe, non-threatening environment to allow participants to feel comfortable to express their feelings.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">STARS exists because racism is only playing dead. It manifests itself not in slurs and exclusion, but in stupid jokes and really inaccurate costumes. As a minority, you’re a character, not a person. People dress up as you on Halloween. On TV, you’re the token black guy, easily replaced by some other black guy after one season.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Racism is so much stealthier now. It doesn’t announce itself, and it’s complicated.</p>

<p><em>Last update</em>:</p>
<p>4.) Thanks to many media outlets, like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/24/racist-halloween-costumes_n_1029669.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://jezebel.com/5852894/students-campaign-against-racist-halloween-costumes" target="_blank">Jezebel</a>, <a href="http://clutchmagonline.com/2011/10/student-campaign-targets-halloween-racism/" target="_blank">Clutch Magazine</a>, and others, this blog post has reached over 7<em>0,000 views and counting </em>(this is probably the most views this blog will ever have in its lifetime, to be honest). <em>Thanks to those who support this poster campaign!</em> And to those who &#8220;still don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; let me say this:</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with the Mexican guy and his donkey? What&#8217;s wrong with the slutty geisha? What&#8217;s wrong with the idiotic Native American and terrorist, and lastly, what&#8217;s wrong with being Lil Wayne? All of these are caricatures of a culture. And unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there who label us, minorities, colored people, black, brown peoples, by these caricatures. There was once an older guy in the South (a coworker) who kept telling me to introduce him to my &#8220;Filipino girl friends&#8221; because he liked how we were &#8220;submissive, naive, and pretty.&#8221; And yes, he really did call me those things, compared me to a geisha, and almost cornered me in our marketing booth. It was scary and it was wrong of him to label me that way, and honestly, if I didn&#8217;t get out of our marketing booth in the nick of time he might have hurt me. Right after that incident, I quit my job and found a new one. It&#8217;s hard to be a LA girl stuck in the middle of the South. People label you, and it isn&#8217;t cool.</p>
<p>Lastly, here&#8217;s one of the best comments I&#8217;ve seen in response to those who say, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a joke, and it&#8217;s fun.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>This group of students is working to discourage racism. Specifically they are discouraging the promotion of stereotypes of groups that are typically marginalized and oppressed. There is a link between these negative stereotypes and racism.</p>
<p>Also, these images are offensive to many and people hurt when they see it. So why is wearing such costumes the idea of fun to you?</p></blockquote>
<p>This poster campaign isn&#8217;t about being overly sensitive to costume choices, it&#8217;s about perpetuati­ng prejudices and negative stereotype­s through these choices. All we&#8217;re asking people is to stop perpetuating those prejudices and to realize that you&#8217;re crossing a line when you strap fake bombs to your chest to portray a Middle Eastern man or if you paint your face black.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who subscribed to my personal blog too. I find this blogging phenomenon very strange and peculiar (I really don&#8217;t get why Jezebel used my personal blog as source, but I still love that magazine to death). But, as long as this important message gets out there and changes people&#8217;s mind about things, I&#8217;m a happy camper.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2919" title="IMG_2036" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2036.jpg?w=488&#038;h=366" alt="" width="488" height="366" /></p>
<p>Remember how awesome Halloween was in elementary school? Everyone got to dress up and wear their costumes to school, which was basically the coolest thing ever. We couldn&#8217;t wait to show off our awesome costumes to all our friends. There was a little parade where we proudly strutted around the school, flaunting our festive costumes like models in a fashion show (your costume was always way better than anyone else&#8217;s). My favorite part was the little classroom party, which always meant food. Those PTA moms would bring in cupcakes, cookies, and all kinds of fun Halloween treats. We kids feasted like pigs. I especially enjoyed these days because my mom was one of those moms who brought treats in. Her Halloween specialty was <strong>Popcorn Hands</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2926" title="IMG_2049-1" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2049-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=384" alt="" width="300" height="384" /></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, these scary treats have been creeping in around Halloween time. My sister and I both brought them into class parties and they were always the star of the show. My mother got pretty good at making them over the years, and she taught me how to make them too. It&#8217;s a tradition I never grew out of. I still made these for Halloween parties in high school. <strong>They&#8217;re always a hit</strong>. Adults and kids alike love &#8216;em. The best part is they&#8217;re really <strong>easy</strong> to make.</p>
<p>I guarantee these buttery hands will make all the ghouls and goblins at your Halloween party smile. They&#8217;re<strong> festive, slightly creepy, and ideal for party snacking!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Few Tips Before You Get Cooking:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2923" title="IMG_2028" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2028.jpg?w=427&#038;h=305" alt="" width="427" height="305" /></p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>gloves</strong> you use for this are not latex; they are a clear, thin plastic. They can be very<strong> tricky to find</strong>, but I&#8217;ve heard you can get them at <strong>Walmart,</strong> and you can always order them <strong>online</strong>. My advice is to<strong> stock up</strong> when you do find them. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always done. That way, when next Halloween rolls around, I know I&#8217;ve got them on hand!</li>
<li>You could make these in bulk to hand out to trick-or-treaters. It&#8217;d be a welcome change from the typical candy!</li>
<li>The best part about receiving these tasty hands is that, when you&#8217;re done eating, you&#8217;re left with a little <strong>souvenir</strong>: the spider ring. It&#8217;s like the prize at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box!</li>
<li>Make sure you let the popcorn cool completely before stuffing the gloves.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Popcorn Hands</span></p>
<p><em>by The Smart Cookie Cook</em></p>
<p>Makes 6 hands (feel free to double, triple, etc. as necessary)</p>
<ul>
<li>4 bags of microwave popcorn, popped</li>
<li>6 clear plastic gloves (not latex)</li>
<li>30 pieces of candy corn</li>
<li>6 plastic spider rings</li>
<li>6 twistie ties</li>
<li>decorative ribbon</li>
<li>sharp, thin knife</li>
</ul>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the knife to poke small holes in the ends of each fingertip in the gloves. It should be big enough to fit the point of the candy corn through it, but small enough to hold it in place.<a href="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2025.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2929" title="IMG_2025" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2025.jpg?w=240&#038;h=300" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a></li>
<li>Poke a piece of candy corn through each hole, creating a &#8220;fingernail&#8221; for each finger.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2930" title="IMG_2026" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2026.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></li>
<li>Fill each glove with popcorn. Work the popcorn down into each finger of the glove. You may have to break the pieces in order to to substantially fill the glove.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2931" title="IMG_2039" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2039.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>
<li>Tie the end of each glove with a twistie tie. Add ribbon for decoration, if desired. Attach a spider ring to the ring finger of each hand.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2927" title="IMG_2030" src="http://thesmartcookiecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_2030.jpg?w=488&#038;h=366" alt="" width="488" height="366" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I did something shocking, socially unacceptable and so counter-cultural, it&#8217;s downright rebellious: I was still. To be specific, I put my feet up on the porch rail, leaned back in a deep chair, and sat in the afternoon sunshine for a while, accomplishing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://undertheapricottree.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_1094.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-279" title="IMG_1094" src="http://undertheapricottree.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_1094.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Not exactly the picture of a revolutionary, is it? I know, but if you look a bit deeper, you might recognize that one action as essentially giving the finger to a powerful and ruthless dictator: the dogma that my busyness reflects my value.</p>
<p>Does the idea of sitting quietly, alone with your thoughts for a while make you sigh wistfully or squirm uncomfortably? Probably a mixture of both.</p>
<p>In my experience as a modern woman, we simultaneously long for and fear the idea of stillness. We tend to pride ourselves on how much we accomplish in a day, and so stepping away from productivity is a risk, as though we must prove the worth of our existence by never slowing down to pause. And yet, we long for peace and rest, to step off the treadmill of life occasionally and catch our breath. And so we allow ourselves an occasional &#8220;indulgence&#8221; in a piece of Dove Chocolate or an extra creamy Yoplait yogurt because their advertising gurus convinced us that it&#8217;s okay, you deserve it. And we&#8217;ll take our  annual vacation, hoping to cram in all the R&amp;R we&#8217;ve denied ourselves all year. But even those &#8220;treats&#8221; are usually accompanied by guilt, shame, and pressure to &#8220;maximize&#8221; the time.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s another reason we don&#8217;t have time for stillness: I believe we avoid it because we are afraid of what we would find there. If I slowed down enough to <em>really listen</em> (to my spirit, my body, my mind), I might not like what it tells me. Or if I sat down to listen for the voice of God and sit with Him in the vulnerability of who I really am, what might He say to me? And so it is safer to fill my schedule with more work, more Facebook time, more music, more accomplishments than to slow down and be still.</p>
<p>But what if we weren&#8217;t meant to &#8220;make the most&#8221; of every day? To fit in the most activities, run the fastest and most efficient household, grow our business as big as possible, get the best we can afford, and achieve our utmost potential in every realm? Maybe doing more, faster won&#8217;t actually get us where we want to be&#8230;or where we need to be.</p>
<p>I am coming to believe that, if we want to truly <em>live</em> life, creating space for stillness is crucial. In spite of&#8211;and because of&#8211;all the pressures on our time, we have a built-in need for periods of quiet, rest and reflection. Although this may seem like just one more thing to fit in, I believe that if we will find a way to <em>make space for stillness and reflection</em>, it will reshape our lives. Just as the human body needs to inhale and exhale, we need times of work and times of rest, times to act and times to reflect. There is no shame in that. Many cultures have retained this rhythm in life, but looking at myself and around at our society, we seem to have forgotten the value in rest and reflection, condemning them instead as laziness, self-indulgence or worthless &#8220;navel gazing&#8221;. And I think we&#8217;re suffering for it. We don&#8217;t know how to just be with ourselves. And how can we offer much to others and this world if we aren&#8217;t even connected to our own selves?</p>
<p>So what are some ways we can reclaim stillness and rest in the midst of real life this week? It will look differently for everyone, and remember that it&#8217;s not about &#8220;what you do&#8221; but opening the posture of your heart and mind. In the stillness, you may find your mind racing to process thoughts that you haven&#8217;t been able to give your attention to, and that&#8217;s fine. Or you might want to acknowledge what you&#8217;ve been feeling lately and just sit honestly in that. Don&#8217;t try to solve every problem or reach a great conclusion during this time. If you aren&#8217;t sure what to think about and you want to connect to God, I encourage you to meditate on a favorite song or scripture that brings you peace and to rest in the knowledge that you are a beloved child of God (even if you don&#8217;t feel that you are).  Here are a few ideas I&#8217;ve been implementing lately, during my experiment in living more slowly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit or lie in a comfortable space for a while; even if you only have 5 or 15 minutes to spare, set a timer and enjoy simply being there.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re waiting in line at the bank, store, or on the phone, reclaim that time as an opportunity to be still in your heart.</li>
<li>While at your job, work hard and focused for an extended period and then step away from your computer for a few minutes (such as 55 minutes on, 5 minutes off); studies have shown this actually increases productivity and decreases overuse injuries such as eye strain, back and neck pain, etc. If you can walk a lap around the building outside or go look out a window for a few minutes, you may find yourself rejuvenated and ready for the next big push.</li>
<li>Eat sitting down at a table; turn off your technology and taste your food; be aware of it pleasing your taste buds and nourishing your body.</li>
<li>Take a walk or jog outside and observe your surroundings; leave the iPod at home and listen; what do you see, smell, or feel?</li>
<li>Leave your car radio off on your next drive; is the silence uncomfortable for you? That&#8217;s okay; don&#8217;t try to fill it.</li>
<li>Do something the slow way; it&#8217;s far more convenient to buy bread from a store, but sometimes I like to take a few hours to bake a loaf of bread, kneading it by hand, letting it fill our house with its scent, and then eating it while still warm from the oven. Whether it&#8217;s baking bread, washing dishes by hand, or driving the scenic route, allow yourself to choose the slow way sometimes if it is more enjoyable and meditative for you.</li>
<li>Spend time just being with your child or pet. Ponder the simple wonder of a little one, pet your dog or cat for a few minutes, take a nap with your child. If you don&#8217;t have a chld or pet at home, observe the birds outside your window. The little ones have much to teach us.</li>
<li>Find healthy boundaries for &#8220;screen time&#8221;. I&#8217;ve found that if I&#8217;m still on my computer after 9pm, I go to bed later and grumpier than usual. So I try to shut down by 9 and spend the remainder of the evening in a more relaxing way. However that applies for you, pay attention to your patterns and find something that leaves you feeling more rested and centered.</li>
<li>Observe Sabbath. Dedicating one day a week to step back from your work really flies in the face of our &#8220;non-stop&#8221; culture. Though we don&#8217;t do this every week, Seth and I try to accomplish our errands and household chores on Saturdays so that we can have a day of rest together on Sunday. It takes some coordinating, but has always felt like an incredible gift when we actually have a full day for rest and reflection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I offer these up as ideas. But I&#8217;d love to hear from you:</p>
<p><strong>What helps you to be still and what have you found to be the biggest challenges in creating that space for yourself?</strong></p>
