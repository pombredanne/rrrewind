			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I understand where Elbow is coming from? Easy. Because what you see below these lines will drive me to do everything but write. I will clean my house. I will walk my brother&#8217;s dog. I will catch up with friends that moved away long ago. I will rearrange my furniture. Anything but write. And in reality, it&#8217;s not the blank page that&#8217;s driving me to do so. It&#8217;s the people that will see this page in all of it&#8217;s printed glory (or horror) when it&#8217;s all said and done.</p>

<p>Peter Elbow begins “Closing My Eyes as I Speak: An Argument for Ignoring Audience” by outlining the ways in which considering audience from the very beginning of the writing process can, in fact, inhibit audience. Essentially, Elbow outlined the way I’ve approached creative writing so far this semester. Given an exercise in class, knowing that I will not <em>have</em> to read what comes out, I can write pages and pages. Sitting in front of the computer, determined to get to work on my story idea, the blank page reminds me that this is a <em>graduate</em> writing class, that there are people (besides the professor) who have been published, that some of them are second years, and some of them are Ph. D. students. My resolve to write crumbles because it does make me nervous for them to read my work. Elbow has a point.</p>
<p>As a teacher of freshman composition, I think we will have to face this hurdle. Students think they have nothing to write about or are so concerned about mechanics that every sentence they produce is subsequently deleted because it’s not perfect. Elbow outlines what I think is a useful approach to thinking about audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when. An audience is a field of force. The closer we come—the more we think about these readers—the stronger the pull they exert on the contents of our minds. The practical question, then, is always whether a particular audience function as a helpful field of force or one that confuses or inhibits us. (336)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ignoring audience, for a time, can lead to better writing. Uninhibited writing is, as Elbow says, often the strongest. While I have no doubt that some students will find audience helpful, I find Elbow intriguing because a writer is not at fault for not appreciating the ominous presence of a vague audience. He even says, “What most readers value in really excellent writing is not prose that is right for readers but prose that is right for thinking, right for language or right for the subject being written about” (339). We want our students to be thoughtful writers first.</p>
<p>The challenge becomes, then, to figure out when and how an audience fits into the teaching of composition. It would be unfair to begin with audience does not matter and then later say that it does. It would also be unfair to ask them to create an audience, because that makes “audience” vast and vague, which is not useful. The best advice I received in undergrad was to “make [my paper] relevant.” I was not asked to think about the teacher, or the masses that will not ever <em>actually</em> read my paper. I was asked to make a point. In a way, it made the world my audience, but at the same time,  it removed the personal element of audience for me. I was writing about Joseph Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em>. My paper focused on the antithetical rivers. In the conference, my professor read my draft, set it down, turned toward me with folded hands and said “so what?” <em>So what?</em> I thought. <em>So what! I made a pretty awesome connection is what!</em> In thinking about it later though, I did find a “so what” that challenged the reader to consider why this little book that is one hundred years old can still be useful. The impersonal audience approach worked for me, and I think that is what Elbow is getting at, but like I said, the challenge is how. How do we find the balance of audience relevancy in the classroom?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we get ready to start our blogging journey, we decided to host a special event in our classroom. We invited my last year group to share their <a title="Jumping into a Blogging Adventure with My Students" href="http://gret.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/bloggingadventure/" target="_blank">blogging adventure</a> with us. What would be more motivating for my students than to learn about blogging and commenting from other kids?</p>
<p>It was amazing to see how engaged in the conversation every kid was. It was powerful to see how everyone wanted to participate either to ask questions or to answer them. There were no shy kids, no quiet kids. Everyone had something to say or ask. Blogging is meaningful not just for my former students but also for my group, which is surprising since they haven&#8217;t even started to blog!<br />
Since, I can’t share the video, I carefully picked some of the things they said, which show how much blogging means to them and how important it is for our kids to learn things which they are really passionate about.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was awesome. I wrote stories and <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/milir/our-vacation-in-punta-del-este/">Marcos, my uncle who lives in Spain</a>, read them and left comments for me!</em>&#8220;<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/MiliR/"> MiliR</a> said proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>People READ our blog. Greta read our blog too, but we got comments from all over the world,</em>&#8221; said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Alex189/">Alex</a> &#8211; &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t forget,<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/our-blogging-buddies/"> the map</a>!</em>, interrupted <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Tody/">Tody</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Oh yes! We had <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/our-blogging-buddies/">a map</a> and we marked all the places we got comments from. It was full of colorful marks</em>&#8220;, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Marti/">Marti</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I loved to write on the blog. I got comments from all over the world. We are famous now</em>&#8220;, exclaimed <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>Then one of my students raised his hand and asked, &#8220;<em>What did the blog mean to you?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was the best, I blogged all the time, when I was happy, sick, bored&#8230; all the time!</em>&#8220;, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The blog was amazing. We learned and had a lot of fun</em>&#8220;, expressed<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/MiliR/"> MiliR</a>.</p>
<p>Just then, another boy inquired: &#8220;<em>Where did you get your ideas to write?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I wrote stories. I wrote adventure stories</em>&#8220;, shared <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Marti/">Marti</a>. &#8220;<em>Yes, she also <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/marti/i-will-tell-you-a-story/">drew a map</a> on her story</em>&#8220;, added <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>, looking proudly at her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I blogged about everything I like: my friends, my pet, my thoughts. I even blogged when I was sick and couldn&#8217;t come to school</em>&#8220;, mentioned <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Vickucha/">Vickucha</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I blogged about <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/pipita/rugby-is-my-passion/">my passion: rugby</a>,</em>&#8221; voiced<a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Pipita/"> Pipita</a>.</p>
<p>“<em>I <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/ber/my-new-song/">wrote a song</a> and then sang it in our <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/vickucha/singing-fridays/">Singing Fridays</a>!</em>”, <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Ber/">Ber</a> said joyfully.</p>
<p>“<em>I sometimes didn’t know what to write, but I read my friends’ posts and left them comments</em>”, said <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Lalo2/">Lalo</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I wrote about <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/alex189/argentina-2/">our country</a> and things that were important to me</em>,&#8221; expressed <a href="http://kidblog.org/ourgoodnews/author/Alex189/">Alex</a>.</p>
<p>I was totally speechless&#8230; I just let them lead and do the talking. I savored each and every minute. It has been one of my most inspiring moments as a teacher. Kids teaching kids. Kids encouraging kids to blog. It absolutely blew my mind.</p>
<p>What the kids said speaks for itself. These are my former students’ voices. Seeing them laugh and share proudly their work was priceless. Seeing my students’ beam as they heard the older kids advice and experience was incredible. Needless to say, my students can&#8217;t wait to start blogging and to be honest, neither can I.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jenaussieadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/6127321.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1118" title="_6127321" src="http://jenaussieadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/6127321.jpg?w=145&#038;h=150" alt="" width="145" height="150" /></a>I love a good faux pas&#8230;.especially when the person committing the faux pas is absolutely clueless (me!).  Have you ever double-dipped a chip in dip at a party?  Reached for the green can of aerosol that you thought was hair spray, but discovered in humid weather that you sprayed your permed head with Lysol instead?  Had the back of your skirt unknowingly tucked into your zebra print underwear as you strutted across the campus grounds?  Well, it appears that I am guilty of committing a fashion faux pas, like those previously mentioned (which I may or may not have committed), in the lovely land of OZ.</p>
<p>Ellie and I had dinner with our neighbors a few nights ago and I noticed that my neighbor was cooking dinner in her UGG boots.  I made a comment about wearing my UGG boots ALL the time, just love them&#8230;.yada, yada, yada&#8230;.and she responded with the following comment, &#8220;You know Australians don&#8217;t actually wear UGG boots out in public, right?&#8221; Me, &#8220;Um, no!&#8221;  She added that most Australians (the trendy ones, I guess?) wear them strictly as house slippers.  &#8221;Are you &lt;*^&amp;$@#bleeping&gt; kidding me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course I had to ask a few more Aussie friends about this and they all concurred with my neighbor&#8217;s persuasive fashion declaration.  So, it seems that I have been prancing about this major metropolitan city in my house slippers.  Yes, sir, I&#8217;ve got black, brown, grey, high, short, cable-knit, fur in, fur out&#8230;.that&#8217;s how we shout!!  I&#8217;m from Indiana, for Pete&#8217;s Sake!! Cold winters and comfort = UGG boots.  And they are not considered house slippers in Indiana.  There is no way that my fellow Hoosiers would spend that much money on shoes that never left the house.</p>
<p>Crickey!  Are you faux real?  How many places have I been while wearing them?  I can&#8217;t even recall if I&#8217;ve seen others wearing them in public.  Do people think I&#8217;m nuts?  Using up my day pass from the Happy Hills Retreat for Social Misfits?  They are sold EVERYWHERE here.  Malls, street corners, high-end boutiques, near the sheep exhibit at the zoo.</p>
<p>There are real and &#8220;fake&#8221; versions, which you can apparently distinguish from the label stitched on the back of the boot.  I&#8217;ve seen the real UGG boots, &#8220;Made in Australia&#8221; and several knockoffs too, like EMU, MUGG, and PETA Approved.  Oh&#8230;.and guess what.  The UGG boots sold and worn in Australia aren&#8217;t made in Australia.  And neither are the UGG boots sold in America, where you can wear them in public without being the subject of someone&#8217;s jokes at happy hour. They&#8217;re all made in China.</p>
<p>How exciting.  Similar to America, perhaps UGG boots can be worn whenever and wherever in China. UGH&#8230;&#8230;.I wish I could&#8230;&#8230;(I think I will anyway!).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a day of absolute perfection in October of 2010.  The boys and I were in full on Halloween preparation mode, and the day around us was all changing colors and dreamy temperatures.  In fact, the weather was so beautiful that I decided it would be a crime to carve our pumpkins indoors.  We took a big white sheet and all the carving tools out to the lawn and had a blast.  Liam danced in the sun.  I let go of my knife phobia and allowed Jack to cut on his own pumpkins for the very first time while I breathed down his neck and kept 911 predialed on the phone.  It was one of those parenting days that makes you feel like you&#8217;re so good at it you&#8217;ve done the world a huge disservice by not having hundreds of children.  After the carving, we hauled the pumpkins up to the front walk for display and photos:</p>
<div id="attachment_807" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pumpkins-liam2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-807" title="pumpkins-liam2" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pumpkins-liam2.jpg?w=400&#038;h=319" alt="" width="400" height="319" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Liam on Lid Control</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pumpkins-liam2.jpg"><br />
</a>As an added bonus that day, we reserved enough pumpkin seeds for weeks of snacking.  When we came in the house, I roasted them with salt.  Mmmm, it was a delicious fall.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We missed one of those seeds.  Or twelve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-1rev.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798" title="patch-1rev" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-1rev.jpg?w=828&#038;h=384" alt="" width="828" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yep, right there in the spot where Liam was so sweetly admiring last year&#8217;s Jack-O-Lanterns, we now have another* raging eyesore.  You see the 50 or so feet of vine up front, yes?  You&#8217;ll also note the brownish structure behind the patch.  This is a bush shaped weed that my husband has been tending to for approximately 3 years.  He feels as though it is the resurrected soul of the actual bush that used to grow there before he killed it, and everyone knows you don&#8217;t screw with zombie plants.  Speaking of things you don&#8217;t screw with, everyone also knows you don&#8217;t mess with a four year old who has figured out that there is a pumpkin patch in his front lawn.  This hot mess happened (literally) overnight, and because I am super, super dumb I uttered the words, &#8220;I think those are pumpkins&#8221; in his presence.  So if you&#8217;re asking yourself why I didn&#8217;t just tear them out when they emerged, I didn&#8217;t do that because he knows where I sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Currently our patch is on pace to yield about 2 dozen pumpkins.  Not kidding.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">*More on this as the post continues</p>
<div id="attachment_799" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 598px"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-baby-1dec.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-799" title="patch-baby-1dec" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-baby-1dec.jpg?w=588&#038;h=440" alt="" width="588" height="440" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Like humans, they&#039;re awfully cute when they&#039;re babies</p></div>
<div id="attachment_797" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 616px"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-ugly-1dec.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-797         " title="patch-ugly-1dec" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-ugly-1dec.jpg?w=606&#038;h=513" alt="" width="606" height="513" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I desperately hope that this guy stays this unfortunate looking, because if it does this nerdy pimple pumpkin is mine</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">So in the interest of full disclosure, there are additional reasons for me to be so mellow about hundreds of feet of prickly vines that double in size approximately every two days taking over my front yard.  A) Ordering a pizza is just going to get more awesome, and B) Our lawn is already the Museum of Landscaping Don&#8217;ts.  Our neighbors <span style="text-decoration:underline;">love</span> us.  To wit:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-bush2-1dec.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800" title="patch-bush2-1dec" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-bush2-1dec.jpg?w=588&#038;h=502" alt="" width="588" height="502" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Twelve year olds have things to do.  Much better things, I might add, then serving as <del>slave labor</del> helpers with the yard work.  To get to those things, they might even rush through assigned tasks as quickly as possible.  It&#8217;s also a possibility that instead of the word &#8220;trim&#8221;  they will hear the word &#8220;remove&#8221;.  Jack does not have a future as a cosmetologist, and clearly any sort of horticulture work is out as well.  Duly noted.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-tree-1dec.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" title="patch-tree-1dec" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-tree-1dec.jpg?w=588&#038;h=785" alt="" width="588" height="785" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is one of our dead maple trees.  We store all of our poison ivy on this one, which is fabulous for keeping perverts away.  It&#8217;s a very hardy &amp; lush supply, and I plan to sew it into boxer briefs and sell it on Etsy as underwear for ex-boyfriends.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-pile-1dec.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801" title="patch-pile-1dec" src="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-pile-1dec.jpg?w=588&#038;h=757" alt="" width="588" height="757" /></a><a href="http://frecklesandfickle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/patch-pile-1dec.jpg"><br />
</a>We&#8217;ve tried to chop this thing down three times.  At this point it is evident that only fire or witchcraft will make it go away, so I give up.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;but now that I think about it, it may be a perfect location for next year&#8217;s pumpkin patch.  But only if the front yard is full.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://joebeckerphoto.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/mountain-blues-2/110826_olympics_025826/" rel="attachment wp-att-782"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" title="110826_olympics_025826" src="http://joebeckerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/110826_olympics_025826.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Mountain blues? Well, lots blue sky maybe. In fact, the only thing to be blue about was the lack of clouds (ever notice how photographers are never happy with the weather &#8211; believe me, Tanya has noticed [and has told me so]). So I saw lots of blue. But how about purples, yellows and reds? I saw them too during the three days I spent on Blue Mountain in Olympic National Park over last weekend.</p>
<p>The trip was an official Mountaineers photography outing, lead by my friend and most excellent photographer <a href="http://johnwoods.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">John Woods</a>. We camped at campground at Deer Park and had great views of the Olympic Mountains without leaving our picnic table. But we did leave the picnic table, to travel the short distance the rest the way up Blue Mountain for sunset and sunrise shots.</p>
<p>Blue Mountain is 6,007 feet high, which may not sound like much, but because its summit is only less than 12 miles from sea level, it seems like it is way up there. It is one of the highest places you can drive to in Washington State (the parking lot is about 170 feet below the summit). The view is incredible &#8211; look to the north and see the Straits of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island, the San Juan Islands,  the Canadian Cascades, Port Angeles, Sequim, and Victoria, British Columbia; look to the east and see Whidbey Island, Puget Sound, Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, and the North Cascades; and look to the south and west see the Olympic Mountains.</p>
<p>But there was much more to photograph than the view from Blue Mountain. There were lots of wildflowers and animal life (they don&#8217;t call it Deer Park for nothing). And there were hikes to take. It was a great weekend &#8211; definitely nothing to be blue about.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was nice to find the following words on the front page of an article in the August Edition of China&#8217;s Voyage Magazine. This marks my third major publication.</p>
<p>Author / Russ   Taylor   high Xiaotao   |   Photography / Russ   Taylor     Ren Jianjun</p>
<p><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/snapshot-2011-08-27-17-22-1112.jpg">撰文／Russ Taylor 高晓涛 | 摄影／Russ Taylor  任建军</a></p>
<p><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/snapshot-2011-08-27-17-22-1113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-720" title="Snapshot 2011-08-27 17-22-11" src="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/snapshot-2011-08-27-17-22-1113.jpg?w=300&#038;h=191" alt="" width="300" height="191" /></a></p>
<p>I have to admit that I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how this was all going to work out when Daisy Huang contacted me about using some of my photographs in an article and then asked me to contribute to the writing of the article. I agreed each step of the way but in the back of my mind I wondered if sending high resolution images through the internet to China would actually result in greenbacks in my hand. We haggled over the number of words written and what would be paid for them. There is indeed a difference in the number of written words in English versus the number of characters in Chinese.</p>
<p>At one point I decided I&#8217;d call the cell phone number that Daisy had given me, just to be sure this was all real. I was greeted by a most pleasant voice that reminded me that it was past one o&#8217;clock in the morning in Beijing. After a short talk and an apology for the inopportune hour at which I&#8217;d called I breathed a sigh of relief. &#8220;She&#8217;s real, and this article is actually going to happen.&#8221; Daisy must have said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&#8221; to me several times throughout this whole process. In the end it all worked out just like you&#8217;d hope it would.</p>
<p>Working with Daisy Huang has been a real pleasure and I can now add Voyage Magazine to <a href="http://www.theadirondackreview.com/fall2010.html">The Adirondack Review</a> and <a href="http://glimpse.org/">Glimpse Magazine</a> as magazines in which I&#8217;ve been published.</p>
<p>The English translation of the article follows along with an image or two used in the magazine, plus one or two that weren&#8217;t, which I&#8217;ve added to this version.  Some of the phrases were written knowing that they&#8217;d be translated into Chinese and not necessarily a phrase I&#8217;d keep in English.  So with that caveat let us begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The land is so barren and the passes so high that only the best friends or fiercest enemies would want to visit us</em>.&#8221;  &#8211; A Ladakhi Proverb</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to become a friend of Ladakh. Walking along the streets of the capital city of Leh, which sits at 11,500ft (3,505m), the visitor is greeted by the word, “Julley!” It’s a word you hear constantly as it means hello, goodbye, please and thank you. Learn the word Julley and you’re well on your way to making friends with this most hospitable mountain people.</p>
<p>Ladakh is a high desert nestled among the high mountains and valleys of the Himalaya and is surely one of the most beautiful places in all of Asia. Once an independent kingdom, Ladakh is today a part of India’s Jammu and Kashmir State. To the north lies the ancient kingdom of Baltistan in today’s Pakistan and to the east sits the ancient kingdom of Tibet, part of modern day China.</p>
<div id="attachment_719" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ladakhs-changtang.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-719" title="Ladakh's Changtang" src="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ladakhs-changtang.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ladakh&#039;s Changtang</p></div>
<p>The Tibetan plateau extends into Ladakh and is called the Changtang plateau. Here high lakes rest at altitudes of over 15,000ft, (4,572m) along which nomadic shepherds still tend to their sheep and goats and earn a living by selling pashmina wool to carpet makers in the city of Srinagar.</p>
<p>Semi-nomadic, several times a year the nomads drive their yak herds down from the mountains and load them with all of their belongings. In the darkness of morning, before even a hint of dawn, they begin their journey to new pastures where they stay for several months before moving again.</p>
<p>The Changtang plateau is filled with unexpected wildlife sightings, from the “kyang,” a wild ass, to the black-necked crane, which makes an annual migration to the shores of Tso Moriri Lake and Tso Kar Lake.  In the high places, if you are fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the Himalayan Condor.</p>
<p>As you wind down the roads from the Changtang you eventually meet the Indus River, one of the oldest rivers in the world. During the fall season the river is turquoise and tranquil, during the winter it is partially frozen and during the summer it is grey with glacial silt and rages enough to be enjoyed by white water rafting enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Following the Indus River Valley you find fields still plowed by yaks and dzos (a cross between a yak and a cow). Traditionally Ladakhis grew barley and traded barley and salt for other needs. Today they are growing a wider variety of vegetables, even using greenhouses to grow tomatoes and greens.</p>

<p>Along the Indus River Valley and built neatly onto the tops of hills are some of the oldest monasteries in the world. Ladakh is traditionally a Buddhist kingdom that has remained largely intact even with the intermingling of Islam from the western part of the state. The monasteries are best visited in the early morning when the monks hold a daily puja, or worship ceremony. Here the chill air inside the monastery is filled with the smell of incense and butter lamps. The monks chanting along with cymbals clashing can be almost hypnotic and somewhat haunting.</p>
<p>To reach the Nubra Valley in Ladakh most visitors will share a jeep that will churn its way up and around the barren desert mountains until reaching a pass called the Kardung La, which at over 18,380ft is reputed to be the world’s highest motorable road. While that itself is most memorable, you’ll bring back even more memories from the Nubra Valley where the visitor can ride the Bactrian Camels, the same kind of camels that were used for trade along the Silk Road in previous centuries.  The camel drivers will take you along the massive sand dunes, reminiscent of the days when the road led north to Yarkand.</p>
<div id="attachment_715" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ladakhs-nubra-valley.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-715" title="Ladakh's Nubra Valley" src="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ladakhs-nubra-valley.jpg?w=300&#038;h=201" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ladakh&#039;s Nubra Valley </p></div>
<p>Ladakh also has something to offer the mountaineer. Stok Kangri stands proudly at 20,123ft (6,123m) and offers views of the both the Himalayan and Karakoram Mountain Ranges. It is Asia’s most accessible peak and can be climbed in a four day round trip from just outside of the capital city of Leh. On a rare occasion the climber may run across the fabled snow leopard. This writer saw two snow leopards while on an ascent of Stok Kangri in 2004.</p>
<p>The most hearty of travelers will also make the time to visit the Zanskar Valley, one of the most remote and beautiful regions of Ladakh. While it can be reached by a two-day jeep ride from Leh to Padum via Kargil it is perhaps best reached on foot. Ladakh has many travel agencies that are willing to arrange treks complete with ponies to carry the heavy loads, pony men who set up your tent before you arrive at camp and who cook the most delicious of meals. Treks of various lengths can be arranged, and it’s a wonderful way to adapt to the pace of nature.</p>
<p>While the best times of the year to visit Ladakh are between early June and late September, Ladakh saves some of its best for the visitor who braves the harshest cold of a Ladakhi winter. During winter, nighttime temperatures can plummet to nearly -30 degrees (Celsius). It is then, between early January and mid-February that you can trek the frozen Zanskar River, traditionally called the Chadar, a journey that takes about two weeks round trip and follows ancient trade routes.</p>
<div id="attachment_717" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-frozen-zanskar-river-trek.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-717" title="The Chadar Trek" src="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-frozen-zanskar-river-trek.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Chadar Trek</p></div>
<p>On this trek you’ll be exploring a region that has been cut off from the outside world for over half the year and can be visited in winter only along the frozen Zanskar River. During the day the warm Himalayan sun helps remove the chill from your bones and holding many cups of Ladakhi tea will warm your hands, while the hospitality warms your heart.</p>
<div id="attachment_721" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/a-porter-on-the-frozen-river.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-721" title="A porter on the frozen river" src="http://nomadruss.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/a-porter-on-the-frozen-river.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Porter on the Chadar Trek</p></div>
<p>Whether you visit Ladakh for two days, two weeks, or two months you’ll find the finest of hospitality.  Visitors are welcomed into homes, served sweet tea and yak butter tea and with the word “Julley!” and an adventurous spirit you’ll leave Ladakh with enough memories to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Getting there:  There are two daily flights from Delhi to Leh by three airlines between May and October. Jet Airways, Air India and Kingsfisher Red all fly two daily flights during the summer months. During the winter Jet Airways and Air India continue almost daily flights. All flights are early morning flights and are pretty reliable, but due to mountain weather some flights may be canceled. When a flight is canceled the airlines are pretty good about putting you up in a hotel room for free.</p>
<p>There are also weekly flights by Air India from Srinagar to Leh (return) on Wednesdays and from Jammu to Leh (return) on Monday’s and Fridays.</p>
<p>Flying is definitely the best way to reach Leh. (I don&#8217;t necessarily believe this, but it seemed like the right thing to say to an upscale Chinese audience). The mountain roads are notoriously bumpy, the vehicles crowded, and you’re dealing with altitude. If you are planning to travel during the summer months it is important to book in advance, as tickets are expensive (US $139 &#8211; $335).</p>
<p>You won’t save that much money riding in a shared jeep, but if you prefer to travel overland you can do so by shared jeep from Manali (July – September) and from Srinagar (May to November). The road from Srinagar is much more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once you are in Leh and want to travel through Ladakh the main options are to travel by shared jeep or by bus. Those who are up for a little more adventure may want to rent a motorbike (about US $12 per day), usually a classic Royal Enfield Motorcycle. It’s a fun way to get around the countryside, but you do have to watch for large convoys of army vehicles.</p>
<p>Roads to Ladakh close during the winter months due to snow and flying from November through May is the only option.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There aren&#8217;t many ways to say it, so I&#8217;ll put it the only way I know how &#8211; Adele is everything. By now we&#8217;ve all heard her timeless line, &#8220;Sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead,&#8221; and if you&#8217;re anything like me, it finds you in probably one of the most compromising positions ever, something along the lines of being naked in the fetal position on the bathroom floor, clutching your phone in one hand and a bottle of vodka in the other, wondering how your life starting resembling a Lifetime Movie. Well, maybe that&#8217;s just me, but regardless, her lyrics are incredibly practical in ways that almost make me feel like she&#8217;s my badass version of a fairy godmother, telling me to get the fuck over it already and go make millions on my own, particularly man-free. Not to mention at 22, practically my age, she&#8217;s the most reasonable and insightful person I (like to pretend I) know. <a href="http://thissinglelife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/photo-56.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2347" title="Photo 56" src="http://thissinglelife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/photo-56.jpg?w=285&#038;h=336" alt="" width="285" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about this before,  but so often in love, we convince ourselves to fight for a love that doesn&#8217;t exist anymore, or just for the sake of fighting because movies like <em>The Notebook </em>and every ABC Family dramedy says we should, because that&#8217;s just how love works—you&#8217;re nice to each other, then you fight and say horrible things and then make up and bottle it all in until the littlest thing sets you off and you fight again. Right, Nicolas Sparks? Right, Sarah Dessen? Right, Emily Giffin? (I could go on for days&#8230;)</p>
<p>You fight because every story of &#8220;great love&#8221; in the past has told you to do so. And why wouldn&#8217;t you want to have a &#8220;great love,&#8221; worthy of Ryan Gosling? We forget that some loves are better than others, some are worth fighting for and some are the kind you should&#8217;ve walked away from a long time ago. Sometimes it&#8217;s love and sometimes it&#8217;s just a pain in the ass and sometimes they steal your financial identity, but alas, another story for another time.</p>
<p>The way I see it is pretty cut and dry, as simple as it gets—if you ever have to question whether you should be with someone or not, chances are you shouldn&#8217;t be with them. Relationships are supposed to make you a better person but the version of you spent fighting, constantly in battle mode, struggling to come out on top, is probably not the best version of yourself. (I say probably because there are just some people who were born to fight, and that goes without saying that they were born to win, I say this because I used to fancy myself one of them&#8230;especially when it came to love.) And furthermore, how could you ever still be in love with the person you&#8217;ve taken it upon yourself to shatter, as he&#8217;s laying in pieces all over the ground, what&#8217;s left to love if you&#8217;ve taken all the good out, beaten it to a pulp and eaten it for breakfast? In the last throes of fighting for love, the words cut deeper, the art of subtlety is lost and the guise of love is completely ridiculous. &#8220;I piss you off because I love you&#8221; may work for some, but in the real world, that excuse rarely ever works, believe me, I&#8217;ve tried it.</p>
<p>Fighting for love has created an industry for itself, landing the feature role in movies, literature, music and so much more. It&#8217;s fueled the fights of couples who know they are aren&#8217;t right for each other, who want a taste of what it&#8217;s like to feel any little emotion that comes their way, because their relationship lacked even an once of the key ingredient emotion of love that they promised to one another. Your first mistake? Love is not a promise. It&#8217;s an emotion.</p>
<p>When all else fails, I play it like Weezy, and when &#8220;love is in the air, I put on a gas mask.&#8221;</p>
