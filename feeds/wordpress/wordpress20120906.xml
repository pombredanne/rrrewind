				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple months ago, the woman corralling my hair into shape filled me in on her vacation excursions. She had been to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee several times because her husband wanted to go there. They were going again this year, and she asked me if I had been there. I replied that I had not, and she asked me where I wanted to go. I replied that I wanted to go to the desert. Once again, I demonstrated my uncanny ability to crush a conversation. The desert was definitely a foreign concept to the hairdresser and why anyone would want to go to one clearly perplexed her. I saw her mentally discard my reply and retreat to the safety of Dolly Parton&#8217;s virtual arms. To keep her from going all Edward Scissorhands on me, I willed the creases from my forehead, stationed my eyebrows at listening level, and switched on the &#8220;how interesting&#8221; light in my eyes as she fleshed out the ins, outs, ups and arounds of Dollywood.</p>
<p>The thought of going to the desert wouldn&#8217;t leave me. I dreamt of it. I could imagine its heat and dryness and unfettered, unending openness; I could envision the long blueness of its sky. I wanted to immerse myself in the independence of the place. I had to get there, to the West. Soon.</p>
<p>When I suggested to Mike that we take advantage of the long Labor Day weekend for travel, he was enthusiastic and suggested a trip to Old Town Salem, North Carolina, a couple hundred miles down the road. Not missing a beat and without adding modifiers, qualifiers, or softening language, and being absolutely, completely, and desperately selfish, I said I wanted to go to the <a title="Grand Canyon" href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm" target="_blank">Grand Canyon</a>, at the other side of the country. There was no hairdresser-esque reaction, but I&#8217;m reasonably sure Mike wasn&#8217;t expecting that reply. And bless him, he agreed without question, and without reservation. With one sentence, I was on my way to somewhere I viscerally needed to be.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon&#8217;s written guide asks how the visitor feels on first arriving at the rim &#8212; awed, overwhelmed, excited? My boss told me, more than once, to remember how I felt at first view. It seemed there might be a quiz on my return to the office.</p>
<p>Standing beside the Canyon, I felt almost nothing.</p>
<p>I wanted very much for that intense need I harbored for freedom, lightness, and no boundaries to be instantly gratified, to feel the shedding of a heavy weight at seeing the endless view before me, to spread my arms and utter a big &#8220;thank you!&#8221; of release. Instead, I felt guilty and frightened that I didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it,&#8221; and wondered if I just didn&#8217;t understand something, more about myself than the Canyon. So, I said wow, and maybe a couple other appropriate comments, and we began walking along the rim trail.</p>
<p>The rim trail is paved and offers view after view accessible to everyone. That is an excellent thing, that persons of all abilities can be this close to the edge of the Canyon, a chasm to which there is no lead in. One second there is ground, the next there is air. There&#8217;s no gradual descent, just an abrupt drop off. Most of the edge is quite readily available for anyone to teeter near, and that&#8217;s an excellent thing also. There are few forbidding handrails to restrain eager visitors nor signs at every turn yelping &#8220;DANGER!&#8221; There is an ostensible sense of personal responsibility to be assumed to avoid meeting a dramatic demise over the unforgiving cliff edge. We walked much of the paved trail section, admiring the canyon&#8217;s various features, with me awaiting the de rigueur &#8220;ah ha!&#8221; moment. Had we come so far for what I sought to not be there?</p>
<p>After a couple of miles of pleasant and uneventful walking beside this enormous ditch, we came to Bright Angel trail that leads into the Canyon. Early afternoon had arrived and I was hesitant to walk too far into the Canyon since we were not fully prepared for its difficulties at that time of day. I had also said that this trip was as much about seeing as it was about hiking; I wanted more to <em>see</em> the phenomenon that was the fabled Grand Canyon rather than engage in a grueling trek to its floor and back up. I have been a desk jockey of many years duration and I saw seasoned hikers coming off the trail panting and red-faced. I seriously doubted my hiking ability at this demanding location. But I could also see that Mike and I <em>needed</em> to be hiking <em>in</em> the Canyon, not strolling its rim as if it were a formal garden to be observed from the edge.</p>
<p>We returned the following day, prepared to hike the South Kaibab trail. This trail appeared steeper than Bright Angel and I approached it cautiously, wondering if I would be able to get myself back up after the descent. But as we walked along, down and down, in perfect weather in the passing company of hikers from around the world, only then did I receive the lessons of the Canyon; only then did the magnitude and eternity and spirituality of the place work its magic on my psyche. Walking the rim trail was like listening to a song played on the radio, while hiking into the Canyon itself was akin to being part of the crowd at an outdoor music festival singing along with a thousand new friends. And for once, I held myself in that moment, not thinking about yesterday or tomorrow, not rushing to the next turn in the trail, instead pausing to absorb every view for which I couldn&#8217;t seem to open my eyes wide enough to take in all the nuances, laying my hand flat against the vertical rock walls to feel the shock of their uncompromising strength and eternity and indifference to so short-lived a being as me. This place had been here long, long before me and would be there long after I&#8217;m not even a memory. There was a strange, inexplicable comfort in that realization.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon, an ancient and living thing unto itself, cared nothing for or about me, and forced me to surrender control and abide by its rules before it would allow me to have what I needed.  This was no soft and tender healing &#8212; this was alpha and omega and in-your-face uncompromising knowledge and acceptance that I was just one of many who have been and will be forgotten by this vast and marvelously beautiful gash in the earth. <em>This</em> was <em>my</em> &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment, and much, much more.</p>

<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-1-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-666" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-1-3.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Beautiful Halong Bay. Mesmerizing panoramas of limestone karsts often covered with lush green vegetation. Adding to this backdrop was the ever present fishermen who live on these waters. We were never completely alone.</p>
<p>The put-put of their engines was the first indicator.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-670" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-7.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>A single boat with Quonset hut and colorful flags passed by our junk oblivious to us watching.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-6.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>Oftentimes boats were rafted together. This was home for them and a way of life dating back generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-1-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-665" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-1-2.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>We notice a lone man in his boat tied to this grey ragged landscape collecting crustaceans. It is food for the table and to sell.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-3" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-3.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>A cultural and colorful highlight on this cruise aboard the <a title="Halong Bay" href="http://www.indochina-junk.com/?page_id=2014" target="_blank">Prince II</a> junk was visiting a floating village tucked along the jagged edge of karsts in a somewhat protected area from the winds. Consisting of 120 people, mostly families with children, they have been there since 1994 and encouraged by the government to fish these waters. They do so with nets as well as fish-farms. There are three other such floating villages scattered throughout Halong Bay and some quite large. Collectively, these fishermen supply seafood to all of Vietnam, particularly Hanoi. In addition, they are developing markets for farm-raised sea grasses, sea weed, and shrimp.</p>
<p>Houses were painted in cheerful colors and each appeared to have a resident watch dog. Roosters crowed.</p>
<p>Generators provide electricity for the floating village and fresh water is brought in from the mainland and stored in tanks.</p>
<p>We were taken to the community building to meet the village elder, his family and to have tea. The structure also serves as a school while efforts are being made to replace the one that was destroyed in a typhoon. The government provides a teacher, but he or she needs to be married, which reflects the cultural morays. Older children who wish to further their education often live on the mainland with a relative. Health care is provided sporadically and women go to the mainland to give birth.</p>
<p>Managing tourism is of importance. This village has a partnership with several junk touring companies. Only the smaller vessels can approach this particular floating village, which was a cultural bonus for us.  Instead of selling us trinkets or local crafts, we were taken on small boat excursions. There were four couples in our group and each couple was assigned to a row boat made from a woven reed basket.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-668" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-5" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-5.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Our rower was a 15 year old girl named Win who was shy and had such a lovely smile. By tipping these rowers we are told this is a “workable” situation for tourists and the village. I had to agree. These women worked hard at what they were doing.   An extra cultural treat for Ron and I was Duc, our guide, joined our little boat as well as the village chief’s son and niece. It was fun listening to the children chatter away and Duc translate.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" title="Fishermen of Halong Bay-8" src="http://onthegowithlynne.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fishermen-of-halong-bay-8.jpg" alt="Fishermen of Halong Bay-" width="640" height="356" /></a></p>
<p>Laughing at each other in our conical hats was a reminder that we were acting the tourist part. There was one particular area that Duc wanted us to see, but the lead rower could not get her boat through because of the current.</p>
<p>We weren’t disappointed. The beauty around us was worth this experience of being rowed in a basket.</p>
<p>Once back on the junk, the long term sustainability of these floating villages was discussed.  There is a balance between the fishermen, tourism, and the fragile eco-system which can change because of industrial run off, storms affecting fishing and increasing pollution. Halong Bay is a beautiful natural wonder. Protection of these waters while preserving a cultural way of life is an ongoing challenge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://evolequals.com/2012/09/03/defriended-2/straightmanperspective/" rel="attachment wp-att-600"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-600" title="StraightManPerspective" src="http://lgbtandallies.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/straightmanperspective.jpg" alt="Straight Man Perspective" width="370" height="370" /></a></p>
<p>My younger brother is gay. Gay as laughter. Gay as the day is long. One of the finest moments in my life, and one of the greatest compliments anyone has ever paid me, was the day he felt safe to come out to me. He’s in his mid-30s now, but he’ll always be my little brother. And man, I love that kid. He’s brilliant, he’s funny, and he’s kind. And he just married a phenomenal man.</p>
<p>I was always predisposed to like his husband because, y’know, he’s my brother’s partner and therefore has automatic status in my heart. The wonderful bonus is that I really like him. He’s brilliant, he’s funny, and he’s kind. He’s a cool dude to hang out with. He also stood by my brother like a rock when my brother had a life-threatening cancer that cost him his left eye.</p>
<p>They married in May. It was a wonderful ceremony in which I was honored to stand by my brother, supporting him in his vows. My eyes teared up like they always do at weddings. I had the joy of watching two people commit to a lifetime together. It filled my heart.</p>
<p>Folks started posting photos from the wedding on Facebook, and I proudly reposted photos of the ceremony (with me looking awesome in my new suit, of course). Shortly after that, I received this message from a FB friend:</p>
<p>“Hey David, I am removing you from my friends list&#8230;sorry man, that latest post is way over the top! Homosexuals joining in &#8220;Holy&#8221; matrimony&#8230;I don&#8217;t think so??? The Holy Bible speaks out against homosexuality and speaks highly of Holy matrimony between a man and a woman. It&#8217;s nothing more than a slap in the face to those who choose God&#8217;s Word, for homosexuals to join in a Holy marriage. I&#8217;m only defriending you so I don&#8217;t have to look at your anti-God stuff anymore&#8230;nothing personal!”</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This came from a man I used to work with. A man I respect in his dedication to his family, and in his desire to live a moral and ethical life. A man with whom I have had some very interesting religious debates. He has become a Baptist preacher since we last spoke in person, and I suppose that makes this message unsurprising.</p>
<p>But, I was still surprised. I was taken aback. I needed a moment. I was hurt.</p>
<p>I was inclined to hurl some expletives in his direction.</p>
<p>But, only for a moment. He’s not really that important of a person in my life. I had actually at times grown rather tired of <em>his</em> Facebook postings…I don’t have a great need for fundamentalist dogma in my day. So, on some level, good riddance.</p>
<p>I sent him a letter at his church, expressing my disappointment in his withdrawal. I had a few friends read the letter before I sent it, to make sure that it didn’t contain too much bile. I’m not surprised that I haven’t heard back from him.</p>
<p>The situation got me thinking: What if this hadn’t been about my brother’s wedding, but about MY wedding? What if it hadn’t been from a distant friend, but from a beloved family member?</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>How many millions of gay kids (and adults) have had that exact thing happen to them? How many millions more will in the future?</p>
<p>I’m sorry.</p>
<p>I’m sorry for that pain. I’m sorry for that rejection. I’m sorry for that isolation.</p>
<p>I’m straight. Straight as a yardstick. Straight as an arrow. I am in your corner. If I could take on that pain for you, I would.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>If you’re gay, I think that’s wonderful, and I’m truly happy for you. I wish you all the love and joy in the world.</p>
<p>If you’re straight, I think that’s wonderful, and I’m truly happy for you. I wish you all the love and joy in the world. And I charge you, I charge you to imagine the above scenario played out with YOU as the target of rejection. Imagine the people closest to you telling you, essentially, “You are fundamentally flawed and I want nothing to do with you.” Our LGBTQ brothers and sisters face this everyday. Please don’t forget that.</p>
<p>The poor, misguided soul is no longer in my life. That’s okay. My brother and his husband still are. I just hung out with my brother a few weeks ago, and it was a blast. He’s brilliant, he’s funny, and he’s kind. I couldn’t be prouder to call him my brother. I love him, and love wins, period.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time last week I was still (!) recovering from a very big night out in Barca. In the district of Gracia to be precise. Gracia is popular with the bohemian/hipster set &#8211; so I fitted right in, natch &#8211; and is jam packed with cool little bars and boutiques. The Gracia festival, known as <em>Festa Major</em>, is completely free and takes place in the streets of the Gracia district of Barcelona over the course a week every August. The streets of the barrio compete to win a prize for the best decorated street (and boy do they make a cracking effort &#8211; my photos only tell half the story!) and on almost every corner there&#8217;s a stage with something going on. We saw a <a title="Zumba" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zumba" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Zumba</a> lesson, some really excellent bands and even had a pop at swing dancing.</p>
<p>And even better &#8211; you can buy cervezas and mojitos until you&#8217;re full to the brim from the dozens of little pop-up bars set up on the streets. Being the last night of the festival, last Saturday was a massive street party which lasted until the very early hours. I collapsed at around 4.30am, but there was still plenty partying going on outside!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adorablycaffeinated.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1317" title="photo (2)" src="http://adorablycaffeinated.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>Before you freak out, it&#8217;s not that we aren&#8217;t Cubs fans anymore, because we are. You can&#8217;t just give up something like that; you&#8217;re born with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just complicated&#8230; Here. Allow me to explain from the beginning:</p>
<p>When you grow up in Chicago or the surrounding region, you are raised to be a baseball fan from birth. Before you&#8217;re old enough to drool, your little baby closet is filled with Cubs or Sox onesies, t-shirts, bibs, pacifiers and tiny baseball mitts. Occasionally a few Cardinals fans will sneak in there (grr), but generally you are either a Cubs fan or a White Sox fan, and that&#8217;s just how it goes. It&#8217;s in your blood.</p>
<p>The Hubbster and I were both raised to be Cubs fans, aka to live lives filled with disappointment and heartache, all the while maintaining our &#8220;next year&#8221; optimism. Whether you believe in the curse of the goat or not, it is an undeniable fact that the Cubs haven&#8217;t won a world series since 1908. That&#8217;s 104 years. That means there are 100-year-old great great grandmothers living in that city who have never seen the Cubs win a World Series, and there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll die the same way. Depressing, right?</p>
<p>But we Cubs fans are resilient. <span id="more-1316"></span>Wrigley Field is always packed, and we somehow <em>do</em> manage to keep telling ourselves that next year is a new year. A fresh start. A clean slate. An opportunity to not royally eff it all up like  2003 (Sidenote: if you like sports, you should watch &#8220;Catching Hell&#8221; on Netflix. It&#8217;s about the Bartman interference and torture that was 2003. Really well done).</p>
<p>When we moved to DC, we took our Cubdom with us. It wasn&#8217;t a question really. We were born Cubs fans, and we will always be Cubs fans. And thanks to WGN America and an MLB package, the Hubbster could still watch every Cubs game. We went to see them play the Nationals on the 4th of July last year, clad in Cubs gear and cursing the baseball gods when they lost to the Nats.</p>
<p>Though to be honest, by that point a major shift had already occurred.</p>
<p>The Hubbster had adopted the Nationals as his&#8211;for lack of a better term&#8211;pitiful step brother. They weren&#8217;t very good, but he loves <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> sports, so he watched them. It helped that we started going to a lot of Nats games. I love live baseball, and Nationals Park is a beautiful place to see a game, so he doesn&#8217;t have to ever twist my arm to get me to go. They have great food and beer (among the plethora of alcohol options available), it&#8217;s easy to get to the stadium from the metro, and tickets are widely available and pretty cheap. We can get great seats for $20 that would cost us $80 at Wrigley (Now that I think about it, I think I&#8217;ve been to more games at Nationals Park than Wrigley Field. That&#8217;s a little embarrassing).</p>
<p>This season the Nats started off surprisingly strong. Then they called up Bryce Harper, the 19-year-old wunderkind who was drafted to the Nats minor league team when he was 17. Kid&#8217;s got a big bat, an arm like a rocket, and plays every inning like it&#8217;s the 7th game of World Series. After he was called up, he was wandering the Mall (a day or two before his first game), and joined in an intramural softball game that was going on. Just to play. Just for fun. I swear, every guy in this city has a giant man crush on him&#8211;including the Hubbster, who had the biggest smile on his face when he bought his Harper t-shirt.</p>
<p>Back in May, we had tickets to a game that was rained out. So instead of going to the make up game (because they were playing a double header, and we already had tickets to that second game. Yeah, right?) we decided to exchange our tickets for when the Cubs were in town. That game was yesterday. And that was the day we cheated on the Cubs.</p>
<p>We told ourselves that we&#8217;d be happy whatever the outcome. One of our teams was going to win at the end of that game. But as we left the house sporting curly W&#8217;s on our shirts, we had to be honest with ourselves: we were cheering for the Nationals. The big realization came in the top of the 9th inning. It had been a great defensive game for both teams, but especially the Nats. They were stopping everything in the infield, and came into the 9th up 2-0. Then the Cubs almost rallied. When the Nats were able to end the game, we stood up and cheered. We whooped, we hollered, we clapped. Then we looked at each other very shamefully.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that we wanted the Cubs to lose. It&#8217;s just that they have no chance of making it to the post-season, and the Nats do. The Hubbster has complete faith in Theo Epstein (seriously, it borders on worship. He freaked out when the Cubs hired him, I thought he was going to cry). But it&#8217;s going to be a few years before Theo can make the Cubs competitive. And until then, I&#8217;m sorry. But we&#8217;re rooting for the Nationals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Roger White  </em></p>
<p>It hit me the other day, my genteel tribe, as I sat watching the glorious first football weekend of the holy month of September. The remote—it hit me square in the back of the head. The wife trying to get my attention again; something about dinner or a burglar or something. Th<a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/here-is-life.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1120" title="here is Life" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/here-is-life.jpg?w=150&h=100" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a>at woman’s got aim. Anyway, then it really hit me, as I listened to that specialized vocabulary that signals the start of a new season. That magical lexicon of the gridiron just so happens to have context—and in quite similar fashion, I might add—to the life of this middle-aged hubby, dad of two teenage girls (help me, Lord), owner of a thoroughly over-mortgaged house, and slumlord to two very ill-behaved pets (one fat, incontinent dog and one nasty, lethargic cat).</p>
<p>I began listing in my head these terms that carry dual meaning in my quaint little life, but the terms kept slipping out of my head where the wife konked me with the remote. The den started getting cluttered with all these words falling to my feet, so I figured I should sweep them up and list them.</p>
<p>So here they are, expressions o’ the gridiron and their “other” meanings, in alphabetical order for your convenient reference:</p>
<p><strong><em>All-out Blitz.</em></strong> Usually run when Mom’s away, this is a designed play in which both daughters beseech Dad in unison to <em>pleeeeeease</em> take them to the corner store for basic life necessities (e.g., gum, ice cream, Pringles).</p>
<p><strong><em>End Around. </em></strong>Another regular from the daughter playbook, this is a misdirection play used to call Mom’s or Dad’s attention to one daughter while the other one either (A) sneaks in or out of the house; (B) cleans up whatever she broke; or (C) dashes to the bathroom to attempt repairs to her purple hair dye job.</p>
<p><strong><em>False Start.</em></strong> Called almost exclusively on Mom, this mix-up occurs whenever the family is set to go out, either to a restaurant, shopping, movie, etc., and Mom says “I’m ready.” Family members then wait in the car for another 25 minutes before realizing that “I’m ready” means “another half-hour” with regard to Mom.</p>
<p><strong><em>Illegal Shift. </em></strong>This penalty is called on either one daughter or the other, depending on who stole the front passenger position in the car after the first daughter clearly called “shotgun” before the outing began.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nickel Back.</em></strong> This term refers to the change Dad often gets back from mall excursions by <a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/yup.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1121" title="yup" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/yup.jpg?w=150&h=112" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>Daughter #1, Daughter #2, or Mom—or, more often, all three of them running the same play. (See also End Around.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Pass Interference.</em></strong> A tactic used almost exclusively by Dad, this is a time-honored anti-flirting measure employed by dads all over, usually achieved by physically stepping in between the line of sight of boys and young men trying to catch the eye of Daughter #1 or vice-versa. Recently, much to Dad’s dismay, this has begun to apply to Daughter #2, as well. (See also Shotgun Formation.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Prevent Defense.</em></strong> This is a tactic often utilized by Dad to avoid manual labor, mostly on weekends, by pretending to be soundly asleep on the couch (or whatever furniture he happens to be lounging on) when called upon by Mom.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shotgun Formation. </em></strong>Although an actual shotgun is optional here, this is the classic formation used by Dad by sitting on the front-porch swing when daughters are due home from dates.</p>
<p><strong><em>Touchback. </em></strong>A nerve-wracking phenomenon occurring almost exclusively on family road trips, this is when daughters #1 and #2 vie for territorial rights in the back seat of the car. The constantly recurring touchback commotion almost inevitably ends with the command, “If I have to turn this car around!”</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/aahh.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1123" title="AAHH!" src="http://oldspouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/aahh.jpg?w=150&h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Two-minute Warning.</em></strong> This mad scramble by Dad is triggered by the appearance of the mother-in-law’s car in front of the house. It takes mom-in-law approximately two minutes to make it from her car to the house, by which time Dad must have himself hidden away in the den or the master bedroom. If not, he is often subjected to many <strong><em>Bombs </em></strong>and <strong><em>Cheap Shots</em></strong> regarding personal appearance, yard maintenance, career ambition, etc.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Every day, 19 WordPressers are featured on the Freshly Pressed section of WordPress.com. And every day, many more wonder, “What do I have to do to get Freshly Pressed?”</em></p>
<p><em>Well, it’s time to reveal what the folks who push the launch button are thinking. Each week, a member of our editorial team will do a close-up on one post and why we thought it was Press-worthy. We hope we can provide insight into the process and give you tips and tools to make your blog the best it can be.<br />
</em>_________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Bloggers on WordPress.com publish various types of photography posts: from black-and-white to color, from digital to film, from Instagram to Lomo to Polaroid, from a single photo to a series of images. We love the variety and don&#8217;t prefer one approach over another.</p>
<p><span id="more-10017"></span></p>
<p>Last week, we featured <a href="http://losrodriguezlife.com/2012/08/26/visiting-south-park-city/">Visiting South Park City</a>, a photo essay on <a href="http://losrodriguezlife.com">Los Rodríguez Life</a>. Husband-and-wife team Javier and Leslie started this blog to stay in touch with their families (Javier&#8217;s family lives in Chile; Leslie&#8217;s family lives in Nashville). Here, they explore everything: travel, food, and life. Images are an integral part of their blog.</p>
<p>On the <em>Daily Post</em>, we&#8217;ll highlight different kinds of photography posts promoted to Freshly Pressed. Here&#8217;s why this particular post made the cut:</p>
<h2><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10058" title="south park city 1" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-1.jpg?w=300&h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>They brought an unfamiliar location to life.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d never heard of South Park City before reading this post (and I don&#8217;t know much about this region of Colorado), but that didn&#8217;t matter. Javier and Leslie make this abandoned 19th-century mining town look and sound intriguing. The photos of an old saloon, schoolhouse, pharmacy, train, and more appeal to readers interested in an array of topics other than photography, from history and restoration to industrialization and transportation.</p>
<p>In other words, you don&#8217;t have to photograph iconic landmarks or exotic locations to wow us. We do love your shots of picture-perfect places and far-flung locales, but we want to emphasize that <em>any</em> subject or location—even your backyard or a random street corner—can be Press-worthy if you pique our interest.</p>
<h2><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10059" title="south park city 2" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-2.jpg?w=199&h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>The assortment of shots is outstanding.</h2>
<p>This post has 45 images! It&#8217;s worth noting that <em>more</em> does not automatically make a set of photos better. In this case, we were impressed by the variety of angles and compositions in these images: Wide, establishing shots of a mining town versus close-ups of rusty antiques. Exterior versus interior. Still life versus people. Together, the images transport us there. Javier and Leslie insert descriptions to clarify what we&#8217;re looking at, but they are sparse and only include necessary details. Words come second to images here; the story of South Park City truly unfolds in the photographs.</p>
<p>In your own photo essay, create a narrative. Or think bigger: create a <em>world </em>for your readers. This may require taking photos of the same subject from above or underneath, from up close or far away. Shoot a city with different rolls of film, or filters, or cameras. Lie on the ground, or climb a tree, or look out over a rooftop to document a neighborhood. Experiment with angles and points of view to bring a place or thing to life, which will provide the visuals to tell your story.</p>
<h2><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-3.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10060" title="south park city 3" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/south-park-city-3.png?w=300&h=205" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a>The presentation was professional and effective.</h2>
<p>Posts on Los Rodríguez Life are written in both English (on the left) and Spanish (on the right). This photo essay is presented in Javier and Leslie&#8217;s standard post format: two columns of text, side by side, which make it easy for readers of either language to follow. We like how these images are displayed; as you scroll down and view each large-sized image, it feels like you&#8217;re flipping through the pages of a print magazine. (For more on this blog&#8217;s design, check out the <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/modern-news/">Modern News</a> theme.) Finally, the order in which the photos are laid out is intentional—Javier and Leslie&#8217;s adventure is presented from start to finish.</p>
<p>Telling a story with text and images is different from telling a story simply with words. For photo-centric posts, consider how best to lay out and display your content. For example, you can <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/gallery/">create a gallery</a>, <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/slideshows/">display a slideshow</a>, or <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/">insert images</a> directly into your post. You should also consider at what size you&#8217;d like to display your images, and where to insert them in your post so they complement your text.</p>
<p>So, tell us: did you enjoy this Freshly Pressed pick?<em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://moviesmedia.ign.com/movies/image/article/118/1186017/famous-last-words--20110808023122509-000.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="328" /></p>
<p>When was the last time you had a girl put a curse on you that <em>worked</em>? Or when did you last hear a screech in the woods and turned around to find that it was not a peacock but, in fact, a banshee? Have you ever been chased across the cemetery yards by a goblin?</p>
<p>Have you met one single person this year, in 2012, whom when you asked what they were doing with their lives, said, ‘Oh, I’m a hipster.’ One simply doesn’t hear this, at least not without irony. Why? Because, like witches, banshees and goblins, hipsters don’t exist.</p>
<p>Now, I know many will want to say, ‘Oh, but on the contrary. I see hipsters <em>everywhere</em>.’ But—I regret to have to make this potentially clumsy correlation—in the McCarthy era, people saw communists everywhere too. What you are seeing is not a member of a definable, objective counter culture. What you are seeing is a boy with a striped shirt. A girl with large glasses. A fellow in a fedora. But sadly, these are not the signifiers of what it means to be (allegedly) a ‘hipster.’ They are only the <em>symptoms</em>, and yet, not very useful symptoms, for they’re so broad and far reaching that anyone who happens to deviate from a polo-shirt and jeans might fit the part to your standard. But what <em>causes </em>these symptoms—or rather, what do we strongly associate with these trite generalizations? Pretention, the-will-to-have-done-it-first, music you don’t happen to yourself like, books you’ve never heard of, the excesses you don’t happen to favor.</p>
<p>I must make my main point here: It is my suspicion that a ‘hipster,’ in the broad sense of the word <em>today</em>, is merely an annoying person who doesn’t share any of your tastes.</p>
<p>You might say, ‘Why would you defend people like that?’ Well, I don’t feel the need to defend them just as I don’t feel the need to defend evil hexes, unicorns or dragons. I simply wish to warn people that they mustn’t feel so threatened by dragons that <em>don’t </em>actually roam the woods.</p>
<p>Now, none of us like things that are annoying and pretentious, but I hardly think it fair that a guy in a club should be ostracized by a plain-clothes person because he happens to wear a bowler hat or because he happens to be reading a biography about Che Guevara while wearing loud colors just because someone who happened to annoy the plain-clothes person carried a similar book and wore a similar shirt on their seldom visit to a non-Starbucks coffee shop.</p>
<p>You may say to me, ‘Sounds like the words of someone who’s angry about being called a hipster at some recent point.’ On the contrary! This blogger has not been accused. There are a series of sayings that broaden the terms of hipsterism beyond its metaphysical range. Surely you’ve heard them: ‘No one hates hipsters more than hipsters,’ which would cancel out the one who accuses you of being one with no real problem. My personal favorite, ‘If you know what a hipster is, you’re probably a hipster,’—as if their mere mention is some kind of self-reflective threat that could turn back in on you unless you’re <em>one step ahead </em>(in hipster fashion) by knowing that mentioning them makes you one of them: an attitude that is so reminiscent of the ‘hipster mentality’ that it would, in a technical way, still make you a hipster.</p>
<p>All over the world, there are douche-bags. You might meet them in the street or on the bus, or you might work with them. ‘Hello, my name is David and I am a douche-bag.’ You don’t hear this either. But the difference between a douche-bag and a hipster: we don’t identify a <em>douche-bag </em>as having any kind of identifiable subculture. But yet the one important thing they both have <em>in common </em>is that nobody would identify themselves as either. If no one is willing to admit that they belong to a certain group, one then has to wonder if the title is a very useful way of categorizing people.</p>
<p>As I said before, there were once <em>real</em> hipsters, which probably means little beyond the fact that the <em>real </em>hipsters considered themselves such. The movement started in the 1940’s and is linked symbiotically to jazz, which cannot be so readily said of ‘hipster’ sensibilities today. The original term ‘hipster’ replaced ‘hepcat,’ for some odd reason—I’m not sure if there was a bebop council that voted on it or not.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they were necessarily better for being the originals. Depending on your taste, you might have found them just as annoying and just as pretentious. The movement was described as white middle-class kids trying to be black—which probably says less about the movement and more about insecurity to do with cultural integration among the generation before. But if they are correct in any way, it could then be said, in regard to the history of hipsters, that white folks have failed our African American friends once again by being <em>second hand </em>racist toward these other white folks who wanted to do what one African American subculture were doing.</p>
<p>Now, I must eat <em>some </em>of my words for a moment. Maybe some of you know people that refer to themselves as hipsters without irony. However, I suspect, that if you gathered all of these people together in one room, they would (similar to the Punks) try to out-hipster each other, which would ultimately trace their contradistinction to one another, thus making them nothing like a real culture of any kind once again—which proves my point.</p>
<p>The automobile has provided us with an easier way to move from place to place. The television provided us with hours of easy entertainment. The internet provided us with an easier access to knowledge and Facebook provided us with an easier means to keep in contact with old friends. But there’s a dark side to <em>easier</em>. Dismissing certain attitudes, fashions and tastes as that of a ‘hipster’ is an <em>easy </em>way for us to cope with our own embarrassment over the cultural fashion follies, philosophy follies and awkward tastes of yesteryear. Anything can be dismissed as outdated, but the great thing about hipster-phobia is that you can dismiss anything that is considered ‘freshly retro,’ or new, or more <em>unknown</em>, as something that a culturally unattractive person would admire. And this will to stay ahead of the hipsters is, by its current definitional nature concerning hipsterism, a hipster attitude which would make anti-hipsters the biggest hipsters of all.</p>
<p>Once again, I’m not defending hipsters because I have shown that they don’t actually exist. If they did exist in the form that people claim they do, perhaps I would be talking about how much I dislike them the way people want to. But I’ll say this, even if they <em>do </em>exist, are they <em>that </em>big of a cultural threat that we have to keep hearing about them everywhere we go?</p>
<p>More importantly, before you decide that someone is objectionable, perhaps you should actually speak to them. If they’re a threat, then you can deal with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eveproofreads.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nw-zadie-smith.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-342" title="NW Zadie Smith" src="http://eveproofreads.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nw-zadie-smith.jpg?w=198&h=300" alt="" width="198" height="300" /></a><span style="color:#000000;">Zadie Smith’s new novel, NW, surprised me. I was expecting something like <em>White Teeth </em>or <em>On Beauty</em>, but the complexity and intense poetry of this created something strong and unexpected. It primarily charts the lives of best friends Leah and Keisha who grow up together on the same estate. Though it initially focuses on Leah, I preferred the later section, ‘Host’, that adopts Keisha’s perspective in brief scenes, told with the senses of memory, that bring them from childhood to adulthood. It explores whether Keisha can successfully negotiate a class transition.  She chooses a new name, Natalie, for her new life as she succeeds professionally and marries wealthy Frank, who looks like ‘he was born on a yacht somewhere in the Caribbean and raised by Ralph Lauren’. Zadie Smith’s characters are, as always, multifaceted and very authentic. I loved her description of Keisha’s teenage angst:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘It did not strike Keisha Blake that such feelings of alienation are the banal fate of adolescents everywhere. She considered herself peculiarly afflicted, and it is not an exaggeration to say that she struggled to think of anyone besides perhaps James Baldwin and Jesus who had experienced the profound isolation and loneliness that she now knew to be the one and only true reality in this world.’</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> The lives of two men are also introduced in this anthropological consideration of an urban landscape. Felix and Nathan have both struggled to establish functional lives after their beginnings on the Caldwell estate. Poverty, failure and distress are never far from the lives of NW’s people; there seems to be a sort of inevitable tragedy about this novel. The moment that struck me the most was when Natalie and Nathan meet for the last time in the text. She tells him, ‘It’s weird to me that you can be so vital to another person and never know it. You were so…loved’. Yet that can do little for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> There are moments that show Zadie Smith’s clever humour. Cultural references ground the chronology realistically, though some were rather lost on me. I struggled a little with some of the prose as semi-sentences often tailed off, as if I inherently knew what she was getting at. I’m afraid I didn’t. Unfortunately, my professional brain also initially interfered with my enjoyment; I kept thinking how difficult it would be to proofread! Once I got past my grammatical fixations, I found the creativity of form refreshing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> NW is just right in some ways. Reading it feels like a trip to London: a city sometimes dense, stressful and un-cohesive, but ultimately it provides a chance to see a cross-section of life in glimpses. It is sometimes beautiful or brutal, but it is always vital and feels essentially real and alive. </span></p>
