				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the success of Curiosity everyone is calling for manned missions to Mars by 2030, but I take the opposite view &#8211; let&#8217;s do more sophisticated robot missions. Is having some people walk around the most ambitious thing we can do? Or is having a really powerful AI robot explore for us the most ambitious and most useful? Which will have the most bang for the buck here on Earth?</p>
<p>Space missions are expensive and there is no money, in our now diminished and small-minded politics, to pay for them. Right now in the glow of the success of Curiosity many are pointing out how these accomplishment &#8220;inspire&#8221; us (and they do) but it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll tax the rich just for some inspiration, esp. when science is under attack today by religion. Those who try to justify the missions from a practical POV always bring up &#8220;spinoffs&#8221;, IOW, spending 2.5B$ to put something on Mars created right-here-on-earth economic opportunity. Fine, I think this is over-hyped (is Tang all we got from moon landings?) but in fact now let&#8217;s go all in. Build a rover that can drive itself, decide for itself what to look at and analyze, get itself out of trouble when it gets stuck or at two steep an angle. Program it to figure out the best way to climb a mountain or descend into a crater.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of the DARPA contest for self-driving cars. In the first year the cars were awful and none finished the &#8220;race&#8221;. But in the second year multiple cars did finish and even under the required time. That accomplishment has practical spinoff applications, which in fact Google is even exploiting in a limited way. Imagine the fortunes that can be made from self-driving cars. The interstate highway system opened up modern transportation but it&#8217;s time for an update. Imagine how we can unsnarl the traffic jams and save countless deaths by replacing this now-antique technology.</p>
<p>Robotics is not a poor substitute for human exploration, it is a superior way to do exploration. The technology we&#8217;ll have to develop for robotic missions is more sophisticated and I&#8217;ll argue, more useful, than sending people there. And because it&#8217;s cheaper we can do more of it. Just look at the progress in Mars surface explorers &#8211; Viking, Rovers, Curiosity. These were just the start, let&#8217;s keep it going. A true very smart AI rover on Mars or on Titan or in the oceans of Europa is a bigger challenge and a more useful one to accomplish.</p>
<p>In the early days of the space program it was decided people had to be the explorers because that gave a human dimension to space exploration and thus the public will be thrilled by &#8220;heroes&#8221; and support the program. That was probably true. But it&#8217;s 2012, not 1969, and now with millions of people excited by Curiosity, following it through Twitter and Internet video streaming, that didn&#8217;t even exist in 1969, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;ve changed. We can get very exciting about an SUV-sized robot rolling around and telling us what it found just as much as we can about Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. Sending people does have a certain of drama (primarily because the public likes crashes, which is the appeal of NASCAR) but we can also be excited by a machine, built by incredible human ingenuity that can go where we can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s let the human body excel at what it can do, amazing Gold medal feats and let&#8217;s let our minds explore the universe.</p>
<p>Robots rule!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’ve said <a href="http://eyesareout.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/in-defence-of-remakes-reboots-prequels-and-adaptations/">before</a>, I am not against adapting books/novels/comics/delete-as-appropriate into movies. I recognise that a lot of amazing films have been created from other sources. However, when a film is made out of a previous intellectual property, filmmakers have to tread a very careful line: to stay faithful to the source material whilst creating a story that works. And believe it or not, this is much harder than it looks.</p>
<p>What people fail to realise is that books and movies are very different media, and as such require very different structures and writing styles. Just because a novel has a brilliant plot, it will not necessarily transfer over into cinema. There are methods novels can employ that films cannot: use of descriptive text, use of internal monologues for characters, and a less stilted conveyance of emotion without resorting to dialogue for instance.</p>
<div id="attachment_2609" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/word-recessed-into-concete-cover-communication_w725_h544.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2609" title="word-recessed-into-concete-cover-communication_w725_h544" src="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/word-recessed-into-concete-cover-communication_w725_h544.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Excessive dialogue does not cover up other flaws in a screenplay.</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, movies are an inherently visual medium, and must also successfully utilize the use of sound. Plots <em>need</em> to be more concise. Characters <em>need</em> to be more concrete and defined. The world of the film <em>must </em>be more structured, and, as it were, more real – or at least have a set of rules that must be adhered to for the audience to buy into the situations shown. Cinema is at the same time both simpler and more complex than fiction.</p>
<p>Having said all this, I can suggest a few main reasons why certain adaptations fall flat. First up is pacing. Fiction can have more meandering sections, where characters can be developed without it being detrimental to the overall plot. Even the most action-packed of novels can have chapters where the tension can drop and the reader can really get to know the characters. In film? Not so much. There is a bit of leeway, but characters really need to be defined by their actions, by how they look, and by what they say.</p>
<p>Next up, there’s the problem of back story. How exactly do you get a huge back story into a film? With a <em>Star Wars</em>-style opening crawl? Clichéd, but it can work sometimes. Expositional dialogue? Definitely not. The most successful back stories are created without the audience even realising: a look or an in-joke between characters, mise-en-scène to portray the world of the film – or in the case of specific props, a bit of a character’s history.  There are some examples otherwise but in general these subvert the tropes of dialogue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2603" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tdk_0654.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2603" title="tdk_0654" src="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tdk_0654.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the reasons The Joker is great is because of his two back stories. Which is real? Is either?</p></div>
<p>Then, there’s the length. Novels, in general, have quite a lot going on – a complex plot, lots of characters, back story, even large jumps through time. When the subject of an adaptation is a long text, then sacrifices need to be made. But where should these sacrifices fall? Successful adaptations take the core plot, keep other plot elements that are thematically important, and cut around that: characters that add little vibrancy or have nothing to do with the story, back story that doesn’t develop the plot of the film, and character-developing scenes. It’s incredibly hard, though, to work out what should be cut, and the director and scriptwriter are bound to upset fans of the original work. Perhaps this is why it seems that short stories often work out as better adaptations.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the audience. Many adaptations fail because they ignore one simple rule: the audience is a blank slate. Lots of them, or even most of them, will not have read the original text, and they shouldn’t have to. It doesn’t matter if fans of the novel understand what is going on; if Average Joe the cinema-goer doesn’t understand it, your film doesn’t work. If a viewer has to have done homework in order to decipher a big-budget adaption, then the filmmaker has, unfortunately, done something wrong somewhere during the production. This is the one criticism I have of Edgar Wright’s fantastic <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> – it looked great, the correct elements were cut from the plot and cast, the art style reflected the comic perfectly, but some viewers came out of the movie not quite understanding what they had just seen. This one mistake in an otherwise wonderful film could be one of the reasons why it didn’t do that well at the box office.</p>
<p><a href="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pilgrim-600.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2604" title="pilgrim-600" src="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pilgrim-600.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>Those are the major reasons that adaptations fail. So, let’s do a case study, shall we? Let’s pick David Lynch’s <em>Dune</em>: one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. Lynch was so unhappy with it that in certain pressings his name in the credit is replaced by Alan Smithee. Let’s not get on Lynch’s back, though – Frank Herbert’s original novel has many traps that any movie-maker could all into. It has time lapses, meandering character-developing sections, a massive back story, it’s absolutely massive, has a huge number of characters, its own vocabulary, a high-concept plot, and it’s absolutely insane. This book is potentially <em>unfilmable</em> – at least, as a single movie.</p>
<p>Lynch’s <em>Dune</em> fails at each and every one of these problems. Time-lapses are explained by an omniscient narrator, character developments are either explained by the same narrator or by the characters themselves – through both dialogue and internal thought. Back story? That’s the first fifteen minutes. The complete version of the film clocks in at just under three hours, and cuts still had to be made for the theatrical release that chopped up the story even further. Hardly any characters were cut, even those who, due to plot streamlining, had no <em>point</em> anymore. The vocabulary remains, some of it explained, some of it not. It’s still insane, and difficult to follow <em>even if </em>you’ve read the original text.</p>
<p>Worst of all though, are the additions made by Lynch himself. Obviously, additions need to be made, in terms of art style and dialogue. Sometimes even plot points and characters need to be added to make an adaptation work. Lynch, though, made some very strange choices. The evil Baron Harkonnen was given sores across his face (not mentioned in the novel), and due to the Baron being gay there were allegations of homophobia – with the sores representing the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>Then there’s this scene:</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://eyesareout.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/source-material-and-the-film-adaptation/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/1d2Ac7IoDuc/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>Why is a cat being milked for an antidote? Who knows. It wasn’t in the novel, that’s for sure, and doesn’t add anything to the film other than making Sting look even more mental.</p>
<p>How about the giant eyebrows of the Mentats? Or the seductive Bene Gesserit being made bald?</p>
<div id="attachment_2606" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mentat-eyebrows-bene-gesserit-bald.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2606" title="Mentat Eyebrows Bene Gesserit Bald" src="http://eyesareout.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mentat-eyebrows-bene-gesserit-bald.png" alt="" width="490" height="124" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eyebrows mean logic and baldness is sexy.</p></div>
<p>Lynch seemed to choose these additions over other points that were vital. The Mentats were included despite the Mentat/Bene Gesserit rivalry being practically removed from the film. Hawat (he who needs the cat-antidote) was kept in the film in spite of his role in the novel – helping the Harkonnens after believing that Paul Atreides’ mother betrayed him – being taken out of the movie. Gone was any feeling that Arrakis was a hard planet to live on, and indeed the value of water is not really present. And the point of the novel – that Paul Atreides is not <em>truly</em> a god, but has made himself seem one, is taken out. Unfortunately, <em>Dune</em> is far removed from the source material in all the wrong ways. It is also similar to the source material in all the wrong ways.</p>
<p>Film adaptations, for me, fall into one of three categories. There are the great adaptations – the films that are respectful of the source, build upon it, and adapt it into a working movie. The films that make you want to go back and read the original work, regardless of whether you’ve read it before. Then there are the films that were heavily criticized for their deviation from their source material, but are still good films in their own right. Finally, there are those that just don’t work – nonsensical plots, poor scripts, changes to the source that make no sense, and that are just <em>bad movies</em>.</p>
<p>Join me next time and I’ll take you on a whirlwind tour of the three categories of adaptations – the good, the bad, and the it-got-ugly-with-the-original-fans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is another great post from PhD student, full time gallery worker and mother, Evelyn Tsitsas &#8230; who decided a while back to do 3 conference papers just 8 months out from submission. She is now questioning the wisdom of her decision!</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thethesiswhisperer.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/smallworld.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3946" title="smallworld" src="http://thethesiswhisperer.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/smallworld.jpg?w=194&h=300" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>It seemed like a good idea at the time. Somewhere, among the photocopied notes, the paperwork, the books, the rewrites and the endless forwarding to different university departments the same invoices and receipts in the <strong>endless quest for elusive conference funding</strong>, it still does.  In fact, until reality set in, attending an overseas conference (or three) and presenting a paper seemed a very good idea in the lead up to handing in my doctorate.</p>
<p>When I started to plot my abstract submissions, I felt like Persse McGarrigle, David Lodge’s fresh faced academic let loose from the University of Rummidge out on the conference adventure circuit. But it hasn’t at all been like something from his campus novels, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_World:_An_Academic_Romance"><em>Changing Places</em> and </a><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_World:_An_Academic_Romance">Small World: An Academic Romance</a> - </em>shortlisted for the Booker Prize.<em> </em>I admit David Lodge &#8211; whose writing I adore, has <strong>ruined me utterly for life in the academic lane of the 21st century</strong>.  Damn you, Lodge! <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/david-lodge-a-novelists-lament-for-the-golden-age-of-universities-2254768.html">Yet even he admits the times have changed.</a> Sadly.</p>
<p>These days, I do the <strong>juggle of paid work, causal lecturing and the push to complete the PhD</strong> like everyone else. With the desperate “publish or perish” thrown in. I think Persse had it easy at Rummidge, even though both he and the university were fictional. Now it’s “welcome to the stress of trying to do it all.”</p>
<p>I am now at that time of the doctorate (equivalent to being 8 months pregnant) when your friends are all sick and tired of hearing you complain how difficult it is. When the<strong> fear</strong> of the end (labour, or actually handing in the doctorate) looks like a<strong> blessing</strong> compared to the misery of being so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Swap swollen ankles for bloated expectations; nagging obstetricians complaining about weight gain for supervisors harping about the standard of your abstracts; and elaborate (and unrealistic) birth plans for equally <strong>unrealistic plans</strong> to present at not one but three overseas conferences.</p>
<p>Surely I can’t be the only one deciding to present at three overseas conferences just 8 months out of handing in my doctorate? Please tell me there are others as driven, ambitious and mad as me? All I can say is that<strong> it seemed like a good idea at the time</strong>.</p>
<p>The reality – like waddling around in the height of summer massively pregnant wishing you’d timed it for winter – is something else again. But just as exhausting. In order to complete the conference papers on top of my other work and family commitments, I have put in <strong>many, many all nighters</strong> – 10 hours at a stretch, (after coming home from work) for weeks on end. And it’s taking it’s toll.</p>
<p>Just two weeks to go before I hop on a plane and everyone is saying “wow, you must be excited – three whole weeks to yourself, no kids, just doing the conference thing.” Alas, if I am exhausted now, drained and beyond feeling like I can ever possibly get my papers done to the exacting standard my supervisor demands, what will I be like when I finally manage to<strong> shuffle myself onto the plane</strong> and head to Utrecht? Will I be able to stand proud in front of my peers and my academic superiors?</p>
<p>I am sure there is a term for this <strong>pre-conference malaise,</strong> though I don’t recall Persse McGarrigle suffering from it. Perhaps David Lodge, like the wise old women who neglect to tell you about the <em>real</em> pain of childbirth and the sleepless nights that follow, is omitting the worst bits not just to be kind, but to keep the faith.</p>
<p>When it comes to overseas conferences, <strong>it’s not just doing the actual papers that cause the stress</strong>, but the ”administration”. Somehow organising the airfare, registration and accommodation, and then wrangling the money for it. I count myself very fortunate that I have had the support from my university and international conference funding, which will make the difference between being able to afford the trip or not.</p>
<p>I am grateful &#8211; because from the experience of local conferences I have attended the past few years, I have discovered that David Lodge wasn’t lying when he wrote <em>Small World</em> and <em>Changing Places</em> – they are <strong>terrific ways</strong> to form networks, friendships, made valuable contacts, exchange ideas, and generally grow in confidence and understanding about your subject area.</p>
<p>After two conferences in NSW and Queensland last year (again, thanks to my university for supplying some funding for me to attend and present papers), I made terrific contacts and now as a direct result, I spend one night a month discussing animal studies topics in a reading group with a professor I not only admire, but also have high up on my reading list. She has said she’d like to speak to me about my research next semester – from someone so in demand and busy, I am terribly<strong> flattered</strong>.</p>
<p>So, later this month, I am off to Utrecht for the international Minding Animals conference and then off to the <strong>dreaming spires</strong> of Oxford University, where I will present papers on monsters and cyberspace in science fiction with Inter-Disciplinary.Net.</p>
<p>But I am sitting here wondering if chasing the dream of <em>Changing Places</em> is worth it. <strong>Exhaustion factor</strong> is the main reason. However, old hands tell me that once I am on that plane, the laptop at my feet full of the much sweated over but completed conference papers, I will be able to zone out on inflight movies, red wine and sleep.</p>
<p>I certainly hope so. Meanwhile, I think it’s time to start re-reading my David Lodge collection. He may have a few <strong>tips</strong> on how to make the most of the conferences once I actually get there. And for those of you who have read his campus trilogy &#8211; I mean more productive things than what young Persse McGarrigle got up to&#8230;</p>

<p>I started off the journey considerably&#8221; fresher&#8221; than I ended it! OH THE HUMANITY!  I could not see more than 2 features at a time in the pocket mirror&#8211;but the emotions are there in any case! The papers performed admirably!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a lot of theories about the workings and happenings of the universe and my life. Numero Uno on that list is that people go to grad school because they hope that if they prolong their time in school, they&#8217;ll eventually get that belated letter from Hogwarts. Number Two is that my mother will never learn that the grocery store Hy-Vee is not pronounced &#8220;HIV&#8221;. Number Three is that everybody wants to be Beyonce.</p>
<p>I want to be Beyonce. I&#8217;m fairly confident in the assertion that most people who know who Beyonce is want to be her. Everyone else is in denial. I don&#8217;t care who you are&#8211;your next door neighbor in the high-waters wants to be Beyonce. Mitt Romney wants to be Beyonce. My dog wants to be Beyonce.</p>
<p><em>Everybody wants to be Beyonce. </em></p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re one of those individuals I spoke of  who might be saying &#8220;What, but I have never felt the desire to be a 5&#8217;7 Black Woman with a booty and voice like whoah&#8221; then I will educate you in the reasons as to why you&#8217;re lying to yourself.</p>
<div id="attachment_76" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 241px"><a href="http://attemptedamusement.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-76" title="oed" src="http://attemptedamusement.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/oed.jpg?w=231&h=300" alt="" width="231" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">They weren&#8217;t jealy of her jelly.</p></div>
<p>1. She coined the term bootylicious and made it into a song. If anyone else tried this, they would be laughed at. Beyonce does it, and it&#8217;s added to The Oxford English Dictionary.</p>

<p>2. She has 16 Grammys at the age of 30. 16. She has more Grammys than most people have friends, 4 times over.</p>

<p>4. Her daughter is the youngest person, at two days old, because of the her recorded cries that appeared on &#8220;Glory&#8221;, to debut on Billboard&#8217;s Top 100. The two day old product of your genetic material poops and sleeps. Beyonce&#8217;s became a recording artist.</p>

<p>7. Beyonce made $40 million in 2011. This was &#8220;a rather low grossing year for her.&#8221; She was also pregnant for most of 2011.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_156" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 290px"><a href="http://toddwerkhoven.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1234533608u0ghhv.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-156 " title="1234533608u0GHhv" src="http://toddwerkhoven.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1234533608u0ghhv.jpeg?w=280&h=260" alt="" width="280" height="260" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What are you doing?! It&#8217;s *full*!</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that whenever you see food advertised, more often than not it&#8217;s flying through the air. There must be some psychological weakness that we all have that equates airborne food with &#8220;Why yes, I must eat Go-Gurt now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I realized this last night when I was watching TV. There was an ad for granola or muesli or something, and every time they showed the product, it was either being tossed through the air or scattered across a table or raining down from the heavens. But what was strange is that I didn&#8217;t even think anything of it. It&#8217;s just something we&#8217;re all used to seeing. Next time you&#8217;re in a movie theater, notice that even the ads before the movie ascribe to this marketing device. There&#8217;s the bucket of popcorn being forcibly thrust up through the mountainous pile of kernels lining the bottom of the screen, sending popcorn flying in every direction. Sour Patch Kids and cookie dough wads are ejected from some off-screen food cannon. And my favorite, the &#8220;Coke and Popcorn Collision&#8221; ad, where a giant vat of Coke is hurled from one side of the screen, a cauldron of popcorn is flung from the other side, and they meet in the middle to form this churning tsunami of moist, inedible foodstuffs. But for some reason, seeing a still picture of that collision is not only acceptable to us, it seems to make us hungry.</p>
<p>The food collision technique is one that we&#8217;re familiar with outside of the movie theater. It is also used whenever a snack that consists of a combination of two flavors is advertised. Most often, it&#8217;s liquid chocolate being poured over some sort of cookie-crisp wafer moving across the TV screen in some unknown trajectory. (Caramel is occasionally involved, although it is usually not poured; caramel may only be drizzled with a quick back-and-forth motion, allowing it to ooze down to full coverage on its own impetus.)</p>
<p>Makers of juice are the most excited about the flying food school of advertising. Rotating slices of lemons, limes, and oranges crash into spinning strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. All of which are just drenched with water being hosed in from some open firehydrant off stage. I just feel terrible for the poor people involved with such a production. Everyone&#8217;s sopping wet, people are trying to dig the raspberry seeds out of their teeth all day long, that lady who happens to be a &#8220;cutter&#8221; is writhing in pain because lemon juice is getting into last night&#8217;s X-acto knife wounds.</p>
<p>But it must work. After all, Americans eat less celery than they do Pringles, the flyingest of all snack foods advertised today (have you <em>ever</em> seen Pringles at rest? Of course not&#8230;they&#8217;re always blasting out from the top of their cannon-like packaging). Maybe that&#8217;s the secret to solving our rampant obesity problem. We can make signs and everything. &#8220;Throw Your Food &#8212; Start With the Vegetables.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gdsdigital/4623496335/sizes/m/in/photostream/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3384/4623496335_73f9b4bfd9.jpg" class="alignleft" width="253" height="500" /></a>Wednesday morning, post-jog Skype sesh: sitting in my robe, cup of coffee, laptop in my lap, feeling all warm and good after a shower and a bowl of pho. </p>
<p>Routines are one of my favorite things (because I&#8217;m officially old and boring). Watching the routines emerge in my new life here in Hanoi has been a sweet, kinda precious thing. And one of my favorites are Wednesday mornings. It&#8217;s my only weekday morning off right now, so I force myself to make the most of it: wake up at 6am to go jogging before the worst of the heat presses down. It doesn&#8217;t really help much; after ten minutes I&#8217;m a fucking slip-and-slide of sweat and after twenty minutes I&#8217;m woozy from the heat. It&#8217;s really more of an excuse to get up early&#8212;cause as it turns out, dawn is one of my favorite times in Asia and who really says, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting up early to go strolling&#8221;? Well, most of SE Asia, judging from how many people are out and about, stretching their limbs and buying vegetables and sitting on little plastic stools drinking tea. But not me&#8212;I&#8217;m the giant, red-faced tattooed girl ducking from all the low-hanging tree branches, curly fro flopping in the breeze. (Majestic, really.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I do that for twenty minutes and after I&#8217;m sweaty and disgraced enough, I go down the block and get a bowl of pho, stroll over to the market and buy some fruit, stop for a coffee, come home, shower, BLAH BLAH BLAH and I&#8217;m on the computer and (in theory) ready to write by 8am. Killer.</p>
<p>Except 8am here is 6pm on the West Coast, 9pm on the East, and a reeeeeally good time to catch up with friends. So I end up chitty-chatting for a couple hours, that Word document slowly getting buried behind Skype and IM and FB windows. Like most writers, I feel a sense of urgent, impending failure unless I&#8217;m writing 2000 words a day, but I try to reassure myself that maintaining connections with folks back home is important. Because I love my friends, but also because they know, <em>really</em> know me, in a way I often don&#8217;t know myself. (And besides, I enjoy the fuck out of a witty IM.)</p>
<p>So this morning I&#8217;m Skyping with a friend in Oakland. She&#8217;s telling me about this nightclub debacle and I&#8217;m telling her about my wading-through-sewage debacle and we&#8217;re laughing and shit. And then she goes, &#8220;You sound so much happier!&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, so this is like fourth time I&#8217;ve heard this from someone. Granted, they&#8217;re not here in person and all they&#8217;ve had to go on for the past 10 months has been my voice, maybe a grainy little video box that freezes a lot and makes my skin look yellow. But still, I think there&#8217;s something to that. You know how they say when one sense is shut down, the others become heightened? Like blind people are supposed to have mad good hearing? I don&#8217;t know if this is true but I like the sound of it and it goes along with my theory, so let&#8217;s assume. Cause it would then follow that if your only contact with someone is through their voice, you&#8217;d get pretty good at reading and gaging it.</p>
<p>So I tell her, &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re like the fourth person who&#8217;s told me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she goes, &#8220;Well do you feel happier?&#8221;</p>
<p>I answer without missing a beat: &#8220;Totally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the transition to Hanoi has been turbulent. I don&#8217;t find Hanoi a particularly accommodating city, and I had to hit the ground running. I&#8217;ve had more demoralizing breakdowns in my move to Hanoi than I did in Phnom Penh, and the air is worse and the traffic is mental and I think it might actually be hotter here.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s true, I&#8217;m happier. I&#8217;m happier in this hard-to-name, only-vaguely-aware-of way, in the same way hard-to-name, only-vaguely-aware-of way I was UNhappy in Phnom Penh. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying not to talk about it too much. One, because you don&#8217;t really wanna sound like a smug bastard and two, because I don&#8217;t know how to explain it. Why am I happier here? Life is easier in Phnom Penh in a lot of ways&#8212;it&#8217;s a smaller city, it&#8217;s less polluted, there&#8217;s more access to foreign products, food is less expensive, people are damn friendly, there&#8217;s tuk-tuks, etcetcetc. People here have asked me, you know, what was Phnom Penh like, why did I go there, why did I leave, and I usually just shrug and say, &#8220;Hanoi&#8217;s a better fit for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I keep chatting with my friend, then I pop on FB and holy shit, Angelo&#8217;s online. So we start IMing, about curly fries and an on-the-job fender bender and some ridiculous Champagne Party an eccentric millionaire gives, when holy shit, ANOTHER friend pops up. (Cause I am so damn popular. In online life.) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s this dude I knew in Cambodia. He left before I did, in March, and we haven&#8217;t talked since then. So I&#8217;m bouncing between windows&#8212;curly fries, Cambodia, curly fries, Cambodia&#8212;when Dude goes: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading your blog.&#8221; Like. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny.&#8221; Like. &#8220;And negative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>&#8220;Negative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about how hard everything is and how bummed you&#8217;ve been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to walk this line between being honest and being a total fucking Negative Nancy. Cause right now, to be honest, I&#8217;m pretty down on Cambodia. But I&#8217;ve been trying to keep my mouth shut about it, cause I know it&#8217;ll pass and that really, that&#8217;s not how I actually feel. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s really fresh; it&#8217;s like I was dating someone and I got burned. </p>
<p>Cause I didn&#8217;t hate Cambodia. It wasn&#8217;t some shithole with no redeeming qualities that I was absolutely miserable in. There were things I loved about Cambodia, loved in that full-body, heart&#8217;s-gonna-leap-outta-your-chest way that you can&#8217;t quite explain. I friggin moved there, from across the planet. </p>
<p>But things didn&#8217;t go well for me there. I went with big dreams and they totally fell through. I had to work my ass off at staying emotionally balanced and healthy, and as dramatic as it sounds, I feel like I narrowly escaped with my sanity. I loved Cambodia and it broke my fucking heart. That&#8217;s not Cambodia&#8217;s fault and it&#8217;s not mine. But it&#8217;s easier to be negative about it, to keep a mental inventory of everything that&#8217;s more developed and better here&#8212;and there&#8217;s a lot&#8212;because I&#8217;m still too close to it to look at the full picture. It doesn&#8217;t yet feel safe to delve into the complexities of why Cambodia didn&#8217;t work for me or what exactly happened to me there. Maybe it won&#8217;t ever be safe&#8212;that&#8217;s another thing I learned in my time there: that some things aren&#8217;t safe in delve into. Why did this thing or that thing happen? In a way it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m not a psychologist; I&#8217;m not a historian; I&#8217;m not a policy maker. What would the knowledge of why do for me? &#8220;If you understand, things are as they are. If you don&#8217;t understand, things are as they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking all this, secretly. But not-so-secretly, it would seem. Totally fucking obviously, perhaps.</p>
<p>So, what I&#8217;ve learned from this morning&#8217;s Skype/FB/IM marathon: I&#8217;m happier in Hanoi; I&#8217;m down on Cambodia.</p>
<p>Not exactly late-breaking news. But the truth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1618" title="Mount Everest" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mounteverest.jpg" alt="Mount Everest" width="150" height="101" hspace="6" />In mid-May, a 33-year-old Canadian woman &#8211; Shriya Shah-Klorfine &#8211; died on the side of Mount Everest.  She had reached the summit two days earlier, but succumbed – along with three other climbers &#8211; to ‘exhaustion and altitude sickness’ during the descent.  Since the first expedition up Everest in 1922, a total of 210 people have died there.  I am sure people have perished in attempts to climb other mountains as well, but thousands more reach their snowy peaks and live to tell the tale (and/or go on to scale others).  So &#8211; why do they do it? Apparently Shriya Shah-Klorfine had flown over Mount Everest in a helicopter when she was nine years old, and had dreamed of climbing it ever since.   It&#8217;s certainly not something I&#8217;d ever consider doing, but to each his (or her) own, I suppose.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1619" title="The Incredible Hulk Roller Coaster" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hulkrollercoaster.jpg" alt="The Incredible Hulk Roller Coaster" width="150" height="113" hspace="6" />People undertake activities like climbing mountains, jumping out of airplanes, running with the bulls, surfing the big waves, and other highly rigorous and/or dangerous pursuits for any number of reasons &#8211; some are adrenaline junkies or thrill seekers, some like the idea of living ‘on the edge’ and taunting death, some are simply looking for ‘the next big risk’.  Personally, I don’t mind a wickedly twisty-turney roller coaster, but that’s about as dare-devilish as I’m willing to get!</p>
<p>I recall watching an interview not too long ago during which a young woman (in her mid-twenties) discussed how she had scaled several ‘mid-sized’ mountains; she had a dozen or so more peaks she planned on conquering before her 50<sup>th</sup> birthday (Everest wasn’t one of them; she said she wanted a reasonable chance of success, and she knew her own limits).  The interviewer asked the obvious question: ‘Why climb a mountain?’ and the answer was the usual ‘quick quip’ most people expect: ‘Because it&#8217;s there’.  But the young woman went on to explain some of the joys – and challenges &#8211; of reaching a mountain peak.  I&#8217;ve paraphrased some of what she said below:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1620" title="Mountain Greenery" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mountaingreenery.jpg" alt="Mountain Greenery" width="180" height="155" hspace="6" />The mountain always looks easier to climb than it is. For one thing, it looks shorter from the bottom than it does from the top. But if you know that going in, you can accept that it’s probably going to be harder than you thought, and you won’t lose faith that you’ll make it all the way to the top.</li>
<li>The trees and the shrubbery look lush and quite pretty from a distance, but can be dense and thick and sometimes nearly impenetrable.  Paths become overgrown; occasionally you can’t find the trail markings &#8211; if there are even marked trails to follow.  You have to learn to trust your instincts as much as your map and compass.</li>
<li><img class="alignright  wp-image-1625" style="margin-left:6px;margin-right:6px;" title="Mountain View" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mountainview.jpg?w=150&h=186" alt="Mountain View" width="150" height="186" hspace="6" />Mountains don’t have smooth sides – there are rocks and ridges and valleys and creeks and rivers that you have to get through or over or around.  Every mile presents new challenges and you have to be up to accepting them and overcoming them.</li>
<li>One thing people don’t think about is that once you’re on the mountain, you can’t see the top &#8211; so you really don’t have a clear idea of where you’re going. It’s easy to get disoriented or lost if you aren’t paying attention.  You have to stay sharp, and focused, if you want to succeed.</li>
<li>The higher you climb, the more difficult the going gets, but the better the view becomes.  You absolutely have to stop once in a while to take it in and appreciate how far you&#8217;ve travelled.</li>
<li><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1621" title="Reaching The Summit" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/reachingthesummit.jpg" alt="Reaching The Summit" width="150" height="125" hspace="6" />You have to be determined to make it to the top.  You need to have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish &#8211; and once you start, you can’t give up. You’re going to slip and stumble and fall and get tired and cold and want to just turn around and go home a dozen times a day.  But if you do, then you’ll never get to the summit. And that’s what you came for – that’s the goal &#8211; so you have to just suck it up and get on with it &#8211; or you’ll never experience the exhilaration you get from achieving what you set out to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll never be a mountaineer, but everything that young woman said about mountain climbing can be seen as a metaphor for any major task you undertake in life (and not just sports-related ones, either).  You just have to apply the same mindset.  So whether it’s that 5k you want to walk (or run), that storage locker you need to clear out, that room you want to redecorate, that fancy French recipe you&#8217;ve been dying to attempt, that exercise program you’ve been avoiding, that wardrobe makeover, that new job or hobby or relationship you’ve been contemplating, remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s probably going to look easier than it actually is, but that doesn&#8217;t mean its not achievable.</li>
<li>You’ll likely face any number of obstacles, and you might occasionally lose your way, but if you trust yourself and keep moving forward, you’ll stay on track.</li>
<li>You’ll probably encounter numerous set-backs and &#8216;rocky patches&#8217; and detours along the way; work around them or get past them and keep going.</li>
<li><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1622" title="Climb Your Mountain" src="http://theothersideof55.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/climbyourmountain.gif" alt="Climb Your Mountain" width="120" height="120" hspace="6" />You have to keep the end in mind; stay focused and don’t become discouraged or get distracted from achieving what you set out to accomplish.</li>
<li>The closer you get to your goal, the more difficult it might seem to reach it; stop every once in a while and ‘take in the view’ – recognize what you&#8217;ve accomplished at each step along the way, then continue ‘ onward and upwards’.</li>
<li>Don’t give up – no matter how many problems you face or how many times you want to give up and ‘go home’, envision what it is that you set out to do &#8211; and go out and do it.  Then revel in the sense of accomplishment you&#8217;ll feel when you reach the summit (and remember: no matter how large or small it may seem, any goal you set for yourself is worth achieving).</li>
</ul>
<p>I may not know WHY anyone would want to climb a mountain, but I do know HOW they do it – one step at a time.  So get out there and find your own personal ‘mountain’ and start climbing it, one step at a time.  You don’t even have to wait until you’re on … the other side of 55.</p>
