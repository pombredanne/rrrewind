				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rumors you&#8217;ve been hearing. They&#8217;re true.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Salad cancels out bacon. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2>The Salad-Cancels-Out-Bacon Rule</h2>
<p>This logic is derived from a spectrum of proven theories, derived as follows, in a highly scien-matical, derive-atory way:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. First, we establish that the <strong><em>ratio of bacon to salad</em></strong> is the same, that is:</p>
<p><strong><em>bacon:salad = true</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p>We can now proceed in applying the laws of cross-multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>2. In particular, we make use of the cross-cancellation laws, such that:<br />
<strong style="font-style:italic;">bacon/salad * salad/bacon = 1</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>3. Because we slash-ed-ed both the <strong><em>bacon </em></strong>and<em> </em><strong><em>salad </em></strong>factors like they&#8217;re imaginary, we&#8217;re obligated to multiply our remainder by <em><strong>i</strong></em> (the infamous &#8220;imaginary number&#8221;). Like this:</p>
<p><strong><em>      1 * i </em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>4. And <strong><em>i</em></strong>, being imaginary and all, stands for nothing tangible, therefore:<br />
<strong><em>i =</em></strong><em> <strong>0   </strong>carried through as<strong>   1 * 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>5. As everyone knows, anything multiplied by zero = 0  therefore expressed as,</p>
<p><i>      </i><em><strong>1 * i</strong><strong> = 0    </strong></em>or<em><strong>   1 * 0 = 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>6. To conclude and prove that</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;line-height:1.625;"><em>salad cancels out bacon</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">See Mr. Willet? I WAS paying attention in AP Calculus. </span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">And heck! You were right. I DID find a practical application for this math stuff.</span></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the cable car to take us to the top of Mount Korek, I’m stunned by the beauty that surrounds me. Bright white snow-capped mountains are all around. They glisten in the sunshine and despite the sub-zero temperatures give off a warm glow. And all is peaceful.  A sharp contrast, I imagine, to 20 years ago,  when gunfire must have echoed among these mountains and blood stained the snow.<a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignright" id="i-164" alt="Me at the top of Mount Korek" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg?w=244&#038;h=244" width="244" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>But this no longer the battleground of Iraqi Kurds and Saddam Hussein’s regime. Thanks in part to a no-fly zone put in place 21 years ago, during the first Iraq war, and the more recent US-led invasion of 2003, some tranquillity has returned. The fall of the former dictator has given a once-persecuted people the security to rebuild and develop this now semi-autonomous region.</p>
<p>Much safer than the south, northern Iraq has even become popular as a tourist destination for Iranians and Turks and those living in the South of he country. The cable car is just one of many new ventures.</p>
<p>As we ascend the steel cable, my guide Dr. Douglas Layton explains how the area has come to be called “the other Iraq”. “So much was demolished by Saddam Hussein” he says.  4.500 villages, 95% of the region. There were no eggs in the bazaar because the chickens had all been killed. Nothing. Nothing, but a little fuel, and a few cars. “</p>
<p>Now though, he says it’s <strong><em>emerging from the ashes.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-168" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg?w=273&#038;h=273" width="273" height="273" /></a>We are the first to try out the cable car and when we reach the top,  the technicians are revelling in their triumph. The generator thawed, the cable car worked and all is ready to receive the first group of tourists. Out comes the celebratory sweet tea to warm us up.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that anyone might choose to go to Iraq on their holidays, but last year the north of the country attracted 2 million visitors. The government hopes that will rise to 5 million this year.</p>
<p>Since it opened the doors to domestic and foreign investment in 2006, billions of dollars have been pouring into the region. A newly-built state of the art airport in the capital Erbil and around 500 hotels now await their visitors. From the viewing platform at Mount Korek, half-built ski chalets line the horizon.</p>
<p>But as Douglas tells me, the outside world is still not convinced it’s safe to come here.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 465px"><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg"><img class=" wp-image " id="i-171" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg?w=455&#038;h=303" width="455" height="303" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">© Ryan Youngblood</p></div>
<p>It is not surprising when you consider the continuing disputes over oil and borders. As we sip tea and admire the views,  200 km south in Kirkuk a building, belonging to a group of elderly Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, is blown to pieces by a suicide bomber.  Their armchairs were ripped apart by the blast, their playing cards stuck to the blood on the floor.</p>
<p>When such incidents make international news headlines, it does not help the tourist board trying to sell the rest of Kurdistan as a safe and beautiful part of the world. But our drive back towards Erbil IS beautiful. We pass sweet stalls, families barbequeing, couples cuddling beneath waterfalls and children throwing snowballs at each other. Huge icicles hang down from the rocky canyon above us.</p>
<p>Below us we can see the original Hamilton road, built by a New Zealand engineer in the 1920s. Winding its way through the mountains it’s a miracle the project  was ever finished. Before even beginning to chisel and dynamite his way through the rocks, Archibald Hamilton had to unite the feuding tribesmen who’d been recruited to work for him.</p>
<p>I wonder what he would make of the melting pot that is Iraqi Kurdistan now. A mixture of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen – Christians and Muslims – who for the most part tell me, they live peacefully side by side.</p>
<p>Ten years after the invasion, this region and its people are moving on.</p>
<div>
<p>Perhaps the mountains are not the Kurds&#8217; only friends.. as the proverb says. Perhaps they are making new ones. New friends from the south, in search of peace and friends from further afield &#8211; keen to hit the open Hamilton road and discover the place they call “the other Iraq”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>It’s 2AM and your phone has just buzzed you awake, filling the room in white-blue LED light. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>You have a message. It’s a photo. No words, no explanation. Just a photo. Tell us all about it. And what happens next.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p>Startled by the sudden introduction of hazy blue light I awake from my slumber hearing the quiet but melodic tune of my phone. Glancing at the clock on the bedside table I realise it is 2am and grab my phone. Fear of an emergency makes my heart race.</p>
<p>Unlocking my phone I am greeted with a picture where written on a crumpled napkin are the words “Where were you?”</p>
<p>I check the number but don’t know of it.</p>
<p>My boyfriend begins to stir. I quickly grab a cardigan and move to the other room gently stepping over the creaky floorboards that we have yet to repair and head down the stairs, phone in hand. I flick on the kettle and reopen the message. The number means nothing to me.  The image means nothing to me yet the writing seems familiar.</p>
<p>I sit down after pouring myself a mug of coffee and continue to gaze at the phone. Why is this bothering me so much? Spock, the cat, nudges the phone and I grumble and push him towards his food bowl.</p>
<p>“Not now.”</p>
<p>I put the phone down and gaze into the darkness of the window and the reflection of myself as my phone snaps me back into reality. I open the message and am greeted with an image similar to the last only the words have changed. I hear the thud of my own heart as I read again the words written on this new image, “I’m not waiting here for you any longer, I’m on my way.” Almost visible at the edge of the napkin are the last three letters of my post code.</p>
<p>I decide to text them, what else can I do?</p>
<p>New message. “Who is this? Sorry I don’t have your number saved.”</p>
<p>God why am I always so apologetic.</p>
<p>I sip at my coffee and hear movement upstairs. I remain quiet as I hear him rolling over in bed and settle back down. Spock wanders across the table pacing, he seems as stressed as me.</p>
<p>Minutes pass and no answer. I look at the clock it’s 2:22am. I grab my phone and dial the number it cuts straight to an automated message which very politely informs me this number is not recognised. I hang up and reopen the message.</p>
<p>This is some kind of joke; obviously someone I know has a strange sense of humour.</p>
<p>I place the mug in the sink and turn to leave the kitchen as I hear a faint tap on the back door. I look at the window but can see nothing outside. Somehow the night seems darker than ever as I move to the hallway and go to call up the stairs I hear the back door move but not open. I feel the temperature drop and watch as Spock backs into the corner of the kitchen.</p>
<p>A voice in my head echoes with the words “I said I would come.” A voice that reminds me of love, loss and will now forever more remind me of fear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/writing-challenge-nighttime-photo/#more-16692" target="_blank"> Today&#8217;s writing challenge</a> hosted by <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/about-the-daily-post/" target="_blank">The Daily Post at WordPress.com</a>  got my blog juices flowing two days earlier this week. The prompt:</p>
<p><em>It’s 2AM and your phone has just buzzed you awake, filling the room in white-blue LED light. You have a message. It’s a photo. No words, no explanation. Just a photo. Tell us all about it. And what happens next..</em></p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>I love my ring tone, but not at 2 A.M.</p>
<p>Every hair on my body, including the fine almost non-existent ones behind my knees, jumps to attention. There isn’t a down comforter in the world capable of warming the chill running through me. Something must be terribly wrong.<span id="more-792"></span> Unless someone has been dumped by a boy or girlfriend, is drunk and can&#8217;t drive, or has been in an accident, everyone has specific instructions not to call me in the dead of night – even if someone has died. Sounds cruel, I know, but my reasoning is that I’d be in better shape after a good night’s sleep to deal with something that terrible. Dead is dead &#8211; and there would be plenty of time for tears in the morning. That said, I know no one has died. Thank God.</p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>My heart pounds – not only in my chest. My ears throb. My throat closes. Someone must be hurt. I roll over and snatch the phone from the bedside table. For a split second, my hand over the screen casts an eerie shadow on the ceiling. It’s nothing like the happy barking dogs or free flying birds we made with our flashlights as kids.</p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>I slide a trembling finger across the bar – it’s a photo. She must have been a beauty. You could tell, even though her smooth olive skin was cracked, swollen, and smeared red. Her velvety blue eyes are barely noticeable from between the pair of luxurious long-lash-Maybelline painted slits. I am so mesmerized by her vacant stare that I don’t notice the thin red line across her throat right away. My free hand smacks against my mouth. It would muffle a shriek except the sound is caught behind the dam of frozen bile in my throat. Chest heaving, I</p>
<p>QUACK!</p>
<p>The text message reads<i>, &#8220;Sorry, Mom. I was up late, working on that model for the book cover. Since you’re up now, what do ya think? Realistic enough?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Thank you DPChallenge! This was an awful lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I don&#8217;t exactly wake up from the sound of the phone, but rather my husband&#8217;s elbow in my stomach.  &#8220;How many times do I need to ask you to turn your phone off before you go to bed?&#8221;  He shoves me to my side of the bed, towards my bedside table with a flickering phone on top of it, like a beacon in the darkness of our small bedroom.  I know my husband isn&#8217;t an angry guy, he just doesn&#8217;t want to wake our four-month-old and have to try to sleep to the sounds of crying baby. I quickly put the phone on silent and habitually tap the fluorescent green Messages window on my iPhone.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>At first, my groggy mind isn&#8217;t quite sure what I am looking at, but then I snort loudly trying to contain my laughter and get shoved in my stomach once again.  </strong><strong>&#8220;Will you turn this damn thing off and stop radiating my head?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><strong>I stick my head under the comforter and zoom in on the picture of my old neighbor Xander.  In the snapshot, he is wearing my brother&#8217;s old baseball cap that says Goofy (quite appropriately!) above the velcro, that the latter left during one of his visits home.  How did it end up on Xander&#8217;s head? I try to think back to the last time he and my brother interacted?  And the last time he and I interacted?…</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Anyway, he is wearing a cap backwards as well as the very apparent blue eye shadow, generous strokes of blush and pink lipgloss.  Because its 2AM, i think even slower than I have already been thinking ever since the influx of hormones from my fourth pregnancy.  Why is Xander wearing makeup and my brother&#8217;s baseball cap?  Why did he send me this picture in the middle of the night? </strong></p>
<p><strong>For a second I think that maybe he decided to come out of the closet, the way I accidentally forced my friend Jordan to come out in high school.  We were all at a big Thanksgiving dinner at Jordan&#8217;s house &#8211; my mom, her boyfriend, my brother with his first wife, me and my then boyfriend Drake with his mom, Drake&#8217;s cousin Jordan, his parents and some more relatives I can&#8217;t recall… I was quite sure that Jordan was gay and even more sure that it was common knowledge.  He was seventeen, gorgeous and showed absolutely zero interest in all the slutty girls in our high school that were throwing themselves at him. He dressed with an effortless cool, was neater than our school principal and knew every Madonna song by heart.  When my boyfriend&#8217;s mom, Jordan&#8217;s aunt, asked Jordan why he wasn&#8217;t playing football for our high school &#8211; &#8220;You have the looks and the physique, hun..&#8221; I blurted out  without pausing to think (unfortunately, I never outgrew this habit) &#8211; &#8220;Yeah, J, why not? Imagine all those dreamy Seniors tackling you to the ground.&#8221;  Jordan chocked on whatever he just put in his mouth, gave me an evil stare and quickly left the table.  As everyone got silent, I wanted to stick my foot in my mouth and choke on it to change the focus, but it was too late.  When i think back to it, however, I don&#8217;t even think my stupid comment was that obvious, but clearly Jordan wasn&#8217;t ready for these type of pronouncements or jokes.  Neither were his parents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>But back to Xander..  Did he decide to come out to me at 2AM?  But the more i stared at the picture, the less oxygen I had under the new thick comforter that we just got at Kmart last week, the more I wished i could say that all this rouge and ridiculous make-up made him look less manly or less brute…</strong></p>
<p><strong>He and I became friends when we were ten.  I started fifth grade and he was the new kid that year.  He was athletic and very funny;  popular with the girls, so for a while, I didn&#8217;t approach him.  I was always easily intimidated by popularity.  Towards the middle of the year our class went on our annual field trip &#8211; to an ice-skating rink.  While my friend Sarah and I were holding on to each other, desperately trying to stay upright, she pointed out that he was looking at me.  I wanted to be half as cool as the other girls he hung out with, so I inquired: &#8220;What are you staring at?&#8221;  He shrugged and skated off.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Back on the school bus he plopped right next to me before Sarah could say a word in protest.  &#8220;Your mom is really nice,&#8221; he said, and I found out that his older brother was in my mom&#8217;s class at the technical school down the street from our house, where my mom held her second job to pay for the house after my dad left us.  I don&#8217;t remember what else we talked about that day but our friendship progressed.  We walked to school and from school and sat together at lunch.  Sometimes he carried my backpack and at other times he hit me on the head with it.  We usually went to his house to do homework but ended up playing board games on top of an old wooden storage cabinet, so his younger brother Finn couldn&#8217;t get to us and steal all the game pieces.   When we got sick of board games we got more adventurous.  Sometimes, we jumped from the top of the storage cabinet across the room onto his sofa bed.  One time Xander missed, hit his head on the metal bed-frame and ended up in that same bed for three weeks with a severe concussion.  And it wasn&#8217;t even his first concussion, as he was proud to announce in class, three weeks later. Two years prior to the jumping incident, he slipped while blatantly ignoring the stupid sign &#8220;No Running&#8221; at the kiddie pool at the Y, rattled his brains quite a bit against the old cracked tile and ended up in the hospital for a while. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>For three weeks, I brought him homework every afternoon but mostly stories of what happened at school while he was missing all the fun. I lay next to him for what seemed like an eternity, we were eleven, have been best friends for almost two years, and it didn&#8217;t seem awkward, except one time.  While watching some old movie on the vcr his dad only  let him have in his room for the time that he was on bed rest, we fell asleep.  When we woke up, his mom was standing over us saying that it was very late and time for me to go home.  I felt as though I was caught doing something wrong, I just wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was.  Other than that aforementioned moment that as a child, I desperately tried to erase from my memory; I would shudder nervously when it would creep back up to the forefront of my recollection of memorable recent events; the three weeks on his sofa with as much potato chips as we wanted and more movies than we have seen in the entire year prior were nothing but unabashed joy (at least to me, as I was not the one with a severe concussion).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>And then I remembered.  Four summers ago, when Gaby was only 2 and my husband and I took her and our older son and drove down to the Outer Banks for a week in August. My brother came there too with his daughter, he and his third wife were on the brink of divorce, and we shared a small house in Corolla right on the beach.   We ran into Xander during our second night there while scanning the menu at the door of one of those seemingly plain looking restaurants that end up costing a fortune because they are the hidden treasure of the islands that are not so hidden anymore.  Gaby was crying because she missed her nap, and because my husband and I had a big fight in the car on the way to dinner, and it always took her a long time to calm down.  It still does.  Last week, her first grade teacher told her that she can&#8217;t chase boys during recess because its unladylike and because it will make boys not like her, she cried from 11am until the time I picked her up.  Her teacher, Mrs. B, told me that I need to show her to a specialist, because no normal child can cry for three hours because of a meaningless comment.  But, anyway, Gaby was crying and my husband was trying to read the menu and decide whether or not we will have enough money to last through the remaining 5 days if we eat at this particular establishment.  Then I turned around and saw Xander and a skinny blonde woman in a lime spaghetti-strap dress with a white cardigan neatly thrown over her shoulders.  My first thought was that I don&#8217;t remember last time I wore white.  My second thought was interrupted with Xander&#8217;s arms around me &#8211; &#8220;Quit stalking me, T&#8221; &#8211; he laughed loud in my ear and pressed me just long enough for me to realize he smelled the same, a cocktail of hay thats been out in the sun too long, oranges and childhood.  He always called me T, even though I always thought that Tina is already short enough.  We had dinner and went home to put Gaby to bed. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>That night my husband and my son watched Mighty Ducks on tv, while I washed the dishes and thought of a night in November when I was walking home from school and ran into Xander holding Ellie&#8217;s hand.  I didn&#8217;t expect it to feel the way it did, because it was he first time I felt this proverbial ground disappear below my feet…I struggled to find my balance and when I did, I asked them how they were doing?  Ellie looked beautiful.  Her cheeks were flushed from the November cold and the lack of warm clothing.  She was wearing a tight black hoodie unzipped, revealing a white fitted t-shirt with some perfectly sparkling design and great jeans that I only ever saw in teen magazines.  Everyone knew that Ellie was &#8216;experienced&#8217; with boys.  There was even gossip that she got her experience from her mom&#8217;s second husband.  But to this day, I hope it was only jealousy fueling the imagination of my classmates, and not real events.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>After that November day, Xander and I saw each other less and less. I ran into him with various girls and in various compromising positions and after a while I stopped noticing it as much.  Only that November evening got imprinted, perhaps, because my mom couldn&#8217;t afford warm clothes that year, but I wasn&#8217;t cool enough to go around without them like Ellie, and who was I kidding, my mom would never let me…long story short, my mom bought a long winter coat from our 45-year-old neighbor Anne. There they were &#8211; impeccably dressed, holding hands and there I was &#8211; in Anne&#8217;s old grey coat that reached all the way to the ground but couldn&#8217;t hide me from the pain.  My mom never did find out why i cried all night in my room and why i never again wore that coat no matter how much she threatened to ground me indefinitely. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Towards the end of our week in Corolla, my husband and my brother invited Xander and his wife to our rental house for some drinks; a small goodbye gathering to celebrate the end of our vacation and a big reason to drink which neither my husband nor my brother could ever refuse.  The house was tiny, space limited and the louder the men got the more scared were the kids.  I sympathized because I very well remembered that long before my dad left, he used to drink and behave in a way that frightened five-year-old me without really giving any reason, other than the fact that he acted differently that the dad i knew.  Girls are always more sensitive and more easily frightened, so I gave Gaby and my brother&#8217;s daughter my makeup case to distract them from the drunken state of their fathers.  I don&#8217;t remember how Xander ended up as the Gaby and her older cousin&#8217;s first client but he ended up lying on the floor while a toddler and a kindergartener were applying his makeup. My brother&#8217;s daughter said that he needs to gel his hair back so he looks like a beautiful girl, which is when Xander&#8217;s patience ran out and he said, &#8220;Enough girls, let me talk to grownups for a bit.&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t want Gaby to start her wailing so I took the cap off of my brother&#8217;s head and placed it backwards on Xander&#8217;s head.  I was stunned at how manly he looked with all this make up on, his features were blatantly staring at me reminding me of everything that pulled me back to my childhood, when no one woke me up six times in one night and when I thought that I will grow up and be famous.  He was beautiful &#8211; strong and so familiar.  I held back my breathe but must have been very obvious because I noticed that he was looking directly at me.  I thought that I shouldn&#8217;t have had that second glass of Asti because I was seeing things.  I don&#8217;t remember how Xander and I ended up alone in the kitchen, but there we were and it was just us, not counting the loud commotion just a thin wall away.   He walked towards me and I thought he would ask me if I ever regretted not being with him, the way beautiful, glossy haired heroines always get asked in the end of sappy romantic films, my husband and I sometimes see at the cinema on Fridays when our neighbor agrees to watch the kids….But he didn&#8217;t say anything.  He put his entire hand on my hair and firmly pressed against my head.   He moved his hand down along the length of my hair and played with the strands for a mere second before stepping back as we both heard footsteps.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>I didn&#8217;t know that someone took a picture of him that day.  And a blurry closeup too.  He is staring right in the phone camera, his brown eyes laughing and piercingly intense at the same time.  It must have been his wife who took the picture because I doubt my brother or my husband would text him the shot, as neither is big on texting.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I turn off my phone.  I think off putting it on airplane mode, but am worried that the light will wake my husband and baby.  The comforter is no longer over my head and I can breathe.  The air feels cold against my overheated face and shoulders.  I must have been starved for oxygen because i just lose myself in this sensation for a while and think about how little we value things that are basic and given and always right here, just like this fresh cool air…   </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My eyelids finally rested and gradually my eyes were comforted by the darkness. My body was finally about to taste comfort after lingering hours of frustrating attempts to fall asleep, but then I heard it. I heard my phone ring, it was 2 a.m. Slowly, I wrapped my fingers around my phone and with so much effort tried to open my somnolent eyes. I saw his name and all the questions in the world raced through my brain, and for a second the only thing I heard were my heart beats. What could he possibly want at this time? Was he trying to ruin all the efforts I&#8217;ve put into deleting every second of happiness I&#8217;ve breathed while in his arms, every tear of sadness that burned my soul, every heartbeat that emphasized that I loved him more than I could love anything or anyone ?</p>
<p>A simple text that is yet to be seen. Yet to be discovered could ruin everything. It could infuriate the waves that I&#8217;ve spent a lifetime soothing, it could awaken them again after I thought they were finally asleep. I slide my frightened thumb across the screen, while my whole body is in agony. It&#8217;s a picture; a picture of us. A picture of a resplendent past, that once succeeded at making a despondent person see with eyes full of faith and dreams. A past where the fairytales I watched as a child were at the palm of my hands. For minutes that seemed like a lifetime I stared at our smiles, trying to figure out what went wrong. Trying to understand how our happiness could vanish, how all this laughter turned into emptiness within a fraction of a second. Attempting to figure out how all the meanings underlying his touch disappeared, where does it all go?</p>
<p>He then emerged into our room, and said with his constantly exhausted voice, looking at me like a damaged child &#8220;Remember that day? When I proposed to you? It was a beautiful day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a tear peeking through the edges of my eyes, I nod and place the phone where it belongs. I feel his warm body rest next to me. Yet I feel like there are thousands of miles separating us, a thousand screams blocking his voice. I place my head softly on my pillow and play back the moments where I was naive enough to think it could get better. I think about all the times that he promised me that he&#8217;d change. Yet all I can see now is a future full of broken promises and flooded with tragic disappointments. </p></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Goodbyes never get easier, or perhaps they do if you say them often enough. There are times when I think I’ve figured out how to deal with people who bemoan my departure long before I’m even gone. Ultimately, I know the flippant comments, curious questions and heartfelt sentiments have nothing to do with me. They’re about people finding a way to cope with the various changes that come to all of us. Yet, while I might be aware of this reality I can’t help but bristle with each “I’ll miss you” thrown in my direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>These are the times when I think the heart just might be a muscle.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/change.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1980" alt="change" src="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/change.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thwack</i> is the sound my palm makes, carrying the weight of compressed fury behind it. I’m barely able to get my body out of the way before the car breaks and another flesh-on-metal collision is avoided. I clutch a heap of dry cleaning against my chest as I push off the steel and cast-iron beast, shooting the driver a withering look of contempt. In that instant I’m reminded of all the countless near-impacts and crushing harassment over the years and so I conjure up as much filthy Arabic as I can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Are you stupid?” the man yells in broken English, his right hand on the wheel as the left presses his Blackberry against his ear.</p>
<p>“<i>Tozafeek 3ars</i> I’m trying to cross the road! What part of that did you miss?” Hitting the hood again I stomp down the street and wave my arms in the air. Another woman gone mad, muttering <i>ibn el mitnaka</i> the whole way home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fuck yeah. The heart is a muscle.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3077.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1978" alt="the intolerants" src="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3077.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Here. There. Everywhere. Nowhere</i>. I live between spaces, trying on places and sprinkle little pieces of myself – in the spirit of Gretel – along every step of the way. From Beirut to Berlin or Brussels to Bangkok, there are times I can’t figure out whether I’m coming or going. I sometimes feel I’m residing in the pockets between moments, the pregnant pauses that feed memory and give substance to this thing called life. I carry the marks of each place I’ve been, their outlines (all blurred around the edges) resting heavy and like nuclear imprints they leave long shadows that creep down the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reminders that are radioactive to the touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The heart is perhaps something between an organ and a muscle.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_5883.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1976" alt="the intolerants" src="http://fortheintolerants.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_5883.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Cairo</i>. I may not like her that much, but I’ve become familiar with her persona. I know the sound of her voice and the way her bosom heaves under the weight of expectations. I know how she tastes (astringent and salty). I’m quite aware of how she looks (grainy and textured). I’m well acquainted with her demeanor (highly mercurial and schizophrenic) and I know she smells like sandstorms and dustbins slightly tinged with desperation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sit for a long time on the floor of my empty flat. Every movement echoes, with vibrations rippling down the corridor of my ears and lapping against shores of soft membrane and hidden cartilage. The sound is cold and alien, suggestive of yearning and absence. It wasn’t so long ago that my flat was stuffed with trinkets, furniture and people. With reminders and memory, and all that other stuff <i>home</i> is made of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82470961"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I find it amusing in that moment that it took less than two hours for movers to compress my life into a stack of marked boxes. It&#8217;s strange in some ways, but really it’s not, because everything has come full circle. We&#8217;re at the cusp of another beginning. I arrived in Cairo empty, but now I am full again. What started as a newly occupied apartment is vacant once more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Cairo&#8217;s long shadow has marked me, there&#8217;s no way I can forget her now. And with that, I stand up and brush off my jeans. I wipe the dust from my face, because I know every fresh start needs an ending to arise from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:13px;">That&#8217;s how new adventures begin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thud. Clunk. Lurch. Moan.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The heart is much more than a muscle.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/elephantitus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" alt="ELEPHANTITUS" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/elephantitus.jpg?w=584&#038;h=104" width="584" height="104" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-123 aligncenter" alt="fat cat 1" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fat-cat-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=266" width="300" height="266" /></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">We have all heard the statistics. Eight in ten American adults are overweight. One in three American kids and teens are overweight, but through all this we have turned a blind eye to one of our most beloved demographics. Recently conducted studies show that one in two domestic cats in the United States are overweight. We let them into our house. We let them sit on our keyboards when we are attempting to write articles, but we have turned a blind eye to the plague that haunts them as much as it hurts each of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';"><b>Why are cats overweight?</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fat-cat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-128 aligncenter" alt="fat cat" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fat-cat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=246" width="300" height="246" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">The short answer is they are eating too much, and not moving enough. Overly affectionate owners feel no shame in feeding their cats massive amounts of Fancy Feast or Whiskas. We have become enablers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">But the blame doesn&#8217;t stop there. Fancy Feast recently announced their newest food lineup including Kentucky Fried Chicken and Double Quarter Pounder. It is time we hold these companies accountable for choices they are giving us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/garfield.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-124 aligncenter" alt="Garfield" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/garfield.gif?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">It goes deeper than that, though. As is the case with most epidemics, we can see roots in feline obesity stemming easily from popular culture. Garfield is a glorified figure in the world of cats. Held on a pedestal for his negative attitude, extreme laziness and centrally, his excessive lust for lasagna. We have gotten to a point in society where lasagna is an acceptable eating option for cat kind. What they don&#8217;t tell you is excessive eating leads to depression. Grumpy cat became an overnight sensation simply for his negative attitudes, and not surprisingly, he too is overweight. When asked to comment, he said, &#8220;NO.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/grumpy-cat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125 aligncenter" alt="grumpy cat" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/grumpy-cat.jpg?w=243&#038;h=300" width="243" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';"><b>Cats in Africa</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cheetah.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-126" alt="cheetah" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cheetah.jpg?w=216&#038;h=162" width="216" height="162" /></a><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lazy-cat.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-127" alt="lazy cat" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lazy-cat.jpg?w=216&#038;h=169" width="216" height="169" /></a></p>
<p><i>In the first picture we get a glimpse at the lifestyle of African cats. In the second we get an honest, but shocking view at the ways of the American cat.</i></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">It&#8217;s easy to say that this is a struggle all over the world, but that would be in falsity. I turn our attention to Africa, where cats are renowned for their physical prowess, and their speed. The average African cheetah can run at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour, whereas the average American domestic cat tops out at 30 miles per hour, though usually they couldn&#8217;t be bothered to move faster than 2 to 3 mph.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';"><b>Where do we go from here?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Luckily, we have a chance to turn this all around. Just recently, national gym chains have launched new incentives for cat fitness programs. Don&#8217;t be surprised in the upcoming months when you go to the gym and see miniature treadmills and miniature stationary bikes. A craze that&#8217;s already gaining popularity is Cat Zumba, though gyms are still struggling to gain interest in Aquatic Yoga.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fitness-kitty.jpg"><img alt="fitness kitty" src="http://guerrillagraffitimagazine.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fitness-kitty.jpg?w=300&#038;h=231" width="300" height="231" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#010101;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Feline obesity is an epidemic of unimagined proportions, but the first step is recognizing the issue. Be mindful of your cat. Sit down and talk to them about late night snacking and the dangers of using food as an emotional escape. We&#8217;ve lost sight of our responsibility for our furry friends, but if we remind our cats that they too have self-control, and set a good example, we could become a nation that can stand proudly on those weird cat scales at the veterinarian, and lead the way in cat fitness and nutrition.</span></p>

Senor de Leon would undoubtedly be shocked to discover that Florida has become NOT the place to maintain one&#8217;s youth but, instead and for many, the final destination before the grave. It&#8217;s a veritable &#8220;hot spot&#8221; for The Grim Reaper! Why should he haul that heavy scythe all over creation when he can knock off, in a manner of speaking, most of his &#8220;to-do&#8221; list with a short jaunt to sunny Florida? I have no personal experience with The GR myself, but one would think that, having made his career in the business of death throughout the whole history of humankind, he would appreciate the kind of one-stop shopping and increased productivity that a place like Florida would afforded him.</p>
<p>I have been giving this whole idea of a more youthful appearance a great deal of thought lately. I have been toying with the idea of disposing of the boxes of hair dye that are currently taking up space in my closet. These boxes are my own version of &#8220;The Fountain of Youth&#8221;. You didn&#8217;t really think I was going to write about Ponce de Leon and The Grim Reaper, did you? </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been graying since my twenties. It&#8217;s hereditary. My father had a full head of gray hair by the time he was forty. He likes to blame it on having four daughters, but we know better now. Studies have shown that gray hair, like baldness, hirsuteness, and most other physical (and mental) characteristics, are marked on our DNA. In other words, many of us are just plain doomed by our faulty genetics.</p>
<p>No one wants to be &#8220;marked&#8221; as old at the age of twenty-five. And, let&#8217;s be honest, gray hair is synonymous with old age. Nothing, and I mean nothing, screams &#8220;you&#8217;re aging!&#8221; quite like gray hair. Unlike losing one&#8217;s hair or having so much body hair that one could be mistaken in the dark for a Sasquatch, those of us who suffer from premature graying can just throw a box of hair dye into our shopping carts and painlessly (unless you get it in your eye!) and fairly quickly, solve the problem. Unlike our hairless or our excessively hairy friends, we don&#8217;t need daily doses of expensive prescription salves to halt our hair loss; we don&#8217;t need to subject our bodies to painful waxes or electrolysis treatments to rid ourselves of the extra coat of fur that our prehistoric ancestors needed for warmth but that is now, here in the 21st Century, just plain unsightly. I suppose, put in perspective, those of us whose afflictions can be solved with a six-dollar box of hair dye have it relatively easy.</p>
<p>At some point, usually by the time we reach our forties, graying ceases to be &#8220;premature&#8221; and gives way to just plain graying. Our friends and coworkers catch up to those of us who have suffered long and, usually, in silence. I knew this was the case when, beginning a few years ago, I could not run into one of my cohorts in the grocery store, the drug store, or, even the local Target, without spying the box of hair dye in their shopping cart. If I looked closely, (and I did!) I could almost always find it &#8212; usually hidden amongst other necessities like eggs, anti-perspirant, or that cute pair of trendy flats! (Why they thought they needed to engage in shopping cart subterfuge, I&#8217;ll never know.) </p>
<p>Sure, there are always a few women who don&#8217;t buy into covering up their graying locks. These women, generally speaking, tend to fall into two categories. They are either the bland and dowdy types who shop for the few cosmetics that they carelessly apply (only on special occasions!) at the dollar store (even I don&#8217;t buy make-up at the dollar store!) or they are the environmentally-conscious health food nuts who wouldn&#8217;t dream of putting chemicals on their heads (so close to their brains!). Either way, they&#8217;re not &#8220;my peeps&#8221;. These women are definitely NOT the ones with the leopard-print flats in their Target cart. More likely, they&#8217;re hiding things like support hose or flax seed oil in those bright red baskets. I&#8217;m no statistician, but I would, based on my own vast experience, go out on a limb and make the claim that these fortyish hair dye eschewing/support hose wearing/flax seed ingesting consumers are the exception, not the rule! </p>
<p>Lately, though, I have been thinking more and more about joining them. No. I haven&#8217;t taken up granola-crunching, but I did, just recently, begin a flax seed regimen (because of my dry eyes!). You won&#8217;t find me shopping for outdated Maybelline at the dollar store anytime soon and I think I&#8217;ll hold off on the support hose, at least for a few more years, but it may be time to throw in the towel where the hair dye is concerned. It&#8217;s become, quite frankly, a very time, energy, and money sucking battle with the bottle &#8212; one that I am, by the way, losing. (Already having lost one battle with the bottle, I simply may not have it in me to lose another!)  </p>
<p>Part of the reason I haven&#8217;t, thus far, just done it already is because I am, and I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit this, vain. I don&#8217;t want to look older than I already am. I don&#8217;t consider forty-seven to be all that old, but it&#8217;s not all that young either. While I certainly understand that age is relative, I also work in a very youthful environment. At the end of a long shift I have a tendency to grow tired and lose my patience. On some level we all do, regardless of our ages, but my fear is that IF I stop dying my hair I will be perceived NOT just as fatigued and exasperated, but as old and cranky. I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;m NOT old and cranky. I&#8217;m saying that I don&#8217;t want OTHER people, YOUNGER people (who, by the way, I can still run circles around) to perceive me as such. </p>
<p>The other decision that I must make, IF I decide to stop dyeing my hair, is whether to dye my whole prodigious head of hair gray or to cut off the rather large and very long portion of my hair that is still brownish (as a result of various bottles of Miss Clairol, L&#8217;Oreal, or whatever brand was on sale). I know that the &#8220;ombre&#8221; look is &#8220;in&#8221;, but the gray on the top, brown on the bottom variation that I am currently sporting is more &#8220;two-tone&#8221; than it is &#8220;ombre&#8221;. I love Pepe LePew as much as the next gal. I do not, however, want to LOOK like him. (Nor would I want to smell like him, but that&#8217;s a whole other subject!) In order to avoid this &#8212; the looking like Pepe, NOT the smelling like Pepe &#8212; I must choose between two styles: The Jamie Leigh Curtis or The Emmylou Harris. </p>
<p>Jamie Leigh manages her style because she has such fine bone structure and because, let&#8217;s face it, she&#8217;s thin. Thin, successful actresses can wear almost any hairstyle. Emmylou pulls it off because she&#8217;s a musician. Those musicians can get away with almost anything. Also, she&#8217;s got the aging hippie thing going on. That doesn&#8217;t hurt. I am neither thin nor successful. I&#8217;m not Hollywood royalty, nor am I a world-renowned singer-songwriter. While I like to think of myself as a free spirit, it&#8217;s safe to say that no one would ever describe me as a hippie (or, come to think of it, hip). </p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s a dilemma. To dye or not to dye. To cut or not to cut. Maybe I should just move to Florida now. I could shave my head and invest in a couple of wigs. Because I don&#8217;t even want to get into with you what tropic-like humidity does to my hair. I know. I know. Florida is not &#8220;technically&#8221; the tropics, but still &#8212; two words spring to mind: Roseanne Roseannadanna.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the big challenges facing journalists writing about science is to summarize a scientific subject accurately, clearly and succinctly. Sometimes one of the three requirements is sacrificed, and sadly, it is often the first one.</p>
<p>So here is my latest (but surely not last) attempt at an accurate, succinct, and maybe even clear summary of why the Higgs business matters so much.</p>
<p><strong>`True&#8217; Statements about the Higgs</strong></p>
<p>True means &#8220;as true as anything compressed into four sentences can possibly be&#8221; &#8212; i.e., very close to true.  For those who want to know where I&#8217;m cutting important corners, a list of caveats will follow at the end of the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our very existence depends upon the Higgs field, which pervades the universe and gives elementary particles, including electrons, their masses.  Without mass, electrons could not form atoms, the building blocks of our bodies and of all ordinary matter.</li>
<li>Last July&#8217;s discovery of the Higgs particle is exciting because it confirms that the Higgs field really exists.  Scientists hope to learn much more about this still-mysterious field through further study of the Higgs particle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that so bad? These lines are almost 100% accurate&#8230; I&#8217;m sure an experienced journalist can cut and adjust and amend them to make them sound better and more exciting, but are they really too long and unclear to be useable?</p>
<p><strong>Some False Statements about the Higgs<span id="more-5686"></span></strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile I would like to suggest we avoid the following statements, or anything like them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs field and/or the Higgs particle were crucial to the Big Bang. <em>[On the contrary, there's no evidence that the Big Bang would have been stymied in the absence of the Higgs field and particle, or of anything directly related to them... despite <a title="Why, Professor Kaku? Why?" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/19/why-professor-kaku-why/">what Professor Michio Kaku said earlier in the week on CBS news, to the embarrassment and annoyance of the physics community</a>.]</em></li>
<li>All mass in the universe comes from the Higgs field and/or Higgs particle. <em>[<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">There are many things in the universe which don't get their mass from the Higgs field</a>, including atomic nuclei, the black holes at the centers of galaxies, and (probably) dark matter.  <em><em></em>Meanwhile, the Higgs particle cannot give mass to <strong>anything</strong>.</em>]</em></li>
<li><em></em>The Higgs field and/or Higgs particle gives ordinary matter its mass.  <em>[Nope; although the Higgs field, by giving the electron its mass, makes ordinary matter possible, it doesn't provide most of ordinary matter's mass.  Most of an atom's mass is in its nucleus, and thus in protons and in neutrons, particles which are not elementary and do <strong>not</strong> get most of their mass from the Higgs field.  Protons and neutrons get the<em>ir masses from effects involving the strong nuclear force; they'd still have mass if there were no Higgs field.  And again, <strong>nothing </strong>gets its mass from the Higgs particle.</em>]</em></li>
<li>The existence of the Higgs particle confirms Einstein&#8217;s theories. <em>[Einstein had nothing to do with these ideas, which were developed after his death.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and please let&#8217;s stop using &#8220;God Particle&#8221;.  Aside from the fact that it is the <em>field</em>, not the particle, that&#8217;s so important, the term makes it sound as though important religious questions can be answered by science, using experiments. Science is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations, and it cannot address questions of this sort.  No one benefits when scientists and/or the media confuse non-scientists into thinking that it can.</p>
<p><strong>Addenda, Subtleties and Caveats</strong></p>
<p>Now, in the interest of accuracy and precision, and so that any journalists and other non-scientists reading this understand exactly where I&#8217;m taking short cuts, here are some caveats and addenda to the two nearly-accurate statements that I gave above.</p>
<p>A first small caveat: I said the Higgs field &#8220;gives elementary particles&#8221; mass; I avoided saying &#8220;gives all elementary particles their mass&#8221; because it is likely that there are elementary particles that we haven&#8217;t yet discovered that don&#8217;t get their mass from the Higgs field.  This is probably true of the particles of dark matter, assuming that dark matter really is made from particles in the first place.  (In fact it is arguably <a title="Does the Higgs Field Give the Higgs Particle Its Mass, or Not?" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/23/does-the-higgs-field-give-the-higgs-particle-its-mass-or-not/">true of the Higgs particle itself, but I don&#8217;t want to argue about this,</a> because semantic issues immediately come up.)</p>
<p>The most important subtlety left out of the two statements above is that not only does the Higgs field <strong>exist</strong>, it is &#8220;<strong>on</strong>&#8221;, in a sense. If you could measure the Higgs field at any point in space (which we can&#8217;t actually do directly), you&#8217;d find it isn&#8217;t zero, because it is &#8220;on&#8221;; in fact it has just about the same value everywhere throughout the universe (at least in that part that we can observe.) By contrast, if the Higgs field were &#8220;off&#8221;, you&#8217;d measure it to be zero in most places. This is similar (though different in a couple of key ways) to another field you may know about, the electric field; it too can be &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; on average. If it were &#8220;on&#8221; in your vicinity then your hair would stand on end, just as when lightning is about to strike nearby, or when you&#8217;ve just taken off a wool hat in winter and static electricity is at work. On the other hand, the electric field exists (i.e., it is something real that can be measured) even when it is &#8220;off&#8221;, as it probably is where you&#8217;re sitting right now, with nicely behaved hair.</p>
<p>And so an important addendum to the second statement is that discovery of a <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model-like Higgs particle</a> doesn&#8217;t just confirm the Higgs field exists; it confirms that the field is &#8220;on&#8221; &#8212; which is crucial, since if it were off, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to provide masses for elementary particles.</p>
<p>We must also now add an asterisk to the statement that electrons would be massless if there were no Higgs field.<em> If the Higgs field did not exist at all, the statement is correct</em>: electrons would be massless. However, if the Higgs field existed but were simply <em>turned off</em> somehow, and nothing else were changed, electrons would still have a very, very tiny mass, due to a funny quantum interplay of the strong nuclear force and small interactions between electrons and the (off) Higgs field. <em>(Thanks to George Fleming for reminding me of this some time ago.)</em> But this is really a small asterisk, because it remains true that atoms could not form at the current epoch of the universe; the warmth left over from the Big Bang would blow them apart. The correct statement in this case would be that electrons would have tiny, tiny masses compared to what they do in nature, and this would cause atoms to become extremely fragile and easily fall apart. So the basic idea is still right.</p>
<p>Another addendum: if the Higgs field were off, not just the electron&#8217;s mass but many other aspects of the world would be very, very different. It isn&#8217;t clear exactly what would happen, actually&#8230; it turns out that, for subtle reasons, it is rather hard to calculate the impact. <em>(Professor Chris Quigg recently mentioned to me that he and his colleagues tried to compute the main effects, but found some important issues are too close to call.)</em> It appears likely that there would be no atomic nuclei,  and/or the proton would be unstable, and/or stars couldn&#8217;t shine. What is certain is that the world would be unrecognizable, even if electrons managed through some alternative magic to keep their masses. So the electron&#8217;s mass is only a part of the story &#8212; the part that is easiest to understand, but not the only part &#8212; of why the Higgs field is crucial.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s important because there is yet one more asterisk about the electron and the Higgs. In the so-called Standard Model (the equations that we use to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) there is only one Higgs field and one Higgs particle, of <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest possible type</a>, and in that case my statements about the electron mass are true (still with the previous asterisk). But if the Standard Model isn&#8217;t quite right, there might be more than one Higgs field and more than one Higgs particle. If this turns out to be the case (and the experimentalists at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> are trying to find out), then we do not actually know yet that the Higgs field associated to the recently discovered Higgs particle &#8212; the field which definitely gives the W and Z particles much or all of their rather large masses &#8212; is truly the <em>same</em> as the Higgs field that gives the electron its relatively small mass. So the caveat here is that although at least <em>one</em> of the Higgs fields in nature must be responsible for the electron&#8217;s mass, we don&#8217;t yet know that the Higgs particle we&#8217;ve just discovered is associated to <em>that</em> particular field. (The field associated to the newly-discovered Higgs particle would still be crucial to our lives, however, because of its other important roles mentioned in the previous paragraph. Moreover, evidence is already rising that this field interacts with the heaviest cousin of the electron, a particle called the &#8220;tau&#8221;, which for technical reasons makes it more likely that it interacts with the electron too.  Still, strictly speaking the jury is out, and will be for a while.)</p>
<p>Despite these caveats and addenda (and maybe there are more I should add), I still think the above two statements are about as accurate as you can get without becoming technical and long-winded. And again, they are far more accurate than what often appears in print!</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Colleagues: please feel free to suggest further improvements, and please point out further addenda, subtleties and caveats that I&#8217;ve overlooked; I&#8217;ll add them to this page.</p>
