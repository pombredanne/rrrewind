			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I slept at work again last night; two and a half hours curled up in a quilt underneath my desk, from 11am to 1:30pm or so. That was when I woke up with a start, realizing that I was late for a meeting&#8230;But it was no big deal, we just had the meeting later. It&#8217;s hard for someone to hold it against you when you miss a meeting because you&#8217;ve been at work so long that you&#8217;ve passed out from exhaustion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Suddenly everyone&#8217;s complaining about how unfair things are in Silicon Valley. How hard everyone has to work so darn hard, and how some people don&#8217;t get venture capital or a nice sale to Facebook or Google even though lots of other people are getting those things. </p>
<p>Silicon Valley is an unfair place, say all the headlines. The CNN racism documentary was just one piece of this. Another are the cries from the press that Zynga would actually consider <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/11/10/zynga-stock-scandal/">renegotiating contracts</a> with highly compensated employees no longer pulling their weight. Expect more articles soon about the woes of being asked to work hard at a startup. People are working so hard, they&#8217;re crying themselves to sleep!</p>
<p>As if all of this was new. The quote above isn&#8217;t from some overworked Zynga engineer. It was <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html">written in 1994</a> by Jamie Zawinski, an early engineer at Netscape. Here&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw Ian today, for the first time in months. His first words were, &#8220;Wow, you look like shit.&#8221; He says I seem really strung-out and twitchy. I thought I had been doing ok! I got a full night&#8217;s sleep last night and everything. I have no life. I never see any of my non-work friends, and I&#8217;m wasting away my one and only youth. I ought to be out doing fun things and active things, the kind of things I won&#8217;t be able to do when my mind and body finally decay. But instead I&#8217;m stuck inside under fluorescent lights, pushing bits around inside a computer in ways that are only interesting to other nerds. I glanced at a movie listing and there are movies out that I haven&#8217;t even heard of. How did that happen? That freaks me out. I bought some wrist braces at a drug store, and I&#8217;ve been typing with them for a couple of days. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s helping much; my middle finger doesn&#8217;t hurt quite as much, but my ring finger is just as bad. This job is destroying my body. This can&#8217;t be worth it.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Well the kids went out to get drunk, or rather, more drunk. I think they might have actually gone out to a strip club again. How classy is that?</p>
<p>Oh good, the kids are back, and they are well hammered. None of them can walk properly, and they keep bumping into the cubicle walls and making everything on my desk shake. Since I&#8217;m not drunk, the impedance mismatch makes it impossible for me to carry on a conversation with them, so I&#8217;m just trying to block them out. But now they&#8217;re all playing networked DOOM at top volume, so in order to concentrate, I have to wear headphones with music on at top volume, and even that doesn&#8217;t quite work. Since, as I mentioned, they keep making the mistake of trying to walk, and they&#8217;re making all the shit on my desk bounce around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a saturday night, and I&#8217;m in my cubicle surrounded by a bunch of drunken farmboys from Illinois who haven&#8217;t been more than two miles from our office in scenic downtown Mountain View in four months.</p>
<p>My ears are going to be ringing after this. Fuck it, I&#8217;m going home. (Check that &#8212; my ears are ringing.)</p></blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m so fucking burnt. Existence is suffering.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re doomed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d work on my resumé, but I don&#8217;t even have anything new to put on it yet, because we haven&#8217;t actually shipped anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go home and cry myself to sleep now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there was crying. Even way back in 1994.</p>
<p>But then, the payoff. That fleeting moment of glory that every twenty-something overworked engineer dreams of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The power came back on, and we put the damnable program on the FTP server, and two million people all started attempting to download it at once, before we had even posted the announcement message, and we&#8217;re done done done and I suppose now we can all live happily ever after.</p>
<p>We sat in the conference room and hooked up the big TV to one of the Indys, so that we could sit around in the dark and watch the FTP download logs scroll by. jg hacked up an impromptu script that played the sound of a cannon shot each time a download successfully completed. We sat in the dark and cheered, listening to the explosions.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can imagine the same words, the exact same words, being written by the guys that created the early Zynga games. Or Google. Or Facebook. Or some startup that failed miserably and was forgotten. Maybe some of those people think that they&#8217;ve been worked harder than anyone else has ever worked in Silicon Valley. That working so hard, working all the time, is an extraordinary demand on their soul.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re wrong. This is what startups are made of.</p>
<p><a href="http://uncrunched.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/msworkhard.jpg"><img src="http://uncrunched.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/msworkhard.jpg?w=548&#038;h=386" alt="" title="msworkhard" width="548" height="386" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-406" /></a></p>
<p>If you work at a startup and you think you&#8217;re working too hard and sacrificing too much, find a job somewhere else that will cater to your needs. </p>
<p><a href="http://gapingvoid.com/"><img src="http://uncrunched.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dentuniverse.jpg?w=249&#038;h=211" alt="" title="dentuniverse" width="249" height="211" class="alignright size-full wp-image-402" /></a>But if deep down you know that you&#8217;re part of history, that the things you are building will be written about and thought about forever, then maybe after that good cry after a short sleep under your desk you&#8217;ll pull yourself together and remember. That you are a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/10/12/the-man-in-the-arena/">person in the Arena</a>. A <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/are-you-a-pirate/">Pirate</a>. That you are here to make a dent in the universe.</p>
<p>You might be sad that you work long hours and that sometimes your boss yells at you when tensions run high. But you also know that there is nowhere on earth like Silicon Valley. Nowhere else that is structurally designed to help you make whatever you can imagine into reality. Nowhere else where there are so many like minded people who are willing to sacrifice and work hard to create something new.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much money in Silicon Valley now that a lot of non-like minded people have rolled in. Looking for easy stock options at a hot startup. They start whining when they realize that they have to give so much to make it all work. This happens periodically, and I wrote about it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/22/silicon-valley-could-use-a-downturn-right-about-now/">back in 2007</a>. Then a downturn happens and suddenly everyone left is just thankful they&#8217;re still here.</p>
<p>But if too many people like this roll into town, a tipping point will be reached. And the magic will be gone.</p>
<p>It feels like we&#8217;re getting there. That not too long from now people will be talking about maximum working hours, minimum numbers of engineers assigned to complete a given task. And, shudder, unionization of startup workers.</p>
<p>I really hope that doesn&#8217;t happen. If it does, all the really necessary people will just leave and do their thing somewhere else.</p>
<p>Work hard. Cry less. And realize you&#8217;re part of history.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/zyngas-tough-culture-risks-a-talent-drain/">Zynga &#8220;colleagues broke down into tears.&#8221;</a> FFS, the place has free acupuncture and an organic cafeteria. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Welcome &#8211; Please come in&#8221; &#8211; Georgian Border Security.<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6533.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6533.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="Tbilisi, Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2511" /></a><br />
<span id="more-2490"></span><br />
Tbilisi, Georgia is one of the koolest cities I&#8217;ve been to in ages. A city? If you could call it that &#8211; as far as capitals go, Tbilisi is more like county town where your distant grandparents might live.</p>
<p>There was an air about it that I coudnt quite put my finger on, sort of Middle-East come Post-Soviet esque. A really great place just to walk around and get lost.</p>
<p>Everything is falling apart and decaying, streets cracked and broken, trees growing through windows, content old men playing Backgammon in the shade, and that feeling you are always being watched but you dont know where from.</p>
<p>After breaking 2 cameras, and brutal sprockets ripping threw rolls of film, this handful of digi shots is all I&#8217;ve got to try and convey it how great it is..</p>
<p><a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tbilisi-panorama-1800.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tbilisi-panorama-1800.jpg?w=600&#038;h=188" alt="" title="Tbilisi, Georgia - Panorama" width="600" height="188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2535" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6786.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6786.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="IMG_6539" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2516" /></a></p>

<p>Before I knew it though I was en route to the mountain town of Kazbegi with my new Swedish counterparts.</p>
<p><a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6535.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6535.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="en route, Kazbegi Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2512" /></a></p>

<p>Georgian Snickers<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6561.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6561.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="Georgian Snickers" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2528" /></a></p>
<p>Stream-cooled beers<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6538.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6538.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="Stream-cooled beers, Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2515" /></a></p>
<p>Guy that built the highway<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6537.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6537.jpg?w=451&#038;h=600" alt="" title="en route, Kazbegi Georgia" width="451" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2514" /></a></p>
<p>Kazbegi, gateway to the 5047m Mt Kazbek, doesn&#8217;t have an awful lot to do. You stay with little Babuska&#8217;s that heckle you when your mini-bus rolls in, there&#8217;s a couple of stores selling everything &#8211; conveniently called &#8216;google store&#8217;, and locally made wine is a plenty.<br />
Really, this place is all about the hiking. And the air is crisp.</p>
<p>Forgetting our cramp-ons and ice-picks, we opted to go for the local hilltop Monastery, rather than the 5047m giant.<br />
Swapping walking sticks for beers, and compasses for snickers, I think we insulted some of the more gun-ho power hikers along the way. But in better time than most, we reached the Monastery and it was epic.</p>

<p>Quite satisfied with our efforts, it was full speed back down the mountain to our Babushkas homestay for an epic Georgian feast. </p>

<p>Next day it was back to Tbilisi.</p>
<p>Espresso everywhere. Kazbegi, Georgia.<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6560.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6560.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="IMG_6539" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2516" /></a></p>
<p>A couple of notable Tbilisi Attractions.</p>
<p>The Royal Bath House<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6788.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6788.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="Royal Bath House, Tbilisi, Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2532" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6789.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6789.jpg?w=451&#038;h=600" alt="" title="Royal Bath House, Tbilisi, Georgia" width="451" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2533" /></a></p>
<p>Baratashvili Bridge<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6528.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6528.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="baratashvili bridge, Tbilisi, Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2510" /></a></p>
<p>And too many of these.</p>
<p>Khachapuri ($2)<br />
<a href="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6564.jpg"><img src="http://leavemehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6564.jpg?w=600&#038;h=449" alt="" title="Khachapuri, Georgia" width="600" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2529" /></a></p>
<p>My stay in Georgia was alot shorter than planed, days rather than weeks, and I definitely only scratched the surface on a couple of places, leaving so much more for next time.</p>
<p>Georgia and the Caucasus might sound like an unlikely destination, but make the effort and you will be surprisingly rewarded.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my brother and his new wife were married at our home this summer, our Mom brought Mexican wedding cookies. Every year they also appear at Christmas. They&#8217;re a lovely, buttery little cookie, tasting of toasty walnuts and covered with a dusting of white. They look like a snowball rolled downhill to me and seem so right on a plate of holiday cookies. But, somebody named them first, so <em>Mexican wedding cookie</em>s they are.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy four or five days. We&#8217;d feasted on Thanksgiving with fifteen around our table. Friday we finished cleaning up after the feast and then briefly braved the crowds. Saturday, after pulling boxes and boxes from the attic, our Christmas tree was lit and dressed with ornaments collected over years. Sunday, we had family for breakfast before they headed out of town. With no precise plan for the rest of the day, a little slow and easy pre-holiday baking sounded more restful than a nap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d made this snowy little confection recently as part of a cookie platter we took to a party. I do remember pulling the recipe card from its sleeve inside a large binder, but its space was now vacant. I looked in files I keep near by desk, files filled with ideas to sample and recipes I intend to post. Not there. I looked in my cookbooks, thinking maybe I&#8217;d used the recipe card as a bookmark.  (Truth is: I looked in each of those places several times, disbelieving my eyesight the times before.) I looked in all kinds of <em>unlikely</em> places too, places I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed to confess. (Might I have left it in the laundry room on one of my many trips there? You never know.) But gradually it became clear: Mom&#8217;s recipe had gone missing.</p>
<p><strong>Plan B</strong>: I&#8217;d seen a recipe for the same cookie in a special baking issue of <em>Cook&#8217;s Illustrated</em> and I&#8217;d wanted to sample it anyway. Thought I&#8217;d try it side-by-side my mom&#8217;s. The side-by-side would have to wait.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve loved this cookie of mom&#8217;s. Trying to prepare myself for the possibility, I thought: <em>No matter which recipe I end up using in the future, I&#8217;ll always associate this cookie with mom and the holidays. It will always be <strong>her</strong> cookie.</em> Until yesterday, I had two unanswered questions: Can we improve upon perfection? and Why should we even try? I&#8217;ve explained the <em>why</em> part. Let me speak to <em>improving upon perfection</em>:</p>
<p>The <em>Cook&#8217;s Illustrated</em>  cookie is <strong>not overly sweet</strong>, but neither was my mom&#8217;s. And it has a <strong>wonderful texture</strong>. (Some I&#8217;ve tried are a bit dry and with no particular taste.  Again, not my mom&#8217;s.)  But where this version shown is in its <strong>walnut-ier taste</strong> and its <strong>supreme tenderness</strong>. (The secret: half of the two cups of these healthful nuts are ground, lending their good oil to the mix &#8211; and the other half are chopped, providing their softly nutty bite.)  <strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>This cookie is one tender, melt-in-the-mouth, dribble-a little-powdery-sugar-on-your-sweater bite of deliciousness!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And yes, every once in a long while, we may need to update our notion of perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">~ ~ ~</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">While enjoying  a cookie or two with a cup of tea, I combed through some cookbooks that had come down through my mom&#8217;s family, some of them from as far back as the early 1900&#8242;s. Some of the ingredients, <em>wow</em>! At least a couple dozen updates to &#8220;perfection&#8221; have to have taken place since then!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cookingspreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/mexicanweddingcookies-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3560" title="MexicanWeddingCookies-2" src="http://cookingspreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/mexicanweddingcookies-2.jpg?w=546&#038;h=819" alt="" width="546" height="819" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Mexican Wedding Cookies</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">(Makes about 4 dozen)</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups (8 ounces) walnuts (or pecans)</li>
<li>2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon table salt</li>
<li>2 sticks (16 Tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>1/3 cup (2.5 ounces) superfine sugar (see NOTE on how to make your own)</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1½ cups (6 ounces) confectioners&#8217; sugar (approximate) &#8211; for dusting</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust oven racks to upper-middle-and lower-middle positions. <strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 325°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or use silicon mats.</p>
<p>Using a food processor, <strong>grind</strong> <em>1 cup</em> of <strong>walnuts</strong> to coarse cornmeal texture (10 to 15 seconds.) Transfer to medium bowl. Using either the food processor or chopping by hand, <strong>coarsely chop</strong> the remaining cup of nuts. (5 seconds in food processor.) Transfer to the same bowl and add the <strong>flour</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, either using hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the <strong>butter</strong> and <strong>superfine sugar</strong> until light and fluffy. Beat in the <strong>vanilla</strong> extract. With mixer on low, slowly add the <strong>flour-nut mixture</strong> until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape the bowl and beaters, then continue to beat on low speed until the dough is cohesive. (About 7 seconds.)</p>
<p>Working with one tablespoon at a time, press and <strong>roll dough</strong> together into balls and lay on prepared sheets, about 1 inch apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cookingspreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/mexicanweddingcookies-1-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3566" title="MexicanWeddingCookies-1-2" src="http://cookingspreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/mexicanweddingcookies-1-2.jpg?w=546&#038;h=819" alt="" width="546" height="819" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Bake</strong> cookies until pale gold and the bottoms are just beginning to brown, about 18 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through the baking.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Let cookies cook on the cooking sheet for 10 minutes, then move to cooling rack to <strong>cool completely</strong>, about 1 hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Using either a bowl or a paper bag filled with confectioners&#8217; sugar, <strong>roll</strong> the cookies to coat. Just before serving, re-roll and gently shake off any excess.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>NOTE</strong>: To make your own <strong>superfine sugar</strong>, simply process 1 cup + 2 teaspoons white sugar in a food processor for 30 seconds. <strong>Yield</strong>:1 cup superfine sugar.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The advantage to using superfine sugar in some baked goods is how easily it dissolves, the superb tenderness and delicacy and/or crispness it imparts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">Over the last 6 years or so I have been submersed in the exercise/fitness realm.  I was a collegiate athlete, worked as a personal trainer, health educator, recreational center building supervisor, and even dabbled in the fine arts of group fitness.  Trust me, i&#8217;ve seen some strange, bewildering, and to be honest unbelievable things in the gym (</span></span><em><strong><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">see:</span></span></strong></em><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;"> man eating sandwich while walking on a treadmill).   </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">Over numerous altercations, instances, and astonishments, I have narrowed down what I feel are the 11 Commandments of Exercise/Fitness.  I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.  Feel free to comment below if you agree, disagree, or have more to add!  Remember, be kind though because somewhere, at some point, you probably did one of these <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">1. )  Thou shalt not offer unsolicited advice, nor shall you tell unwarranted and outlandish glory stories of your bench pressing and squatting days.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">2.)  Thou shalt not text, BBM, e-mail, call, tweet, poke, Press This, StumbleUpon, Google+, update your status, unlock badges on foursquare, or Google while working out.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">3.)  Thou shalt not wear shorts of the booty variety, especially if you can not decipher whether they are actual shorts or something Victoria’s Secret models wear on the catwalk.  We’re looking at you “Sassy” and “Juicy.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">4.)  Thou shalt not lift heavy weights just for the sake of lifting heavy weights.  Perfect your form and you will perfect your strength.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">5.)  Thou shalt not be afraid to ask a fitness professional how to properly do an exercise.  Everyone </span></span><em><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">will</span></span></em><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;"> laugh at you if you throw-out your lower back doing a bicep curl.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://remixyourhealth.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/gym-personal-training-example.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-931" title="gym personal training example" src="http://remixyourhealth.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/gym-personal-training-example.jpg?w=300&#038;h=346" alt="" width="300" height="346" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">6.)  Thou shall wear clothes that properly fit your physique.  We know you’re working hard to improve your health and your body, but there is nothing more unattractive than a person wearing a shirt so tight that their pizza crust is being squeezed out of their waistline.  Flowing but fitting is the new sexy.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">7.)  Thou shalt not try to hold lengthy conversations in the locker room while parading around butt-naked.  You may think you’re hot stuff, but there’s nothing more awkward than having to hold a conversation with someone, butt-naked.  Eye contact becomes a game of pin ball and it immediately causes people to make uncomfortable, awkward hand gestures.       </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">8.)  Thou shalt not fart in yoga/Pilates class.  We know, your body is being twisted, tortured, bent, and compressed all at the same time.  However, there is still no excuse for firing intestinal ammunition at will.  Simply excuse yourself politely, go to the bathroom or a dormant hall/room, let it rip, excuse yourself again, and go back to class.  See, even you can be both classy and productive.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">9.)  Thou shall wipe down machines/equipment after use.  Whether you think you sweated or not, wipe down your equipment.  There is nothing more disgusting than slipping on or literally &#8220;off&#8221; a machine due to someone’s bodily fluids.  Slip N’ Slides are meant for BBQs, college apartment complexes, and collegiate Olympics… not the gym!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">10.)  Thou shalt not be a creepy hover-rat while waiting for a piece of equipment.  I will gladly respect the time limit; however, if I can feel you breathing or circling me like a piece of road kill on a Route 66, I will purposely workout longer than the limit permits. Go away and come back later!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:12px;">11.)  Thou shalt not imbibe in sugar-laden sports drinks whilst working out. If you’re at the gym to burn calories and lose weight, that 24 oz. tankard of Lemon-Lime Gatorade isn’t doing you any favors. Drink water. Plain old water.   </span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bora25/6365892701/"><img class="alignnone" title="Garbage fire in Tahrir" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6096/6365892701_74ceeeaf36.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I walked around Tahrir and the surrounding streets for a few hours tonight. I’ve visited a couple of times before in the past few days but haven’t been able to spend much time there, mostly because we’ve been finishing up the first edition of our new weekly print newspaper. I hadn’t really gone close to the front lines of the fighting, but that’s been okay with me. War reporting isn’t the kind of journalism that interests me. But after seeing the square again and getting close to Mohamed Mahmoud Street, which has been the epicenter of the running battle between Ministry of Interior paramilitary forces and the protesters, I’m left feeling a little haunted.</p>
<p>Being there overwhelms the senses. The acrid stench of teargas hovers over everything, mixing with the smoke from bonfires made of garbage and the smoke from the sweet potato vendors who burn treated wood to heat their ovens and the piss that the fighters (understandably) discharge against the walls. The endless stream of ambulances assaults your ears, as do the incessant honking of the informal motorcycle ambulances that go all the way up to the battlefront, and the chants of “Down with the field marshal!” and, closer to Mohamed Mahmoud, the <em>bang</em>…<em>crash/whistle</em> of teargas cartridges. Inside the square, you are jostled by the crowds of people, pushed aside to make room for fighters on their way back to the front line or wounded on their way to the hospitals. The eyes take in everything under the tungsten street lamps: The crying faces of teargas victims and the alien-like visages of men and women in gas mask wearers, the swirling blue ambulance lights. Perhaps this kind of scene is pedestrian for people who are in conflict zones regularly. For me, they are new.</p>
<p>Some people say that the square right now reminds them of the 18 days in January and February. I have to disagree. When I was here in February the feeling in the square was angry and determined, but it was also somehow celebratory. The energy seemed clearly directed at Mubarak and his regime and was fairly well articulated. Tahrir does not feel celebratory right now. The constant presence of injured and the number of field hospitals (I counted about five, but that could be wrong) keep the atmosphere from getting too carnival-like. And while there are definitely some families around, the crowd is overwhelmingly young men. I was in the square with some female colleagues and people repeatedly warned them to leave. During the January 25 uprising, the mood was angry, but this seems like a darker, nastier anger.</p>
<p>I don’t want to say too much about the politics of all this, but we’ve been talking a lot in the office recently about this question of “state failure” and what that could mean for Egypt. I won’t get into it in too much detail, but I generally believe that real state failure is unlikely here because most Egyptians (or maybe I should just say Cairenes, since that’s what I know best) seem to have a pretty strong sense of nationalism and commitment to the state. But when I looked around the side streets near Tahrir tonight – at the post-apocalyptic scene of toxic fumes and burning garbage and decimated sidewalks – I caught a glimpse of what I imagine state failure to look like.</p>
<p>If the state is failing, the blame rests on the military junta’s shoulders. The violence downtown wouldn’t exist if not for their complete refusal to meet the revolution’s demands and their complete and utter mismanagement of the transition. And as the generals have positioned themselves as the guarantors against chaos and collapse, every new instance of street violence justifies their presence. For now, I’ll stay away from conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I don’t know how this will end. I believe that if the generals are going to maintain the social contract, they have to give way to the protesters demands. It’s not just Cairo where these clashes are occurring. In Alexandria and Upper Egypt and the Suez Canal cities, revolutionaries are sucking up the teargas. It has to end soon before too much of the country looks like Mohamed Mahmoud Street.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16530" title="6" src="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/6.jpg?w=497&#038;h=749" alt="" width="497" height="749" /></a>I am always in the Thanksgiving spirit because&#8230;well&#8230;I love to eat. I was off to visit my family in Philly and I was excited to see them. I was especially excited to bust out a dress I bought at a thrift store in California that has been sitting in my closet awaiting the perfect occasion. I knew this would be the perfect day for a perfect dress. The dress is wool so it was warm enough for the weather and the print just screamed fall. I love crazy prints, they don&#8217;t bother me at all. I especially love this one because it reminds me of something Anna Sui would put together and I love her stuff. I love that this dress is long and fitted and that it has cute peasant sleeves and a tie around the neck. It kinda has a Victorian feel to it. I wore it with a black on black skinny studded belt, my <a href="http://www.BetseyJohnson.com">Betsey Johnson</a> velvet-black purse, my <a href="http://www.SteveMadden.com">Steve Madden</a> wedges, and some vintage jewelry. I like to mix up different styles of jewelry so I wore my vintage Avon cameo ring on one hand and another regal ring on the other. I also wore Milagros heart earrings with crosses in them that I snagged at <a href="http://www.BillysAntiques.com">Billy&#8217;s Antiques</a>. The dress is wool so it is already warm for this time of year but I threw on my fur stole just incase the weather drops. See more details and photos of my day inside!<span id="more-16529"></span><a href="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16531" title="1" src="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1.jpg?w=497&#038;h=765" alt="" width="497" height="765" /></a>The pattern on this dress is what appealed to me the most when I saw it on the rack. I love when I find things that are unique and they happen to be my size.<br />

I also wore my <a href="http://www.stilacosmetics.com/Default.asp?">Stila</a> red lip liquid color and <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/index.tmpl">Mac</a> &#8220;Pinch me&#8221; blush.<a href="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16532" title="2" src="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/2.jpg?w=497&#038;h=697" alt="" width="497" height="697" /></a>Accessories!<a href="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16533" title="5" src="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/5.jpg?w=497&#038;h=749" alt="" width="497" height="749" /></a>After an awesome day of seeing my family and eating everything in sight, I was ready to go home. I have my vintage leopard suitcase and my Thomas Wylde bag with me because I spent a few days at my parents place.<a href="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16534" title="4" src="http://vintagevandalizm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/4.jpg?w=497&#038;h=749" alt="" width="497" height="749" /></a>lol my sister and I in the lobby of my mother&#8217;s building.

<p>Top Ten Tuesday is a weekly meme hosted by the bloggers over at the <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/">Broke and the Bookish</a>. Book bloggers from all around create lists based on the chosen topics, and post links from the host blog to share our love of books! This week&#8217;s topic is:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Top Ten Books That I Read That Were Out of My Comfort Zone</h3>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">(good or bad)</h4>
<p><strong>1.) <em>Moby Dick</em> by Herman Melville</strong> &#8212; I had to read this for AP English in my junior year. I hated it.</p>
<p><strong>2.) <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen</strong> &#8212; I used to be turned off by classics because I found them a bit dull. I&#8217;ll read them from time to time, but I didn&#8217;t want to read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> because I couldn&#8217;t see the appeal of this dreamboat Mr. Darcy business. Still can&#8217;t say I do, but I&#8217;m glad I read it. It was better than I thought, and I have reconsidered this &#8220;classics are dull&#8221; thing. It&#8217;s still mostly true, but there are some really great works that stand the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>3.) <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> by JK Rowling</strong> &#8212; I refused to read this for the longest time because, as a rule, I don&#8217;t like fantasy. I don&#8217;t like talking animals or made-up words. Thirty pages and I was hooked. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>4.) <em>Twilight</em> by Stephanie Meyer</strong> &#8212; Just like I&#8217;m not in to fantasy, I also don&#8217;t like vampires. They will never appeal to me.</p>
<p><strong>5.) <em>Guilty: Liberal &#8220;Victims&#8221; and Their Assault on American</em> by Ann Coulter</strong> &#8212; I like to sometimes read books from people with views that are very different from my own. Ann Coulter makes me want to punch things, but I&#8217;m pretty sure she does it all on purpose to cause a stir. Ann Coulter, I respectfully disagree with you on everything in your book.</p>
<p><strong>6.) <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> by Jeff Kinney</strong> &#8212; Wimpy Kid is marketed at the reluctant-reader, something that I never was. I didn&#8217;t see Greg as funny, just mean and annoying. I didn&#8217;t appreciate that his character failed to grow as a person. The format and the story didn&#8217;t appeal to me and I wasn&#8217;t compelled to read on. I only read it because it felt like it was necessary to know the story since it is so wildly popular in our library.</p>
<p><strong>7.) <em>Geektastic: Stories from the Nerd Herd</em></strong> &#8212; This was out of my comfort zone because it is a short story collection. The idea of having so many characters and plots to try to be invested in has always felt overwhelming to me, but the general awesomeness of stories about nerds pulled me in. I was pleasantly surprised, and have since read more short stories.</p>
<p><strong>8.) <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em> by Orson Scott Card</strong> &#8212; The idea of sci-fi didn&#8217;t appeal to me. I failed to realized that this novel is SO MUCH MORE. I also realized that I like sci-fi. Not that I read much of it. I know that sci-fi and fantasy are basically the same (technology vs. magic), but I much prefer the way sci-fi goes about things because I believe technological advances (even time travel) might some day be possible&#8230;I don&#8217;t think magic ever will (is?). <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em> is now one of my favorite novels of all time.</p>
<p><strong>9.) <em>Chains</em> by Laurie Halse Anderson</strong> &#8212; I don&#8217;t even know what possessed me to read this, but it was amazing. Historical fiction is okay, but the American Revolution is certainly not my favorite time period (ditto to the civil war). I think my elementary school reading experience was so full of books about slavery and the African-American experience that I was just turned off from it at an early age. However, I love Laurie Halse Anderson and she does YA historical fiction so well. I shouldn&#8217;t have doubted her.</p>
<p><strong>10.) Any Shakespeare Play</strong> &#8212; Even though Shakespeare influenced, like, every plotline in modern movies/literature and added all these words and phrases to the English language, I thought people that loved his works were pretentious assholes. And I didn&#8217;t want to be a pretentious asshole. Then I read King Lear in senior AP English and kind of liked it. I figured it was a fluke. After an entire semester of taking Shakespeare as a requirement for my ed degree in college, I changed my mind. We read fifteen plays in fifteen weeks and I grew to love that silly playwright and all his silly plays (well, not all&#8230;Histories, I&#8217;m talking to you). However, reading fifteen plays in fifteen weeks has the residual effect that all of them run together in my head (Comedies, I&#8217;m talking to you). Oh well.</p>
