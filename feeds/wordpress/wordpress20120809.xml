		<description><![CDATA[Jerome John Garcia (“Jerry”) died 17 years ago today. For me, and for throngs of Jerry fans everywhere, it is a sad day. August 9 will always carry with it a somber note, a tinge of the blues evocative of some of Jerry’s more melancholy tunes, like Morning Dew or Stella Blue.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Every day, 19 WordPressers are featured on the <a href="http://wordpress.com/#!/fresh/">Freshly Pressed</a> section of WordPress.com. And every day, many more wonder, &#8220;What do </em>I <em>have to do to get Freshly Pressed?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Well, it&#8217;s time to reveal what the folks who push the launch button are thinking. Each week, a member of our editorial team will do a close-up on one post and why we thought it was Press-worthy. We hope we can provide insight into the process</em> and<em> give you tips and tools to make your blog the best it can be.</em><br />
___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Before we delve into today&#8217;s post, there are a few preliminaries to get out of the way:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don&#8217;t actually get to push a launch button, although that would be awesome.</li>
<li>There are half a million of you and a handful of us, and we&#8217;re scouring the blogosphere day in and day out. If we don&#8217;t find you, it&#8217;s nothing personal &#8211; promise. Keep writing, and we&#8217;ll keep looking.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re real people with different perspectives and tastes, so we&#8217;re drawn to different content. And we love feedback, so if a Freshly Pressed post feels really off-base to you, <a href="mailto:editor@wordpress.com" target="_blank">let us know</a>!</li>
<li>We do not accept bribes, although that may just be because no one has offered us enough gold bullion&#8230; yet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Last week, Oliver at <a href="http://literatureandlibation.com/">Literature and Libation</a> made it to Freshly Pressed with <a href="http://literatureandlibation.com/2012/08/03/craft-and-draft-character-counts/#"><em>Craft and Draft: Character Counts.</em></a> If you haven&#8217;t wandered over there to read it, you should remedy that immediately (especially if you&#8217;re a fiction writer).</p>
<p>Go ahead, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons to love this post, but the big three are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The content was informative and entertaining.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/8-aug-why-fp-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-9486" style="border:2px solid white;" title="Two-Headed Humanioid Pirate" src="http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/8-aug-why-fp-3.jpg?w=174&h=236" alt="Two-Headed Humanioid Pirate" width="174" height="236" /></a>Lots of Freshly Pressed readers are themselves writers, and we thought this post &#8211; a tutorial on the mechanics of character development, with homemade Lego illustrations &#8211; would speak to you. The figures morphed as the easy-to-follow post took us though each step of the character creation, refinement and revision process.</p>
<p>The accompanying commentary was clear, well written, and made us laugh hard enough to shoot coffee out of our collective nose. On his newly-born character, left, he writes:</p>
<p><em>I mean, it is kind of identifiable as some sort of humanoid, but there are some major problems here. One: his period-inappropriate tri-corn hat is on fire. Two: He has two heads, one of which is completely black and has no face&#8230; </em></p>
<p><em>This is an extreme example, but my point remains. It is very difficult to properly build your character the first time around. He’s going to come out with conflicting motivations, bad dialogue, missing limbs, and possibly even a flaming hat.</em></p>
<p>See what we mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The photos were genius <em>and</em> filled out the content.<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many posts can benefit from an image; they add another layer of texture to your words. Photos also help break up a longer post, and are useful for clarifying complex or intangible points. Oliver&#8217;s Lego shots took the potentially ephemeral process of developing a fictional character and grounded it in something nearly all of us can identify. Plus, they were cute as heck.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The organization and layout made reading easy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reading dense blocks of text is difficult enough on the printed page, and even more so on a screen. Smaller paragraphs help readers scan more easily, while headings make a longer post digestible and keep readers from getting lost in your content.</p>
<p>Oliver took full advantage of both guidelines. Paragraphs were short and focused on a single point. Headings broke the process down into four discrete components.</p>
<p>What did you think of this pick? Will you be reading along with <em>Craft and Draft</em>?</p>

<p>When you look at a cucumber, what do you think?  Perfect for tea sandwiches?  Great marinated with vinegar and dill? Over the eyes for depuffing? Something inappropriate for sharing on this site???</p>
<p>I look at a luscious summer cucumber and think, &#8220;Man, they&#8217;d be awesome mixed with gin and thrown into a soup.&#8221;  Just me?</p>
<p><span id="more-794"></span>During this point of our vicious Summer, finding big, beautiful, and delicious cucumbers should be a super easy task.  Now all you have to do is round up some other suspects and get them together.</p>
<p>The botanicals, rose, cucumber, and coriander notes of <a href="http://www.hendricksgin.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Hendrick&#8217;s</a> make it an obvious choice for this soup.  It will be boozy off the bat, so I suggest letting it meld and marinate over night.  Once it has calmed down, the gin brings the cucumber and avocado to a whole nother level.</p>
<p>If you wanna make this as healthy as possible, obviously you can omit the gin, you can substitute the milk with water, and you can use a non-fat sour cream or yogurt.</p>
<p>Earthy, hearty, flavorful and refreshing&#8230; thank you Summer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cucumber Hendricks Soup Shooters</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></p>
<p>2 large cucumbers, peeled and seeded</p>
<p>1 small ripe avocado</p>
<p>2 scallions sliced, white and green parts</p>
<p>1 garlic clove, minced</p>
<p>1 medium lemon, juiced</p>
<p>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</p>
<p>2 tablespoons honey, or 2 teaspoons sugar</p>
<p>2 teaspoons Sriracha</p>
<p>2/3 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt</p>
<p>1 cup low-fat milk</p>
<p>1/2 cup Hendrick&#8217;s gin</p>
<p>1/4 cup rice wine vinegar</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</p>
<p><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></p>
<p>Combine all ingredients in food processor.  Pulse until smooth, with small chunks remaining.  Adjust salt, pepper, sugar and hot sauce.</p>
<p>Chill for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.</p>
<p>Laddle into shot glasses or small bowls.  Garnish with sour cream.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>A woodshed would be best. But a basement would suffice. I need someplace to go, someplace to excuse myself to, someplace where I can get violent. A place where I can go apeshit and smash things to bits and pieces, to smithereens. Not people. I am not crazy, some sociopath. God no. Things. Objects, the everyday objects that screw with me constantly. The coffee table, for one, deserves to get chopped to splinters. The desk, for certain, should be ground to sawdust. And the computer. Oh, the computer. I would reach inside, right through the monitor, and rip out Windows and Internet Explorer and every goddamn program that stalls or freezes or refuses to respond. Inanimate objects have it out for me. All of them&#8211;the furniture, the doors, the dishes, the appliances, the electronics. All are out to get me. All have inflicted a measure of harm, pain of the physical sort and the mental variety.</p>
<p>Always the corner of the coffee table finds my shin, except when it gets my toe. It has accomplices, co-conspirators. Sit in a chair and the back breaks free. Place a cup of coffee down and it cartwheels onto the floor or my lap or everywhere. The television outright refuses to keep its reception. Open a cabinet and it falls off the hinge. Stand near an open door and it will slam shut on an unsuspecting finger. Attempt to do anything with the computer and it spits in my face and pisses down my back, laughing the entire time.</p>
<p>They all laugh, all the inanimate objects that are out to do me harm. They double over in hysterics, safe in the knowledge that I will not batter them, that I cannot afford to do anything more than punch a pillow and curse a storm. The refrigerator knows, because it took a solid right hook, took it right on the chin, a good clean shot that left a dent. And it damn near choked on laughter when I then fell to the floor, writhing in pain, a knuckle swollen and blue. The computer knows too. It knows it&#8217;s safe, because it&#8217;s heard my idle threats, threats to do unspeakable acts to its every port and drive. But I never do. Because I need that bitch. And to break it would be to screw myself. The television too. They are a fine pair, the computer and the television. They are assholes. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; they mock, &#8220;throw us out the window.&#8221; They laugh with derision, at me, impoverished me, who cannot do without them and cannot afford their replacement.</p>
<p>But if I had a woodshed. A woodshed filled with all kinds of shit. Not my shit, not the shit I need. Stuff that looks exactly like my shit would be best. But I will settle for any old shit. Leftover yard sale shit. Left at the curbside shit. Whatever. Boxes and plates and mirrors and furniture and stereos and speakers. Put it all in the wood shed. Arrange it just like my living room. Oh, and I want tools, murderous tools. Some that will bludgeon and others that will chop. A quick list would include but not be limited to: A baseball bat, a crowbar, an ax, a sledgehammer, a hatchet, a cinder block, steel toe boots, and a pile of rocks. All of it, I want all of it waiting just inside the door. To inflict damage. I will go into my woodshed, quietly close the door, and then lose my mind and put a foot through a speaker and smash a mirror and take an ax to a table. And I will not have to deal with replacing my own nefarious possessions, my plotting things, the inanimate objects that are out to get me.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s an even bet that the crowbar bounces off a table and strikes me in the head. Or I slip while swinging the ax and cleave a toe. Because it&#8217;s only a matter of time before my inanimate things infect these new inanimate things and together they plot my demise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="sikh" src="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2012/08/06/09/27/596-MCr5f.St.84.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="342" /></p>
<p>The reactions to the shooting that took place at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin Sunday all have one thing in common: expressions of tragedy. Beyond that? There is a lot of disagreement about what needs to be said, what isn&#8217;t being said and what it all means. While some would have us focus on gun control, others would highlight American ignorance over the differences between Muslims and Sikhs. Others still focus on the linguistic choices made in coverage of the recent shootings, questioning when to say &#8220;terrorist&#8221; and when to say &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t pretend to know everything, or really anything, but I do think it&#8217;s important to consider the questions raised by the shooting in Wisconsin, particularly as seen side by side with the Aurora shooting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sikh vs. Muslim: Should we really be focusing so much on the differences between Sikhs and Muslims? While the event serves as an important teaching opportunity, the focus on differentiating Sikhs from Muslims seems to insinuate that a &#8220;revenge shooting&#8221; against the &#8220;correct&#8221;group (Muslims) would be okay. Is there a way to make this distinction and teach people the difference between the two groups without making underhanded digs at the Muslim population?</li>
<li>Islamophobia: Related to the above question, at what point will the coverage acknowledge the issue of Islamophobia. Shooting a Sikh place of worship because you think it is a Muslim place of worship points to the deep and lingering Islamophobia within our country. The shooters links to 9/11 make this question all that much more pronounced. At some point our country does have to acknowledge the serious problems its white population faces with Islamophobia following 9/11.</li>
<li>Gun Control: As a blogger on Femeniste asked, &#8220;Is it time to talk about guns yet?&#8221; In the aftermath of the Aurora shooting many claimed that it was an inappropriate moment to discuss gun control. When is the right moment then? If our society is so scared to talk about gun control surrounding two horrific shootings, when will we talk about it? I&#8217;m not advocating the complete illegality of guns, or suggesting that with more stringent gun control laws all shootings would disappear. I am, however, questioning our unwillingness to have frank discussions about the issue. If the only potential comment is &#8220;Guns don&#8217;t kill people, people kill people,&#8221; we are never going to reach any sort of point of discussion.</li>
<li>Race: From the first articles on the shooting that noted that the shooters race had not been identified, race was a factor. What role will race play in the coverage of the shooting? Already it has been determined that the shooter has white supremacist links, a factor which makes it that much more inevitable that this will become a racial discussion. My fear is that it will become a shouting match, with people unwilling to have a serious discussion.</li>
<li>Terrorism: Many have been quick to note that the phrase terrorism was never used with James Holmes, so was it an act of terrorism? Many speculated about the differences between his case and that of the shooter in Wisconsin because the phrase terrorism was used only in the case of the Sikh shooting.</li>
<li>Mental Illness: At what point does potential mental illness free either of the shooters of their responsibility? Additionally, with the high number of shootings that turn out to be in people previously determined to be mentally ill, what does that say about our mental healthcare system? Additionally, since it has been determined that the shooter in Wisconsin was identified as a Vet, will we able to talk about issues of mental illness in the armed forces, or will the issue be dismissed as it so frequently is?</li>
</ul>
<p>This shooting alongside the Aurora shooting clearly raises important issues and forces some uncomfortable topics onto the table. Having multiple shootings in such a short window committed by white men in small cities in &#8220;the Heart of America,&#8221; whatever that means, challenges the notion that crime is an urban issue, endured and committed by minority populations. While the Aurora shooting brought the issues of gun control and mental illness to the foreground, the Oak Creek shooting raises even more uncomfortable issues. With all of these phrases and topics floating around, my hope is that at least a few of them get the attention and consideration they deserve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick Recap: President Barack Obama is a tax and spend liberal who uses the government as his personal piggy bank to pay off <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/07/18/romney_ad_where_did_all_the_money_go.html">fat cat donors</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOteefhlfJo">Energy companies in guaranteed bankruptcy</a>. He also launched an utterly failed stimulus that deliberately paid <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXdF-cR66V8">other countries</a> to make things we could here just to stick it to the working American in the throes of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zkWJrf_x2rA">“worst economic recovery America has ever had”</a> when all he has to do was magically lower the National Debt. Oh, did I mention he also doesn’t think any business owners are <a href="http://bit.ly/OBDAPQ">responsible for their companies’ success</a>?</p>
<p>Governor and Republican nominee Mitt Romney is an effete, out of touch pirate captain of industry who ran a company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0tZK_qHHCc&amp;feature=relmfu">pioneering outsourcing</a>. He also plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=I1pPFlcGav4%23!">reward companies</a> for sending jobs overseas while simultaneously taking money from the middle class to give to the rich like a <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/2012-election/video-new-obama-ad-slams-romneys-plan-cut-taxes-rich">reverse Robin Hood</a>. By the way, his only political experience &#8211; a gubernatorial stint in Massachusetts &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdZEJW1vWY">resulted in lost jobs, a 47th ranked job creation figure, and an exploding debt</a>. Let’s face it: as far as both President Obama and Governor Romney’s campaigns are concerned, our country is pretty much doomed.</p>
<p><span id="more-339"></span></p>
<p>Here’s the catch: only about <a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/">46% of anything the Obama Campaign</a> says and <a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/">30% of the Romney Campaign’s</a> statements are even mostly true according to Pulitzer Prize winning <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/">Politifact.com</a>. Beyond that, the outside contributors &#8211; who’ve increased markedly in their participation after the now infamous <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205%23opinion"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Comission </em></a>decision &#8211; rarely touch above 35% mostly true statements and ads. Clearly saying that any campaign advertisements out there should be taken with a grain of salt is an understatement. I view this as a serious problem in a political system in which so much emphasis is put on television advertising. We want our president (or senator, or representative, or board member, <em>etc.</em>) to be trustworthy and upstanding &#8211; the best of all of us &#8211; yet we do not expect them or any of our other political candidates to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Lies" src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/will-not-lie-politifact-fact-checking.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="236" /></p>
<p>Take, for example, the two most famous truth-dodging advertisements from both sides. President Obama’s Bain Capital attacks and Governor Romney’s “you didn’t build that” indictment. While Romney’s time at Bain was not exactly indicative of the struggles of small businesses in America &#8211; He specialized in buying, improving, and sometimes then reselling smaller companies for profit &#8211; there is no proof whatsoever of for the accusations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=I1pPFlcGav4%23!">Obama’s ads</a> have <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/bain-still-no-evidence/">repeatedly thrown at him</a>. While Bain Capital did send jobs overseas, there is little to no proof that Romney had any control when it happened. It is false and unfair to lay blame on him when he had no obvious say in the matter. Conversely, Mitt Romney has blatantly taken Obama’s “you didn’t build that” comment out of context and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLZpMFbxyxU">run with it</a>. Obama was trying to say that we are all building America together, small business owners get help from government built roads and bridges and they give back to help America continue to improve its overall quality of life. Though he said it poorly, Obamas comments do not open him up for attacks if his comments are not given full context as to their meaning.</p>
<p>I understand that a campaign can’t be expected to actively provide information detrimental to their own cause. However, I do not think it is unreasonable for the government, or a private organization such as <a href="http://politifact.com">politifact.com</a>, to have to vet advertising to ensure that Americans are getting as factual a representation of their election options as possible. In fact, we have <a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/truth-advertising">regulations on all advertising</a> in America <a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1843796,00.html">EXCEPT for political ads.</a> Why are we expecting our grocery stores, electronics outlets, and television networks to be more honest than our countries leaders? Does the fact that the First Amendment tenuously protects “political speech” really allow our leaders to outright lie in advertisement with little to no punishment?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Politifact" src="http://saintpetersblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/politifact3.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p>The argument for the <em>status quo</em> is twofold: Regulation is an impingement upon free speech, and that we have “free market” checks such as <a href="http://www.politifact.com">politifact.com</a> or <a href="http://factcheck.org">factcheck.org</a> to keep the citizens informed as to the truthfulness of campaign advertisement. While I am not one for nonchalantly reducing American’s rights to free speech, I do not understand how ads are different from ads. What makes a political ad inherently different from any other? If anything, shouldn’t they be held under more scrutiny that your average Dominoes ad? I’d feel much more comfortable knowing that a news outlet can refuse to run a political ad if it’s proven to be false (<a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1843796,00.html">they can’t right now</a>). This brings me to the second point, that we have fact-checking websites to which all Americans have free, unrestricted access. While I think it is good to teach the citizens to be discerning in gathering information, I think we should do this by expecting them to critically examine party platforms to really understand which party’s policies most represent their views, not whether a candidate is telling the truth.</p>
<p>Surprisingly or not, there is definite world precedent in regulating political advertisement. In England political parties are not even <a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/Political-ads.aspx">allowed to run advertisements</a>, a fact <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/may/13/monbiot-climate-lobbying-legislation">heralded by some</a> as instrumental in avoiding a polarizing and vitriolic political sphere. <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=loi/fel/cea&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e">Canada prevents</a> anyone from making a deliberately false statement about a candidate on any major medium during an election. In short, this is hardly a draconian or anti-democratic measure and one that, frankly, will help all Americans make an informed decision come election season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Brass knuckles, brass monkeys, knucks, brass knucks, nuckles&#8230;anyway you put it, knuckle dusters make a bold statement.  Usually it&#8217;s the kind of statement that says &#8220;you really don&#8217;t want to mess with me in a dark alley.&#8221;  But when you hang them on the same necklace chain as a mini-harmonica and pair them with skinny jeans, summer loafers, and an American Apparel deep V, they really should tell a different tale.  Like perhaps that you enjoy functional jewelry or unique statement pieces or maybe even mobster memorabilia.  Mistakenly wear it to the airport, they take it away at security, slap of the wrist, and you move along, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Not so fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Apparently, the fine folks at LAX consider you a felon in possession of a deadly weapon and will arrest you on sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Hollywood Playground" href="http://anjouclothing.com/2012/08/04/hollywood-playground/" target="_blank">My friend</a> wore this exact ensemble for his first flight to Seattle and was immediately cuffed and sent to beautiful Culver City to live out 27 hours behind bars.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">You guys, he was <em>actually</em> arrested by the fashion police.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So in honor of his time in lock-up for a maybe too-bold fashion statement, here are some time-honored deadly accessories:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Poison Ring</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Also known as pillbox rings or snuff rings, poison rings have been around since the sixteenth century in jolly ole Europe.  They contain a hidden compartment underneath the bezel that was used to slip poison into food and drink or for a convenient suicide before dungeon torture and the guillotine.  As barbaric practices gave way to more humane methods, poison was replaced by perfume, crosses, locks of hair, hidden notes and messages, and other keepsakes, earning it a new reputation as a locket ring.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pearl Inlay Derringer</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">In 19th century Philadelphia, a man named Henry Deringer made the very first pocket-sized pistol.  This model, incidentally, was used by John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  The world took note and Remington was soon manufacturing thousands of the palm pistols under the misspelled moniker, &#8220;Derringer.&#8221;  Mother-of-pearl grips, often engraved and inscribed, adorned the derringers of many a brothel worker on the western frontier as well as famous cowboys like Wyatt Earp.  A simple slip into the garter and you are fancifully armed and ready to duel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dagger Necklace</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The origin of this little deadly gem is unknown&#8230;at least to me, so for now I&#8217;ll just take a few stabs in the dark.  Victorian?  Perhaps originally intended as a letter opener.  Or possibly a torture method in ancient Asia; an agonizingly slow and painful slip under the fingernail.  Free Masons, seamstresses, so many could have a use for a tiny concealed blade.  It&#8217;s easy to see why hidden knife necklaces are a current and coveted accessory.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Knuckle Dusters</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And hey why not, all hail the original offender.  Authentic brass knuckles are made of steel, surprisingly enough, and wrap around the knuckles for maximum tissue and bone disruption upon impact in hand-to-hand combat.  Popularized during the American Civil War, knuckle dusters are now illegal in many countries, but are trending throughout today&#8217;s fashionable youth, doubling as belt buckles and pendants.   Fun fact: the French call brass knuckles &#8220;The American Punch.&#8221;</p>
