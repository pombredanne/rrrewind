			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it, the sight of snow on the mountaintops whilst you&#8217;re strolling along a sunny, palm-lined street, or even floating in the ocean is almost surreal, and  it still gives me a thrill.  I was both born and bred in a flat and damp English landscape, and the vista from my roof terrace yesterday morning was so very different from those lingering winter memories! I just had to get up there!</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0860.jpg"></a><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_08601.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3783" title="IMG_0860" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_08601.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>So I seized the chance to take some time off to take a closer look.  A few weeks back when it snowed, I wasn&#8217;t able to get up into the mountains for 3 days, and by that time much of the snow had melted away.  It was cold too, with a keen windchill factor.  Yesterday, however, was different, it was only 24 hours since the last snow had fallen, and it was a morning of halcyon purity, with a sapphire  sky straight out of a glossy travel magazine to offset the shimmering white,  and bone-warming sunshine.</p>
<p>I was stoked, as my sons would say, to be up in the mountains again.  The drive was easy, through the first stirrings of spring; some lingering almond blossoms, a few adventurous California poppies and evident, fresh, green growth on the pines.  When you drive up from the Vilaflor road it&#8217;s a mellow ride, taking you to another season, through those first glimpses of springtime, into pine forests and snow-lined roads, then into the barren rockery on the outskirts of the crater, until El Teide rises before you, lord of all he surveys, and in his winter coat, more awe-inspiring and imposing than ever.  If you live in the north, the omnipresence of  Teide is perhaps not so much of a surprise when you arrive, but from the southern coast he rises tall but distant, and arriving you marvel at his domination of the scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0875.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3785" title="IMG_0875" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0875.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Traffic was light enough, though it was obvious that locals as well as tourists were heading upwards to admire the winter landscape.  It&#8217;s not uncommon, it snows up here most years, but it doesn&#8217;t last long under the sun&#8217;s fierce glow, and there isn&#8217;t always chance to come see it, nor mornings like this to see it at its most breathtaking.  I overheard people talking about taking their kids out of school for the outing.  By weekend when they have no school it will mostly be melted away.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0870.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3786" title="IMG_0870" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0870.jpg?w=500&#038;h=400" alt="" width="500" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>At the first  stop I looked back, and could see that mountain mists were following us.  We must have been driving just ahead of them as they wound through the trees and rocks, and now they were beginning to finger their way across the crater, but for the meantime we were well ahead, and the road in front was clear and quiet enough.</p>
<p>The thing which struck me about this depth of snow cover was that it highlighted the ebbs and flows of lava, so that you could see how it had inched its way down the mountains, and where and how, at some point, it had halted, sometimes producing lacey effects, like festooned curtains, with the weird shapes and boulders, randomly spewed out from the earth, stark against the white.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0877.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3787" title="IMG_0877" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0877.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0898.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3788" title="IMG_0898" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0898.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0899.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3789" title="IMG_0899" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0899.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0908.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3791" title="IMG_0908" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0908.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Drawing level with the <em>parador</em>, we turned into the viewing area opposite, where the <em>vista</em> is unfailingly jaw-dropping in any kind of weather or time of day, but it was chock-a-block with cars, buses and tourists.  I have nothing against them.  We need them &#8211; just not in my photos!  So it was back into the car.  I wanted to see what the view was like from where I taken <a href="http://http://islandmomma.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/3496/">these photos</a> a few weeks back.  However, it wasn&#8217;t to be.  Just past the cable car the road was still closed off.  I learned later that roads from La Orotava in the north, and la Esperanza just above La Laguna were still closed.  We&#8217;d only seen one snow plough on our journey, and though there had been some light rockfalls, the road had seemed quite safe, but as always here, life on the other side of the mountain is a different story, so we turned back, to see the mist now approaching fast, an over-powering, immense wall of dense white, shifting shape as it flowed over hilltops and crater.  We took the road down to the west coast and Chio, partly because it&#8217;s wider with smoother bends than the Vilaflor road, and partly for the change, Mother Nature and the Enviromental Service having spoiled my plans.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0922.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3793" title="IMG_0922" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0922.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0926.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3794" title="IMG_0926" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0926.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0927.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3795" title="IMG_0927" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0927.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The lava beds through which this road winds are sombre black and rich brown, contrasting with the snow, and resilient to whatever kind of weather Nature hurls at them, be it a temperature of 5ºC or searing heat in August.  We&#8217;d lost the sun&#8217;s warmth to that mist now, and the day was chilling fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0955.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3796" title="IMG_0955" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0955.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0956.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3797" title="IMG_0956" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0956.jpg?w=500&#038;h=400" alt="" width="500" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Stopping to try to capture the diversity of landscape between the snow covered forest floor and the sight of the island of La Gomera seemingly floating on that sub-tropical ocean (It didn&#8217;t turn out that well.  The camera doesn&#8217;t see what the eye does &#8211; or is it time to try out HDR I mused &#8211; that stain of a darker blue in the top right is La Gomera), I turned around to see, on the other side of the road, a bleak and colorless scene, as the clouds bore down on us.  Thank goodness this was a drive and not a hike, though hiking in those conditions wouldn&#8217;t have fazed me at one time! But I&#8217;d seen the desolate scenes on morning tv the day before, and I hadn&#8217;t expected to be able to walk very far, so I wasn&#8217;t entirley euqipped, plus lunch was calling too!</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0983.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3798" title="IMG_0983" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0983.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>There was even less traffic on this road, and as we descended and, as the temperature rose, the road was adorned for springtime again.  These bonnie flowers are lotus campylocladus, and were so prolific in places that they carpeted the floor of the forest which was getting sparser as we drove down.  By now, however, the light had gone, despite heading west, it was too gloomy to get a decent snap.</p>
<p><a href="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0991.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3799" title="IMG_0991" src="http://islandmomma.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0991.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And so we returned to the coast, casting aside layers of clothing until the normal jeans and T-shirt remained, and marvelling at how we&#8217;d seen at least three out of four seasons in something short of one day.  I know I keep saying it, but diversity is what keeps me here.  At the end of the day, this is an island, it&#8217;s small, there are constrictions which come with that, however beautiful it might be, but it does feed my need for variety very well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="ipad NYT" src="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/nytipad.jpg?w=229&#038;h=275" alt="" width="229" height="275" />As of today, <em>The New York Times</em> is now offering <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/l18times.html?_r=1">a digital subscription</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about this last fall in the journalism program I did in Washington, DC. Lots of people saw it coming, so it&#8217;s not so much unexpected as significant. This just might be the model of the future that publications use to help fund themselves.</p>
<p>As an aspiring journalist and someone who tends to have a little more sympathy for the media, I support the <em>Times&#8217; </em>decision. The news and media world is in flux right now. With the rise of the internet, we&#8217;re getting used to more and more free information, but &#8220;free&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to sustain much quality journalism. Even with advertisements, newspapers need more funding to continue operating at a high level. Pay-per-story is one solution that I thought could work quite well. Online subscriptions is another. We&#8217;ll see if it works out for the <em>Times</em>. If it does, expect a lot of other papers to start heading that direction.</p>
<p>Personally, of course, I&#8217;m not as much of a fan of this move because it means I can only read 20 articles a month before I have to cough up $15 for the minimum monthly plan. And as a poor college student, I think I&#8217;m going to content myself with the 20 stories. That&#8217;s about one story a day on weekdays.</p>
<p>Though come to think of it, when you put it that way I guess it&#8217;s not too bad.</p>

Yesterday, they dyed the Chicago River green, just as they do every year. I&#8217;ve photographed it before. Everyone here has. Large crowds, closed roads, a few drunk people here and there.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today millions of Americans claiming Irish roots, if only for one day, take to the streets in celebration of  St. Patrick&#8217;s Day; drinking green beer, wearing the green, playing their bag pipes, and clicking their heels like happy little leprechans.  There is none of that going on in this house.  Saint what?  Saint who?  Oh, yeah.  That.</p>
<p>My boys are engulfed in a purple fog of ignorance to the fact that today is St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.  Their one focus is the Kansas State and Utah State match up in the NCAA tournament.   Okay, so maybe it isn&#8217;t Taz&#8217;s only focus.  He has got Dora and Diego to consider, millions of small toys to drag out, and regularly annoying his mother and harassing the older children to worry about, which will result in a good long mandatory nap.  But he did want to show his support for the team and wear his Kansas State warm ups.</p>
<p>Speedy quickly brought to my attention the fact the game starts at 9 pm tonight; his eyes filled with disappointment because he was painfully aware this was past his bed time.  Doc let Speedy stay up late last night and make his bracket picks online so the chances of staying up late once again are not good.  For this reason, Speedy was singing his praises to the DVR.   He wonders how Doc and I ever survived as a childen.  No remote&#8230;5 basic channels&#8230;no recording devices&#8230;no internet.  It&#8217;s a miracle we know anything at all about anything.</p>
<p><a href="http://sixringcircusdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_0005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-378" title="DSC_0005" src="http://sixringcircusdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_0005.jpg?w=680&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="680" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>I found it doesn&#8217;t take much to start an obsession when you are a little boy.  My brother was about 8 years-old when he bumped into a couple of Ram&#8217;s football players at a hotel and got autographs.  That was it.  The deal was sealed.  He was a Ram&#8217;s fan for life.  It took one weekend at a father/son basketball camp, rubbing elbows with the Kansas State players, for my boys to be hooked.   Slam dunk, Alley-oop, Jump Shot. There was no looking back.   For me, this mad obsession means regular arguments and compromises surrounding the fine balance of bedtime and game watching.</p>
<p>I asked Speedy for his pre-game analysis. He kept it simple:  the Seniors need to show up and play some basketball.    I think he has it figured out.  I asked him what he thought the chances of Kansas State winning the whole thing were.  He shrugged and said, &#8220;Twenty percent.&#8221;  I guess he&#8217;s remaining hopeful but realistic.</p>

<p>Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day! I made it up for a six a.m. workout again this week &#8211; this never happens twice in one week! &#8211; to knock out my 7 mile marathon training run. I was supposed to do it yesterday, but I didn&#8217;t have time to fit it in. Ah, it&#8217;s becoming so time-consuming! Work is packed with meetings, followed by tutoring at the youth center, and <em>then </em>I&#8217;m meeting some friends for dinner and Irish music. Can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Last night I was surfing through my pics from <a href="http://dailynibbles.com/2010/08/19/travels-ireland-trip-details/">Ireland</a> last summer, which was such a <em>blast</em>. I strongly believe Ireland and Irish culture is so much more than drinking and all things green &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure what we&#8217;ve turned it into in the States?! -  but it did make me want a Guinness. I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m getting a Guinness tonight. I haven&#8217;t had one since Ireland for some reason.</p>
<p>Mom and I never drink Guinness in the States. We went to Ireland and had one almost every day. It’s fantastic! Smooth, creamy, thick, and much more mellow than I had imagined it would taste.</p>
<p>Here’s some pics from the factory tour, which was a lot of fun. {Although other people told us the Jameson Irish Whiskey tour was their favorite. Missed it! Maybe another time.} Did you know the Guinness building has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness">9,000 year old lease</a>? It’s this massive industrial building that takes up about nine floors. It&#8217;s a stunning and visually beautiful tour.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0670/972384283_RD5vj-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Simple ingredients. Water.</p>

<p>Barley.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0671/972384159_WDSwC-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hops.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0676/972383624_7tnBo-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And yeast. That’s it!</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0679/972383254_53HUz-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some complicated brewing plan with the simple ingredients.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0694/972382769_zuPJw-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We got a substantial sample along the way.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0699/972382391_oKuzN-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>That’s a lot of pints!</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0701/972382240_67h2b-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>They had this awesome video on barrel making, which is quite an art form.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0703/972382032_7BXsG-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>They also had a floor dedicated to Guinness objects and advertisements.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0715/972381689_aQKT6-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0717/972381053_nYkkS-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The old bottles were very neat.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0725/972380854_HWLPe-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In addition to the hefty free sample, you also get a complimentary full drink at the Gravity Bar on the top floor that offers 360 views of Dublin. {I kept calling it the <strong><em>Zero</em></strong> Gravity Bar….don’t ask why?!}</p>

<p>Oh, man, I want to go back.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0739/972380223_nqvvP-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>With my momma.</p>
<p><img src="http://smugsarah.smugmug.com/Ireland/Dublin/LR-0753/972379035_rqAk4-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>#1 Thing You Need to Learn from This Post:</strong><br />
Launching new ideas in today&#8217;s marketplace requires less capital and greater agility &#8211; something food trucks know very well.</p>
<p><strong>A More Detailed Exploration:</strong><br />
<a href="http://rallythecause.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sxswbbq1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1379" title="SXSWBBQ" src="http://rallythecause.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sxswbbq1-e1300305124658.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Eating barbecue in Austin during SXSW is part of the annual pilgrimage. Since I have spent my fair share in Austin with my prior travels and previous times at SXSW, I was searching for something new. Fortunately, I caught a news story about a place that has <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/franklin-barbecue-austin">skyrocketed on to the Austin BBQ scene</a>: <a href="http://www.franklinbarbecue.com/">Franklin Barbecue</a>.</p>
<p>What caught my attention was that they were opening their first permanent location on the Saturday of SXSW Interactive after operating for some time from a food truck. Yes, you&#8217;ve seen those food trucks in your city starting to multiply like rabbits. There&#8217;s a good reason for that. It&#8217;s far cheaper to open for business, especially since the credit market has been so tight for small businesses as of late.</p>
<p>Apparently, Franklin Barbecue is so good, people will wait in line for over an hour to eat it. Even more interesting is how Franklin Barbecue is open until they run out of food &#8211; which is fast. This daily scarcity is because of capacity issues. They only have one smoker, but are in the process of building a second one. But the fact it can run out adds urgency for barbecue lovers to buy the product when they can.</p>
<p><a href="http://rallythecause.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sxswline2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1384" style="margin:5px 10px;" title="SXSWLine" src="http://rallythecause.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sxswline2-e1300305708404.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Line at Franklin Barbecue" width="300" height="225" /></a>I showed up at about 11:45am to beat the rush. That was naive. A few had camped out over night and most got in line by 10 am for the 11 am opening. The line was this long (see left) when I got there and took a little over an hour to get to the counter. The line moved steadily and gave me a chance to talk with passionate people who&#8217;ve been eating there for awhile. That&#8217;s how I knew to order the two-meat plate that came with two sides AND a brisket sandwich. Brisket is by far the reason for its success. (see above)</p>
<p><strong>The Lessons for Social Innovators</strong><br />
Before you mistake this post for a restaurant review (5 stars, BTW &#8211; most amazingly moist brisket and three types of sauces. Ribs and sausage were great, too), I think food trucks offer up important lessons for social innovation. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Smaller Entry Barriers = Greater Risk Taking &#8211; </em></strong>Opening up a barbecue stand featuring espresso-marinated brisket is risky, especially when you source your brisket from a humane-certified ranch in Montana that you sell in Texas.</li>
<li><strong><em>Carve Your Niche and Stay Focused -</em></strong> Walking around Austin, I found food trucks selling gourmet mini-donuts at DocMunchies, multiple Korean taco trucks, estate-grown espresso drinks, wood-fired Italian sandwiches, waffle cones full of bacon and cereal, Australian pocket sandwiches and much more.</li>
<li><strong><em>Go to Where the People Are -</em></strong> Unlike fixed point restaurants, you can move if the crowd has migrated away from where you set up for the night.</li>
<li><strong><em>You Can Be Classy in a Food Truck -</em></strong> I ate one of the most exquisite Indian meals at <a href="http://grajmahalaustin.com/">G&#8217;Raj Mahal Cafe</a>, which was a food truck parked in a pea gravel lot with magnificent Moroccan-style tents interspersed with the Austin Bike museum&#8217;s collection (see below).</li>
<li><strong><em>Use Social Media to Build Your Following -</em></strong> Twitter and Facebook are a great way to let your loyal customers know where you&#8217;ll be, what new recipes you&#8217;ll be serving and any other changes. I followed <a href="http://twitter.com/DocMunchies">@DocMunchies</a> to find out where and what they&#8217;d be selling. (I went with Mexican Chocolate and traded some for my friends&#8217; Coconut, Cinnamon and Sugar and Hazelnut orders &#8211; all excellent).</li>
<li><strong><em>Prototype Then Scale -</em></strong> Just like Franklin Barbecue, you can test out your recipes, portions, prices and other elements of your operations. Once you&#8217;ve figured out the right mix, you can move from the equivalent of a food truck to the bigger scale brick and mortar in your sector.</li>
</ol>
<p>What other lessons do you think social innovators can learn from food trucks?</p>

<p>Actually, that’s a bit presumptuous on my part. She may very well be telling me to go away or asking me for a little head scratch. I really don’t know. It’s hard to tell with cats, you know. It’s not like they can speak.</p>
<p>Or can they…?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard countless claims from various people over the years that their pet – dog, cat, iguana – can understand exactly what is being said, and though they can’t form the actual words (with the exception of <a title="Talking Animals" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR0DXKn8LBs&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">a few elite examples</a>), the pet can “talk back” to their owner. Of course, I generally look at them askance and wonder what they’re on and if they’re really hearing voices talking back to them. If that’s the case, my friend, it surely isn’t the dog. <a title="David Berkowitz on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berkowitz" target="_blank">David Berkowitz</a> anyone?</p>
<p>The fact is, many people think that animals can use and understand language when they really just mean to say that animals can communicate. All animals and even plants have their own way of communicating, but is that the same thing as human language? It is a matter of controversy, actually. Some claim that systems of communication amongst prairie dogs, dolphins, and chimpanzees have the same characteristics and level of complexity as human language does. Others, however, may concede the relative sophistication of certain communication systems, but argue that they still do not perform all the functions of a full human language.</p>
<p>At the core of the matter is what defines language. Most linguists will agree that certain things must be present for a system to qualify as a <em>language.</em> Simplifying for the sake of brevity, I will focus on three of those things: meaning, productivity, and displacement.</p>
<p><em>Meaning</em> seems self-evident. The sounds (or gestures) of human language are all connected – quite arbitrarily – to a meaning, whether it be a reference to a physical object (chair, computer, martini) or a concept (love, respect, curiosity). When I say these sounds are arbitrary, I mean that there is nothing inherent in the sounds /c/, /a/, and /t/ that naturally refers to the small furry animal that chews the belt of your favorite sweater dress. The existence of other languages is evidence that any sequence of sounds can be used as long as everyone who speaks that language understands and agrees upon that sequence. For example, when I write <em>cat</em>, it only works because those reading this a) understand English, and b) have the same furry reference in mind when reading that sequence of letters.</p>
<p><em>Productivity</em> refers to the ability of a limited number of sounds or rules to generate infinite possibilities of meaning, including those never uttered before. The sounds and rules generate new meanings and phrases, and aren’t just used for the same purposes or chunks of information over and over again. For example, I may write “Something’s burning!” and we’ve all heard it before. We know what it means and we know when it’s said, someone had better be running towards the kitchen with a fire extinguisher. It’s instantly recognizable and communicates a clear message. However, we are not limited to these types of utterances. I could also write, “Premature mint gum consumption ruins the taste of the remainder of my cup of joe”, and I’d be willing to bet what little money I have that no one has ever said that before. (Excuse me while I go throw out my gum and refresh my coffee cup…).</p>
<p>Finally, <em>displacement</em> essentially refers to our ability to talk about past and future, and not just present. Human languages all have ways to talk about things that happened not just in the recent past, but even historical events that took place long before the speaker was born. We are also able to discuss ideas or events that may happen long after we die. We are able to see beyond our present existence and express these ideas through – depending on which language is being spoken – verb tenses, word order, time words or transitions. In fact, aren’t we always trying to tell ourselves to forget the past, not worry about the future, and just live for today? This wouldn’t be such a problem if we weren’t able to do it in the first place, and for some, with such alarming frequency.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the question at hand? Do animal systems have these same characteristics? Animal communication certainly can be said to have meaning. The prairie dogs, for example, have seemingly arbitrary sounds to refer to different types of threats or functions. And apparently, there is some dialectal variation between groups of prairie dogs that live in different areas. And certainly, an owner of a cat will learn to recognize the difference between the “hello”, the “food!”, the “don’t touch my paw!”, and the “crap, it’s a hairball!” meows. Also, there have been<a title="Can Animals Use Language?" href="http://www.cambridge.org/resources/0521612357/3215_Ch3AddlTextAnimalLg.pdf" target="_blank"> notable examples of certain animals</a> that learned an extraordinary amount of vocabulary and grammar.</p>
<p>What about productivity? Animals certainly seem to be limited to certain chunks of informative utterances that aren’t generally productive.  A cat may have something completely different in her mind, like “I’d really like a belly rub now”, but there are only so many variations on the <em>meow</em> theme that they have at their disposal, so we humans are left to guess what it might mean. Of course, body language can come in handy, but again – a fluffy tail will always mean “Holy crap!” and will never be used in novel ways to express something completely different.</p>
<p>Moreover, animal communication nearly always refers to the present time, which means there seems to be little or no capability for displacement.  Sure, bees have been known to be able to communicate the way to a good pollen source, which is technically speaking, the past tense. But it’s the immediate past tense and never more than that. They can’t dance to communicate something like, “Dude, do you remember that great pollen we found last month? Yeah, that was great. They don’t make flowers like that anymore.”</p>

<p>And finally, while some animals may have very sophisticated systems that can inform, express intention, and even convey emotion, they are still limited in what they can “say.” Meta-cognition, or meta-linguistics refers to our ability to think <em>about</em> thinking, or talk <em>about</em> talking. We are aware of the behavior itself and can discuss it. We don’t just have feelings; we lie on couches and pay good money to talk <em>about</em> those feelings, to analyze and process and understand those feelings. Who knows, maybe animals can do this too, but aren’t foolish enough to pay anyone to listen to them, but at this time, we don’t know if they can because <em>they can’t tell us, </em>at least not in a way we can understand. We humans, though, have language to do so.</p>
<p>To give some explanation of an additional factor – the multilayered nature of human communication that doesn’t seem to exist in animal systems - I refer you to the capable and more entertaining hands of linguist <a title="Language as a Window into Human Nature" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-UsdATXqxU" target="_blank">Steven Pinker and his animator</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not clear by now, I’m coming down on the side of the linguists who believe that, according to our current understanding of both language and animals, no – cats can’t talk. I understand that our knowledge and understanding of both are evolving as we speak, so perhaps evidence yet to be presented will provide a clearer answer one way or another. In the meantime, I have to be content with never knowing whether or not the cats are engaged in an intense staring contest with the ghost in the corner, or if they’re just messing with me.</p>
