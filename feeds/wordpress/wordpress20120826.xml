				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’d always been round. A chubby child. <em>Pleasantly plump</em>. Pink cheeks on fair skin. Dark, dark, wavy hair. A cherubic babe from a Renaissance painting born to a later era.</p>
<p><a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-136" title="Me" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me.jpeg" alt="" width="147" height="204" /></a>I felt like a near-miss.</p>
<p>Mine is the least reliable memory about this; I can only say I felt awkward, bigger, slower, clumsier. I don’t remember anyone trying to dissuade me from this when I looked for reassurance. And when my grandmother made my clothes she played with the paper patterns, adjusted darts and seams so garments would fit me better.</p>
<p>But I didn’t fit.</p>
<p>When I hit middle school and slightly older, boys who could drive barked from passing car windows and their howls crystallized my perception that I wasn’t pretty. Didn&#8217;t weigh what I should. Was not good enough. Not desirable.</p>
<p><a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me-2.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-140" title="Me 2" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me-2.jpeg" alt="" width="207" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>In reality, my weight probably bounced around and though I was never skinny, nobody’s string bean, I was average and sometimes ten pounds more. Now when I peruse photos of myself from years ago they don’t match my memories. I see a pretty young woman. In the time before mega-models like Paulina, and Naomi, Gisele and Kate, there was sunny Cheryl Tiegs. Christie Brinkley. American girls. Blonde, golden, blue-eyed, and lanky.</p>
<p>Nothing like me.</p>
<p>But when Tom chose me a lot of old pain washed away. He loved most everything about me, of that I was certain. In time I became okay with me, too. When he <em>suggested</em>, I knew it was just that. I respected his aesthetic and his judgment. He cared for me, admired me, encouraged me, loved me and married me. I relaxed into being me.</p>
<p><a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me-11.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-141" title="Me 1" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/me-11.jpeg?w=245&h=300" alt="" width="245" height="300" /></a>After his sudden death, for the first time in my life, I could not eat. Did not think of food at all, a long-time preoccupation. I could not look at food or even smell it. Most of all, I couldn’t chew it or swallow it.</p>
<p>Food was for some far away place where people stirred among the living and needed sustenance. My soul bereft, my mind wrapped in fog, I hovered in a state where a sandwich couldn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>But I was thirsty. Endlessly so and water, water needed little help to swallow. It cleansed and cooled. With a slight pour it trickled down my throat and no matter how many pints and quarts I drank, I wanted more.</p>
<p>Within days I’d lost ten pounds and could feel my clothing becoming looser. Bound by <a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/glass-of-water1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-142" title="glass-of-water" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/glass-of-water1.jpg?w=225&h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>grief it was a nice feeling. The lack of attachment and confinement by the material that surrounded suited me.</p>
<p>When little more than a month had passed so had 20 pounds. Dressing was a problem. Now clothes weren’t only unrestrictive, they were hard to keep on. Hip bones hiding since college made a blatant appearance, coupled with cheekbones I’d never seen. I pinned and clipped, rolled and belted to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Then, 30 or 35 pounds of me was missing. Still I could barely eat.</p>
<p>Co-workers made everything as comfortable for me as possible and shielded me from taxing situations. But when I’d returned to work meetings were required with individuals in other organizations. Not everyone knew what had happened nor did I want them to. By now my clothes had left the realm of oversized and rolled right into odd. It was time to shop. Mom and I together determined to make me presentable again.</p>
<p>It had happened quickly and the sizes I needed were so much smaller than I’d ever worn that I was disoriented. I chose things still far too big, finding out when buried once again by another skirt or pair of pants only slightly smaller than what I had at home.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by racks, and people, and choices, and colors, and mostly by being in public. I didn’t know what size I was. I didn’t know who I was. Painful as my inside was, it was at least familiar, unlike the stranger I attempted to dress.</p>
<p>It was a brief and tiring shopping trip. We left with a few items and I had a vaguely improved outlook. Everyone assured me I looked fine. My mother nodded her approval and the sales team said the clothes in the bag were cute and appropriate, stylish and well fitted.</p>
<p><a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mirror-wall-mirror_0_0.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-143" title="mirror-wall-mirror_0_0" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mirror-wall-mirror_0_0.jpg?w=241&h=300" alt="" width="241" height="300" /></a>I wasn’t sure. The mirror I had loved and who had loved me was gone. In his absence I trusted few.</p>
<p>I surrendered the familiar and oversized garments from my closet and began to wear the new. As I continued to dwindle more purchases were necessary and the single thing I enjoyed was the ability to walk into the store and grab any article quickly with a high probability it would fit and look good. In the midst of so much pain this was a (no pun intended) small delight.</p>
<p>And then it happened. The world I’d been shrinking away from, one of colleagues, neighbors and those I thought friends who’d distanced themselves from me, the collective mute universe filled with those who peered around corners and peeked only when they thought I wouldn’t see, all those who had nothing to say to me but plenty to each other, came out of their homes, offices, yards, and cubicles to tell me how wonderful I looked.</p>
<p>How svelte and stylish. Fashionable and fit. I must be feeling ever so much better they prattled on, because &#8212; <em>I looked so good.</em></p>
<p>Never had my outward appearance so disguised my inner world, my childhood inverted. First a happy child made miserable by external deficiencies as defined by other children, and now in this agonizing period after Tom’s suicide, the scale fairy waved a wand and I drew kudos for my looks.</p>
<p>I wondered why they didn’t see my entrails or the trail of blood behind me.</p>
<p>I seethed when confronted by those emboldened by appearance who simultaneously remained timid – no, <em>cowardly</em> – in addressing what mattered most to me. As they felt twinges of unease and awkwardness they took an easy path. I viewed it as a choice between their discomfort and mine, and as if similar in magnitude they chose to soothe their own. “You look great,” and they hid from the opportunity to say something I could feel.</p>
<p>As they did, I felt hidden to the world while at the same time drawing its attention. Upside down and inside out, I couldn&#8217;t get my bearings.</p>
<p>One evening after dinner my son and I meandered through a shopping mall. An excursion into a life, a field trip of sorts. Months had passed. We tasted social interaction in small, sample-sized spoonfuls. A voice called my name from behind.</p>
<p>“Pam,” I turned to see her. A peer who sat near me in the evening philosophy class I’d dropped after my husband’s death. We’d spoken once since.</p>
<p>“You look wonderful. What have you been doing? Some kind of diet? Which one?”</p>
<p>My boy and I stood hand in hand. We looked at each other. A relative stranger barged into our world with her unsolicited, superficial observation. Maybe she deserved it and maybe she didn’t. I didn’t care about being fair.</p>
<p><a href="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hands-connecting.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-139" title="Mother Holding Child's Hand" src="http://pamelahesterking.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hands-connecting.jpg?w=300&h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I gave his hand a squeeze. “It’s the suicide diet. It works. Lose a life. Gain a new wardrobe.”</p>
<p>And for that moment my inside and my outside found compatibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thefriendshipshore.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fans-in-autzen.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-576" title="Fans in Autzen" src="http://thefriendshipshore.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fans-in-autzen.png" alt="" width="570" height="377" /></a></p>
<p>As a college sophomore I witnessed one of the most ridiculous football games you will ever see. In 2005, The University of Oregon beat then 18th ranked Oklahoma in a game that left both sets of fans complaining about the refs after an historic comeback by my Ducks. Down 13 points, our quarterback threw his second pick of the quarter. Thousands headed to the exits. After Oregon made its comeback, punctuated by a wacky onside kick and field goal block, those that remained mobbed the field and the players. Those who left missed a monumental moment, and a turning point in the program – plus they had to live a lie that they were there.</p>
<p>Those fans who deserted the team violated one of my long-held Pillars of Sports Fandom. I have developed these after years of following mostly terrible teams in the Pacific Northwest. I’ve sat through epic collapses and winless seasons, and through it all, I have remained loyal. And it made those rare moments of joy all the better. Here is my secret recipe for being the best sports fan you can be. If I could describe these pillars in one sentence it would be, “be passionate, but don’t be an asshole.”</p>
<p>KNOW YOUR TEAM</p>
<p>I’m not talking about just knowing whether the guys in the white uniforms or the black ones are on your team. True fans possess intimate knowledge of pivotal games and important traditions in their team&#8217;s history.  At the University of Oregon, prior to each game, a highlight package of some of the team&#8217;s most important moments fires up the crowd (Kenny Wheaton’s gonna score!).  At the University of Michigan, the players run out and slap a banner that reads “Go Blue”.  These pre-game rituals add to the team’s, and stadium’s, overall mystique.  The duty of enhancing these traditions falls squarely on the fans.</p>
<p>RESPECT THE VISITORS</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, they are wearing the wrong color, and are probably the worst people ever – you know, the kind with three popped-collar polo shirts, talking on their cell phone during the game – but we are here to watch the teams duke it out, not a bunch of fans three or four beers deep before the game even starts.</p>
<p>DON’T BOO THE BOYS</p>
<p>This one fits the “don’t be an asshole,” part of the speech. Sure, that promised free agent might be stinking it up, looking like he’d rather be at the buffet line than on the court, but why is that the rest of the team’s fault? Show the adequate respect to the guys putting their bodies on the line to entertain you. I hear what you are saying: these guys make millions, I can boo whoever I want. You sure can, but what’s the point of pinning your emotions on these guys if you are just going to turn on them when the chips are down?</p>
<p>NEVER LEAVE EARLY</p>
<p>And of course the most important one: Never leave early. You can do all of the above, but if you are that guy who bolts with three minutes left and your boys are down a few points or runs, your fan card will be confiscated at the gate. Just stay a few extra minutes. The traffic is going to horrible either way. Who knows, you might get to be a part of history.</p>
<p><em> Nat is way too big of a sports fan, who can&#8217;t wait for football to start. Even if it means no more sun.</em></p>

<p>What is it about vintage effects on photographs that people love? Is it the timelessness, the creation of art, the need to share photos with communities, or is it simply a trend that has returned to modern day society? Two weeks ago my mother brought home a classic Polaroid Supercolor 635 CL camera that had been sitting in a storage cabinet for over 30 years. After searching for film around camera stores in Auckland, it was shocking to discover the scarcity and cost of the 600 film the camera requires. 14 packs including 10 sheets of photo paper per pack costs around $550 American dollars to purchase on Ebay. It’s no wonder people are opting for the Iphone photo application software <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram </a>recently obtained by Facebook for $1bn that offers users 15 free retro photo filters to apply to their photographs.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 496px"><a href="http://pickabandwagon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_6109.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image " title="Instagram photo board" src="http://pickabandwagon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_6109.jpg?w=487" alt="Image" width="486" height="704" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Instagram photo board. Source- Kathryn Wanoa</p></div>
<p>The difference between both cameras is that <a href="http://www.polaroid.com/en/stream">Polaroid </a>prints physical copies of images whereas Instagram is an iPhone camera and virtual photo board.</p>
<p>A question that could potentially affect Facebook must be addressed. If Polaroid cameras and film were easy to obtain and affordable to buy, would people choose to use Polaroid cameras again like they used to? Or are users more likely to stick with up-to-date internet technology where photos are taken and stored in cyberspace?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2130524/The-rise-rise-Instagram-app-40-million-fans.html">Daily Mail</a>, Instagram attracts an average of one million new users per day adding to the total user count of 40 million. This essentially means Instagram users make up “roughly 5 percent of Facebook’s active database.” Yet after posing the question on Facebook as to which of the two photo technologies individuals would rather use and why, Polaroid was the majority’s preferred choice. 16 out of 20 Facebook users that commented on the post picked Polaroid.</p>
<p>Five others “liked” the following comment, “Initially I was with Instagram because of its simple easy to use nature and I didn’t want to carry around a whole lot of photos at the end of the day but the Polaroid is not altered and keeps a physical picture that is real and an old school feel which I really like.” Of the four people that made Instagram their preference, their reasons for doing so was mainly for its quick on-hand accessibility.</p>

<p>A recent concept design created by Antonio De Rosa of <a href="http://www.adr-studio.it/">ADR Studio’s</a> may be the solution to the debate! An article from the Huffington Post has revealed images and information for a concept combing both Instagram and Polaroid to form the Instagram Socialmatic Camera. What’s cool about this device is that it incorporates Wifi technology to enable the camera to perform exactly how Instagram does with instant photo sharing on the internet as well as Polaroid benefits to allow users to print physical images via internal printing technologies. Read more about it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/10/instagram-socialmatic-camera_n_1505908.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is your opinion on this? Would you rather use a classic Polaroid camera for a more authentic photographic experience or would you rather stick with Instagram for quick and easy faux-vintage photo sharing? Would the new Instagram Socialmatic Camera be the perfect solution?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been at this blogging thing for quite a while now.  Honestly, I still surprise myself with some of the skills I&#8217;ve learned along the way like, umm, HTML.  Seriously I never in a million years thought I&#8217;d understand coding.  I&#8217;m not advanced by any means but I actually get HTML a little bit.  That&#8217;s hypertext markup language for the lay person.  (And that&#8217;s the IT recruiter in me coming out.  Yes, my rarely mentioned day job.)</p>
<p>So anyway, it seems that many of you have been interested in blogging basics.  I&#8217;ve been able to encourage a friends and family members to start blogs of their own recently and as a result a few questions have come up.  I thought it might be fun to share some blogging basics for the newbies.  Let me start with 2 basics that go hand in hand that I live and blog by.</p>
<p><strong>PICTURES</strong></p>
<p>This is an area that I am always trying to improve on.  I think that will never change as long as I have an online presence.  It is true that a picture captures a thousand words.  So take good ones.  Use natural light.  Know how to use your camera even if it is just a point &amp; shoot or an iPhone.  Cell phone technology has advanced so they can take some pretty amazing pics but they can also take lame ones.  Only post the good ones so you don&#8217;t scare readers away.  Let me say again use <em>natural light</em> when photographing your subject. Avoid the flash.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-8891 aligncenter" title="canon" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/canon.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="208" /></p>
<p>Love your camera.  Bond with it.  I use a DSLR &#8211; Canon Rebel eos T3.  How did I make the choice between Nikon and Canon you ask?  I admired another bloggers photos for so long that I finally asked her what kind of camera she uses.  That&#8217;s it.  I had no real camera shopping experience but I loved the results she put out there so I inquired.  Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for advice.  I know I still have a ton to learn about photography and my camera even after using it for a year but what fun would it be if there wasn&#8217;t more to learn?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8888" title="Blogging Basics: Pictures &amp; Pinning" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_67881.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="406" /></p>
<p>And when your pictures need a little extra boost, edit them.  I use <a href="www.picmonkey.com" target="_blank">www.picmonkey.com</a>.  There are about a zillion ways to edit photos but I like to keep them natural. Once in a while I give them a vintage vibe too.  This website is 100% free and no login required.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.picmonkey.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8885 aligncenter" title="PicMonkey" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/freebug_banner-315e26d8c547ea25b16b2bf77bf290dc2701a810.png" alt="" width="114" height="72" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked about how I watermark my photos.  This feature can also be found in pic monkey.  There is a text overlay option.  Just click on the <em>P</em> and it will show you about 25 fonts, choose your color, type your blog or .com and voila, you&#8217;ve got a watermark.  Yes, you have to do it every single time this way.   I am not sure of how to watermark a lot of photos at once so if you do, let me know!</p>
<p>When posting photos on your blog, make sure they are large.  Seems simple but this is something that took me a while to catch onto.  Look at the difference a small photo</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8894 aligncenter" title="Cottage Bedroom" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_6271.jpg?w=99&h=150" alt="" width="99" height="150" /></p>
<p>vs. large photo makes.  I tend to post on the Large &amp; XL side but you can find a size that works for you when you upload your photos.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-8894 aligncenter" title="Cottage Bedroom" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_6271.jpg?w=612&h=922" alt="" width="612" height="922" /></p>
<p>So why watermark pictures?  Not because I think they&#8217;re amazing and want to claim all rights to them necessarily.  But as a bibliography of sorts.  Remember before the days of the internet when you researched something and had to reference where you found that info?  Yeah, like that.  Who knows where your picture, idea or story may end up on the world wide web so why not tag it with a reference to your site?  After all, you put hard work into it so you should receive the credit.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my next topic&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>PINTEREST</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The main reason I watermark photos is because they end up on pinterest.  Have I mentioned the mumkin yet?  Oh yeah.  Well that has been pinned all over the place and the photos were posted pre my watermarking days.  So literally thousands of people have seen that photo without necessarily linking back to my site.  In fact other bloggers have reposted it without necessarily linking back to my site (which is bad etiquette BTW).  So am I kicking myself now for not watermarking that little project as a reference?  No.  I chalk it up to a learning experience.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-8900 aligncenter" title="Mumkin" src="http://circadee.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1898.jpg?w=427&h=641" alt="" width="427" height="641" /></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s get back to the basics about what pinterest is and how to use it for those who have been living under a rock in 2012.  If you are a blogger, not just a DIY or design blogger, you should have a pinterest account.  We are visual creatures and scanning through hundreds of pretty pictures is appealing.  We&#8217;ll pin them until the cows come home and then most likely link back to the source to <em>read</em> about that visual. Like I said this isn&#8217;t just true for design blogs so if you ahem blog about beer reviews, maybe you want to take a really appetizing picture of your beer paired next to a juicy steak (Suddenly I&#8217;m hungry.) and upload that photo in your post.  Then pin it to pinterest.  See what kind of traffic you get from it.  It might surprise you.  Pinterest is my number one referrer and I don&#8217;t think that is going away anytime soon.  To do this, install the &#8216;pin it&#8217; application under your favorites on your computer.  Pinterest provides instructions on how to do this.  Pin photos from your blog posts with descriptions.  You can see what pictures of yours have been pinned and re-pinned by typing pinterest.com/source/yourwebsite into your browser.  For example, <a href="http://pinterest.com/source/circadee.com/" target="_blank">http://pinterest.com/source/circadee.com/</a>- see I told you lots of mumkins.</p>
<p>Did you also know that pinterest (and all of the other social networks) provide buttons for you to easily upload to your blog to gain followers?  True story.  After you are logged into your account, go to the goodies page (cheat sheet: <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/" target="_blank">http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/</a>) where you will find various follow me buttons along with the HTML that links directly to your account.  Cut and paste this into the widget in your blog&#8217;s dashboard. Be sure you are pasting in the text view of your blog versus the visual so it recognizes the HTML code.  Now your readers can follow you on pinterest with just one click.  They don&#8217;t need to search for you.  This method is pretty much the same across other social media sites too.  Just look for the button HTML under help and paste like so&#8230;try it!</p>
<p><a href="http://pinterest.com/circadee/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://passets-lt.pinterest.com/images/about/buttons/follow-me-on-pinterest-button.png" alt="Follow Me on Pinterest" width="169" height="28" /></a></p>
<p>And one more thing about pinning and pictures.  There&#8217;s like 100 more things but just one more for today&#8230;when you upload your pictures to your blog post, rename them.  I only just started doing this.  Otherwise they are titled IMG_1905 or something non-descript.  You can easily edit the name to something descriptive like &#8216;Mumkin: easy pumpkin mum fall planter&#8217;.  When you or a reader pin it, the title is already there and it helps new potential followers on pinterest find your image who may be searching for pumpkin or fall ideas.  You can then convert that pinterest user into a new follower of your blog!  Plus renaming your pictures is better for Search Engine Optimization of your blog in general.</p>
<p>Oh SEO that is a whole different topic for a whole &#8216;nother day.</p>
<p>It feels funny to write a post like this being that I&#8217;d only consider myself an intermediate blogger but the time seemed right to share these tips since I&#8217;ve been fielding related questions from newer bloggers lately.  So if you have any other questions or topics for me, leave it in the comments and perhaps I will do a follow up on blogging basics.</p>
<p>Happy weekend!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Photos of the spell-binding artwork at Gibbs Farm have been circling the internet for some time now, and I have come to the conclusion that I would be doing you all a disservice if I did not share some of them on here!  I mean, how incredible is this giant sculpture?  It was created by artist Neil Dawson for Gibbs Farm, a large sculpture park in North Auckland, New Zealand, and it is one of the coolest installations I have ever seen.  I love everything about it; its larger than life size, the magical way it appears as if drawn on the air with a giant sharpie marker, but most of all I enjoy its placement within the farm.  Up on a hill, the frame-like nature of the floating &#8220;paper&#8221; structure provides a window to the varying skyline, which changes with the seasons as well as the time of day.  This breathtaking piece of art adds an unexpected, whimsical element to an otherwise beautiful, but slightly less imaginative setting.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1579" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://theflamingpotholder.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ingredients.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1579 " title="Ingredients" src="http://theflamingpotholder.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ingredients.jpg?w=240&h=180" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Harvest Basket + 5 Ingredients</p></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">We often have pantry meals – we make something for dinner out of just what we have in the pantry (and maybe add a few things from the refrigerator and/or freezer). These meals can be <em>creative</em>. Sometimes we just don’t want to go to the grocery store or farmers market, this is a good alternative. </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Well this week, I went outside and harvested a basket of veggies from the garden: tomatoes, spaghetti squash, green beans, onions, bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, and herbs. I decided to make a “harvest meal,” using the ingredients in the basket plus 5 kitchen staples: olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">I made a quick marinara sauce to top the spaghetti squash and served it with sautéed green beans, and a chopped salad. It was a tasty meal, made even better because we grew the veggies! We’ve only been gardening for two years, so it’s still a treat when we harvest. I don’t really have recipes and exact measurements, just guidelines. Hope you are enjoying the summer bounty! It’s time to think about a fall garden. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Spaghetti Squash with Marinara Sauce</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Olive oil</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Onions, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Celery leaves and stems, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Bell peppers, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Tomatoes, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Salt and </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">pepper</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Fresh herbs (basil, parsley, oregano)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Balsamic vinegar</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Spaghetti squash pasta (see the next recipe)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Heat some olive oil in a pan; add the onions, celery, and bell peppers. Sauté until tender. Add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook until the tomatoes are tender. You can mash some of the tomatoes with a fork or potato masher or even use an immersion blender. Depends on the texture you prefer. Stir in a splash of balsamic vinegar and the fresh herbs. Serve over the spaghetti squash with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Spaghetti Squash “Pasta”</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">1 medium spaghetti squash</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">You can bake spaghetti squash in the oven at 350º F for 45 minute to an hour, until tender. However, it is August and I prefer not to heat up the house by using the oven for this. The microwave does a fine job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">You can cook spaghetti squash whole, but I prefer to cut them. Wash the outside of the squash. Dry it thoroughly. The rind is tough so it can be a little tricky to cut, so use care when cutting it. Wrap it in a towel, place it on a cutting board and use a large knife to slice it lengthwise from stem to end. Then use a spoon or a sturdy ice cream scoop to scoop out the seeds and the stringy stuff. This is similar to how you clean a butternut squash or a pumpkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Place the two halves cut side up in a microwave safe container (I use a Pyrex pie plate). Fill the cavities with water. Pour a little extra water in the bottom of the container. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Rotate the squash halves and pour a little more water over the cut edges – this keeps them from drying out. Microwave another 5 minutes. Let them rest for about 5 more minutes. Then, use a fork to shred the squash so that it looks like strands of spaghetti.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Green Beans</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Green beans, washed and snapped (if needed)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Olive oil</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Salt and </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">pepper</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Fresh herbs (basil, parsley, oregano)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan or wok. Stir in the green beans. Sauté until slightly tender (I like them with a little bite). Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Chopped Salad</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Onions, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Celery leaves, chopped</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Olive oil</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Balsamic vinegar</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Salt and </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">pepper</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Fresh herbs (basil, parsley, oregano)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Toss the vegetables in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil. Add a splash of balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, Parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs. Toss well. Serve.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With bright blue skies I made a snap decision to head straight to Pier 84 where I could get my hop-on/hop-off Water Taxi ticket (free with my New York Pass) plus they can organise you a ticket for the 9/11 Memorial. Killing two birds with one stone I was on the first boat of the day at 9:00am. It&#8217;s an express run that takes you straight to the Statue of Liberty for a quick photo opportunity which was great in the morning light and then drops you off at Battery Park.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7410_statue_of_liberty_new_york/" rel="attachment wp-att-239"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239" title="IMG_7410_statue_of_liberty_new_york" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7410_statue_of_liberty_new_york.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="778" /></a><br />
From there it&#8217;s a short walk up to the 9/11 Memorial site. You have to queue a few blocks away, go through several airport-style security checks and scans before finally making your way to the memorial site. Where the two world trade centre buildings once stood they have created these square waterfalls and in the centre is<span id="more-237"></span> a hole that you can&#8217;t see the bottom of giving the illusion of a bottomless pit while around the waterfalls they have engraved the names of all the people who lost their lives in the attacks.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7418_panorama_9-11_memorial_waterfall/" rel="attachment wp-att-240"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-240" title="IMG_7418_panorama_9-11_memorial_waterfall" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7418_panorama_9-11_memorial_waterfall.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="148" /></a><br />
Towering above the memorial site is the new One World Trade building that is still under construction. At the moment it is 1250ft tall but when completed it will be 1776ft. Why that number you may ask. That was the year that America declared its independence.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7424_9-11_memorial_new_one_world_trade_centre/" rel="attachment wp-att-241"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-241" title="IMG_7424_9-11_memorial_new_one_world_trade_centre" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7424_9-11_memorial_new_one_world_trade_centre.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="1024" /></a><br />
I then headed back up to Pier 84 where the SS Intrepid, a retired aircraft carrier that is permanently docked and has been turned into a museum. Once again entrance to the museum was included on my New York Pass card and for a few dollars extra I also got a ticket to enter big silver dome you see on the flight deck.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7397_ss_intrepid_museum/" rel="attachment wp-att-238"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238" title="IMG_7397_ss_intrepid_museum" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7397_ss_intrepid_museum.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>Inside is the space shuttle Enterprise that had only arrived in New York a few weeks before I did and so I got to see it up close and personal and it&#8217;s amazing to think that an aircraft that size can be rocketed into space and re-enter through the earth&#8217;s atmosphere. An amazing feat of engineering.</p>
<p><a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7496_space_shuttle_enterprise/" rel="attachment wp-att-242"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-242" title="IMG_7496_space_shuttle_enterprise" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7496_space_shuttle_enterprise.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>My water taxi ticket was valid for the whole day so after exploring the rest of the SS Intrepid museum I hopped back on the boat just cruised down the Hudson with New Jersey on the right&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7553_new_jersey_skyline_from_hudson_river/" rel="attachment wp-att-243"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-243" title="IMG_7553_New_Jersey_skyline_from_hudson_river" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7553_new_jersey_skyline_from_hudson_river.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a><br />
&#8230;and then around downtown Manhattan. Later in the afternoon, the sun had moved over providing great light for photography of the New York skyline.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7623_panorama_new_york_skyline/" rel="attachment wp-att-244"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-244" title="IMG_7623_panorama_new_york_Skyline" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7623_panorama_new_york_skyline.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="158" /></a><br />
After the one and a half hour round trip it was nearing sunset and so I rushed to the Empire State building with plans to get some photos of the sunset from the top. However I slightly underestimated the holiday crowds and arrived to find a 45 minute wait time just to get to the elevators. Then once at the top there was another 25 minute waiting time for the elevator to take you up the last six floors to the observation deck. Just then a steward appeared from a doorway to the left and announced that anyone who wanted to avoid the wait could take the stairs. With the sun sinking and the light fading I didn&#8217;t hesitate and was the first one into the stairwell in the centre of the building. I ran up the stairs and was greeted by one of the guides at the top announcing me as the first person up but I didn&#8217;t have time to hang around and rushed outside, managed to squeeze through the crowds and get my lens through the wire fencing to catch a shot of the sun setting.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7627_sunset_at_the_top_of_the_empire_state_building/" rel="attachment wp-att-245"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-245" title="IMG_7627_sunset_at_the_top_of_the_empire_state_building" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7627_sunset_at_the_top_of_the_empire_state_building.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a><br />
Goal accomplished I relaxed and just enjoyed the views as I waited for darkness to fall and the lights of New York to come on. You aren&#8217;t allowed to take a tripod up the Empire State Building so taking long exposure shots isn&#8217;t easy but with a bit of patience and persistence I eventually managed to get some shots that I was happy with. This first shot is looking North towards Central Park with the bright lights of Times Square illuminating the buildings just left of centre and cars on 5th Avenue towards the bottom right of the picture.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7667_light_from_times_square/" rel="attachment wp-att-246"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" title="IMG_7667_light_from_times_square" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7667_light_from_times_square.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a><br />
Looking East, across the East River, there was a full moon low in the sky.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7677_full_moon_rising_over_east_river/" rel="attachment wp-att-247"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" title="IMG_7677_full_moon_rising_over_east_river" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7677_full_moon_rising_over_east_river.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a><br />
And of course the view of Downtown Manhattan with the Brooklyn Bridge to the left, the new One World Trade in the centre and the Hudson River on the right.<br />
<a href="http://roryinamerica.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/high-above-the-city-that-never-sleeps/img_7678_downtown_new_york_at_night/" rel="attachment wp-att-248"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-248" title="IMG_7678_downtown_new_york_at_night" src="http://roryinamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_7678_downtown_new_york_at_night.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="346" /></a><br />
I could have stayed up there all night looking at this view, taking in the magic of the city that never sleeps, New York!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you seen those <em>Elle</em> or <em>Vanity Fair</em> issues where they do tributes to past movies and their iconic scenes using today&#8217;s stars? For Instance:</p>
<p>Lea Michelle In &#8220;The Creature from The Black Lagoon&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/lea-michele-8.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-410" title="lea-michele-8" src="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/lea-michele-8.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="406" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Jayma Mays as Tippi Hedren  in &#8220;The Birds&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jayma-mays-in-the-birds.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-411" title="Jayma-Mays-in-The-Birds" src="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jayma-mays-in-the-birds.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="429" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It&#8217;s a cute, yet superficial way for a young star or starlet to both pay tribute and pander to the history of cinema. Young stars assume they are paying respect by making a simple pose. Yet it&#8217;s a pose that is done without any of the skill, technique or talent that accompanied the original performers in the roles. It&#8217;s only good for a nostalgic laugh if not for anything else. Sadly nobody seems to have let Kimberly Pierce in on the joke.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/carrie-221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-412" title="carrie-22" src="http://filmcycle.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/carrie-221.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>These are the first official set images from Kimberly Pierce&#8217;s remake of Brian De Palma&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I mean Stephen King&#8217;s Carrie that were released today. They feature Chloe &#8220;Hit Girl&#8221; Moretz and Julianne &#8220;Body of Evidence&#8221; Moore respectively sporting the now iconic outfits of a prom dress with a dash of red food coloring and a white gown and cross ideal for the chic Christian woman on the go.</p>
<p>Its laughable because, in looking at the pictures, you can almost hear the studio heads behind the film deliberating on how to make it more &#8220;modern&#8221; and distinguish it from its predecessor.</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;I got it, Piper Laurie played it with frizzy hair so all we have to do is give Julianne Moore a blowout to get rid of the perm and people will say it&#8217;s totally different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Brilliant Boss, but what will we do about Chloe Moretz as Carrie? We can&#8217;t have her looking too much like Sissy Spacek or else people will say we&#8217;re being derivative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I got it all thought out. In the original, De Palma played up the Gothic horror element. He had Sissy play it as if she was in a nightmarish trance; an enraptured portrayal of righteous anger, sexual revenge and supernatural intrigue. We can never match that, so just have Chloe looking very confused, like she doesn&#8217;t know why she is covered in blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;A masterstroke Boss; the audience will never catch on. They&#8217;ll think we&#8217;re doing something unique and different, when really we&#8217;re just recycling a name brand for a quick cash grab. Still, I&#8217;m concerned about the online film blogs like <a title="cinemablend" href="cinemablend.com" target="_blank">cinemablend</a>, <a title="slashfilm" href="slashfilm.com" target="_blank">slashfilm</a>, and <a title="aintitcool" href="aintitcool.com" target="_blank">aintitcool</a>. What if they catch on to our game?&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;I told you it can never happen. They&#8217;re on our side now. They tell their listeners not to judge until they see the movie for themselves. They&#8217;re so afraid to be negative, or have any sort of standards that they become shills who actually help us sell our mediocre product. Can you believe that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Yeah, especially after they bit the bait with the &#8220;Total Recall&#8221; remake. For months they told their readers not to judge until they saw it for themselves, even after that lame trailer was released.  They didn&#8217;t want to seem judgmental so they didn&#8217;t caution their readers. They saw that awful film and, even though it stunk, the film ended up breaking even in the worldwide grosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: Gotta love those film blogs: &#8220;don&#8217;t judge until you see it&#8221;, how stupid can you be? I&#8217;m glad no other aspect of our society tries to function like that. Imagine the army operating on that kind of thinking:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Cadet: &#8220;General they have their nukes pointing straight at us and their prepared to fire&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">General: &#8220;Stand down solider it just looks like they&#8217;re firing. You can&#8217;t judge them until they actually do something.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Cadet: &#8220;But sir they&#8217;ve fired on us in the past (&#8220;The Fog&#8221;, &#8220;The Crazies&#8221;, &#8220;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#8221;, &#8220;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#8221;, &#8220;Last House on the Left&#8221;, &#8220;Straw Dogs&#8221;) but you keep on insisting we give them the benefit of the doubt. Yet our country (the cinema) is in shambles and continues to sustain damage. Isn&#8217;t it about time we stop giving them (the studios) the benefit of the doubt and start demanding peace (quality, original films)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">General: &#8220;Solider you are so negative. I withhold my judgement on something until I see what actually happens. Maybe the bomb will hit and it won&#8217;t be so bad. Maybe it will explode candy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Cadet: &#8220;Sir, you&#8217;re an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">General: &#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Hilarious sir, you&#8217;re funnier than Dane Cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;Thanks, but I can&#8217;t take all the credit. Our publicity department did us a big favor with floating the lie that we&#8217;re making the movie different by going back to the source material.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Yeah sir, but I still don&#8217;t understand what going back to the source material means. It&#8217;s not like you can adapt a whole movie to the screen page by page. You have to leave some stuff out in favor of others. So no matter how back into the book you retreat, you always end up doing an adaptation anyway&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think too hard about it, cause its obvious the film bloggers don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just a lame excuse we thought up to justify remaking something that didn&#8217;t need to be remade in the first place. Besides if the public were really paying attention they would know that in the book, Carrie is supposed to be overweight and have acne and thinning hair, so we obviously don&#8217;t give a crap about the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Like De Palma?&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;No De Palma was different. He&#8217;s an artist. The specific nit picky elements of the book were inconsequential in lieu of his overriding vision of subversive sexual horror and religious paranoia. We, on the other hand, are just lazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;So sir, when we say were going &#8220;closer to the book&#8221; we mean it the same way Tim Burton meant it when he kept repeating that very thing while promoting &#8220;Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory.&#8221; (i.e. we&#8217;re deviating from the book as much as the first movie did, but we don&#8217;t want the audience to think we have nothing new to offer because we would very much like their money)</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;Exactly, we&#8217;re deviating from the book but still following a scaled down idiotic version of what De Palma did. As you know, we are deathly afraid to do anything new or different so we just use the source material argument as an excuse to mask our copycat tendencies. The bloggers buy it, and give us some credibility which extends to their followers, which translates to box office dollars for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing sir that nobody has caught on yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;Well some critics and journalists have been wise to us in the past, but they usually go away. The film community ridicules or ignores their dissenting opinions and they are labeled a nuisance or troll. Funny how today having high standards for film gets you labeled a nuisance by your contemporaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;It&#8217;s a crazy world sir, but as long as I&#8217;ve got money in my pockets, I say to the devil with good cinema.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 1: &#8220;I&#8217;ve taught you well. I&#8217;m so proud of you. By the way, how are those script revisions going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Studio Guy 2: &#8220;Excellent sir. We have Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, a writer on the hit television series &#8220;Glee&#8221; doing it so it should be great.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">and scene&#8230;..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://daphnepropst.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/delete-button.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-42" title="delete-button" src="http://daphnepropst.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/delete-button.jpg?w=167&h=153" alt="" width="167" height="153" /></a>Yesterday I was reading through my Facebook news feed and a post from a friend caught my eye.  I don&#8217;t know all the details (and don&#8217;t care to, frankly), but apparently Facebook deleted profiles for anyone who had the word &#8216;cosplay&#8217; in their profile name.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m still trying to figure out when &#8216;cosplay&#8217; became a word.  Nonetheless, I found the story intriguing.  You are only supposed to have a Facebook profile that uses your &#8216;real&#8217; name (and this is stated in the terms of use for Facebook &#8211; you know, all that legal mumbo-jumbo that no one actually reads before they hit &#8216;ok&#8217;).  However, people created profiles using all kinds of names, for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>A lot of people who play games (online games, LARP games, etc.) are known to others only by their &#8216;character&#8217; or &#8216;avatar&#8217; names.  So, they create Facebook profiles under those names.  No different than a writer using a pseudonym, right?</p>
<p>But, since Facebook is free, they have to make money somewhere.  So the speculation is (and I bet it&#8217;s correct), that since Facebook makes money by selling your information to others (even though they used to say they didn&#8217;t), they want everyone&#8217;s profile to have their &#8216;real&#8217; names, so that the information has value to buyers.</p>
<p>I can see both sides.  I understand that Facebook wants/needs to make money, and they therefore need marketable data.  However, I can also see that someone who makes a living under a &#8216;character&#8217; name wants/needs the ability to have a profile under that name.  Facebook&#8217;s answer has been that you can have a &#8216;page&#8217; under any name you want.  However, a page does not have all the same capabilities as a profile, so many people find a page a poor substitute.</p>
<p>If John Wayne were alive today, his Facebook profile would have to be under Marion Morrison.  He could make a Facebook &#8216;page&#8217; for John Wayne, but not a profile.  And what if Samuel Clemens didn&#8217;t want everyone to know that he was really Mark Twain?</p>
<p>People have used aliases/pseudonyms/pen-names (whatever you want to call them) forever.  Is there something wrong with trying to keep your personal and professional life separate? Is that an unrealistic expectation in this technological age?  Does Facebook get to decide who you can be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week in 1916 a blockbuster film had its first general release in London&#8217;s cinemas. The film went on to be the most popular film in British cinemas until 1977.  It showed genuine footage of men in battle on the Western Front in the Battle of the Somme.</p>
<p>The film was made by Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, who mixed short sections of mocked up battle scenes with plenty of genuine footage of guns firing, troops moving around in the trenches, men attacking over no-man&#8217;s land, the wounded and the explosion of the mine under Hawthorn Ridge (on top of which was a german redoubt).</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://greatwarlondon.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/the-big-push-on-the-big-screen/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g8YfJmwY5Uo/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>The whole film is available to watch on youtube. The attack starts around 30 minutes in, with a few faked scenes &#8211; most of the remainder is real:<br />
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://greatwarlondon.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/the-big-push-on-the-big-screen/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/krT1lX_Dvm0/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>After a few private showings, the Battle of the Somme film opened in 34 cinemas across London on 21 August 1916. The next day, the Times reported that:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Never before has there been so large a demand for a long film. Managers of cinema houses have to make their arrangements many months ahead, and  in order to show the war pictures they have had to cut out of their programmes films rented many months ago for exhibition this week. [...] The early arrangement of programmes has in some cases had the unfortunate effect of associating the war pictures with fimls of a light and trivial character, but this could hardly be avoided. One cannot imagine, however, that an audience which has seen men &#8220;go over&#8221; the parapet, and tumble back dead or wounded into the trench, can afterwards have the heart to laugh at picture theatre inanities.</p>
<p>A week later it was released across the country. Every copy of the film was reportedly in use that week. By the first week of Setember, the film was showing in more than 1000 &#8216;picture theatres&#8217; across the UK.</p>

<p>Famously, 20 million tickets for the film were sold in its first six weeks (in a nation of 45 million people). The next film to sell so many tickets was Star Wars in 1977 &#8211; more than 60 years later!</p>
<p>Most other films shown at the time were short pieces or serial shows &#8211; much more like TV programmes (soaps, news, dramas, comedies, etc) than what we see in the cinema today. The most popular of these attracted audiences of 10 million each week for their installments, which means that the success of The Battle of the Somme was as much in the continued demand for it (presumably more than 20 million tickets were sold over the month or so it was on, probably including many repeat attendances) as in the numbers watching in any one week &#8211; although the demand in late August was clearly vast. The film provided people in London and across the UK with a view of the battlefields like they had never had before. It interested millions and shocked a great number of them.</p>
<p>Frances Stevenson (Lloyd George&#8217;s secretary) wrote in her diary after a private showing on 4 August:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We went on Wednesday night to a private view of the &#8216;Some films&#8217; i.e. the pictures taken during the recent fighting. To say that one enjoyed them would be untrue; but I am glad I went. I am glad I have seen the sort of thing our men have to go through, even to the sortie from the trench, and the falling in the barbed wire. There were pictures too of the battlefield after the fight, &amp; of our gallant men lying all crumpled up &amp; helpless. There were pictures of men mortally wounded being carried out of the communication trenches, with the look of agony on their faces.</p>

<p>Similar films made in 1917 were nowhere near as successful, and people drifted back to the usual serial or comedy films (such as those of Charlie Chaplin). The Battle of the Somme was the great success in the war-documentary genre in the Great War. It was shown at a point when the images it showed were new and shocking, but (perhaps) before the failure of the Allies to win in 1916 made the war seem to grind on interminably.</p>
