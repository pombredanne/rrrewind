			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5350476075_63d4fdf654.jpg" alt="Barcelona 024" width="333" height="500" /></p>
<p>Our plan was to spend a few days in Barcelona, work our way up through Southern France to our final trip destination, Paris.  But, as I mentioned in the <a href="http://meetusinmunich.com/2011/02/11/sojourning-through-toledo-cuenca/">previous post</a>, we were experiencing travelers&#8217; burnout.  And the best way to combat it was to quit moving around so often.  We decided it was time to start winding down and enjoy the last bit of our travels rather than run around like lunatics.  We ended up splitting our last two weeks of our trip between Barcelona and Paris.  And we are so glad we did.  Barcelona is fun.  There is so much to see and eat and do. We loved it!</p>
<p>We made the long bus ride from Cuenca starting at 9am and arrived in Barcelona around 7pm.  By the time we hit the steps of our rented room for the week, we were knackered.  But instead of feeling stressed for lost time, we had a whole week to explore.  Woohoo!  We spent the rest of the week exploring the city, seeing some of the usual tourist spots, and even making it out to the town of Figueres, about a two-hour train ride, to visit Salvador Dalí&#8217;s former home now called the Dalí Theatre and Museum.</p>
<p>We also made the obligatory tourist visit to La Rambla, a boulevard in the heart of Barcelona&#8217;s old city.  It&#8217;s a bustling street full of vendors, street performers, shops and restaurants (read: tourist trap!).  Just off this boulevard lies the Mercat de Sant Josep/ La Boqueria, a neighborhood market full of colorful fruit, fresh seafood, and ham legs dangling above the butcher stalls.</p>

<em>Neck-deep in ham legs.  I don&#8217;t think I was disturbed when I saw this in person, but this photo changes my mind.</em></p>

<em>Right next to the ham stalls was a vegetarian stall where &#8220;organic is orgasmic&#8221;.  Pretty bold statement, I&#8217;d say.</em></p>
<p>From La Rambla, we were able to end up at the waterfront and we strolled around admiring the blue waters and imagining how nice it&#8217;d be in warmer weather.  </p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5082/5350475945_dc7c40a4ae.jpg" alt="Barcelona 023" width="500" height="333" /></p>

<p>There were these strange &#8220;arty&#8221; looking buoys in the water.  From far away, it looks like a boy peeing into the sea.  Up close, we realized it&#8217;s a boy holding a star behind his back as he gazes at the sky.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5350475565_f736d12c07.jpg" alt="Barcelona 020" width="333" height="500" /><br />
<em>I like the boy peeing in the water better, like a Spanish version of <a href="http://meetusinmunich.com/2011/01/07/the-hustle-in-brussels/">Belgium&#8217;s Manneken Pis</a>.</em></p>
<p>One of our main goals in Barcelona was to find a bar/restaurant that served a type of tapas called pintxos (pronounced &#8220;pinchos&#8221;).   They consist of tasty morsels of various fresh ingredients (i.e. tomatoes, manchego cheese, anchovy, shrimp, iberico ham, olive oil, etc) topped on a slice of bread and held together in place by a toothpick.  They are displayed in large plates on top of the bar.  Pintxos are typical of the Basque region of Spain (more northwest of Barcelona.  Barcelona is in the Catalonia region).    But since we weren&#8217;t going to be making it to the Basque region this time around, we figured eating the pintxos in Barcelona would be close enough.   Lo and behold, as we wandered around, we found a pintxos bar, and gorged ourselves silly on some deliciousness.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5048/5351104164_1e4e77844b.jpg" alt="Barcelona 159" width="375" height="500" /><br />
<em>The normal course of action goes like this:  order a drink, eat as many pintxos that your heart desires, count the number of toothpicks, pay the bill. </em></p>
<p>We also spent some time checking out the museums of some of Spain&#8217;s most famous artists, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró.</p>
<p>The Miró museum was really great except that I wasn&#8217;t feeling well, so I didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as I would&#8217;ve liked.  The collection of his work is vast and varied, so it kept things interesting. The museum is high up on a hill in the Parc de Montjuïc neighborhood.  It was a great walk from our rented room to the museum.  They also had an outdoor space with great views of Barcelona.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5412222565_4579b1042a.jpg" alt="Joan Míro Museum" width="500" height="337" /><br />
<em>View from the Joan Miró Foundation</em></p>
<p>The Picasso Museum is in the neighborhood of Montcada and the museum is in an old medieval building along a narrow cobblestone pedestrian-only street.  Of course with the popularity of the Picasso Museum, there are plenty of tourist traps along the way in forms of restaurants, shops, and street vendors.  But, it&#8217;s a cool place to just wander about and get lost.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/5412222917_5920e37418.jpg" alt="Picasso Museum" width="500" height="337" /></p>
<p>A pretty interesting tidbit about the museum:</p>
<p>In 1957, Picasso had become completely obsessed with a 1656 painting by Diego Velázquez called Las Meninas.  It&#8217;s a very famous painting, and it hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid (along with Picasso&#8217;s very famous painting called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_%28painting%29">Guernica</a>).  The painting IS really fascinating.  It looks like a snapshot from a moment in time.  Picasso  proceeded to paint 58 interpretations of this painting in a period of 4 months.  A whole giant room in the museum is dedicated to Picasso&#8217;s renditions.</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Las_Meninas_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="Las Meninas" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Las_Meninas_01.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="500" /></a><br />
<em>Las Meninas by Velázquez</em></p>
<p>There was also a special exhibit about the influence of Edgar Degas on Picasso, especially all the ballet paintings and bronze sculptures Degas is famous for.  Picasso also created paintings and bronze sculptures with his interpretations of Degas&#8217; works.  So, the take away message for me was:  Picasso really liked interpreting other artists&#8217; works.</p>
<p>The rest of the museum was okay.  It contained a really large collection of Picasso&#8217;s earlier works, and personal collections from Picasso&#8217;s close friends.  It was really interesting to see his artistic development and experimentation through the years, but for me, I left feeling a little underwhelmed.  I think mostly, I didn&#8217;t feel like the chronological setup of the museum flowed very well.  Or I don&#8217;t know, maybe I had museum burnout as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, enough whining about burnout and let&#8217;s move onto some other good stuff.</p>
<p>Jay and I had both been to Barcelona separately when we were in college and there was one place that had made a big impression on both of us, and we were really excited to see it again: La Sagrada Familia. It&#8217;s a gigantic Catholic cathedral designed by the revered Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudí.</p>
<p>Gaudí also designed some notable landmarks in Barcelona, each becoming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.  The two most popular buildings are in the neighborhood of Eixample along the very shi-shi Passeig de Gràcia.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5350477291_2ae6dcc8ab.jpg" alt="Barcelona 034" width="375" height="500" /><br />
<em>Casa Batlló</em></p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5351090876_63e8e3366b.jpg" alt="Barcelona 038" width="333" height="500" /><br />
<em>Casa Milà</em></p>
<p>Gaudí also designed an outdoor space called Park Güell.  We took Barcelona&#8217;s awesome subway system to reach Park Güell.  Outside the subway entrance, we ended up following a load of tourists in the direction of the park.  We ended up at a very steep neighborhood street that had escalators to the top.  Phew!</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5246/5351098698_53c9c5298b.jpg" alt="Barcelona 108" width="375" height="500" /><br />
<em>If you can peel your eyes away from this super-flattering photo of me, look behind me to see how steep the street was. Hurray for escalators!</em></p>
<p>The view at the top was awesome!  We got lucky with the weather.</p>

<p>This street performer serenaded us with Elvis songs as we climbed our way to the top.<br />

<p>There was a nice winding trail that led us to the entrance of the park which was surrounded by footpaths, bridges, fountains, mosaics, and a terrace to look over the city. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5351099352_654883918b.jpg" alt="Barcelona 114" width="375" height="500" /><br />

<em>The terrace is great for people-watching and soaking in the sun.  That is, if you can find a space to sit.</em></p>

<em>People were waiting in line to take pictures with this mosaic lizard.</em></p>
<p>Finally, we saved the best visit for last, Gaudí&#8217;s magnum opus, La Sagrada Familia.  The building of the church began in 1882 and it&#8217;s expected to be completed in 2026.  It will have taken 144 years to build this church, and exactly 100 years after Gaudí&#8217;s death.  A lot of the reason that it&#8217;s taking so long is that the whole construction is funded by donations, and revenue from admissions&#8217; tickets into the church.  Also, at the time that Gaudí envisioned his masterpiece, the technology to actually build it was simply not there.  Talk about someone ahead of his time!</p>
<p>We went there 3 days in a row trying to get inside the gates of the church and have a chance to climb one of its towering spires.  First day, we arrived too late to climb the towers.  Second day, the line was really, really long.  The third day, the line was even longer than the day before, but we decided to wait the 2 hours in a line that circled the entire block.  </p>
<p>I found this picture online of a scale model of what the completed structure will look like:<br />
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Sagradafamilia-model_background_adj.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Sagradafamilia-model_background_adj.jpg" title="Sagrada Familia" class="alignnone" width="400" height="480" /></a><br />
<em>Come on, that&#8217;s pretty nuts, right?</em></p>
<p>And, here are some pictures that Jay took:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5350488667_21bb39c8e8.jpg" alt="Barcelona 139" width="500" height="375" /><br />
<em>The towers</em></p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5350489131_e1fe3439fd.jpg" alt="Barcelona 143" width="500" height="375" /><br />
<em>The Passion Facade</em></p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5350490917_04be55f055.jpg" alt="Barcelona 161" width="333" height="500" /><br />
<em>The door at the entrance of the cathedral</em></p>
<p>The inside was more magnificent than I could have imagined.   It was incredible.  Gaudí&#8217;s concept was for the columns to resemble trees.  Gaudí&#8217;s vision allows the visitor&#8217;s imaginations to run wild.  I felt like I was in a magic forest.  </p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5161/5350491573_8e7691e1e4.jpg" alt="Barcelona 168" width="500" height="375" /></p>

<p>We were able to go up one side of the spires by elevator.  We reached the top and was able to walk across at a vertigo-inducing height to see the city below us. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5083/5350497177_0cef800e34.jpg" alt="Barcelona 222" width="333" height="500" /></p>
<p>We decided to walk down instead of taking the elevator back.  We ended up in a dizzying spiral staircase that took us down to the main floor.  </p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5350498923_0cb1bc512a.jpg" alt="Barcelona 237" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>It was pretty exciting to see how much had progressed since our last visits.  I really hope one day we get to see the completed structure 15 years from now.  </p>
<p>That pretty much sums up our time in Barcelona.  We had such a fantastic time in the city.  Here&#8217;s looking forward to 2026!</p>
<p>By the way, if you think some of the stuff we saw in Barcelona was out of this world, wait until our next post on the Dalí Museum in Figueres!</p>
<p>Hasta luego,<br />
Christina</p>

</div>
<p>My neighborhood book club has been going strong for nearly three years. A bunch of women who range in age, profession, religious background, and plenty of other things, we agree that we enjoy the following items (not necessarily in the order they are listed):</p>
<p>1. Periodically getting together at someone&#8217;s house (preferably not our own);</p>
<p>2. Eating chocolates;</p>
<p>3. Drinking wine;</p>
<p>4. Chatting it up a bit;</p>
<p>5. Discussing books we might not have otherwise ever picked up.</p>
<p>The last meeting was at my house. This time eleven people showed up for an hour of &#8220;eat, booze and schmooze&#8221; in the kitchen, and eight stayed to gather on the family room couches to &#8220;talk book.&#8221; Since the host selects the book, my selection was Jen Lancaster&#8217;s <em>Bitter is the New Black : Confessions of a Condescending, Egomaniacal, Self-Centered Smartass (Or, Why You Should Never Carry A Prada Bag to the Unemployment Office).</em></p>
<p>Quick summary: Before September 11th, Lancaster worked as an associate vice president for a  technology company prior to being laid off. In this capacity she made loads of many and acquired many pairs of shoes. After 9/11, the author whines &#8211; incessantly &#8211;  about being unemployed, her boyfriend/fiancé/husband, Fletch, their neighbors, their  pets, and how she can no longer afford the shoes she once used to buy so readily. I liked Lancaster&#8217;s wit and rampant narcissism.</p>
<p>And while Lancaster was not for everyone, we agreed the book was snarky and fast-paced: a good choice for February, when knee-deep snow and the winter white skies of Western New York provide enough gloom to make everyone question just how severe our vitamin D deficiencies might be. It&#8217;s hard to stay connected to neighbors in the winter; it&#8217;s just so friggin&#8217; cold. People walk around with their shoulders up and their heads down. We rush from warm house to warming car. There is little time to casually chat at the mailbox when the wind is stinging your ears and making your eyes tear up. Our little club keeps us connected year round so that <a href="http://rasjacobson.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/being-neighborly/">we remain in touch with our neighbors</a>, something equally rare these days.</p>
<p>It is up to the host to facilitate discussion, and &#8211; big surprise &#8211; I have long wanted to infuse a writing exercise into a meeting, so I figured &#8211; since this book was devoid of any real literary depth &#8211; this was my chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said brightly ,&#8221;Remember when Lancaster lists her &#8216;Jen Commandments&#8217;? The little quirks she possesses that people who know her and love her just have to accept?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few people nodded. (I had my suspicions that most people didn&#8217;t get that far.)</p>
<p>I referred to the text. I didn&#8217;t have to; almost no one brings the book to book club.  I could have said anything, but I quoted Lancaster:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">I hate holding anything heavier than my purse. If I have something in my hands, I will attempt to trick you into carrying it for me?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>A few people snickered then looked semi-spooked as I handed everyone one salmon-colored index card and plopped a pen onto each lap. As I stuck a small,  non-threatening bowl in the middle of my tufted ottoman, I said, &#8220;I thought it would be kind of fun if each of us wrote one of our own &#8216;Commandments&#8217; and put it into the bowl. Anonymously, of course. It could be fun to see if we can figure out who goes with what.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, some people looked panicky and began to protest, but thank goodness the majority was with me. A few women asked for extra index cards. At first, I thought it was because they goofed up, but for some people once the creative juices started flowing, the flood gates could not hold all our estrogen and soon the orange-bowl, index card confessional runneth over. I read the first one aloud:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">I always sleep with 3 pillows. This is a need not a want. And, I will always travel with a pillow, even if it necessitates bringing another suitcase.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>We laughed, especially because we were so dead wrong with regard to whom was attached to this statement. Surely our quiet, unassuming neighbor could <em>never</em> be so demanding. But there she was, shamelessly nodding her head.</p>
<p>I passed the bowl to my right so someone else could read another book clubber&#8217;s words:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">If you say you&#8217;re going to do something, then just do it. If you talk about something but never get to it, then I start wondering about you.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Hilarious. And so true.</p>
<p>One woman wrote on the front of her card:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">I&#8217;m in charge of almost everything&#8230; <span style="color:#000000;">(and then on the back)</span> &#8230; and I like it that way!</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Another neighbor penned:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">I obsess about making decisions and my good friends have to listen to me!</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone easily guessed mine.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">I absolutely hate repetitive noises. If you tap something more than five times, I might have to kill you.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>One that stood out was short and direct.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008080;">Do not screw up my coffee order.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This, of course, led to a hilarious story about how this neighbor had recently visited a local Starbucks where the barista dared to give her <em>three</em> squirts of vanilla in her mocha latte instead of one. There was hell to pay that morning. <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  There were other &#8220;isms&#8221; that were equally excellent. And it was a hoot to hear each woman&#8217;s words read aloud. Everyone was honest and enjoyed poking fun at herself, sharing her quirks, her personal truths. As usual, book club was less about the book than it was about people gathering together to get to know each other a little better.</p>
<p>What my book club mates don&#8217;t realize is that they are <em>totally</em> screwed. Now that I have seen that they can write (even under pressure), the next time it is my turn to select a book and host, we are sooooooo writing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1451" title="50-1" src="http://ladynoble.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/50-1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=366" alt="" width="500" height="366" /><br />
So Monday morning I received a call from someone in need of a gift.  We came to agree that a jewelry set should do the trick and this here is what I came up with&#8230;</p>
<p>Day 50. <em>In the Woods</em> Jewelry Set</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1452" title="50-2" src="http://ladynoble.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/50-2.jpg?w=500&#038;h=689" alt="" width="500" height="689" /><br />
Handpainted, altered, hammered, reliefed elements mixed with czech glass flowers <em>(in case you haven&#8217;t yet noticed I love these)</em> a super sweet <a href="http://www.etsy.com/transaction/39685811" target="_blank">stoneware tree pendant</a>, <a href="http://vintaj.com/products/category.asp?category=Arte%20Metal&amp;QueryLoad=1" target="_blank">Vintaj arte meta</a>l, and colorful turquoise beads.  These necklaces were designed to be worn together, but they will also look good solo. The tree one is long and the ped pod necklace hangs much shorter. Both are tied together with coordinating colors, hand altered elements and the overall &#8220;woodland&#8221; theme. I am very happy with how the set turned out and almost didn&#8217;t want to give these away. I ant to wear them!<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453" title="50" src="http://ladynoble.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/50.jpg?w=500&#038;h=353" alt="" width="500" height="353" /><br />
I wanted to stay pretty simple for the earrings. I don&#8217;t make earrings to much and I don&#8217;t wear them either so they aren&#8217;t my favorite thing to spend time on. However, if I <em>was</em> to wear earrings myself, these would definitely make the cut. I also made a bracelet to go with this set but I didn&#8217;t get to photograph it because I ran out of time. In fact you can tell by the photos above that I was rushed to snap anything for this project before handing it over. The bracelet was pretty neat, I used an <a href="http://earthenwoodstudio.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Earthenwood </a>ceramic square to link two hammered, painted and reliefed <a href="http://vintaj.com/products/proddsp.asp?which=P290" target="_blank">rectangle blanks</a> into a mini cuff bracelet. { If you can even picture what I just wrote} I happen to be friends with the lady that received this set as a gift so maybe I can take a picture of the bracelet sometime to show you exactly what I mean.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Cajun culinary experimentation begins with a local favorite, Shrimp and Grits.  We’re easing our way into Cajun cooking here…can’t just jump into Shrimp <a class="zem_slink" title="Remoulade" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remoulade">Remoulade</a> or <a class="zem_slink" title="Gumbo" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbo">Gumbo</a> just yet!  Let’s get our taste buds warmed up with this simple, delicious dish-with-a-kick.</p>
<p>There is a serious abundance of fresh seafood ‘round these parts.  Ordinarily, in Tejas, I speed up my shopping cart in the seafood section to avoid nasty fishy shmells.  Here the fish actually smell good.  It’s incredible!  Fridays during <a class="zem_slink" title="Lent" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent" target="_blank">Lent</a> (without meat) can hardly be called a sacrifice this year!</p>
<p><strong>Cajun Shrimp and Grits Ingredients<br />
</strong>1-½ packets of instant grits per person<br />
salt and pepper<br />
1/4 cup shredded parmesan, asiago and/or romano cheese<br />
1 1/4 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, with tails<br />
2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped<br />
cayenne pepper &#8211; ohhhhhhh boy!!<br />
juice of a lemon<br />
fresh or dried parsley</p>
<p>1.    Boil water for grits (1/2 cup of water per packet of grits)<br />
2.    When water is boiling, whisk in grits, boil for about a minute and take off heat<br />
3.    Add handful or ¼ cup of cheesy mixture (parmesan, asiago, romano or cheese of your choice) to grits<br />
4.    Sprinkle grits with salt and pepper and add a spoonful of butter for good measure!<br />
5.    Cover grits to keep warm until ready to plate<br />
6.    Meanwhile, season the deveined shrimp with salt and pepper<br />
7.    In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter or drizzle olive oil<br />
8.    Add the shrimp, garlic and a little cayenne (start with a very small amount) to pan and sauté shrimp until they’re pink and are no longer transparent (about 3 minutes)<br />
9.    Remove shrimp from heat and add the juice from a lemon to the pan…and maybe a little more butter if you need it…stir to coat shrimp with sauce, season with salt and pepper<br />
10.   Plate grits in center of shallow bowl, top with shrimp and give a generous shower of the lemon/butter/cayenne sauce from the pan over the top.<br />
11.   Add a dash more of cayenne pepper for color and flava (if you can take tha HEAT)!  Then sprinkle with fresh or dried parsley – so pretty!</p>

<p>This dish has incredible spice from the cayenne, tang from the lemon juice and rich cheesiness from the grits.  And took me about 15 minutes from walking in the kitchen to serving this&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is Scrapbooking Industry Day and my family is probably 27% of the industry. Since I can remember my mom has scrapbooked. She has dutifully scribed my every moment. From birth until now, when she claims she will no longer be crafting my life. Last weekend when I was home I asked her if I could take my baby book to Norman so I could celebrate the fact that I have these amazing books. She sort of freaked out, mainly in part to the fact that I asked her if I could go sky diving this weekend about 30 minutes before I asked to borrow the book.</p>
<p>She has an emotional attachment to these books. Probably due to the fact that she has spent hundreds of hours making them. If there is every a fire at our house we all know that the scrapbooks get saved no matter what.</p>
<p>As a child, I sort of loathed the fact that my mom took 5 million pictures wherever we went. I had friends that lamented with me as well because they too had scrapbooking mothers. Emily, Taylor, Thomas and I, who were in the same grade school class, and who I still am friends with to this day would be subjected to photos everywhere we went. Our mothers were our own paparazzi. You better believe that we had every outing, together or separate documented. We put on really good faces and went along with it. Good thing we did, because now we all have these amazing books that our moms made.</p>
<p>They used to have parties together. They would set up tables and scrapbook for hours. Literally hours. I remember one time my mom and I went to Chicago with another mother daughter set. My mom thought it would be a genius idea to bring her scrapbooking things with her so she could scrapbook in the hotel. We had to tote those bags around with us through the airport. We missed a flight due to the volume of bags, and due to the fact that our moms found a Talbot&#8217;s Kids.</p>
<p>The point is I love these books. My books are a teal green color. My sister has a color and so does my brother. And as the years progressed on my mom got better at scrapbooking. When I told her I was taking my baby book she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t take that one, I wasn&#8217;t good at scrapbooking then.&#8221; Now she uses a fancy paper cutting machine that carves colored paper into shapes and letters and 3D holograms. But when she first started she hand wrote most of what was in our books. And I love my mom&#8217;s hand writing so I was jazzed.</p>
<p>I am also the first-born child. Which means my parents loved me the most&#8230;. I mean they didn&#8217;t really, but I was like a new toy. A new toy that my mom needed to write down everything about. Literally. I know the dates of almost every major event in my baby days. For example&#8230;.</p>
<p>Crawled: May 10, 1990<br />
Sat up: May 2, 1990<br />
Walked Alone: Mid July 1990<br />
Drank From a Cup: at 10 1/2 months, only uses a cup (with a lid)</p>
<p>You get the idea. Every new food that was introduced to me was dated. Every hilarious thing I said was document. And let me tell you, I was hilarious. For example&#8230;</p>
<p>2 Years: Put your seat belt on lady. (I said this to a realtor that was taking us to see a house)<br />
2 Years: I&#8217;m the cleaner lady&#8230;. have you got fixty dollars? Have you got ten? Ok, it&#8217;s free.</p>
<p>2 Years 4 months: Kate, guess what Santa Claus will come to our house. &#8220;Does he have a key?&#8221;</p>
<p>2 1/2 Years: What are you guys talking about? Are you talking about me?<br />
2 1/2 Years: I know, let&#8217;s do something really fun!<br />
2 1/2 Years: Oh, I&#8217;m sad. I&#8217;m sad (before a spanking)<br />
2 1/2 Years: Kate, it&#8217;s rude to contradict people. &#8220;No it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I know a lot about myself as a child. And that is largely due to the fact that my mom wrote in this book. I am forever indebted to her. She likes to try to guilt trip me into scrapbooking by saying things like, &#8220;Your children are going to be <em>so </em>deprived without scrapbooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I laugh and nod and know that she is right. I probably won&#8217;t be able to resist the stickers and paper and nonsense that my mom loves so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Me, my mom, Damma, Nanny, Gram. </p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably one of the coolest pictures in my baby book. We span the years 1889 to 1989. The women in my family are notorious for cutting their hair short whilst pregnant. Clearly my mom fell into that category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_539" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://thecelebrationist.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc01988.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-539" title="DSC01988" src="http://thecelebrationist.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc01988.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There&#039;s a reason Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. </p></div>

I had a rocking outfit. </p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My third birthday looked like it was straight out of the pages of a Pottery Barn photoshoot. I had a great outfit on and my mom had beautiful hair. 1992 was a good year.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s that. My baby book. I will have it forever and ever. I love it so so much. I should probably start buying stickers so I can become a professional scrapbooker.</p>
<p>Thanks Momma.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sufficiently documented.</p>
<p>PS: As I write this, my friend Courtlyn is looking through my book. He said the following, &#8220;The best thing about this book is the evolution of your mother&#8217;s hair.&#8221; That pretty much summed everything up.</p>
<p>PPS: I went to grade school in Edmond up to the 2nd grade. I have pictures with all of my friends from Edmond. There are about 5 of them that I reconnected with in college. Full circle.</p>

<em>Editor's note: the following is a guest post by <a href="http://scobleizer.com">Robert Scoble</a>, who studies tech startups and innovators for Rackspace Hosting. His videos usually go up on <a href="http://building43.com">Rackspace's Building43</a>.

You might be like my friends, who thought that the computer mouse was invented at PARC, Xerox's R&#38;D lab. 

It wasn't.

Instead the computer mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart at SRI International and, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">the mother of all demos</a>, showed it, and a number of other key features of computing that we all know like windows and hypertext, off in December, 1968.

<p>Since then <a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI International</a>, which employs 1,700 researchers, has been busy on a number of things from radar, ultrasound imaging, remote surgery, and much more. It has also been incubating a few things that have turned into startups. My favorite example is <a href="http://siri.com/">Siri</a>, which is an assistant for your iPhone. Apple bought that last year for a rumored $200+ million and I&#8217;ve been hearing rumors that we&#8217;ll see some of that work as part of the iPhone 5 launch later this year. More about Siri later.</p>

At the end you can listen into the venture capitalists who funded Siri and hear about the process that company went through during its acquisition by Apple.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick it off with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOwfdUFdtf0">an introduction to the tour</a> where you&#8217;ll meet Norman and Bill.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/EOwfdUFdtf0/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Next <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPa7aU0XBoc">you&#8217;ll see an augmented reality system</a>, built for the military, where a soldier can get training at a much lower expense than before. How? It replaces human actors with computer-generated ones that a soldier can &#8220;see&#8221; by wearing a helmet that includes a camera and glasses with a screen inside. </p>
<p>What could this be used for in real world? How about training of customer service agents? Or police officers? </p>

<p>To continue on the augmented reality theme, Norman and Bill next introduce me to &#8220;shopping of the future.&#8221; Using a Microsoft Kinect system someone at home could try on a variety of different items. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jkO6KjhpjU">In the demo, titled &#8220;Magic Mirror,&#8221; we see</a> that a consumer could try a number of different handbags and see how they actually look as they virtually carry them around.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/5jkO6KjhpjU/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>But how do we actually augment humans in another way? For instance, can we make an iPhone that takes spoken English text and translates it to some other language? Well, at SRI International they next brought me over to <a href="http://www-speech.sri.com/people/precoda/">Kristin Precoda</a>, director of <a href="http://www-speech.sri.com/">SRI&#8217;s Speech Technology and Research</a>, who demoed me a translation system. This system is being used in military in Afghanistan and other places in the world. It&#8217;s an amazing system, but will need work to build it out for consumer applications (most consumer uses would be in languages like Chinese, Japanese, or European languages like French or German and the system does none of those since it was developed for military purposes).</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/-xPRZvs-GLE/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>After getting my mind blown by the translation technology, what could we do with the iPhone&#8217;s camera? Well, SRI has invented an image processing technology they call &#8220;fusion.&#8221; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8hTh9jPi2I">Here they show us</a> how they can fuse images together taken at different focus positions, which will let you get one image that&#8217;s sharp at all of them. Plus, they can combine images done at different exposures, which extends the dynamic range. Features like these have already shown up in cameras and software like Adobe&#8217;s Photoshop, but they go further with fun image replacement technology.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/a8hTh9jPi2I/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>What else could these smart developers do with cameras? Well, how about an iPhone app that could help you track what you eat? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrhN7kPU9rI">Aim this iPhone app at food</a> and it measures it and calculates how many calories the food contains. Since my dad just had a kidney transplant and needed to measure all of his food, this app means a lot to me. But imagine a future <a href="http://www.foodspotting.com/">Foodspotting</a> app that could share not just a photo, but caloric info about that ribeye steak you are considering eating! You&#8217;ll notice this isn&#8217;t ready for consumers yet, they need to make it work smoother because it needs you to capture five images so it can do its calculations.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/xrhN7kPU9rI/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>After that we moved to another part of the building and while walking Bill and Norman told me about all the work that SRI had done on medical robots that help surgeons do their work (<a href="http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/">Intuitive Surgical</a> was spun out of the work done here) but what is the latest work they are doing? </p>
<p>Well, they&#8217;ve developed systems that let a surgeon work thousands of miles away from the patient. This keeps battlefield costs down, but as it is privatized it can bring great healthcare to people around the world. A surgeon who lives in Palo Alto could operate on someone in Africa, using these devices. Here Tom Lowe, director of medical robotics at SRI, shows me several machines, in two parts, to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bioGAH1KnME">see both the existing machines in the field now</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ghwOLCA35o">next-generation machines that give haptic feedback</a>.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/bioGAH1KnME/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>In the second part of the medical robotic demos, Tom shows me a machine with much higher resolution 3D imagery as well it includes haptic feedback. In other words, this machine can let you &#8220;feel&#8221; how much force is being applied by the robot (very important if you were defusing a bomb, for instance).</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/_ghwOLCA35o/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>But how else can robots be used to augment human capabilities? How about a robot that can walk up walls or windows to look for cracks or other things that need to be fixed up?</p>
<p>Harsha Prahlad, research engineer at SRI, showed me around his lab, explained all sorts of things they are doing using electro adhesion. Whoa, what&#8217;s that? Well, adhesives used to only be chemical glues, right? Now they&#8217;ve replaced the glue with static electricity. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKKPIAe-bDs">He explains how it works and shows me</a> several different use cases and robots.</p>
<p>This stuff is amazing. It can stick to anything. Glass. Concrete. Peeling paint. It doesn&#8217;t need suction to &#8220;stick.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/NKKPIAe-bDs/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>What else can you use static electricity for? Well, they started playing around and found they could make artificial muscles. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfVK-F8Pfm8">See how they work here</a>. These small muscles can compress and contract very quickly and they show a demo where it makes an iPhone have much better haptic feedback. Their technology is built into the <a href="http://www.mophie.com/pulse-iPod-Touch-4th-Gen-vibrating-gaming-case-p/2015_pulst4.htm">Mophie Pulse</a>, which is coming soon (I got an early demo and it definitely gives much better feedback than just the vibrator built into the iPhone).</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qfVK-F8Pfm8/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>While walking the hallways I saw a weird display case with some destroyed rings and asked them if I could turn on the camera and learn more. Turned out we were near <a href="http://www.sri.com/psd/poulter/">the Poulter Lab</a>, where they solve practical problems in explosions, impacs, and fire and their effects on materials and structures. In this segment <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or3vLxZp6qs">I learned all about &#8220;impulsive loads&#8221;</a> and now you will too as they show you some of the things they are doing now, including trying to find materials that will stand up to weapons. Gives new meaning to bulletproof glass. The stories this team can tell are lots of fun.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/coolest-tech-tour-sri-human-condition/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/or3vLxZp6qs/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Finally, in a previous visit, I sat down with Norman and the VCs who funded Siri, the company that sold to Apple, and got the inside scoop in a two-part video (<a href="http://www.building43.com/videos/2010/08/10/behind-the-scenes-scoop-on-siris-funding-and-sale-to-apple-part-i/">part I</a>, <a href="http://www.building43.com/videos/2010/08/12/behind-the-scenes-scoop-on-siris-funding-and-sale-to-apple-part-ii/">part II</a>). This is a rare look at how VCs think and how technology moves out of SRI and into your hands. Since I ran those videos before, I&#8217;ll let you go and watch them and won&#8217;t embed them here.</p>
<p>Lastly on our tour<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYWObsyF8Hg"> Bill and Norman wrap up our day</a>. What a great tour and it&#8217;s a rare look inside SRI. Thank you to Bill and Norman for opening up the doors to me and giving me one of my favorite technology company tours ever.</p>
