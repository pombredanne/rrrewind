			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sent an article yesterday from the January issue of Wired magazine that is well worth reading.  Written by comedian Patton Oswalt, it&#8217;s titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_angrynerd_geekculture/">Wake Up, Geek Culture.  Time to Die</a>,&#8221; and deals with the ways in which our consumption of &#8211; and relationship with &#8211; popular culture have changed over the past twenty years or so.  Within the article, Oswalt expresses frustration about the popular adoption of what might be called geek or &#8220;otaku&#8221; culture and especially at the ease in which new and casual fans can apparently learn everything there is to know about a property with a few swift clicks.  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with the Internet, however, is that it lets anyone become otaku about anything <em>instantly</em>. In the ’80s, you couldn’t get up to speed on an entire genre in a weekend. You had to wait, month to month, for the issues of <cite><a href="http://watchmenmovie.warnerbros.com/dvd/index.html">Watchmen</a></cite> to come out. We couldn’t BitTorrent the latest John Woo film or digitally download an entire decade’s worth of grunge or hip hop. Hell, there were a few weeks during the spring of 1991 when we couldn’t tell whether Nirvana or Tad would be the next band to break big. Imagine the terror!</p></blockquote>
<p>The article descends into flippancy towards the end, but Oswalt makes a valid point about speed and ease of consumption of entertainment information.  The internet does make it a lot easier to &#8220;catch up&#8221; with properties, which in some cases may accelerate their seeping into the mainstream.  However, what Oswalt is really concerned about isn&#8217;t the ability to stream the whole of <em>The Wire</em> to your laptop in a week.  He&#8217;s really focused on the twin concepts of (a) exclusivity; and (b) mastery.  I&#8217;m going to briefly look at both from a Transmedia standpoint and suggest why he shouldn&#8217;t be quite so worried.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exclusivity</span></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve written before, the entertainment properties that we enjoy become part of our identity.  That&#8217;s true for somebody who loves Lady Gaga and <em>Gossip Gir</em>l as much as it is a consummate <em>Warhammer </em>devotee.  But there&#8217;s something special about the kind of culture that Oswalt describes as &#8220;geek culture&#8221; &#8211; a joy in knowing something that most people don&#8217;t.  As he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Admittedly, there’s a chilly thrill in moving with the herd while quietly being tuned in to something dark, complicated, and unknown just beneath the topsoil of popularity. Something about which, while we moved <em>with</em> the herd, we could share a wink and a nod with two or three other similarly connected herdlings.</p></blockquote>
<p>That &#8220;wink and nod,&#8221; whether literal or metaphorical, underpins a lot of fandom.  We all want to be part of something special, and when our passion begins to ooze into the mainsteam &#8211; as happens so rapidly today with anything of artistic value &#8211; we feel that our identity has been co-opted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disconcerting in a way to realize that the internet may have killed the era of the underground; it is hard to conceive of anything that is exceptionally well executed, refreshing, innovative or even plain disturbing <em>not </em>spreading virally to a significant audience over a course of months (or perhaps days).  With that said, I do not think that the kind of exclusive connective experiences that Oswalt writes about are dead altogether &#8211; they have been replaced with something critical to the thesis of Transmedia: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">tiered fandom</span>.</p>
<p>The internet may allow the spread of entertainment quickly, but it is also ideally suited to a scenario where the audience has the choice in how deeply it wants to delve into the world.  To pick up on the musical examples that Oswalt uses, even a mainstream act like Bruce Springsteen can be tiered into levels of fans: those who only know the biggest hits, those who have bought several albums and seen a concert, and those &#8211; the otaku &#8211; who seize on every live performance, trade old obscure b-sides and discuss the differences between two different versions of a song by The Boss.  Granted, those fans may no longer have to physically trade grainy old cassettes, but the level of devotion and exclusivity in the core fans is not diminished.</p>
<p>Think of any entertainment property or artist in the world, and you will likely find a devoted, exclusive community on the web.  As Henry Jenkins explains in <em>Convergence Culture</em>, reality television shows often have &#8220;secret&#8221; message boards that are hidden within a large, general access forum.  Access to those forums is limited to a select few, and admission based on longevity of fandom and trust.  Within these secret forums, rumors and &#8220;leaks&#8221; are dissected comprehensively.  I know this to be true because as a teenager I moderated a fan forum for a rock band and would be sent information and even studio recordings by the lead guitarist straight from the mixing board to be disseminated among less than a dozen people.  It may not be the literal &#8220;nod and wink&#8221; that Oswalt describes, but it is the digital equivalent.</p>
<p>The magic of the situation is that we now live in a world where, pursuant to Transmedia principles, we can actually manage these core fans and give them experiences that cater to their desire to be exclusive.  Millions of people saw <em>Tron: Legacy</em> (which is <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/48054">apparently </a>about to be greenlit for a sequel).  However, fewer of those people played the game and read the accompanying video game.  Fewer still participated in the <a href="http://www.flynnlives.com/">Flynn Lives</a> Alternate Reality Game, and only a few hundred had been patiently discussing the original film for the best part of a decade on <a href="http://www.tron-sector.com/">tron-sector.com</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.tron-sector.com/forums/">I/O Tower Forums</a>.  For those fans, the resurgence of <em>Tron </em>isn&#8217;t a reason for fear, it&#8217;s a cause for celebration &#8211; and if their world is invaded by new casual fans, the original core fans will simply move further into their web of exclusivity.</p>
<p>In essence, Transmedia allows us to avoid the kinds of worries that Oswalt talks about by enfranchising a few of these core fans (after discussions and vetting, of course) to become agents of the franchise &#8211; torchbearers.  In that way, they help manage the communities while knowing that they will always be special &#8211; even as the property is absorbed by the masses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mastery</span></p>
<p>The other side of the coin in Oswalt&#8217;s argument is mastery, which can also be thought of as &#8220;a deep understanding of the property, story and characters.&#8221;  He suggests that, because people can consume the basics of a property in a week (or, with wikipedia, a day), fan culture is somehow less special.</p>
<p>I actually take issue with Oswalt&#8217;s essential thesis here.  For starters, fans are still &#8211; to a lesser extent &#8211; slaves to release dates.  You can catch up on the whole of<em> Mad Men </em>in a long weekend, but you&#8217;ll still have to wait for the spring to see what happens next.  Likewise, you can study everything around Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>Batman </em>films but you&#8217;re still going to be waiting for the release of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> like everybody else.  That basic principle will be accentuated further as we move to the Transmedia paradigm of prepping a rollout of stories for a property over the course of years.  Because true Transmedia requires a deep understanding of the underlying themes and values of a property, there is potential for a huge number of varied stories that resonate authentically with fans and allow them to explore many facets of a story world &#8211; true &#8220;mastery&#8221; might never be fully achieved.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, is the idea that knowing something &#8211; the facts of a property &#8211; is not the same as understanding it.  This is where we move, perhaps, from the idea of entertainment <em>consumption </em>to a word I hear used a lot in Transmedia discussions: <em>experience</em>.  For instance, I could go onto the <em>Spider-Man</em> wikipedia page, as Oswalt implies, and learn about all of the major events in Peter Parker&#8217;s life in a few hours.  I could memorize them, even to the extent of knowing the issue numbers, and claim to be an expert.  But that would not mean that I understand <em>Spider-Man</em>.  To do that, I would have to sit down with the individual issues, or some trade compilations, and follow the chronology of the story &#8211; watching relationships develop and, occasionally, tragedies occur.  I would probably also have to discuss my experience with others.</p>
<p>It is for that reason that we have started to see internet forums and discussion threads spring up entitled &#8220;let&#8217;s play <em>Monkey Island</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>let&#8217;s read Lord of the Rings</em>.&#8221;  The principle behind this is that a group of people &#8211; located across the world &#8211; experience something simultaneously and then meet back and talk about it.  Even in a spoiler-based culture where we all know that Elsa Schneider is a Nazi and that Angela Baker is really Peter (prize for recognizing that reference!), this replicates the experience of communal mastery wonderfully &#8211; just as well, if not better, than the ostensibly lost process that Oswalt describes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Waiting for the next issue, movie, or album gave you time to reread, rewatch, reabsorb whatever you loved, so you brought your own idiosyncratic love of that thing to your thought-palace. People who were obsessed with <cite>Star Trek</cite> or the <cite>Ender’s Game</cite> books were all obsessed with the same object, but its light shone differently on each person. Everyone had to create in their mind unanswered questions or what-ifs. What if Leia, not Luke, had become a Jedi? What happens after Rorschach’s journal is found at the end of <cite>Watchmen</cite>? What the hell was <cite><a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/the-prisoner/">The Prisoner</a></cite> about?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the kinds of questions that Oswalt mentions bring in another factor in Transmedia mastery: fan content.  There are fan works &#8211; some of excellent quality &#8211; that explore all of those ideas and can then be critiqued and discussed within communities.  In that regard, the internet has improved the level of dialog around entertainment properties; I fail to see how you could argue otherwise.  The added bonus is that, in Jeff Gomez&#8217;s proposed paradigm, some of this fan work then becomes canonical.  This would mitigate further against the kind of &#8220;everything available&#8221; numbness that Oswalt talks about because, in addition to the officially commissioned motion picture sequel (due in three years), graphic novel (next year) and video game (coming in 18 months), fans would have to eagerly wait for the next installment in a wonderful fan written (but officially recognized) trilogy that follows the adventures a niche character and his family on the other side of the globe from the main action.</p>
<p>The future is bright, and &#8220;geek culture,&#8221; as Oswalt calls it, is poised to become more interesting than ever before.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">On Remixes and the New Generation of Talent</span></p>
<p>On a side note, Oswalt also suggests that the internet, and remix culture in particular, is going to kill original thought and new IPs.  His argument is, in essence, that people will hardly bother creating new things when they can simply remix existing hits &#8211; changing<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkVWuP_sO0"> The Shining into a comedy</a> for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why create anything new when there’s a mountain of freshly excavated pop culture to recut, repurpose, and manipulate on your iMovie?</p></blockquote>
<p>On this count, Oswalt is dead wrong.  Not withstanding my personal belief that people will always be driving by creative instinct (and ego) to put a personal stamp on the world, he fails to understand that people that are creating remixes are learning valuable creative skills that can be applied to their own work.  Someone who reedits a film into a different genre is learning about dramatic beats, rhythm, use of music for tone, shot framing for emotional effect and so on.  When I was studying producing, the owner of one of the top trailer companies came in to speak to us and revealed that every new hire his company makes has a background in fan-created trailers.  It will only be a matter of time before one of those people writes, shoots and edits something on the weekend that demonstrates his or her expertise to stunning effect.  Absorbing popular works does not deaden creativity &#8211; it enhances it.  Quentin Tarantino sat around watching obscure VHS tapes all day before reprocessing the ideas within to give us some of the most iconic scenes in cinema history.</p>
<p>This will prove to be true with literature, music, games and more.  Moreover, because these remix-creators are so finely attuned to fan culture, they will be more prepared to create Transmedia universes that satiate and excite the modern &#8220;geek&#8221; &#8211; with greater depth and narrative complexity than ever before.  It&#8217;s not unlike the effect of Dungeons and Dragons.  I had the great fortune to listen to <a href="http://twitter.com/floerianthebard">Lucas Johnson</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeff_gomez">Jeff Gomez</a> discuss their D&amp;D experiences before the Transmedia meetup this week &#8211; Jeff said that people in Hollywood had expressed to him the belief that the skills that D&amp;D fosters had influenced some of the most interesting genre works of the past twenty years.  So it will be with remix culture; it may take a while to kick in, but when it does the art produced will be fantastic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></p>
<div id="attachment_423" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><strong><a href="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_48831.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-423" title="IMG_4883" src="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_48831.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">All clean on the western front.</p></div>
<p></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To redouble the difficulties of moving to a foreign country, the onslaught of my big dumb adventure in Korea coincided with the first time I lived away from home and the first real Big Boy job I had ever had. As though to compound and concrete up my developing, nascent sense of grown-upedness, I would move around the world on my own and begin working full-time all at once. The teaching, at least, I had done before. Moving to a different culture, I felt ready for, at least in-as-much as one can feel ready to abandon everything your brain accepts as a normal way of life. The weirdest part has probably been adjusting to living on my own.</p>
<p><span id="more-422"></span></p>
<p>My feeling of myself as an adult is one that I cling to, a tiny bulb of ego to be nourished against the other prevailing notion in my brain that I’m still a developing man-child in over his head. For whatever reason, I disconnect this Grown Up feeling from my profession, and from my interactions with Korean culture. Teaching occupies its own region of my consciousness, and it’s something I managed to do while feeling still overarchingly immature. By the same token, I’ve also travelled and written about travelling in previous years, all while overall feeling half-baked as a cognitively developed Real Adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While superficial at times, my Grown Up sense is deeply tied to my apartment and how I manage it. Every aspect seems to speak to my abilities to be a Person who can be good at Life. When the apartment is well-maintained, when the dishes are washed, when the floors are clean, when the laundry is nice and folded, I feel pride. I feel wise. I feel as though I can confront the world, come what may, weather any storm, cliché cliché cliché. I feel precocious, as though no one has ever managed to live alone at 23 before (and I suffocate my cognitive dissonance by ignoring my knowledge about how the majority of people used to do this and how many still do). My ego swells Jabba-like, and I become self-satisfied.</p>
<div id="attachment_425" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4900.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-425" title="IMG_4900" src="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4900.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A clean apartment! No other human has achieved such a feat.</p></div>
<p>It is a shame, then, that I am systematically unable to maintain the apartment, or this preening sense of self., for more than a consecutive three-day span The cleanliness of my apartment rides on an easily observable cycle, as do my moods and my feelings about the rising tide of filth surrounding and entrapping me. Behold, a standard week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday is the cleanliest day. It is garbage day, and thus I remove all of the crap I accrue over the span of one week. The laundry has just finished drying and is put away. Often I will make my bed as soon as I am out of it. Things are orderly. If I use a dish, I wash it almost instantly, allow it to dry, and then put it away. Coincidentally,, Tuesday is also the night I have little time at home, so there is no chance to mess things up. The delicate ecosystem of orderliness is maintained harmoniously, mostly because I am not around to disrupt it. All is well. The moments I am, I am overcome with smugness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wednesday and Thursday, I spend only a little time at home. Trash has no chance to build up, I only leave a few articles of clothing draped across the futon, and the bed gets made at least at some point before I go to sleep. I am comfortable with my adulthood. It is secure. I think I could make a go at being an adult professionally! They have leagues for this sort of thing, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_424" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4885.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-424" title="IMG_4885" src="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4885.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Clutter encroaches.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friday and Saturday strike. I cook things, and have no time to scour the dishes. They begin to form a tower in the sink, slowly building, becoming more rickety and galling to my sensibilities by the second. I stop looking in the direction of the kitchenette, hoping that in the time before I snap and do the dishes, they will become sentient and get to it themselves. I go out those nights, and when I eventually stumble in, I drink water and juice from the bottle, I drop my clothes upon whatever spot they first leave my wretched body, and fall into my shredded, unmade bed. When I wake, I will eat breakfast, not wash the dishes, and never look at the condition of the tile in the bathroom when I shower. It will be better if I don’t know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On these days, I have no time for shame. I’m living my life! Seeing the world! Life is my oyster and also a big box of chocolates, and who can think about piddling concerns like cleanliness and sanitation when you’re out eating chocolate oysters all the time? Adulthood maintained! Party on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunday I wake. I see the condition of my apartment. I grow concerned. Do people actually live like this? I become certain I was cloned in a lab, and that bear or pig genes were spliced in at some point. Do Koreans break into my apartment and leave the dust from their own homes for me to deal with? I can’t have possibly done all of this. Do dirty dishes breed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wallow in self-pity for some time, click about the internet, feeling down on myself and my capabilities as an adult. Real people don’t do this. Real people believe in picking up after themselves, and don’t behave as though they were raised by wolves. I momentarily develop hypochondria, positive I have inflicted myself with untold disease and bacteria. What is wrong with me? As you grow up, you become cognizant of the laundry hamper, and you try to organize your refuse. You do not allow your one-room to turn into its own dystopic hell-hole.</p>
<div id="attachment_428" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dum-dum-graph.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-428" title="dum dum graph" src="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dum-dum-graph.jpg?w=600&#038;h=450" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Originally I was going to make this in Paint.</p></div>
<p>I steel myself. Things can change. I will redouble my commitment to being a real Grown-Up. I put on the laundry (and tape the exhaust hose into the sink so that it doesn’t flood the bathroom anymore, a neat trick I learned a few weeks back). I scrub the dishes, and the floors, and the walls. I acquire groceries, cook a meal, and clean the remnants, rather than letting them fester. I spray air freshener. I would live here, I think, even if I wasn’t required to by the Korean government.</p>

<p>By Monday, my laundry is freshly drying upon the many racks. My sink is still empty, and my futon clear of detritus. I have done good. My pride returns, and I flop onto bed, swollen with ego once more. I deserve a little break from cleaning and organization for the next few days, don’t I? I am, after-all, such a grown-up, that I can just get to cleaning up after myself in a few days!</p>
<p>The cycle begins anew.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jannatwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/questionmark.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1566" title="QuestionMark" src="http://jannatwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/questionmark.jpg?w=88&#038;h=119" alt="" width="88" height="119" /></a>I’m going to share a secret:  embarrassment is a close friend of mine.  Okay, it’s not really a secret; anyone who knows me is aware that I have a knack for turning even normal encounters into awkward moments that usually end with my cheeks looking like I overindulged at the Clinique makeup counter.</p>
<p>Digging back into my abundant “embarrassing moments” archive, my first job interview came easily to mind.  I’m going to share it with you for two reasons:  1) it has some application to my writing experience; and 2) you can’t point and laugh at me because we’ll never meet.</p>
<p>I was just a couple months shy of my sixteenth birthday, and I wanted to get a job so I could buy my own stuff.  My parents also wanted me to get a job…so I could buy my own stuff.  It may have been the only thing we agreed on at that time in my life <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>My applications to grocery stores, drug stores and anything-but-fast food went ignored.  I couldn’t even get an interview because I had no work experience.  One day, I finally did it.  I did something I told my parents (very indignantly) that I would never do:  I submitted an application to a fast food restaurant.  I expected another dead-end, so I stammered like an idiot when they called me on the phone several days later to set up an interview.  It would be the next day.</p>
<p>I dressed to not impress in my Jordache jeans with the holey knees and zippers on back that ran from my ankle to my calf, neon pink puffy paint L.A. Gear T-shirt and my pink and white high-top tennis shoes.  I can feel your disbelief.  You’re thinking, “Yeah, right.  How does she remember what she wore?” </p>
<p>It’s easy.  I just described my favorite clothes that year.  I wore them ALL the time, so I know that&#8217;s what I picked for the interview.  Looking back, I acknowledge that it was a cringe-worthy outfit that I probably shouldn’t have worn anywhere.  I shouldn’t have teased and hair-sprayed my bangs straight up either, but that’s beside the point.</p>
<p>I didn’t have my license yet, so my mom drove me to the interview and sat at a table across the restaurant.  I pretended like we weren’t together.  The manager directed me to a table against the wall.  I succeeded in walking over to it without tripping, so I was pleased with myself.  I set my purse on the floor beside the chair and sat down, reminding myself to breathe because my nerves were threatening to suffocate me.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the questions he asked, or what goofy answers I supplied.  What I do remember is that I had crossed my legs and was nervously swinging my leg back and forth, causing my foot to tap against the table leg as if I kept time to some imaginary song.  I don’t know how long I did this before I finally realized it, but it finally started to annoy me so I uncrossed my legs to make it stop. </p>
<p>Soon after, the interview ended.  I thanked him for his time and bent down to get my purse.  To my horror, I noticed that the table wasn’t on a pedestal like the others in the middle of the restaurant – it was bolted to the wall.  I realized that the object I had been kicking was the manager’s leg, and he didn’t say a word about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://jannatwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/embarrassedemoticon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1569" title="EmbarrassedEmoticon" src="http://jannatwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/embarrassedemoticon.jpg?w=148&#038;h=150" alt="" width="148" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>To my surprise, I was offered the job soon after.  But I was so embarrassed, the thought of seeing the manager again made me physically ill. What do you think I did?</p>
<ol>
<li>Turned the job down and cried.</li>
<li>Never went to that restaurant again and cried.</li>
<li>Accepted the job, even though I’d probably not be able to make eye contact with him – and cried.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, it was 3., or I wouldn’t have a blog post, would I?  Now, I bet you’re curious about what this has to do with writing (or you’re irritated because I’ve taken so long to get to the point.)  Here it is:</p>
<p>My first job interview was a disaster (this is fact – not opinion.)  I’ve had a few job interviews since then, and most of them have gone smoothly.  (One didn’t – but that’s a different blog post <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> )  My interviews are not unlike my writing:  my first attempts at writing were a mess.  My early poetry was very simple and trite.  My first stories were essay-ish, overly descriptive narratives without even a line of dialogue.</p>
<p>I would be embarrassed if others read these works, but I am still pleased with them, because they were the beginnings of practice that allowed me to improve – just like my first interview taught me to always keep my feet on the floor…just like my writing ten years from now will be more precise than it is today.  That is something to not blush about!</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to share any life events that have translated to your writing?  Do you have anything to add?  If so, leave your comment!  Have a fantastic Friday <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </strong></p>

<p>Having already failed on the postaday challenge, I was instantly drawn to the idea of a &#8216;blogging buddy&#8217;. It&#8217;s my mission this year to keep this site fresh and sharing the experience may well help a great deal.</p>
<p>The idea is that you team up with someone who has similar interests and then set about the postaday/postaweek challenge together, inspiring each other with content and, more importantly, inspiring each other to continue doing something which can so easily be dropped.</p>
<p>I did as WordPress suggested and put my name forward, as did literally <em>hundreds</em> of other people. My reply was suddenly lost in a sea of text; fellow bloggers posting their likes, dislikes, preferred topics and gentle requests for someone to help them along. I quickly forgot about it. No one would spot a lone poster wanting to increase the music and tech content on his blog.</p>
<p>Then, within a couple of days, I had an email from a like-minded soul who had spotted my request. He too was into music production, technology and all things geeky. Suddenly, I had my blogging buddy.</p>
<p>That man is Chris, from Salt Lake City, Utah. Take a look at at his blog <a href="http://www.jazzsequence.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our goals seem to have stuck a chord (if you&#8217;ll excuse the pun) and I look forward to seeing how both our sites develop in 2011.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">Somehow&#8230;.I still remember my favorite Crayola box color from my elementary years. Though, I didn&#8217;t know I still remembered it until yesterday when I realized I&#8217;d been struck by a few images this week, all with a similar base color. That&#8217;s when it hit me, it wasn&#8217;t just any blue, it was M<em>idnight Blue</em>. Always the first crayon to wear down to the paper skin, I remember claiming it as soon as the 48-ct. box was opened.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">I first noticed it last week when <a title="Young House Love" href="http://www.younghouselove.com/2011/01/tall-dark-and-handsome/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808080;">Young House Love</span></a> (a genius and hilarious home renovation couple) used it as the background to their bookcase. Two days later, I was struck by it again (this time in form of a sofa) in <a title="Lonny Mag" href="http://lonnymag.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808080;">Lonny Mag</span></a><span style="color:#808080;">&#8216;s </span><a title="Lonny Mag Jan-Feb 2011" href="http://lonnymag.com/issues/13-jan-feb-2011/pages/1" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808080;">January-February issue</span></a>. So of course, I decided to do a Google search and found out that <a title="Crayola Midnight Blue" href="http://www.crayola.com/colorcensus/americas_favorites/display.cfm?color=225" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808080;">Crayola has a whole personality</span></a> attributed to Midnight Blue ~ &#8220;confidence, strength, and security&#8221;.

<p>Here&#8217;s a recipe for a  healthy cookie that makes an awesome snack or breakfast component. Adapted from Applesauce Softies in Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar.</p>
<p><a href="http://alimental.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn1640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-700" title="DSCN1640" src="http://alimental.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn1640.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Apricot Walnut Apple Cookies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1/2 cup spelt flour</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/2 cup oat flour</strong></li>
<li><strong>3/4 cup all purpose flour</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 tbsp cornstarch</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/4 tsp salt</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/2 tsp baking soda</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 tsp cinnamon</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/2 tsp allspice</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/2 tsp nutmeg</strong></li>
<li><strong>3/4 cup sucanat</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/3 cup vegetable oil</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 1/3 cups unsweetened applesauce</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/3 cup chopped walnuts</strong></li>
<li><strong>1/3 cup chopped apricots</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reduce the applesauce in a small saucepan over low heat for about 20 minutes, until the volume is reduced to about 2/3 cup. Completely cool the applesauce before continuing.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flours, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and spices. In a separate bowl, combine the sucanat, vegetable oil, vanilla, and reduced applesauce. Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stir in chopped apricots and walnuts. Place tablespoon sized cookie dough onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes.</p>

<p>Before I got into this whole parenting gig four years ago I was sure that people were overstating how complicated it is. I’m not talking about the daily challenges like sleepless nights, battles of wills, testing of patience and, at times, an utter inability to relate. I wasn’t naïve to how hard those would be. What I’m referring to are some hot-button issues that really get parental blood boiling, such as education, vaccines (although that should be less hot <a>now.</a>), breast feeding, corporal punishment and Santa Claus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not that I was unaware these were contentious issues, it’s just that I was confident in my opinion on each (as ignorant as that sounds now). I assumed that my wife and I could just make our choices, everyone else could make theirs and we’d all pat ourselves on the back and sing Kumbaya . Boy was I wrong. I completely underestimated a parent’s ability (including my own) to antagonize and belittle others, even if done unintentionally or subconsciously.</p>
<p><span id="more-1049"></span></p>
<p>Parents have opinions. Passionate ones. And most of them want other parents to agree with theirs. I really don’t know why that is, but my theory is that we know the gravity of the task ahead of us and we want validation that we’re doing it right.</p>
<p>We should definitely have our convictions about all of these issues. What kind of parents would we be if we didn’t? We&#8217;ll almost certainly take the public school route. He has received all of the scheduled and recommended vaccines and will continue to do so. He was not breastfed for the most part. We will never spank him. He believes in Santa Claus. I&#8217;m also in favor of discussing all of these issues with as many people as possible in order to understand other points of view and even change my mind if warranted. We cannot, however, allow those discussions to turn into harsh judgments about one another as parents.</p>
<p>Now that I know how difficult this job is, what I refuse to do is criticize others who choose differently on these issues. Unless I see some sort of true neglect or abuse, I’m going to assume that parents who have differing points of view have weighed each as prayerfully, judiciously and soberly as Shannon and I have. This is a damn hard job. We should be helping each other through this gloriously difficult life as a parent rather than looking for ways to prove others wrong.</p>
