				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toyota_Prius_III_20090710_front.JPG" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Toyota Prius III" alt="Toyota Prius III" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Toyota_Prius_III_20090710_front.JPG/300px-Toyota_Prius_III_20090710_front.JPG" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Toyota Prius III (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>This morning I noticed a Toyota Prius trying to get up a small hill that is very gradual.  It&#8217;s a small car that does wonders with gas mileage . . . normally.</p>
<p>Northeast Ohio, where I live, was hit by a load of snow yesterday (Yes, the day <em>after</em> Christmas. Bummer.).  We used to live in Rochester, NY, where there was an abundance of snow removal equipment. That was because there was quite a bit of snow up there on a regular basis. In fact, our first winter there it was the snowiest city in the United States (except for Alaska).  After the first major snow storm that year I was amazed to see a small snow plow being driven by an employee of our town. It was just the right size for the sidewalk! Pretty cool.</p>
<p><span id="more-2576"></span>We don&#8217;t get that much snow where we live now.  When it does snow a ton the plows don&#8217;t get around as quickly because we aren&#8217;t equipped to remove so much at one shot.</p>
<p>The New Year is right around the corner.  It&#8217;s the time when we take a look at ourselves with constructive criticism. <em>What is it that I need to change about myself? Boy, I really let myself go last year!</em>  I like to think that the Holy Spirit capitalizes on this time of year. We could help him out by listening to his prodding about how he&#8217;d like to transform us a little more. Maybe a lot more. Sometimes that voice you hear isn&#8217;t you trying to improve yourself. Often times it&#8217;s God.</p>
<p>Identifying the goal is the first step. Then you must agree to try to accomplish it. After agreeing to accomplish it, we need to use the right tools to make it happen. We fail at our New Year&#8217;s Resolutions at this final step more often than the rest. Zechariah 4:6 says &#8220;‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty. (NIV)&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the little Prius struggled in the depths, spinning and whirring to get the job done. He&#8217;d back up ten feet and charge forward to plow his way through, but to no avail.  I wonder what kind of mileage that guy got today.  From the looks of it, he had about six feet to the gallon in the minute that I watched. Eventually, he gave up. He had struggled valiantly, but he just wasn&#8217;t equipped for the task.</p>
<p>What hill is it that God wants you to conquer this year? Don&#8217;t take a Prius to an SUV party. God has the power you&#8217;ll need.  Stop depending on your own, because you&#8217;re just spinning your wheels.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Facebook,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. I need to figure things out. Like how you are sucking all my time and how you&#8217;re making me into someone I am not. Like how you make me hate myself as I skim through posts and pictures of my so-called &#8220;friends&#8221;. God, their lives are so perfect! Why is my life not as perfect as theirs? Am I the only one who have to deal with occasional bouts of jealousy and self-doubt every time I read about a &#8220;friend&#8221; who bought his own private jet, and another &#8220;close friend&#8221; who spent his holidays on the moon? I feel so pathetic.</p>
<p>Oh please, don&#8217;t stare at me with those wide pitiful eyes. That won&#8217;t work anymore. I know, things were going so great between us, and it&#8217;s such a shocker that I&#8217;m telling you this. But this has been on the back of my mind for months, and I&#8217;m sorry it has taken me quite a long time to finally gather enough courage to confess that you and I just aren&#8217;t good for each other. Remember that time I was at the top of the Eiffel tower in Paris? For a fleeting moment, while taking in the breathtaking panorama of the City of Lights, I really felt like I was the King of the World, that everything was truly possible, and yes, that with a panoramic view of Paris at night, who needs drugs to get high? But that feeling of being invincible quickly evaporated and was immediately replaced by a seemingly innocuous thought along the lines of: &#8220;I need to share this on Facebook! Paris, you&#8217;ll now be Instagrammed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh by the way, I don&#8217;t have an Instagram account, so I might have slightly altered the line above. But then, altering wall posts and minor adjustments in statuses have become a staple part of our complicated relationship dynamics, right? You&#8217;ve always made me feel like I needed to make my posts and stories more interesting than they really are, so there you go, I made some minor adjustments in them. It&#8217;s not that the minor adjustments are lies you know, they are after all, just minor. I just want my &#8220;friends&#8221; to like my posts, isn&#8217;t it a noble motivation to alter, and in doing so fake a post? Everyone&#8217;s doing it, so nothing&#8217;s possibly wrong with it, right?</p>
<p>Listen, you&#8217;re really great. You are. And you&#8217;re way too generous, to the point that I&#8217;m really having a hard time receiving all the stuff you so generously shower upon me. How come you know that I need to get informed on what my &#8220;friends&#8221; had for dinner, or about how a &#8220;friend&#8217;s&#8221; baby just had the first poop of the baby&#8217;s life, complete with DSLR-quality pictures of the poop? And isn&#8217;t it too much information when a &#8220;friend&#8221; posted about her weird bodily functions, about another&#8217;s drunken ramblings, and beat this &#8211; about someone&#8217;s sex life?</p>
<p>Our relationship was founded on complete trust. We even made a pact to be totally honest to each other. You promised me that you will reveal to me all your secrets, that all the things you know I will know. You have given me the power to really <del>stalk</del> know someone &#8211; what someone is up to, what type of movies she likes, where she spent her weekend, what sort of jokes she finds funny, how she looks like in a swimsuit, and even when she has a period &#8211; all in the comfort of my room and with a mindless click of a button! You even told me about a friend of a friend&#8217;s family background and life history, even though that friend of a friend is someone I&#8217;ve only known through you, and wouldn&#8217;t even talk to in real life. I sometimes feel queasy about this kind of set-up. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a little unhealthy knowing too much about a person without even spending time talking with that person?</p>
<p>This is not easy for me, believe me. We had so much promise, we shared so many memories. But as time passes by, I feel like our relationship has become a little more than a superficial facade, a carefully altered representation of myself. It has been totally unexpected that with the ease you provide in communicating with &#8220;friends&#8221;, my relationships with my &#8220;friends&#8221; are increasingly becoming shallower. What went wrong? Is it because with your existence, I have been more concerned about what others think of me through my online persona? That instead of meeting and talking with friends and family, I have resigned myself to simply liking and commenting on their posts?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. You deserve someone better. I deserve a better life too &#8211; a life of genuine relationships, a life that couldn&#8217;t care less about what people think as long as I know it&#8217;s what I want, a life lived every moment without thinking of posting it online&#8230; which is why, I&#8217;m setting both of us free.</p>
<p>Farewell,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Authors" href="http://thecortex.com.au/authors/">BENJAMIN ZAUGG</a>: Right at the beginning of <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i>, there is a wonderful scene depicting Thrór, the Dwarf King of Erebor, surrounded by mountains of gold, going completely mad with greed and power. As I watched the rest of the film I would frequently find myself recalling that scene and substituting that Dwarf King with Peter Jackson.</p>
<p>At a little over 300 pages long, the original paperback of <i>The Hobbit</i> is a rather and short straightforward tale. Originally, Peter Jackson was going to tackle it in two films, adding some backstory/sidestory elements to fill out two separate features. This was a bit of a surprise, but given Jackson&#8217;s relatively strong track record I was cautiously optimistic. When I heard that he was splitting the 300-page tale into <i>three</i> films I began to worry.</p>
<div id="attachment_492" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-492" alt="Peter Jackson's The Hobbit is far too long at 170-minutes. " src="http://cortexnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bilbo_1280x1024.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" width="300" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Peter Jackson&#8217;s The Hobbit is far too long at 170-minutes.</p></div>
<p>Going in with these grave concerns I came out at the end neither disappointed nor overly pleased with what I saw. There is no doubt that the movie was a combination of two dark forces: Warner Brother Studios milking three films out of what could easily have been one or two, and Peter Jackson given unlimited power to explore every nook and cranny of his cherished middle-earth. What makes Jackson different to say, George Lucas, is that he is actually an extremely good filmmaker. So while this first installment is overloaded with tacked-on story elements it holds together far better than it has any right to.</p>
<p>If you go into this expecting a faithful film adaptation of the first third of <i>The Hobbit</i> you will probably be disappointed. However, if you want to experience a richly detailed backstory to <i>Lord of The Rings</i> where part of <i>The Hobbit</i> is the main plot line, then this may be your cup of tea. Perhaps because I went in knowing it would be more of the latter I enjoyed myself most of the time.</p>
<p>The problem with expanding the story beyond the original book seems to be that much of its spirit seems to have been lost in the process. Part of what made the book so charming was its very linear Bilbo-centric storyline and Tolkien&#8217;s excellent pacing &#8211; which was so different from LOTR. With all the backstory and &#8216;side-quests&#8217; stuffed into this installment there is an added weight that slows down the narrative and it also feels like the story is more about the fellowship than about Bilbo Baggins. This is a particular shame because I felt that Martin Freeman&#8217;s Bilbo was the best thing about the film and I would have enjoyed a film more focused on that character’s journey.</p>
<p>It is only the <i>extra</i> story elements that slow things down, not the key ones. The arrival of the dwarves and the unveiling of their plan at the hobbit hole, while a scene or two too long, was very well done. The meeting of Gollum and Bilbo is above and beyond what I ever expected, and the appearance of the Goblin King (Barry Humphries) was excellent.</p>
<p>Whole swathes of story could be cut from around the main plot points and the film would only have benefited. Instead, Jackson seemed to be pulling out every bell and whistle to keep the add-ons interesting. I lost count of how many scenes occurred on or just near an overhanging cliff (there&#8217;s a new drinking game), and by the end of the film I&#8217;d almost forgotten what normal daylight looked like, because every scene seemed to take place at either sunrise or sunset. The editing seemed to be working overtime to keep things dynamic. Just when I thought they exhausted every camera angle a new one would appear.</p>
<p>Despite being a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster of plot and despite being something other than the original tale of <i>The Hobbit</i>, the stunning visuals and extraordinary cast made this film an enjoyable watch. I have no doubt that once all three films are finally released on Blu-ray, someone somewhere will rip and edit them all into a single three-hour epic with no extraneous plot. <i>That</i> film will be incredible. In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to treat each of these installments like the extended extended edition releases that they seem to be.</p>
<p>* * *</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Santa, I don&#8217;t ask for much geeky stuff, but one very good gift in that area would be a Dvorak keyboard for my iPad. And please don&#8217;t give me a side real hardware keyboard, I am talking of a touchscreen keyboard (the combo external keyboard + iPad looses the battle with my Mac Air&#8230;).</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31512354@N00/730311163" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" alt="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1074/730311163_2912a98110_m.jpg" width="240" height="80" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (Photo credit: Gustavo da Cunha Pimenta)</p></div>
<p>I switched to the Dvorak keyboard map not so long ago, last July. Reason for that was not to be faster (like many others) even if this would be a nice side effect, but exploring solutions to solve the pain of a recurring carpal tunnel syndrome. My friend Paolo advised this, explaining it would make my finger, hand and wrist move way less, as a result, it should reduce the inflammation and then the pain. If you are interested in the Dvorak keyboard, jut read it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Wikipedia</a>, or from <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/">Ma.tt</a> already almost 10 years ago!</p>
<p>For learning resources, you will find plenty around the web so I won&#8217;t say much here beside a short feedback if you are interested:</p>
<p>I am not yet 100% up to speed but really happy with that switch &#8211; I am still fighting a bit for all special characters and also for french accents&#8230; but I made progress in speed compared to my Qwerty typing. I am finally touch-typing and have my pain slightly diminished, which was the main goal. While not perfect yet, still very positive change!</p>
<p>I must say though that I can&#8217;t type for a too long time or pain still comes back but it is definitely an improvement compared to Qwerty. I also still have a hard time using it when not really in a &#8216;typing mode&#8217;, for instance when taking notes in meetings. And finally, I am just a bit annoyed by the blind or Dvorak stickers that I use on my keyboards as it is not the most comfortable solution. One day I will take the time to remove and switch keys.</p>
<p>Actually, now, the very main issue is coming from iOS. The Dvorak keyboard would be a perfect story for me if only I could use it not only on my computers but also on my iPhone and iPad but I can&#8217;t! It simply seems impossible to find a way to have a Dvorak map configured on the iOS system. Come on Apple, what the heck!? Can you believe that?</p>
<p>This is supposed to be so easy to support, certainly not more than a bunch of configuration files to change. Instead of that, we are in the paradoxical situation where we were able to find a solution for hardware keyboard and not for purely software ones&#8230;</p>
<p>And let me add that this is a typical example (among plenty of others) where I would love iOS to be more open if not open source. We are so far from it now with Apple. Openness would enable a bunch of happy few to make this thing happen quickly, without hurting Apple or asking their contribution, and pleasing many other users&#8230; but no! This has a taste of &#8220;innovation is over&#8221;&#8230; I will certainly keep a very interested eye on Android phones and tablets, and feel the change coming stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>And to conclude, I took 20 minutes to write this post because, even if just a drop in the ocean, I wanted to contribute to the Dvorak keyboard cause! It is super interesting and deserves more attention from device and system makers. It also needs to be known by more users. I believe that it is an interesting option with lots of potential for people like me. When I think about people writing, typing, translating, transcribing all day; I strongly feel Dvorak could be a much bigger change worth to consider.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Turbo debriefs on IBM's 2012 "5 in 5," five projected innovations based on market and societal trends and emerging technologies that could dramatically change our world.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=6878&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IBM released its annual &#8220;5 in 5&#8243; list yesterday, the seventh year in a row whereby IBM scientists identify a list of innovations that have the potential to change the way people work, live and interact during the next five years.</p>
<p>The IBM 5 in 5 is based on market and societal trends, as well as emerging technologies from IBM&#8217;s R&amp;D labs around the world. This year, the 5 explores innovations that will be underpinnings of the next era of computing, what IBM has described as &#8220;the era of cognitive systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>This next generation of machines will learn, adapt, sense, and begin to experience the world as it really is, and this year&#8217;s predictions focus on one element of the this new era: The ability of computers to mimic the human senses &#8212; in their own manner, to see, smell, touch, taste and hear.</p>
<p>But before you try and spoon-feed your iPad some vanilla yogurt, let&#8217;s get more practical.</p>
<p>These new sensing capabilities will help us become more aware, productive, and help us think &#8212; but not do our thinking for us.</p>
<p>Rather, cognitive systems will help us see through and navigate complexity, keep up with the speed of information, make more informed decisions, improve our health and standard of living, and break down all kinds of barriers &#8212; geographical, language, cost, even accessibility.</p>
<p>Now, on to our five senses.</p>
<p><strong>1) Touch: You will be able to touch through your phone.</strong>  Imagine using your smartphone to shop for your wedding dress and being able to feel the satin or silk of the gown, or the lace on the veil, from the surface on the screen. Or to feel the beading and weave of a blanket made by a local artisan half way around the world. In five years, industries like retail will be transformed by the ability to &#8220;touch&#8221; a product through your mobile device.</p>
<p>IBM scientists are developing applications for the retail,<strong> </strong>healthcare and other sectors using haptic, infrared and pressure sensitive technologies to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric &#8212; as a shopper brushes her finger over the image of the item on a device screen. Utilizing the vibration capabilities of the phone, every object will have a unique set of vibration patterns that represents the touch experience: short fast patterns, or longer and stronger strings of vibrations. The vibration pattern will differentiate silk from linen or cotton, helping simulate the physical sensation of actually touching the material.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sight: A pixel will be worth a thousand words.</strong> We take some 500 billion photos a year, and 72 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. But computers today only understand pictures by the text we use to tag or title them; the majority of the information &#8212; the actual content of the image &#8212; is a mystery.</p>
<p>In the next five years, systems will not only be able to look at and recognize the contents of images and visual data, they will turn the pixels into meaning, making sense out of it similar to the way a human views and interprets a photographs. In the future, &#8220;brain-like&#8221; capabilities will let computers analyze features such as color, texture patterns or edge information and extract insights from visual media, having a potentially huge impact on industries ranging from healthcare to retail to agriculture.</p>
<p>But please, no Escher drawings, at least for now&#8230;that&#8217;s just plain mean.</p>
<p><strong>3) Hearing: Computers will hear what matters. </strong> Ever wish you could make sense of all the sounds around you and be able to understand what&#8217;s not being said? Within five years, distributed systems of clever sensors will detect elements of sound such as sound pressure, vibrations and sound waves at different frequencies.</p>
<p>It will interpret these inputs to predict when trees will fall in a forest or when a landslide is imminent. Such a system will &#8220;listen&#8221; to our surroundings and measure movements, or the stress in a material, to warn us if danger lies ahead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ever hopeful such systems will be able to &#8220;listen&#8221; to my golf swing and help me course correct so I can play more target golf!</p>
<p><strong>4) Taste: Digital taste buds will help you to eat smarter.</strong> What if we could make healthy foods taste delicious using a different kind of computing system built for creativity? IBM researchers are developing a computing system that actually experiences flavor, to be used with chefs to create the most tasty and novel recipes. It will break down ingredients to their molecular level and blend the chemistry of food compounds with the psychology behind what flavors and smells humans prefer.</p>
<p>By comparing this with millions of recipes, the system will be able to create new flavor combinations that pair, for example, roasted chestnuts with other foods such as cooked beetroot, fresh caviar, and dry-cured ham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top Tasting Computer Chefs,&#8221; anyone?</p>
<p><strong>5) Smell: Computers will have a sense of smell.</strong> During the next five years, tiny sensors embedded in your computer or cell phone will detect if you&#8217;re coming down with a cold or other illness. By analyzing odors, biomarkers and thousands of molecules in someone&#8217;s breath, doctors will have help diagnosing and monitoring the onset of ailments such as liver and kidney disorders, asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy by detecting which odors are normal and which are not.</p>
<p>Already, IBM scientists are sensing environment conditions to preserve works of art, and this innovation is starting to be applied to tackle clinical hygiene, one of the biggest healthcare challenges today. In the next five years, IBM technology will &#8220;smell&#8221; surfaces for disinfectants to determine whether rooms have been sanitized. Using novel wireless mesh networks, data on various chemicals will be gathered and measured by sensors, and continuously learn and adapt to new smells over time.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to listen to IBM scientists describe some of these new innovations and their potential impact on our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The only unfulfilled love I&#8217;m willing to talk about openly is writing. And the realization that the love affair will never be reciprocated hurts just as much as that first time someone came out and said, &#8220;I like you. I just don&#8217;t like-like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing will never like-like me. I&#8217;m too old, and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m too old as much as born at the wrong time – the non-generation. I&#8217;m not a baby boomer. I&#8217;m not a Me. I&#8217;m too old to be a Gen-Xer. Or Y and Z for that matter. I missed the computer age – I didn&#8217;t even have a computer until I got married and I was forty-one before I actually owned my own – a laptop, which took me a year to finally use with any kind of regularity. My kids know the VCR as the machine next to the TV that has never worked.</p>
<p>I read Julie Andrews autobiography recently. She grew up in the fifties, and I was sad to discover that her voice is my voice. That&#8217;s how I write. Very formally, describing how the leaves rest on the rooftop, narrative on top of narrative with very little emotion unless it&#8217;s purple prose. I write like someone who grew up in the fifties, only I have no story to tell. My parents weren&#8217;t alcoholics, I did not overcome drug abuse, I wasn&#8217;t abused or molested. My parents sent me to college. I lived at home until I got married.</p>
<p>This non-generation of girls was expected to grow up, be prim and proper, but still know everything, go to school, college and be anything you wanted, anything boys could be even President of the United States. At least until you got married and had kids and in that order. And when the kids were in high school you could go back to work because women were independent now.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a writer. A writer is impractical. And they drink. They don&#8217;t have two nickels to rub together either.</p>
<p>Get a degree and then you can write.</p>
<p>Get married. You can write later.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re still young. You can&#8217;t wait to have kids. Writing will always be there.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Writing didn&#8217;t wait for me. Writing found someone else. Writing computerized. Modernized. Writing grew up, and changed with the times where it needed to. More do it yourself. More travel. More health care and fitness. New writers came along. Younger and prettier and having seen people like me get left behind knew just what to do to keep up.</p>
<p>Writing won&#8217;t ever come back for me, and I just can&#8217;t catch up. My writing is tired and old; timid. Like me.</p>
<p>My best friend, like any good friend, pushes me towards the love that got away, prods, challenges, shames, but he can only push so far. I keep my hand on the ledge. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s down there. I lean over, but I can&#8217;t see very far, and what I can see is dizzying.</p>
<p>What if I fall?</p>
<p>What if I catch up to writing and I&#8217;m just not good enough? Staying back and wondering is better than being rejected again, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
