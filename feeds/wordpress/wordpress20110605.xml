			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_7116" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://smheffern.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_1797-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7116" title="Summer Days, Driftin’ Away" src="http://smheffern.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_1797-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Mmm... steamers!" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mmm... steamers!</p></div>
<p>Even though I&#8217;ve been at the office three days this week, I&#8217;ve been feeling fairly vacation-y &#8211; probably a combination of Memorial Day being the official &#8220;kickoff&#8221; of the summer season and the fact that I&#8217;m taking a day off tomorrow to spend time with my sister while she&#8217;s in town. I suspect that&#8217;s the reason I looked at yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Daily Post</a> recommendation &#8211; <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/make-a-top-ten-list-of-things-to-do-this-summer/" target="_blank">make a top ten list of things to do this summer</a> &#8211; and thought, &#8220;Oh, I need to do <em>that</em>!&#8221;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Go to the beach.</strong> This is already planned &#8211; I&#8217;m joining a bunch of friends on a house rental in Cape May in August.</p>
<p>2.<strong> Go to the Adirondacks.</strong> I have a feeling this might come to pass as the girls&#8217; weekend I&#8217;m planning with <a href="http://www.wendalicious.com" target="_blank">Wendy</a> and Shannon <a title="Poll: To Train or Not to Train…" href="http://quesarah.net/2011/05/30/poll-to-train-or-not-to-train/">while I&#8217;m in New York in July</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Eat steamers (with beer).</strong> For reasons I can&#8217;t explain, steamed littleneck clams are not a summertime bar food staple in DC the way they always seemed to be in Albany, so that&#8217;s on my list of musts when I&#8217;m visiting this year.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Go to the races.</strong> I haven&#8217;t been to Saratoga <a href="http://quesarah.net/2007/09/02/and-theyre-off/">since the summer after my dad died</a>, so I need to find out if I can stow away in my brother&#8217;s car on one of his trips this summer.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Have drinks down on the waterfront.</strong> The Potomac makes for a nice backdrop for cocktails, but I rarely go down there (other than for ballgames) and want to rectify that this year.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Go to a Caps rookie or training camp practice.</strong> I&#8217;ve never done this before, but it seems like a good way to get a little hockey fix in the summertime.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Read five books.</strong>This is a fairly arbitrary number, but I haven&#8217;t been reading enough lately, and I think I can manage five books before Labor Day. (Currently, I&#8217;m thinking <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones" target="_blank"><em>A Game of Thrones</em></a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7968243-cleopatra" target="_blank"><em>Cleopatra: A Life</em></a>, <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks" target="_blank">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</a></em>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27002.First_Among_Sequels" target="_blank"><em>Thursday Next: First Among Sequels</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112075.The_Spring_of_the_Ram" target="_blank"><em>The Spring of the Ram</em></a>, but this could all change depending on what strikes my fancy.)</p>
<p>8. <strong>Buy a new grill.</strong> My grill died last spring, and I never got around to replacing it. I can&#8217;t really imagine another summer without one.</p>
<p>9.<strong> Start doing yoga again.</strong> I was a fairly devoted student of yoga for years, but stopped going to classes longer ago than I care to admit, and I&#8217;ve been missing it terribly. Time to get back to it.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Go to outdoor concerts.</strong> I already have tickets for a couple of shows (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire" target="_blank">Arcade Fire</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mumford%2520%2526%2520Sons" target="_blank">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>) but I&#8217;m hoping to add a few more to the list.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my list&#8230; What do you have planned for the summer?</p>

<p>A torn ticket stub. It&#8217;s yellow and has a tear down the middle, stopping short of the only black text on there which says &#8216;admit one&#8217;. At first glance, it seems indistinguishable from the rest of the seemingly random and yet useless paper products that seem to inhabit my room which have only been unearthed whilst packing. Old newspapers, always weekend editions, that were kept with the intention of one day being read in their entirety and not just the travel inserts. Receipts, quite often for values less than a pound, also seem to be a mainstay as they were never thrown away with the thinking that no doubt they will be integral to my future financial security, when I one day get round to sorting it. And of course, this torn ticket stub.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of my room or more specifically, my room whilst packing. I&#8217;m about to travel to the other side of the world to embark on an exciting, yet scary, new career as a Teacher of English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) in Cambodia. I leave in little under 3 weeks and have quite a lot to do. My room which I predicited would take a mere few hours to tidy and sort has, in fact, taken a few days, and I still do not have the end in sight. However, despite the stress involved it has, in many ways, been a major relief to start packing my room up for many reasons:</p>
<p>It means it&#8217;s all becoming real, that in a few weeks I will really will be on the most tremendous adventure of my life and every time I think about it a big bubble of excitement rises up my centre. Also, it is always good to have a big purge and there is a genuine cleansing feeling that comes with seeing the bin bags pile up. And let&#8217;s not forget that it is also comforting to be able to actually see my carpet and know that each time I go to bed, I&#8217;m not running a gauntlet that my life will be ended by tripping on a pair of two sizes too small ripped trousers and cracking my head on the wardrobe door that won&#8217;t close due to the overflow of the contents within. I can say this with all honesty, I am amazed that after all this time, I haven&#8217;t at the very least broken a bone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, packing my room is taking a lot longer than planned and it&#8217;s all due to that damned ticket stub. And the newspapers. And the receipts. I know I should just throw them away and be done, but it&#8217;s so hard. These are not just ticket stubs, newspapers and receipts. These are memories, and very fond ones at that.</p>
<p>This particular newspaper is from a few months ago when me and Chris spent a weekend in Betws-y-coed. It had rained so hard that the roads flooded, so there was little else to do but sit in a pub and read the paper. This may not have been the best trip we&#8217;ve ever been on, but to me it was great. We had good food and good beer, and best of all, we had each other.</p>
<p>One receipt is from Chester Zoo which we went to in April 2009. It was an amazing day, we laughed at the monkeys, cooed at the baby Elephant and acted like big kids on the swings. Perhaps a standard day for many people, but I will always think of it and smile.</p>
<p>And the torn ticket stub. Although it has very little information on the ticket, I knew immediately when and where it&#8217;s from. We had spent the day in Redcar, a lovely, but suffering from a sense of faded glory, seaside town in the North East. It was sunny, and the wind was strong which I think is a perfect combination for the coast. We played in the amusements and won a ball in the cup toy, we ate fish and chips from what is reputedly the oldest fish and chip shop in the world and finished this all off with lemon top ice-cream, which seems to be native to Redcar. Then we went to the cinema. And I don&#8217;t mean a 14-screen, run of the mill multiplex thing. I mean a cinema, a glorious art-deco cinema. It had one screen and showed 3 films a day at set times. It had only 2 members of staff working who were incredibly enthusiastic about film and cinema. We handed over our money and received in return two yellow tickets which was purposefully torn by the attendant. I pocketed the tickets and we made our way in. A fantastic end to a fantastic day.</p>
<p>The day in Redcar was amazing, but it was always marred by a strange sense of finality for me and Chris. We had gone at the end of April this year, my travel plans already well under way. We knew we had to make the most of it because all too soon, days like these would be over for us. And now in what seems to be within the blink of an eye, that time is upon us.</p>
<p>I had never planned on keeping the ticket stub or the newspapers or the receipts and had they have been previously thrown away without my knowledge, then I would probably not have missed them, but they weren&#8217;t. Now they&#8217;re still here, creating a dilemma for me. On the one hand, I need to clear and get rid of as much stuff as possible so that I can start my new life abroad, but on the other hand, if I am to throw these away i&#8217;m scared i&#8217;m throwing away a part, a very important part, of my life. Perhaps for now, i&#8217;ll leave them in the &#8216;to keep&#8217; pile and hope that one day I will sort through it.</p>
<p>And so, as an archeologist must sift through the sands of time to unearth the past, I must continue to pack my room. Maybe, just maybe, somewhere in the depths, in the stratum of mess that is my room, perhaps I will dig up more treasures like this torn ticket stub.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mad-men-cast.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-576" title="mad-men-cast" src="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mad-men-cast.jpg?w=604&#038;h=409" alt="" width="604" height="409" /></a></p>
<p>For a long time on the drama side on television it seemed as if it was network TV and then HBO.  There was no other cable channel to even put up a fight against the juggernaut that was the HBO machine.  Over time that has obviously changed.  HBO has struggled finding their identity in the drama department ever since &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; went off the air.  Honestly, one could argue &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; was all they had to offer dramatically towards the end of its run. If it wasn&#8217;t for &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; this past year HBO would legitimately have NOTHING to hang their hat on.  Considering the domination that HBO had over the cable world that is truly a shocking thing to come to grips with.</p>
<p>As HBO&#8217;s grasp on the field started to fade other networks stepped up for the right to be cable&#8217;s number one. A few years ago,  FX made a great showing with fantastic shows like &#8220;The Shield&#8221; and &#8220;Rescue Me&#8221;.  They added &#8220;Damages&#8221; and &#8220;Sons of Anarchy&#8221; and were looking really good. The thing is, even after putting on quality shows like that, they were never able to really grab the large audience that cable&#8217;s top dog should have. Then &#8220;The Shield&#8221; ended, &#8220;Damages&#8221; ratings sank (so they had to cancel it) and &#8220;Rescue Me&#8221; didn&#8217;t pack quite the same punch it did in the beginning. They never really could take the torch 100% and as a result their time in the sun started to disappear as well.  Actually, if it wasn&#8217;t for the AMAZING &#8220;Justified&#8221; their current drama situation would be in very bad shape as well.  They tried to get an audience this year with new shows like &#8220;Lights Out&#8221; and &#8220;Terriers&#8221; (both incredibly well done) but it just never did work out and they both joined the &#8220;one season and done&#8221; club.</p>
<p><span id="more-571"></span></p>
<p>Showtime threw its hat in the ring but they just never had the right show to build upon.  &#8220;Dexter&#8221; has been overall a huge success but it never really gave them that type of buzz and attention that they would need to officially steal the title away from HBO.  It must be said that Showtime has made its mark in comedy and no cable network has been able to keep up with their success in that area.  &#8220;Weeds&#8221;, &#8220;Californication&#8221;, &#8220;United States of Tara&#8221; and more recently &#8220;The Big C&#8221; and &#8220;Nurse Jackie&#8221; have all found a lot of success in the world of cable comedy. However when it comes to drama years of shows like &#8220;The Tutors&#8221;, the short-lived &#8220;Brotherhood&#8221; and &#8220;Dexter&#8221; (which many critics believe may have officially worn out its welcome) aren&#8217;t going to let them come close to the top spot in cable.</p>
<p><a href="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/110110_1841_breakingbad1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-577" title="110110_1841_BreakingBad1" src="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/110110_1841_breakingbad1.png?w=299&#038;h=392" alt="" width="299" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>It seemed like nobody wanted to be considered the best.  But then a little network called AMC,  mostly known for re-airing Citizen Kane and Gone With the Wind every Oscar season, put out a little show called &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; and everyone was put on notice.  Are these guys really trying out the original drama game?  How are they going to compete?  It seemed that AMC knew something we didn&#8217;t. The whole time the industry was predicting them to fail they must have said to themselves something like &#8220;how is everyone else going to compete with US&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s great is that AMC knows they are still new at this type of stuff.  They aren&#8217;t flooding the market with a new project every two months and trying to build up a cable empire as fast as they possibly can and therefore risk making big mistakes.  They are slowly picking very unique and specific projects and as a result kicking all their opponents in the gut with very a strong and powerful force each time. &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; bursts out on the scene and quickly gains a large audience and then grabs the Best Drama Emmy&#8230;three years in a row.  Then they rolled out  &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;, TV&#8217;s most intense and well-acted show, and have its star win the Best Actor in a Drama Emmy&#8230;three years in a row.  They then came out with Rubicon and that didn&#8217;t work out.  Nobody said that they would be perfect.  Every network will have its failures.  I am sure it would have been easy for everyone to think &#8220;OK so they had two big hits but that &#8220;Rubicon&#8221; tanked, maybe they aren&#8217;t so special.  Let&#8217;s see what happens next.&#8221;  Rather than playing it safe with some mediocre project they again swung for the fences and put out &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221;, arguably the most daring and innovative drama in  a long time.   Not only did critics love it but guess what?  The ratings were HUGE.  AMC was officially here to stay.  They survived a flop and released an even bigger hit (ratings wise) than their first two success stories.  The made the gap between them and second place even wider with the release of &#8220;The Killing&#8221; this past spring.  Another different type of show that showcases top-notch acting and griping storytelling.  Four solid-gold hits.</p>
<p><a href="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/the-walking-dead-rick-grimes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-578" title="the-walking-dead-rick-grimes" src="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/the-walking-dead-rick-grimes.jpg?w=604&#038;h=402" alt="" width="604" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>When every network in the world wants to put out yet another cop show or courtroom show AMC has taken chances on subjects that are diverse and stuff you can&#8217;t find anywhere else on TV.  A show about the advertising industry based in the 60&#8242;s? A show about a terminally ill chemistry teacher who cooks meth to make money for his family? A show about a small town sheriff holding together a group of survivors during a zombie apocalypse? All so different and all done so perfectly.  But Wait John!!! Isn&#8217;t that new show &#8220;The Killing&#8221; a cop show?  Seeeeeee&#8230;AMC is JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. Nice try but YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG.  &#8220;The Killing&#8221;, AMC&#8217;s first &#8220;cop&#8221; show, isn&#8217;t ANYTHING like the cop shows you see everywhere else.  Try this on for size- One murder case taking place over all 13 episodes with each episode representing one day of the investigation. As a result we get a glimpse into how this case is impacting all those around it from the victim&#8217;s family to a local politician running for mayor.  Doesn&#8217;t really sound like a &#8220;CSI&#8221; does it.</p>
<p>As it stands right now AMC just cannot do any wrong.  They are far and away the best cable network when it comes to drama and very well may be the absolute best on all of television.  All of their shows bring something different to the table and really know how to grab an audience.  If I could recommend one thing to the readers out there I would say do yourself a favor and get a hold of an AMC show, ANY AMC show, and watch it.  I promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<p><a href="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/amc-the-killing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-579" title="AMC-The-Killing" src="http://doyoulikeapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/amc-the-killing.jpg?w=560&#038;h=330" alt="" width="560" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Who knows how things will turn out down the line.  HBO has a second season of Boardwalk Empire coming, they have gotten a lot of attention for their adaptation of Game of Thrones and they have an interesting drama about the behind-the-scenes of a cable news show being written and produced by Aaron Sorkin (he of West Wing and Social Network fame) tentatively titles &#8220;More as the Story Develops&#8221;.  All I know is that if the past is any reflection on how they will do things AMC will not panic at what the competition is doing, they will simply build up the projects they feel strongly about very slowly and unleash them just when they feel the time is right.   They have come a long way from a network who used to show Casablanca every four months.</p>
<p>Oh by the way, later in 2011 AMC plans to premiere a show called &#8220;Hell on Wheels&#8221; which is described as a show about &#8221; a confederate soldier who seeks out the Union officers who killed his wife, traveling West in the aftermath of the Civil War. He finds himself living and working as part of the itinerant community building the first transcontinental railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know what kind of network can pull off doing a show like that?  ONLY THE BEST.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I&#8217;m a primarily a wedding a real estate/architectural photographer, my photographic background is in travel photography, specifically landscapes and portraits. I love to travel, and I love meeting people everywhere I go. I try to learn a little about each person I photograph; spending some time with them relaxes them before I ask if I can take their photo, and it also gives me a little insight into who they are and what their life is like.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to post a travel portrait each day. These are not shots I&#8217;ve taken in the last few days &#8211; some are from 2010 and the rest from early 2011. I&#8217;m going to India in November to photograph a wedding so I&#8217;ll no doubt come back with lots of new portraits from that trip too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s number 1 &#8211; an amazing Sadhu I photographed in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2010.  This is probably my favourite photo out of all that I&#8217;ve ever taken.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jet lag is a funny thing. Right now it actually seems to be working in my favour; it&#8217;s managed to knock a couple of bad habits out of me. Specifically, these happen to be the not entirely unrelated habits of going to bed too late (then making it later by reading for a good long while) and getting up too late. Right now I seem to be fighting to keep my eyes open by around nine, and then being wide awake by seven. Which is more or less the position I found myself in on Sunday. Since day one at Google camp was a couple of days away I thought I&#8217;d check out my immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>This may come as a bit of a surprise to you, but there isn&#8217;t actually a lot to do in Mountain View. One of the things there is to do, however, is the computer history museum, which I&#8217;d been told is exactly as awesome as it sounds. In case my meaning isn&#8217;t clear: really awesome. There is no sarcasm here. Look at my face. Awesome. This is not my sarcastic face. Awesome. Face. Awesome.</p>
<p>I have a rental car, but the brakes scare the shit out of me, and the place didn&#8217;t look too far away, so I decided to walk. Now, I&#8217;d been warned that no one walks in America, but I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for it to be true. I must have walked 5 miles on Sunday and saw a grand total of perhaps 3 other pedestrians, and found that drivers looked at me as though I was a crazy person. I think perhaps one reason for this might be that the pavements (or sidewalks, if you like) are&#8230; well&#8230; shit. Anytime you have a height difference of more than an inch between two slabs&#8230; that&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>Slightly thankful that there were no other pedestrians to see me trip, I arrived at the building in question. Externally, it&#8217;s kind of neat. You might mistake it for the headquarters of some hip new tech startup. If it wasn&#8217;t for the big sign saying &#8220;Computer history Museum&#8221; outside, obviously. Inside, though, it reminded me quite of bit of the Science Museum (&#8220;which science museum?&#8221; &#8220;The Science Museum&#8221;). It&#8217;s nowhere near as grandiose, and has a much narrower focus, but the comparison feels apt.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/e01ff01b-d1b9-454d-afd7-cbc96bdfc9ed6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/e01ff01b-d1b9-454d-afd7-cbc96bdfc9ed6.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>The scope of the exhibits is quite impressive, starting with slide rules and abaci, moving though Babbage (oh, I&#8217;ll come back to Babbage), on to Turing and right up to the present day. Here are a couple of examples of things which made me smile:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ab03b781-9c94-46de-851f-711679d9a0e90.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ab03b781-9c94-46de-851f-711679d9a0e90.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>The Altair 8800, quite an important machine in the history of Microsoft, of which the fictionalised version of Steve Jobs in Pirates of Silicon Valley says &#8220;I never had any problem with the Altair&#8230; until I tried to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/b17fcbeb-6b46-46e5-93f7-91c5995b999d1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/b17fcbeb-6b46-46e5-93f7-91c5995b999d1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>You know what&#8217;s better than that, though? A computer made out of wood. If you bought an Apple I you received a box of parts and some schematics. You hade to supply the case yourself. You know what else is awesome? UNIX is awesome:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/11d69f5d-3b06-4df6-bc7a-0b85aaf6ca362.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/11d69f5d-3b06-4df6-bc7a-0b85aaf6ca362.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>You see? There&#8217;s a badge and everything. What says awesome more than a badge? Oh wait, I know:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/7a115add-1257-44eb-9fa7-6dc114378d8f3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/7a115add-1257-44eb-9fa7-6dc114378d8f3.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>Oh yeah. That&#8217;s right. I bet you wish you were cool enough to have that licence plate. As a side note: I wonder if anyone does have that licence plate, since I assume this one isn&#8217;t real. Furthermore: what kind of car would you put that on? This is fodder for <em>Pimp My Ride</em> right here. They should get on that (&#8220;Yo, we heard you like UNIX&#8230;&#8221;).</p>
<p>There was a lot more at the museum. Too much, in fact. I arrived about an hour after it opened and literally left as they locked the door behind me. I probably skipped about half of the section on the internet, and only had time for a brief look at the exhibit on the history of computer chess. Did I mention that they have half of Deep Blue? They also have something else very, very cool, and that&#8217;s one of the two Babbage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engines</a> which we only very recently developed the capability to actually build:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/a677c6d3-c432-4285-9d81-1085791eeed14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/a677c6d3-c432-4285-9d81-1085791eeed14.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>You really can&#8217;t do justice to this thing in a photograph. It&#8217;s beautiful. A marvel of engineering, it actually works exactly as Babbage said it would, and he built it entirely on paper. In 1849. Somebody should build an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine">Analytical Engine</a>. that, my friends, would truly be something.</p>
<p>One last thing:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/c4843570-b8d8-4251-bf11-2e49bc097e955.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="http://harveynick.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/c4843570-b8d8-4251-bf11-2e49bc097e955.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></a>I think this might be THE teapot.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Update: <a href="http://www.plan28.org/">Someone</a> is building one!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perfect timing, considering I had just picked up a 2x extender from a buddy that weekend! One thing I didn&#8217;t realize about the 2x is that I now had to manually focus the lens &#8211; Something I hadn&#8217;t done in quite a while, so that was fun to reconnect with. </p>
<p>It was a pleasant, but overcast Sunday afternoon. As clouds brewed ominously in the distance, I hopped into my &#8217;98 Volvo wagon, hoping to capture some nice action shots. I made my way up to the north beach, parked, and began to walk along the wooden plank path towards the water. As I reached the crest, I looked out on the water only to find a sea full of disappointment and frustration. &#8220;Are these guys really surfing this today? Alright&#8230; Whatever&#8221;, and I proceeded. I see three of my friends, and one man who was unfamiliar (who I was later introduced to &#8211; Austin, of the <a href="http://www.austinsurfboards.com" title="Austin Surf Company" target="_blank">Austin Surf Company</a> based right out of VB) out on the choppy, and inconsistent tide, trying here and there to catch something decent. One by one, they all trickled onto the shore reflecting on the seemingly disappointing surf session. The morale is never all that low, however, and entertaining conversations were soon to follow. Overall, I&#8217;m not too upset with the time I spent out there, but hopefully I can catch some good, clean surf in the near future. Until then &#8211; Leave love/leave hate.</p>
