				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I want to belong,&#8221; pleads a woman whose face is swathed in bandages. &#8220;I want to be like everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly all of us do at one time or other. The desire to fit in can exert a seemingly irresistible force. &#8220;Conform or be cast out,&#8221; Geddy Lee sings in the Rush song &#8221;Subdivisions.&#8221; The question is, how far will we go to do so? What will it cost us? And what happens if we fail?</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, who sets the standard?</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hand-gesture1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-662" title="Hand Gesture1" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hand-gesture1.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Enter Rod Serling, and an episode of <em>The Twilight Zone </em>called &#8221;The Eye of the Beholder.&#8221; His 25-minute tour of a world where ugliness is a crime presents us with a terrifying specter: a society where peer pressure has been given the force of law, and conventional notions of beauty are turned on their head.<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<p>The story, in capsule form (here&#8217;s the last exit for those who have never seen the episode): Janet Tyler is in the hospital, her head encased in bandages, awaiting the results of a procedure intended to make her beautiful. But this is no elective plastic surgery. It&#8217;s a major operation mandated by law to help people deemed ugly blend in with society. When the bandages come off, the doctor and nurses recoil in horror from her &#8230; very attractive face.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ms-tyler-post-bandage1b.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-663" title="Ms. Tyler Post Bandage1b" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ms-tyler-post-bandage1b.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Only then do we see <em>their</em> faces, with distorted cheeks, twisted lips and pig-like noses.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/eye-of-the-beholder1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-674" title="Eye of the Beholder" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/eye-of-the-beholder1.png?w=1024&#038;h=170" height="170" width="1024" /></a><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/eye-of-the-beholder.png"></a></p>
<p>The operation a &#8220;failure&#8221;, Miss Tyler tries to flee, but is soon escorted away by a handsome man named Walter Smith to a colony of others with a similar &#8221;condition.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/walking-down-corridor2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-664" title="Walking Down Corridor2" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/walking-down-corridor2.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Serling&#8217;s closing narration begins as they walk away:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now the questions that come to mind. Where is this place and when is it, what kind of world where ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation from that norm? The answer is, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference. Because the old saying happens to be true. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in this year or a hundred years hence, on this planet or wherever there is human life, perhaps out among the stars. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Lesson to be learned &#8230; in the Twilight Zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The famous unveiling scene is the episode&#8217;s centerpiece, but it&#8217;s remarkable how powerful the rest of the episode is, from first frame to last. I consider it the series&#8217; finest, in fact. Everything clicks: the direction by TZ veteran Douglas Heyes; the acting by Maxine Stuart (Janet Tyler under the bandages), Donna Douglas (Tyler unwrapped), William D. Gordon (Dr. Bernardi) and others; the black-and-white photography by George Clemens; the soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann; the make-up by William Tuttle &#8230; and, of course, a script by Rod Serling that is both a pointed critique of a totalitarian society and a sensitive portrayal of a lonely woman.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ms-tyler1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666" title="Ms. Tyler" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ms-tyler1.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ms-tyler.png"></a></p>
<p>All of these elements come together beautifully in the show&#8217;s opening scenes, which &#8212; considering they involve conversations between people whose faces are entirely obscured &#8212; are remarkably compelling. Maxine Stuart is such a wonderfully expressive actress that although we have nothing but her voice and gestures to go by, we can&#8217;t help feeling touched by her plight, which Serling so poignantly describes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s pretty bad, isn&#8217;t it? I know it&#8217;s pretty bad. Ever since I can remember, ever since I was a little girl, people have turned away from me. The very first thing I can remember is a little child screaming when she looked at me.</p>
<p>I never wanted to be beautiful. I never wanted to look like a painting. I never even wanted to be loved. I just wanted people not to scream when they looked at me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lines like this also condition viewers to expect horrendous ugliness at the final unveiling. Serling could be very efficient with his writing; he keeps stressing her humanity, even as he sets us up for that scene. One nurse remarks that if she had a face like Miss Tyler&#8217;s, &#8220;I&#8217;d bury myself in a grave somewhere.&#8221; And when Dr. Bernardi is trying to express his frustration over her case, he says: &#8220;I&#8217;ve looked underneath those bandages &#8230; Deeper than that pitiful, twisted lump of flesh. Deeper even than that misshapen skeletal mass. I&#8217;ve seen that woman&#8217;s real face, Nurse. The face of her real self. It&#8217;s a good face. It&#8217;s a human face.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/removing-bandages5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-671" title="Removing Bandages5" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/removing-bandages5.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>A face that belongs to a woman who just wants to smell the flowers and feel the night air. We naturally feel incensed that this gentle soul is condemned by a society determined to change her, exile her, or kill her. &#8220;Under certain circumstances, Miss Tyler, the state does provide for the extermination of undesirables,&#8221; Dr. Bernardi says in one of the most chilling lines of the entire episode.</p>
<p>But this is unlikely, he says: &#8220;One of the alternatives &#8230; is simply to allow you to move into a special area in which people of your kind have been congregated.&#8221; Miss Tyler explodes: &#8220;People of my kind? Congregated? You mean segregated! You mean imprisoned, don&#8217;t you, Doctor? You&#8217;re talking about a ghetto, aren&#8217;t you? A ghetto designed for freaks!&#8221; Coming only a decade and a half after the end of World War II, this line is clearly designed to evoke the horror of the Nazi reign of terror.</p>
<p>Douglas Heyes cleverly hides the faces of the doctor and nurses through adroit camera moves and heavily shadowed sets. We know <em>something</em> is up, yes, but what?</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/group3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-667" title="Group3" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/group3.png?w=300&#038;h=227" height="227" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Heyes also heightens the surprise of the unveiling through a simple audio trick: He deliberately cast actors with very sympathetic voices as the doctor and nurses. He also selected Maxine Stuart in part because her somewhat harsh voice suggested someone who <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> beautiful. And he cast Donna Douglas (later to play Elly May on <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em>, as well as guest star on an episode of<em> Night Gallery</em>) as the unbandaged Miss Tyler, who tries to escape after Dr. Bernardi cries out: &#8221;No change!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-and-girl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-668" title="Screen and Girl" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-and-girl.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>As she races frantically down the hallways of the hospital, the full horror of the situation stands revealed. Omnipresent TV screens (a premonition of today?) bring us the latest speech by &#8220;Our Leader,&#8221; an impassioned orator who harangues Miss Tyler at every turn:</p>
<blockquote><p>I say to you now that there is no such thing as a permissive society, because such a society cannot exist! They will scream at you and rant and rave and conjure up some dead and decadent picture of an ancient time when they said that all men are created equal! But to them equality was an equality of opportunity, an equality of status, an equality of aspiration!</p>
<p>And then, in what must surely be the pinnacle of insanity, the absolute in inconsistency, they would have had us believe that this equality did not apply to form, to creed. They permitted a polyglot, accident-bred, mongrel-like mass of diversification to blanket the earth, to infiltrate and weaken!</p>
<p>Well, we know now that there must be a single purpose! A single norm! A single approach! A single entity of peoples! A single virtue! A single morality! A single frame of reference! A single philosophy of government! We cannot permit&#8230; we must not permit the encroaching sentimentality of a past age to weaken our resolve. We must cut out all that is different like a cancerous growth!</p>
<p>It is essential in this society that we not only have a norm, but that we conform to that norm. Differences weaken us. Variations destroy us. An incredible permissiveness to deviation from this norm is what has ended nations and brought them to their knees. Conformity we must worship and hold sacred. Conformity is the key to survival.</p></blockquote>
<p>Survival? Perhaps. But to what purpose? To live a life in which you are merely an interchangeable cog in a vast wheel that allegedly represents progress? To be nothing more than an unhappy piece of someone else&#8217;s puzzle? To sacrifice everything that makes you different in order to please a society that views you as nothing but a faceless building block &#8212; one that will think nothing of discarding you if you stand out? That will change you, shun you or murder you for the unspeakable crime of being different?</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doctor-and-ms-tyler.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-669" title="Doctor and Ms. Tyler" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/doctor-and-ms-tyler.png?w=300&#038;h=227" height="227" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>As Miss Tyler so aptly tells the doctor:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who are you people anyway? What is this State? Who makes all these rules and conditions and statutes that people who are different have to stay away from the people who are normal? The State isn&#8217;t God, Doctor. The State is not God! It hasn&#8217;t the right to penalize somebody for an accident of birth! It hasn&#8217;t the right to make ugliness a crime!</p></blockquote>
<p>When Mr. Smith leads Miss Tyler away, he reminds her of the classic saying on which the episode&#8217;s title is based, and adds: “When we leave here, when we go to the village, try to think of that, Miss Tyler. Say it over and over to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hand-gesture6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670" title="Hand Gesture6" alt="" src="http://thenightgallery.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hand-gesture6.png?w=300&#038;h=226" height="226" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all Miss Tyler can do, really. But here&#8217;s a suggestion for those of us who want to avoid living in such a dystopian society: Never forget that “the State is not God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, say it over and over to yourself. If we keep that thought alive, it might help us avoid one of the darker corners &#8230; of the Twilight Zone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_725" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 261px"><a href="http://pryorfrancis.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ff-spoil-heap.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-725 " title="Flag Fen spoil heap" alt="Flag Fen spoil heap" src="http://pryorfrancis.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ff-spoil-heap.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flag Fen the day following its discovery in November 1982. Here David Gurney (now County Archaeologist of Norfolk) stands behind the spoil-heap left by the Anglian Water Board excavator that had just cleaned-out the dyke. At the top of the dykeside you can just make-out an orange layer, which was the make-up of a Roman Road (the Fen Causeway), built in AD 60. Maisie Taylor’s lower foot rests at the base of the Bronze Age buried soil, her left foot is at the base of the Bronze Age timber layer (still not yet visible in this picture). The water in the bottom of the dyke is at about half a metre below Sea Level (and we are 35 miles inland).</p></div>
<p>We discovered the extraordinary Bronze Age site at <a title="Flag Fen" href="http://www.vivacity-peterborough.com/museums-and-heritage/flag-fen/" target="_blank">Flag Fen</a>, Peterborough, exactly 30 years ago. To be honest I’m not certain of the precise date, but I think it was around the 3<sup>rd</sup>, or 4<sup>th</sup> of November, 1982. I’ve described that moment several times and I won’t repeat myself here, but you can read it in the <a title="Archaeoguide at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008MINTUU/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bagotblog-21" target="_blank">ebook</a> and in <a title="Flag Fen at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0752429000/ref=nosim?tag=bagotblog-21" target="_blank"><i>Flag Fen: Life and Death of a Prehistoric Landscape</i></a>. But the point I want to make here, is that its discovery wasn’t an accident. It was part of a detailed survey of recently cleaned-out Fenland drainage dykes, which at the time (and with admirable originality) we called the Dyke Survey. That survey has been comprehensively written up by Charles French<b><sup>[</sup></b><strong><sup>1</sup><sup>]</sup></strong>; I had the idea of the survey and wrote a bit of the report, which is why my name (perhaps rather cheekily, in hindsight) appears on the title page. Incidentally, I’ve just heard that Charly has recently been honoured with the award of a <a title="Charles French at Cambridge University" href="http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~caif2/" target="_blank">Professorship at Cambridge</a>. WELL DONE PROF CHARLY!!!</p>
<p>I had the idea of doing a dyke survey after I’d taken our team to Holland, where we collaborated in a big excavation at Assendelft<sup>[<span style="color:#000000;"><b>2</b></span>]</sup>, an early Iron Age project organized by the <a title="University of Amsterdam" href="http://www.uva.nl/en" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. To this day, I don’t know how I persuaded <a title="English Heritage" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/" target="_blank">English Heritage</a>to let me take the team abroad, but they did – and we had a wonderful time – and discovered Grolsch beer (which tasted very much better than the modern stuff with the same label, which is brewed in England). While we were at Amsterdam we were taught about Dutch-style dyke survey, which involved picking up artefacts along the edges of flooded dykes. They keep their fenlands very much wetter than we do. Anyhow, the principle was the same: to discover sites that are still buried and wet.</p>
<div id="attachment_726" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://pryorfrancis.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ff-ditches.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-726" title="Flag Fen boundary ditches" alt="Flag Fen boundary ditches" src="http://pryorfrancis.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ff-ditches.jpg?w=300&#038;h=197" height="197" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bronze Age field boundary ditches, as excavated at Fengate in the summer of 1976. On the horizon are the chimneys of the Whittlesey brickworks. There’s a long hedge in the middle distance, in 1989 we discovered that this runs very approximately parallel to the Bronze Age post alignment, about a metre below it. The flag fen platform is less than half a mile from the excavations, in the direction of Whittlesey.</p></div>
<p>So we returned home and the following year started the dyke survey, in July, I think it was. Over the summer we made some remarkable finds, often of really old, Neolithic and Mesolithic sites, along the edges of buried ‘islands’. Then, in the autumn, we found Flag Fen and life, for me at least, hasn’t been the same since.</p>
<p>The 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Flag Fen was celebrated yesterday on Radio 4’s excellent <a title="Making History" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ntfvz" target="_blank">Making History</a> series, which also celebrates its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary this month. At the end of a <a title="Making History podcast download" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/mhistory" target="_blank">very good programme</a> the two guest speakers, both distinguished academics made rather disparaging remarks about the Flag Fen <a title="DigVentures" href="http://digventures.com/" target="_blank">crowd-funded excavations</a>. I have to say, I thought their remarks verged on the haughty. Yes, we’d all love to open our excavations to everyone, and for free. Indeed, if I was receiving a large university grant, that’s precisely what I’d do. But the fact is, over the past thirty years, Flag Fen has received more than a million pounds of public money and I personally think there comes a time when one has to call a halt. After all, there are other worthy projects in England, that urgently need excavation and research. That’s one of the reasons it was decided to go down the crowd-funded route: as an experiment. And, happily, it was an experiment that worked: the participants had a good time, and the archaeology was professionally excavated, to a very high standard. The same will go for the report. So yes, it was funded by subscription, but the charges were very low and it’s far more important that somebody does something soon, because the site is rapidly drying-out and most of it won’t be there in thirty years’ time.</p>
<p>So get real, you academics. Climb out of your ivory towers and take a closer look at the modern world: you’ll discover it’s not all gloom and doom. There are a lot of good things going on out there, and (dare I say it?!) they’re not all as elitist as you…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They met at a party circa 1960, she a shy country girl in her first year of nursing school in the big city, he a college boy who had lived nearly all his life in that city. Her nervous giggle that was immediately followed by an apologetic &#8220;oh shoot&#8221; captured his attention. He was charming and handsome. She was sweet and pretty. Neither of them had ever seriously dated anyone else and once they met, they never would.</p>
<p>He was the eldest son of a Norwegian ship&#8217;s officer and a school teacher. She was the eldest daughter of a farmer and a homemaker. She was staunchly Catholic. He was uncommitted. She had decided to become a nurse so she would at least have a career because she was certain she would never marry. But then one night she had a dream, and a voice told her, &#8220;you will marry a man named Joseph.&#8221; This handsome young man at the party who gave her and all her friends a ride back to their dormitory in his mother&#8217;s station wagon was not named Joseph. But two years later, when he converted to Catholicism so they could be married in her church, he chose Joseph as his baptismal name. She didn&#8217;t learn this until after they were wed. Not that it matters what his (or her) given name is; they have called each other by several endearing pet names almost from the very start, and refer to each other by their actual names only when talking to strangers.</p>
<p>They married in a cathedral, drove away on their honeymoon in the little blue Chevy Nova her parents gave them as a wedding present, and began their life together, both barely out of their teens and green as grass. They lived in that same big city for a short time, long enough for the first baby to be born, a tow-headed, busy boy who loved to get into mischief. They moved to another state so he could go to graduate school in preparation to become a teacher. Along came the second baby, a tow-headed girl who quietly followed her big brother everywhere he went. Graduate school would have to wait; with two babies to feed, it was time to go to work. They moved again to a small town far from both their families, bought a big old house, and set to work raising their own little family. He taught chemistry at the local college. She took care of home and kids. Eventually the third baby came along, a charming little redheaded girl, and the family was complete.</p>
<p>The social turbulence of the &#8217;60s, the hedonism of the &#8217;70s, and the conspicuous consumption of the &#8217;80s passed them by completely as they focused on work, church, home, family, friends, and building a solid, quiet life together. He returned to graduate school on summer breaks and one sabbatical to complete a master&#8217;s and a Ph.D., and his career at the college progressed right on track. She worked briefly as a nurse, but soon turned her full attention to raising her kids (for which she found that a nursing career was excellent preparation). She kept busy, too, with all kinds of art classes, moving from ceramic painting to tole painting to oil painting to watercolors while pausing along the way to learn belly dancing, macramé and acoustic guitar. She always had an art project going. She sewed her kids&#8217; clothes, cut their hair in the kitchen, and baked them healthy cookies with carob chips and sunflower seeds that they failed utterly to appreciate.</p>
<p>Their kids grew up, not without many bumps and tears, all attending the same schools, for the most part, and always coming home to that same big old house and those same two parents. A home-cooked supper was served at 6 or 6:30 every night almost without exception, everyone at the table with their hands washed, say grace, converse politely, ask to be excused. Not a lot of extra during those years, but always enough of everything that was needed&#8211;food, clothing, school supplies, health care, discipline, support, love. They modeled stability, fidelity and integrity in everything they did.</p>
<p>The Nova eventually was gifted to the oldest son and a used Volvo took its place, which went with the eldest daughter to college, then another used Volvo that went with the youngest daughter to college, which is when they finally bought their first new car together after 30 years of marriage. There were health scares for both of them over the years, some very serious indeed. They pulled together and got through, stronger than before. Friends came and went as the couples they knew divorced or moved away and others took their place. They paid off the mortgage on that big old house the old-fashioned way: one month at a time for 30 years. He tried again and again to retire from teaching, always managing somehow to get called back for one more semester. The kids graduated college and moved away. They said goodbye to their parents, one by one&#8211;first her dad, then his dad, then his mom, then her mom. They welcomed grandchildren. They got their first dog, which was the light of their lives for many years. They have another dog now, which they say is really their favorite child.</p>
<p>And today, my parents celebrate 50 years of this love, this marriage, this family, this golden circle of commitment to each other and to their life together. They still enjoy each other&#8217;s company, still laugh together, still hold hands when they walk together, still approach life as a team and always have each other&#8217;s back. Where you find one, you will always find the other nearby.</p>
<p>From the time I was very young, I always thought/hoped/dreamed/assumed that this was how it went when people grew up: I would meet someone and fall in love, and that first love would be my only love all my life. The relationship would progress smoothly from meeting to dating to engagement to marriage and last until death. It was the natural order. That was how it was going to be for me, too, I was sure of it. (Of course it wasn&#8217;t.) I have always envied my parents for never having suffered a broken heart from being left by a lover. They both have always said that they never doubted, from their very first date, that they were meant to be together all their lives. And every day since, they have made the choices and kept the promises and done the work to make that possible. In my eyes, there is no greater achievement.</p>

My eyes are green like his and turn into crescents when I smile, like hers.</p></div>
<p>I have only one friend whose parents have been married 50 years. My parents know at least four couples who have been, one of which is closing in on 70 years together. I don&#8217;t know what the latest statistics are, but a quick internet search suggests that about 5% of all married couples can expect to celebrate their Golden Anniversary. One in 20. Those are long odds simply to stay with one person that long, let alone to stay happy with one person for that long.</p>
<p>Happy anniversary, mom and dad. Thanks for everything you have given us, particularly your example of how to be happily married. I love you both.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well known and cherished couplings that seem to last the test of time: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, bacon and eggs, snow on Christmas morning, Willie Nelson and country music, and so on.</p>
<p>Older and wiser? Not so much.</p>
<p>The world presents us with enough evidence to confirm that few of us, very few, become wiser as we age. If I wanted to use data here, I’d make a case that at least 96% of the older among us are clearly not wiser.</p>
<p>I bet you that nearly every one of us older folks have said things like, “I’m sure glad I know what I know now.” And then we proceed to do the most foolish and hapless things—as though we’re suffering from amnesia and cannot rely on the memory of our youthful indiscretions to guide our behavior. It’s not as though examples of older NOT wiser behavior hide from view. The media, after all, thrives on them; frequent and blatant examples of careless acts are the Vitamin D of network news.</p>
<p>Something false resonates in Sinatra’s words, “Regrets, I’ve had a few. But I did it my way.” Because “my way” frequently includes a trip to the emergency room, unemployment, bankruptcy, jail time, divorce, or adulterous liaisons. Frankly, “my way” doesn’t exist. There is no “my way” when it comes to foolish behavior, rash encounters, and general imprudence. Because, in fact, <i>my way</i> too often resembles the way of so many older and NOT wiser characters. The <i>my way</i> is a road paved with embarrassing and painful examples of reckless behavior. We have plenty of examples around us—we have a veritable GPS of examples, yet we don’t use it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1609" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/berlusconi1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1609" title="berlusconi1" alt="" src="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/berlusconi1.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Incapable of older and wiser</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1610" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/5weiner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1610" title="*Apr 14 - 00:05*" alt="" src="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/5weiner.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Older, NOT Wiser, and a Name to Go With It</p></div>
<p>A bit of anecdotal evidence: My father, who used to be a dentist before he retired, now behaves as though an all chocolate diet is healthy. My mother, who used to be a nurse, supports this practice. Older, not wiser.</p>
<p>Do this quick exercise: Make a list of all the older and wiser things you’ve done. Next to it, make a list of all the older and NOT wiser things you’ve done. Which list is longer?</p>
<div id="attachment_1611" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photocopied-butt1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1611" title="photocopied-butt1" alt="" src="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photocopied-butt1.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The photocopy will live on</p></div>
<p>Of course, that probably wouldn’t be an accurate test because, remarkably, our memories don’t hold onto all of the unwise, irrational, thoughtless and reckless things we’ve done in our older years. Mercifully so.</p>
<p>In my case, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve done something older and wiser. For example, I got rid of my snowboard last month because the image of damaging my veneers and breaking a hip had come into clearer focus as time went by. Perhaps we all need to play a video in our heads of the most likely outcome of our idiotic behavior—in full color with Surround Sound. Bring popcorn and a large soda.</p>
<div id="attachment_1612" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/snowboard_crash.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1612" title="snowboard_crash" alt="" src="http://snoringdogstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/snowboard_crash.png?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grays on Trays: Recipe for Disaster</p></div>
<p>A lot of us are expressing shock and awe over the Petraeus love quadrangle. Our reaction tells others that we believe the older, more celebrated, and most powerful among us are immune to poor judgment in some areas of their lives. Why should they be?</p>
<p><b>What does this all mean?</b></p>
<p>1. Perhaps we should be less hasty in condemning others for stupid behavior.</p>
<p>2. It would behoove us to use the examples of the older and NOT wiser to guide our behavior. Oddly, we rarely do.</p>
<p>3. Most of us seem to love a gloriously colossal fall from grace. What does that say about us?</p>
<p>4. Humans appear to be just as reflexive in the presence of temptation as a hungry mutt. Perhaps we’re all doomed to repeat mistakes and do stupid things.</p>
<p>5. Don’t wait for the news to print evidence of your less wise moments to become older and wiser.</p>
<p>Honestly, we will NEVER learn. Stop scolding the younger generation for being irresponsible, rash and immature. Instead, repeat and repeat often, “Do as I say, not as I do.”<br />

In fact, all tour companies and many of the hotels are run by the government.</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is such a thing as a stupid request.</p>
<p>I was casually dating a guy. He was the sort of guy that was nice enough, but not really my type overall as I was quickly realizing. You know the guys that it would be better to have just been friends as opposed to date? He fell into that category&#8230;hence the &#8220;casually dating&#8221;. I was planning on ending it myself, but I knew he was really stressed with work (so I was barely seeing him anyway) so I figured I&#8217;d wait at least a little bit to not add to the stress.</p>
<p>One day, he came over to my house for dinner. I had just made an amazing lasagna with wild mushrooms from my local <a href="http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/event_landing/events/mose/wicker_park___bucktown.html">farmer&#8217;s market</a>. I couldn&#8217;t wait to eat it.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize there was going to be a slight delay.</p>
<p>He walked in, sat down on my couch, and said &#8220;I think we need to take a break.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not a believer in breaks, plus I really wasn&#8217;t sure what that meant when two people are casually dating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think we need to break up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I was quite confused. How do you break up with someone who you weren&#8217;t even officially dating in the first place? I personally had planned on using the line of &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we should see each other any more,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>And then, the piece de resistance&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Is there any way I can take home a piece of lasagna?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>As you can probably guess, I ordered him to get out of my house. Without food.</p>
<p>P.S. My coworkers came over the next day for dinner, since, after all, I had a huge delicious lasagna to eat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>No Doggie Bags Wild Mushroom Lasagna</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://domesticdivamd.com/?attachment_id=486#main"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-486" title="wild mushroom lasagna" alt="" src="http://domesticdivamd.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/019.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300" height="300" width="400" /></a>if he was smart, he would have waited until after dinner</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>2 lb wild mushrooms (if you can&#8217;t find wild mushrooms, use cremini or portobello)</li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 tsp worchestershire sauce</li>
<li>8 oz fat-free cottage cheese</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 stick butter</li>
<li>1/2 c flour</li>
<li>4 c skim milk</li>
<li>3 tablespoons garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 + 1/4 c parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 lb whole-wheat lasagna noodles</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Cooking spray</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>How-to</p>
<ol>
<li>In a large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Remove stems from mushrooms and slice thinly. Add to olive oil, along with worchestershire sauce. Cook for approximately 5 minutes or until mushrooms become soft and start to release liquid. Put mushrooms in a bowl to let cool.</li>
<li>When mushrooms are cool, add fat-free cottage cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Add egg and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>In a large pot, melt butter over low heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Switch to a whisk. Whisk in milk slowly so it is incorporated. Add garlic. Increase heat to medium-low and cook for 5-10 minutes (the whisk is best at first and then you can switch back to a spoon) until the mixture becomes thick and coats the back of the spoon (you know the trick where you run your finger down the middle of the spoon and the sauce stays on either side? that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for).</li>
<li>To sauce, add nutmeg and 1/2 c parmesan cheese. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>In another large pot, bring a large quantity of heavily salted (I&#8217;m talking a near handful here!) water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles to 1 minute less than package directions (you want it just shy of al dente). Drain and add a little bit of olive oil so they don&#8217;t stick.</li>
<li>Finally, lasagna prep time! Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
<li>Coat a lasagna pan (or 9&#215;13 in baking dish) with cooking spray. Add a small amount of the cream sauce and spread a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of lasagna noodles. Add in 1/2 of the mushroom mixture, then 1/3 of the cream sauce.</li>
<li>Repeat with another layer of the lasagna noodles, the rest of the mushroom mixture, and another 1/3 of the sauce.</li>
<li>Top with a final layer of lasagna noodles and the rest of the cream sauce. Sprinkle on 1/4 c parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>Bake for 45-50 minutes or until top is brown and bubbly. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know the recipe looks rather complicated, but it comes together fairly quickly! Saute the mushrooms first, then make the sauce and boil the noodles at the same time. My coworker, good friend, and fellow blogger <a href="http://undercovercarrots.blogspot.com/">Colleen </a>can promise it&#8217;s delicious!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels good to return to the blog after several weeks of hiatus.  Six  performances in three weeks has a way of eating up my time!  As the holidays approach, I look forward to having a bit more time to read and also study music.  Not surprisingly, I find the two pursuits quite similar.</p>
<p>The concept of reading music is well-established.  We learn to <i>read</i> music.  We <i>read</i> through a piece.  <i>Sight-reading</i> is a valuable skill for musicians.  Reviewers praise a particular conductor or soloist’s <i>reading </i>of the score.  All very well, but how often do we actually <i>read </i>the music; not merely learning notes with an instrument at hand, but actual <i>READING</i>?</p>
<p>I encourage all musicians to spend some time with printed music away from an instrument, away from the nuts and bolts of sounding everything out (and analyzing the music to death as a starting point). There is certainly a time and place for this, but the life of the music must also be discovered, nurtured and remembered.</p>
<p>These days we usually first get excited about a piece of music by listening to it.  Too often we jump immediately into<i> learning</i> it.  We pick up our instrument and dive in.  The problem is that, without <i>mind time</i>, we can quickly lose the enthusiasm that that initial hearing by trying to reproduce it.  We need to look at the music through the eyes of both our intellect and imagination.</p>
<p>For me, the act of reading a score involves these two types of brain activity.   I endeavor to read the same score both ways to achieve the desired result.  Here’s the idea:</p>
<p><strong>Reading music as non-fiction:</strong> This is looking at the craft of a composition: harmony, melody, phrase structure, form, rhythm.  All can be seen on the surface and then more can be discovered as we dig deeper.  This type of reading is like reading a technical how-to manual or a historical description of battles and political events. You see how something works, how it functions and how is fits in with the style.</p>
<p><strong>Reading music as fiction: </strong> While we must do the above to understand a piece and present it to an audience, this “fiction” approach is by far my favorite.  This is where the imagination soars, where I identify with the composer and define myself through the music.  A musical score can be read as a novel, in time.  The unfolding of events, all described by the non-fiction approach, become a vibrant, emotional story.  The soul of the music is revealed.</p>
<p>Great music is like great literature or poetry.  The deeper you dig, the more you discover about the BIG PICTURE.  I consider this an important aspect of <i>learning</i> music.  After these readings I will begin to mark my music and practice the tricky passages.   When I get discouraged, or when the music loses immediacy, I simply curl up with the score and begin again.  Like a great poem, I am always invited back inside.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Here's one I've had on the back burner for while. It finally came together after I'd seen the film <a title="Miss Representation" href="http://www.missrepresentation.org/the-film/" target="_blank">"Miss Representation"</a>.]</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come a long way, baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember that one? By 1968 women had come so far that Madison Avenue designed a cigarette just for us. Since then, they have taken us on quite a merry romp in the &#8220;updating&#8221; of womanhood. In TV and movies, we have seen our roles transformed. Where once the female role was to provide utilitarian set decoration &#8211; a buxom girl with a steno pad off in the corner or a nurse poised prettily two paces behind the wealthy male patient or distinguished doctor &#8211; women characters began to take center stage in boardrooms, courtrooms and, of course, bedrooms. Women could now be the initiators in sexual encounters, a situation apparently both exciting and unnerving for the mostly male minds concocting these plots, as suggested by the easy transformation of female sexual aggressor to female maniacal murderer or tough-girl avenger.</p>
<p>Hollywood had it all figured out: If a good looking woman looked good on the periphery of the action, imagine how she&#8217;d look in a tight dress and high heels pleading the case center stage. And when the bound-and-gagged, ripped-bodice, helpless, virginal-but-damned-sexy victim character wore thinner than the nightie she was invariably abducted in, she could be replaced with the even more scintillating spandex-clad cat-woman character, whose punches and leg kicks showed off her curves. Over time, the female super-hero or anti-hero has &#8220;evolved&#8221; to the degree that she is also freely shown <em>being</em> hit herself. The violence in both directions has become more real, leaving the heroine looking very much like the old image of victim &#8211; bruised, cut, bloody and barely dressed.</p>
<p>On to the commercials, thanks to which basic bodily functions have been introduced as acceptable material for public discourse. Acne and hemorrhoid creme, sanitary products, anxiety medication, and every other remedy or product for any and every real and imagined condition, are out there front and center. Women may now be found all across the airwaves frankly discussing formerly unmentionable subjects. I do not deny that on some level this is progress. The time is long past when real, human issues may not be exposed in &#8220;polite society.&#8221; But the time has also passed when we can equate the crashing of taboos with genuine liberation.</p>
<div id="attachment_146" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://cinderzelda.com/m22-makeover.htm"><img class="size-medium wp-image-146" title="Extreme Extreme Makeover" alt="collage by Zelda Gatuskin" src="http://zeldagatuskin.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/m22-makeover.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" height="300" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size:xx-small;"></span>&#8220;Extreme Extreme Makeover&#8221; Collage by Zelda Gatuskin</p></div>
<p>What we would like to see now are images of women that are not traditional &#8211; by which I mean, that are not the way men traditionally portray women. We want images that are actually realistic, meaning, how women really see themselves and want to be perceived by others. It would be refreshing to see portrayals of women created by women, portrayals of men created by women, and portrayals of men and women created by men who are not invested in the marketing power of pigeonholing and demographics.</p>
<p>I lament the ubiquity of the man&#8217;s business suit as much as the bright-tight version of professional-wear favored by today&#8217;s on-screen female &#8220;role models.&#8221; In both cases the effect, if not the objective (though I think it <em>is</em> the objective), is to strip us of individuality in order to make us more predictable and easily-manipulated consumers. The man&#8217;s suit and the grooming that goes with it de-sexualize his appearance while imbuing him with the power of conformity to a system in which his &#8220;type&#8221; is favored. Conversely, the woman&#8217;s &#8220;uniform&#8221; and attendant cosmetic enhancements are meant to accentuate her sexuality, so that, however much wealth is evident by her appearance (and it takes considerable resources to look <em>that</em> good), she is first and foremost female. The man is a power figure to be followed; the woman is a figure of desire to be pursued.</p>
<p>Each generation that has tried to resist these stock identities has found itself in yet another battle for self-acceptance, often on the losing side. As more actual women (not the TV kind) reject the fashion dictates of Madison Avenue, the marketing geniuses turn their attention to the men. These days, men are equally the target of commercials intended to make them &#8220;need&#8221; something special in order to be acceptable. It is now essential that they perfume their bodies, condition their skin, soften (darken or increase) their hair, increase their virility (via medication or the stock market), flatten their tummies, and make themselves more &#8220;interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call me a curmudgeon (she of the tube top, hip-huggers and frizzy hair), but the younger generations&#8217; piercing and tattooing backlash to this Madison Avenue version of beauty and grooming looks a lot like self-mutilation. I admit, I&#8217;m not getting much traction for my theory that their heavy-metal style represents a deep, internalized self-loathing &#8211; certainly not from the young people themselves. One-on-one, &#8220;kids today&#8221; strike me as smart, confident and not at all self-hating. Their loathing is directed at societal bullshit and hypocrisy, and it is their right and duty to wage a creative campaign to point out that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>Each generation must fight that battle for primacy in envisioning the world they will inherit. Unfortunately, spontaneous, organic rebellion that emerges within any group these days is quickly trended and friended to death, with the &#8220;market&#8221; appropriating every new word and gesture for mass franchise: Young men and women who rejected over-hyped, mass-produced &#8220;fashion&#8221; and adorned their very bodies with ink and hardware have seen their style go from fringe to accepted to institutionalized via increasing refinement and reproduction by the purveyors of mass culture. Thus we find a relatively new stock character added to the hall of TV &#8220;types&#8221;- a goth-punk-styled, geeky young woman. She happens to be very pretty as well as very smart. She is empowered by virtue of her braininess rather than her figure &#8211; but let&#8217;s face it, she still looks like a dress-up doll.</p>
<p>What I see generally in mass media entertainment is, whether consciously devised or not, an effective program of desensitization to violence, vulgarity and verbal viciousness. About &#8220;entertainment&#8221; violence, suffice it to say that if you spend half an hour surfing TV channels (you&#8217;ll get plenty of movie trailers and video game ads in the mix too) you may come away with PTSD from all the shooting, burning, bombing, slashing, crashing, stalking, dissecting, threatening and torturing you will be exposed to. Likewise, verbal viciousness is sufficiently on display in print, radio and TV &#8220;news&#8221; that I will not elaborate on the point here, except to note that the nastiness and lies &#8211; nothing new, especially in the political arena &#8211; are now disseminated with lightning speed so that resulting disputes may escalate with equal rapidity. By &#8220;vulgarity&#8221; I do not refer only to sex debased to something like a joke, or debasing to one or more individuals, but images that are just plain gross and stupid. For example, we now have animated personifications of things like dirt and snot &#8211; though that latter word has yet to be used on-air. I suppose &#8220;snot&#8221; would be keeping it a bit too real to fulfill the marketing purpose, which is apparently to make &#8220;mucus&#8221; (dust, fat cells, germs, stomach acid, ants, roaches, weeds and unsightly growths) at once cute and killable.</p>
<p>Oh my. Cute and killable. That seems to be the same agenda Madison Avenue has for women. &#8220;Here, sweetie, have a cigarette.&#8221; &#8220;Put on this bikini and run for your life.&#8221; Meanwhile, the straight-laced types you might expect to defend our worth and integrity have fallen back to a notion of female &#8220;honor&#8221; that relegates us to, 1) the actual role of childbearing and rearing, and 2) its many metaphorical variants in society, such as office mommy – she who props up and cleans up after the overgrown boys in suits. It would be funny, or it would be irrelevant, except that women are not paid at all for their work in the home, and are not paid equally to men when they work outside of the home. And so we too exist in a prolonged version of childhood &#8211; financially dependent, disempowered, insecure about our identities, uncomfortable with our bodies, ripe for exploitation. The resulting tension leads to poor relationships between the genders and across generations. This is a battle that no one is winning, though some are banking on it, and laughing all the way. It&#8217;s been going on at least since someone penned the venerable Adam and Eve tale &#8211; and that guy <em>still</em> has the pen.</p>
<p>The mass media is a massively wealthy and powerful cadre of elites who literally control the lanscape and soundtrack of our lives. How long will we remain &#8220;babies,&#8221; allowing them to drum into us the same simplistic messages of fright or comfort or desire or superiority or insecurity or hostility, like bedtime tales in rotation? Wake up. Grow up. The medium is not the message. We have to take responsibility for the message. Until we do, we&#8217;ll keep getting the same old fare &#8211; reactionary condescension and amoral marketeering designed to make us feel like we&#8217;re going somewhere, when we&#8217;re really just tripping over our high heels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://papaangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/sanford-and-son-3-sanford-and-son-6399140-491-592.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-251" title="The Original Papa Angst" alt="" src="http://papaangst.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/sanford-and-son-3-sanford-and-son-6399140-491-592.jpg?w=248&#038;h=300" height="300" width="248" /></a>Yesterday, the furies of fate granted me a short trip back in time. Our car’s left headlight was out, so I drove, during daylight, to our local auto parts store for a replacement bulb. The store is an Auto Plus, formerly Parts Plus, which is the chain that bought Western Auto, the hardware-cum-auto parts store where I worked summers during my halcyon high school years. Back then, in the days before Wal-Mart, Western Auto (WA) was something of a trailblazer in that it not only sold hardware, but electronics, appliances, furniture, mowers, bikes, and toys. Auto parts and tires, though, were their big money makers, at least in the store where I worked, which was in a dusty, two-stoplight town just south of the Mason-Dixon line. It was a town where plenty of people fixed their own cars, and it was a time—dare I say, a simpler time—when what was under your car’s hood looked more like a machine than a computer. That said, I was no mechanic. My skills were limited to fluid and filter changes, tire mounting and balancing. In other words, nothing that was going to get me within chaw-spitting distance of any funny car racing pit.</p>
<p>Still, a big part of my job at WA was selling auto parts, and I had to fake it damn good whenever the locals came in asking, for instance, for an alternator for their ’67 Malibu. And I had to pretend to know the crucial difference between gauges that had a light or a switch, otherwise, as I was once advised, “you don’t know shit from Shinola.” So, when I rocked into Auto Plus yesterday with my son in tow, I got a bit of a flashback. There, behind the parts desk, was a guy in a black baseball hat that, had I not made the right turns out of WA, that charming small town, and it’s trifecta of boredom, sweet thangs, and dead-end jobs, might have been me. Just as it might have been Schadenfreude I felt when, after telling the guy the part I needed, he instinctively barked, “make, model, and year?” and, upon my answering, started thumbing a huge rack of parts catalogues in search of what I needed. Which, I admit, he quickly and ably procured from the shelf right behind him. In truth, he seemed like a nice guy who just happened to have the letters H-A-T-E tattooed on his knuckles, and when he smiled at my son after he waved goodbye, the rich tobacco stains on his teeth just about shined.</p>
<p>My second flashback of the day came later, when I tried <span id="more-250"></span>to replace the headlight bulb. Expecting this to be a five-minute job, I brought my son along, and for the first few minutes that we stood around our car with the hood up on a gorgeous fall afternoon, we looked out there like a genial Sanford and Son. All I needed was my can of Colt 45. But quickly I found out that this was not going to be a five-minute job, that no matter how hard I pulled on the old bulb, it wouldn’t come. I tugged, yanked, nearly broke the damn thing trying, unsuccessfully, to replace it. I even resorted to pliers, which the instructions had specifically advised against so as not to damage the headlight itself, which I very nearly did. All the while, my son, who at first had been fascinated by this new father-and-son adventure involving his favorite thing in the world besides cookies and his mother, our car, was fast growing bored. Several times I had to tell him to get his hands off the engine, the last requiring a semi-shout as he reached for a battery cable. Trying to fend off his curious little fingers while engaging in what had then become an epic struggle between me, the former auto parts salesman, and 2.5 inch left headlight bulb, I got a little, as they say on <i>Thomas and Friends</i>, cross. Or, as Papa Angst says, <i>fucking</i> cross.</p>
<p>But just as I was about to implode in defeat and utter emasculation, I stopped. I let go of the bulb. I collected myself, took a breath, and said (probably aloud), “You’re not a kid anymore. Use brains, not brawn.” Which is precisely when I decided to go back inside and look for advice on the Internet. And that’s what we did. My son and I gathered up our tools, marched inside, did a quick father-son Google search, and found the answer in 0.03438433 seconds flat. Faster than any top alcohol-class funny car. We even hi-fived after I read in some discussion forum that <i>yes</i>, indeed, unless you know the secret, replacing the bulb is a major pain in the “a*#.” (I love that kind of digital civility.) So, armed with this newfound knowledge, the <i>secret</i>, my son and I trotted happily back outside. We popped the hood, followed the instructions I’d scrawled on the back of a pediatrician’s bill, and replaced the bulb in a less than five minutes, which is just the amount of time I’d originally predicted it would take. I tested the light. It worked! I put down the hood, gathered up our stuff, and grabbed my coat from the front seat, where I’d thrown it earlier as I heated up in my impotent rage. After slipping it back on, I almost playfully flicked the driver’s side door shut—right onto the perfect, precious fingers of my pride and joy, my raison d&#8217;être, my sweet son, who’d inexplicably and maddeningly stuck them there just as I closed the door.</p>
<p>This is when my third flashback of the day came. When I was a kid, I got my fingers slammed in the car door (by my evil older brother, not my useless father), so I knew exactly how much it hurt and thus believed every decibel of my three-year-old boy’s screams. Since this is a relatively common occurrence for kids, I won’t describe the sensation, just recommend to those who haven’t experienced this to trust those of us who have. Instead, I’ll just say that not only did the high of pride and accomplishment at solving the incredible headlight bulb replacement puzzle come instantly crashing down, but I simply felt awful for having hurt my child so much. A day later, I still feel terrible, and guilt-wracked, with Mama at a work/dinner thing tonight, Papa is throwing a ‘Guys Party’ tonight that will include burritos, chips and salsa, and Curious George reruns for all the guys, which means, my son and all his stuffed animals, which he delightfully refers to as ‘the guys.’ After what happened, I hope there’s room for me on the sofa, too. If not, that’s okay. I’ll just sit in the kitchen and carve a homemade tattoo onto my knuckles: A-N-G….</p>
<p>for the <a title="The Angst Blotter: Blue Shirt" href="http://papaangst.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/the-papa-blotter-blue-shirt/"><strong>Angst Blotter</strong></a>:</p>
<p><strong>Nearly deboned my progeny&#8217;s left hand with the driver&#8217;s side door of a late-model compact car: hatchback, import, dark blue, modest, unimpressive, but bought new and paid off in 14 months, two hours after an acid-like trip down memory lane in an auto parts store, eighteen plus hours before throwing a Mexican-and-monkey-themed party for my injured child and his literally brainless friends. </strong></p>
