<p>If you&#8217;ve read this blog before you&#8217;ll probably know I&#8217;m super into space and Neil helped spark that. See when I was growing I honestly didn&#8217;t know any other Neils and I grew to almost dislike my name until my mum told me about Neil Armstrong the astronaut. Then I suddenly thought Neils were awesome and learning about the other Neil sparked my interest in all things spacey which has stayed with me to this day.</p>
<p>Rest in peace other Neil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some reason (boredom, chronic illness, and an under-appreciation of how short life is) I&#8217;ve seen every episode of <em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em> at least once.</p>
<p>Contrary to the title, I was not a fan of our eponymous hero. Nor did I enjoy his overbearing parents. But his wife Debra, played by Patricia Heaton, was the worst.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t hate her for the reasons we were supposed to hate her: she couldn&#8217;t cook, was a mediocre housekeeper, and kept denying Ray his court-mandated sexytimes. What I despised was that she was the archetypal sitcom wife: a put-upon nag with a doofus for a spouse, who seemed hell-bent on resenting the life she&#8217;d chosen, acting out every sexist male sitcom writer&#8217;s fear of the independent ball and chain with an incomprehensible need for self-actualisation. There was actually an episode (in the &#8217;00s!) where Debra decided to work outside the home but wasn&#8217;t <del>allowed</del> able to <em>because she had children</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/debra.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1361 aligncenter" title="Debra" src="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/debra.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>So when I heard Heaton was starring in another network sitcom about a nuclear family, I didn&#8217;t rush to watch. On the surface, <em>The Middle</em> looks as conventional as<em> Raymond</em>. It&#8217;s about an average family and their wacky antics, and it&#8217;s been low on awards and acclaim, so I was sure it wouldn&#8217;t be much cop.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. As the mom, Frankie Heck, Heaton is put-upon in a similar way to Debra, but here, she isn&#8217;t a martyr; she just gets on with her life. She bickers with her husband, Mike, but most of the time it seems like she actually cares about him and their three offbeat kids. Best of all, she&#8217;s an endearing mess who touches up her hair with felt tip pen and isn&#8217;t above petty outbursts and &#8220;borrowing&#8221; her neighbour&#8217;s car. (&#8220;Some people do meth,&#8221; is her justification.)</p>
<p>And while there are moments of gender disparity, such as her getting a dishwasher for Christmas (!), there are more that subvert traditional roles, where Frankie isn&#8217;t presented as automatically in charge of everything domestic just because she&#8217;s a woman. When she says she &#8220;cooked&#8221;, she usually means she picked up take-out, and her parenting style could best be described as &#8220;benign neglect&#8221;. (At one point she muses to Mike: &#8220;Name three times you’ve seen the kids since May. And not just in the house — I’ll even count around town.”)</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s also pretty ground-breaking in the way it&#8217;s taking on the recession while most other programmes gloss over it. The family shops at Frugal Hoosier, their holiday is an ill-fated camping trip, and at one point Frankie holds four jobs at once. Despite the title, the Hecks are actually (whisper it) working class, and their struggles are relatable, in an oddly uplifting &#8220;at least I didn&#8217;t get my tumble dryer when it blew into the front garden&#8221; kind of way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well-written, well-acted, with not a weak note in the cast, and it deserves all the awards and acclaim that have gone to more derivative, overrated and woman-hating shows like <em>Modern Family</em>. (Yeah, you can&#8217;t have a storyline about ladies&#8217; periods synching up and it making them cray-cray without invoking my righteous indignation.)</p>
<p><a href="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/frankie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1362" title="Frankie" src="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/frankie.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, after rolling my eyes at Debra for so long, <em>The Middle</em> made me think that Patricia Heaton might be pretty cool IRL. But something was nagging at me, much as Debra used to nag poor, useless Ray: repressed memories from snippets of news stories I&#8217;d seen and that time almost a decade earlier when I read/was baffled by her book, <a href="//" target="_blank">Motherhood and Hollywood: How to Get a Job Like Mine</a>.</p>
<p>Because I can&#8217;t leave good enough alone, I looked it up. <em>Oops</em>.</p>
<p>Not only is The Middle really popular with Republicans, not only is P-Heat a big <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-calling-sandra-fluke-slut/story?id=15841687" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a> fan, not only is she apparently super into religion in that &#8220;God wants me to convert everyone&#8221; kinda way, but she&#8217;s a vocal member of a campaign group called <a href="http://www.feministsforlife.org/" target="_blank">Feminists for Life</a>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s even gone on record as saying (brace yourself):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Women experiencing an unplanned pregnancy also deserve unplanned joy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which — once I&#8217;d recovered from my unplanned nausea — got me thinking about a couple of things:</p>
<p>1. Does a star&#8217;s politics put you off their pop cultural product? And</p>
<p>2. Can you call yourself a feminist if you don&#8217;t support a woman&#8217;s right to choose?</p>
<p>Technically, you can call yourself what you want, of course, and feminism is under attack from so many sources that perhaps we should welcome everyone who identifies with the label.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Feminists for Life have a point of view that isn&#8217;t entirely hateful. Yes, their protestors are doing the same thing as non-feminist campaigners: spreading misinformation and propaganda, and acting like a woman having a baby she never wanted isn&#8217;t a tragedy. But they do have a tiny point when they say that women who want to keep their pregnancies shouldn&#8217;t have to have abortions for social or financial reasons.</p>
<p>But I think women should always have agency over their own bodies and that human rights matter more than a tiny clump of cells with the potential to become a person, and that&#8217;s where The Hotster and I differ.</p>
<p>But does that mean I&#8217;m a better feminist than she is?</p>
<p>I wish it did. I would so like to wear a &#8220;top feminist&#8221; crown and ride around in a special chariot.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not sure I can. (And not just because I don&#8217;t know anyone who designs chariots.)</p>
<p><a href="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/feminists_anti-abortion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1363" title="Feminists_Anti-Abortion" src="http://beamagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/feminists_anti-abortion.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>Brilliant Nora Ephron once said, &#8220;You can’t call yourself a feminist if you don’t believe in the right to abortion,&#8221; and reproductive freedom is a key issue for most feminists, especially as our rights are continually eroded, but is it so important that being pro-choice is a requirement for entry into the community?</p>
<p>Feminism can be alienating for women who don&#8217;t grow up with any experience of it, not least because it sometimes seems like we all espouse a certain way of thinking and being. If we want to encourage more people to embrace the movement, maybe we need to accept more dissenters on every issue, as long as they identify with the idea of equality.</p>
<p>There are feminists who hold other beliefs I&#8217;m not personally on board with: that sex work is empowering, that whatever a woman chooses is feminist because it&#8217;s her choice, that changing your name when you get married isn&#8217;t a form of subjugation. But I&#8217;m still happy to be in their gang, because we don&#8217;t all have to think the same. I&#8217;m tempted to say that it&#8217;s OK for a feminist campaigner to oppose abortion, as long as she doesn&#8217;t try to restrict other women&#8217;s access to it. Then again, I can&#8217;t help wondering if part of Feminists for Life&#8217;s agenda is to undermine feminism by associating it with their anti-choice campaign.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone around in circles on these issues for hours (in my head) so I&#8217;d love to know what you think: should anyone who identifies as feminist be allowed into the fold, or should there be some kind of qualification for entry?</p>
<p>And can you watch <em>The Middle</em> regardless of Heaton&#8217;s views, see a Clint Eastwood film despite the fact he backs Mitt Romney, and look back on <em>Frasier</em> with fondness even though Kelsey Grammer thinks his right-wing politics have <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/338471/kelsey-grammer-my-republican-views-cost-me-emmy-nomination" target="_blank">cost him an Emmy nom</a>, or is that only encouraging them? Tell me! (Please.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many readers, I grew up reading comic books. I would accompany my mother on her weekly shopping excursions to the local grocery store, and she would give me a dollar, which would buy me four comic books and unlimited imaginary realms.</p>
<p>My favorites were <em>The Fantastic Four</em>,<a href="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-31" title="images-4" src="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-4.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></a> <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>The Black Panther</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, and the <em>Incredible Hulk</em>—as much for the illustrations as for any narrative delights they might have held. But, in many ways, I’m sure, this seemingly innocent weekly purchase ignited my love of reading.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn’t be dismayed, then, that my ten-year-old daughter has gravitated toward Manga. Huh? It was not that long ago when I didn’t even know what Manga was. In fact, I probably still would not know what it is if not for the many students I’ve had over the years who have shared their love of Manga—seemingly at the expense of the literature that I was trying to get them to read.</p>
<p>As an English instructor, I have spent countless hours and have expended tremendous energy trying to ignite a love of literature in my students, so I suppose it’s only natural that I share some of that enthusiasm with my own child.</p>
<p>Of course, I read to my daughter from the moment she entered this world. I remember sitting next to her crib and reading poetry to her in both English and Spanish—hoping that somehow this early exposure to the rhythms of Octavio Paz’s verse would begin to create complex, linguistic neural pathways in my daughter’s burgeoning brain.</p>
<p>Nowadays, as many parents know, there are myriad distractions—flashy video games, captivating websites, interactive iPhone apps—that compete for the attention of our children. How can a long sequence of black alphabetical characters against a white background bedazzle a child’s mind the way colorful, moving graphics can? Images they can see and hear and interact with in ways I could not have imagined when I was immersed in a <em>Fantastic Four</em> adventure and watching The Thing pulverize a Mack truck in the middle of a busy Manhattan intersection.</p>
<p>It’s not that my daughter doesn’t like to read or that she can’t appreciate the sublime joys that text can provide, it’s just that she likes to do so many other things. <em>Free Realms</em>, <a href="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-36" title="images-6" src="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-6.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="149" /></a>an on-line world wherein participants create an avatar that interacts with other avatars, has so captured my daughter’s imagination that the real world, for her, seems but a series of interruptions to this digital world.</p>
<p>What hope, then, for books?</p>
<p>Well, one must keep trying, I suppose. So, from time to time, just as my mother brought me to the grocery store and, ultimately, to the trove of comic books, I bring my daughter to the library and, ultimately, to the wellspring of Manga.</p>
<p>In May, my daughter and I went to a nearby public library where she immediately sought out the Manga collection. Although it wasn’t extensive, there were enough famous series to attract my daughter’s attention. And, even though <em>I</em> know little about the genre, <em>she</em> seemed to know exactly what she was looking for.</p>
<p>Thus, much like I imagine my mother was mystified by my seemingly preternatural knowledge of Marvel Comics, my daughter’s near innate knowledge of Manga mystifies me. How she knew to look for a Manga series titled <em>Inuyasha</em>,<a href="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-32 alignleft" title="images-3" src="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-3.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a> I do not know. She plucked the first two volumes off the bookshelf and went directly to a nearby table, where she sat and immediately began to devour <em>Volume 1</em>.</p>
<p>I believe she had read half of it in the relatively brief time that it took me to thumb through the library’s jazz CD collection. She continued to read <em>Inuyasha</em> in the car on the way home from the library while I listened to the Japanese pianist, Hiromi Uehara, whose CD I had just checked out of the library, on the car stereo.</p>
<p>As I said, I don’t know much about Manga, but I know enough about the genre to understand that many of the series contain mature themes, including graphic sex and violence, so I made sure to vet my daughter’s literary selections before allowing her to check them out of the library.</p>
<p>My daughter devoured the first two <em>Inuyasha</em> volumes quickly. I had hoped that perhaps she would feel compelled to read the entire series, which spans 56 volumes, according to wikianswers.com. However, she never asked to read another, and soon she was seated again in front of the computer screen in our home office, her eyes tracking the avatar that she had created and was controlling.</p>
<p>I suppose if I had had the ability to create a superhero like my beloved Captain America<a href="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-51.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-34" title="images-5" src="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-51.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="212" /></a> and control not only his movements in the comic book realm but his growth as a character, I might have chosen to forgo reading about him.</p>
<p>To be fair, I spent countless hours from my freshman to senior year in high school playing the fantasy role playing game Dungeons and Dragons, so I have some understanding of the attractions that a virtual world can hold for a young mind.</p>
<p>Still, I worry. As a parent, I worry that my child will become, or has already become, addicted to Free Realms or to the computer or to whichever electronic device is readily available. And I still believe that, despite all the electronic wizardry of the digital realm, there remains important cognitive and creative growth that occurs in our interactions with text and, I believe, that the digital realm cannot serve in the same way.</p>
<p>So I continue to invite my daughter to accompany me to the library. On Wednesday, I brought my daughter to the library at the college where I teach, and I directed her to the extensive Manga collection that our librarian has taken pains to amass in service of our Animation students, among others.</p>
<p>This time, however, my daughter did not seem to find easily any Manga series that interested her, for in the brief time that I had walked away to find the most recent edition of <em>Harpers Magazine</em>, she had abandoned her search for entertaining Manga, and I returned to find her standing in front of the nearest computer monitor—no doubt trying to figure out how to access Free Realms via our library’s interface.</p>
<p>I gently steered her away from the screen and guided her back to the Manga collection. This time, I tried to help her find a new series that she might be interested in. This was more difficult than I imagined, admittedly, since many of the series we have in our collection were written for a more “mature” collegiate audience. In her innocence, I didn’t want my daughter to pluck a book off the shelf and open it to a page depicting Samurai sword decapitations or mildly pornographic depictions featuring Geishas with open kimonos. Call me Victorian, but there will be time enough for all of that—and it won’t be long.</p>
<p>No, as a tween, she still hasn’t completely left bunny rabbits behind. Not completely. So, when I pulled a Manga off the shelf titled, <em>Usagi Yojimbo: The Brink of Life and Death</em>,<a href="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-35" title="images-2" src="http://mfcourteau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/images-21.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a> admittedly an alarming title, I was pleased to find a rabbit on the cover…in full Samurai costume wielding a Katana. At least the rabbit was clothed.</p>
<p>I leafed through the book and a quick scan of the images did not reveal anything particularly troubling. There are lots of sword fights and, well, I guess, stabbings, but it’s all in black and white, so the blood that is shed is not, well, very bloody. In fact, compared to the level of pugilistic violence that I was exposed to in my beloved Marvel Comics, this stuff is pretty tame by comparison.</p>
<p>It has been three days since we checked <em>Usagi Yojimbo</em> out of the school library. So far, my daughter hasn’t read much, if any, of it. She says she will. I still have hope that she will somehow fall into the thrall of this series and want to read more, and more, and, I still have hope that she will look less at the pictures and more at the text until, one day, she decides to dispense with Manga altogether and read literature once and for all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_18502" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerrynelson.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18502" title="JerryNelson" src="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerrynelson.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Jerry Nelson</strong><em> (July 10, 1934 &#8211; August 23, 2012)</em></p></div>
<p>I remember when Jim Henson died back in 1990 it didn&#8217;t really affect me. I was, after all  twenty years old and having just recently left the confines of public school; eagerly looking forward to getting my &#8220;You can now purchase alcohol legally&#8221; card.</p>
<p>I was roughly nine years removed from the days of regularly watching Kermit the Frog and Ernie (who was always my favorite Muppet). So, although still tragic, I saw Henson&#8217;s untimely passing as something much too childish to think about.</p>
<p>Fast forward 22 years.</p>
<p>Jerry Nelson, another famous Muppeteer, passed away on August 23rd at the age of 78. Although having lived nearly three decades longer than Henson, his death has affected me more. I look at the list of characters he has portrayed over the course of his career; many of whom were a regular part of my life growing up in the 1970&#8242;s. Among them:</p>
<div id="attachment_18513" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerrycount.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18513" title="Jerry&amp;Count" src="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerrycount.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="292" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Count and Jerry Nelson</em></p></div>
<p><strong>The Count:</strong> my second favorite Sesame Street character, next to Ernie of course. I loved him.<br />
<strong>Herry Monster:</strong> The one monster that ALWAYS scared me. Must have been that he always looked angry and had that big nose.<br />
<strong>Sherlock Hemlock:</strong> The greatest detective.<br />
<strong>The Amazing Mumford: </strong>Ala peanut butter sandwiches.<br />
<strong>Mr Johnson:</strong> The  bald, blue-headed Muppet who always ate at the restaurant Grover worked at.<br />
<strong>Floyd Pepper:</strong> the bass player for the band Electric Mayhem on The Muppet Show.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most sentimental Jerry Nelson character for me was <strong>Emmet Otter</strong> from the Jug Band Christmas story that played every December on HBO. A story that I will always remember sitting next to my grandmother and watching every year.</p>
<p>Funny, I can still hear her yelling to me from downstairs, and it always sounded like the house was on fire by the tone in her voice:</p>
<div id="attachment_18518" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerryemmet.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18518" title="JerryEmmet" src="http://jameswood.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jerryemmet.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Emmet Otter and Jerry Nelson</em></p></div>
<p>JIMMY!!! HURRY UP AND GET DOWN HERE &#8211; EMMET OTTER IS ON!!</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m now a middle-aged man that I&#8217;m starting to become acutely aware of the fact that every day more and more parts of my childhood die. And even though I&#8217;ve never met Jerry, it&#8217;s hard not to look back at his passing without a sense of sadness. For in many ways, much like The Count and The Amazing Mumford, he was a part of my family.</p>
<p>My grandmother has been gone for 16 years now. Whenever I think about her, the first thing I think about are those cold days in December when Emmet Otter&#8217;s Jug Band Christmas came on. And now, I&#8217;ll think about Jerry Nelson too.</p>
<p>Godspeed Mr. Nelson. Your work will not soon be forgotten; at least not by this 42-year-old kid.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a difference.  You’ve probably known a guy who goes to his local music store, spends hundreds of dollars buying a guitar, amp, cord, pedals, etc. just to put everything up on craigslist three months later.  Now, it could be that the hobby just didn’t interest him, or maybe he found a new hobby.  <strong>Or</strong>, it could be that the vision he had in his head when he bought that equipment had nothing to do with playing guitar.  He may have envisioned himself on a giant stage, spotlights blinding him while droves of screaming fans try desperately to get his attention.    Maybe he imagined a line of girls waiting outside his tour bus, desperately hoping that he’ll impregnate them and never talk to them again.</p>
<p>The problem with this fantasy of his is that it already assumes he knows how to play the guitar magnificently.  He doesn’t want to <strong>learn</strong> guitar, he wants to <strong>know</strong> guitar.  He doesn’t want to embark on a journey towards mastery over a musical instrument.  He wants fame, fortune, and sex.  After a month of hardly picking up his guitar, he will throw in the towel, put it all on craigslist, and use that money to go buy DJ equipment so that he can be the next Skrillex. A month after that, the dj equipment will appear on craigslist too.  Noticing a pattern?  Here’s the lesson:</p>
<p><strong>When you are picking a hobby, a job, or simply looking for something that interests you, make your decision with the assumption that you will not receive any fame, fortune, or recognition  for your hard work, other than the enjoyment of the hobby itself.  </strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at what this means.  Say you’re looking for a hobby, and you think you want to play guitar.  Assume that you will never, ever be a rock star, and imagine that nobody will ever get to hear you play other than close friends and family members.  Do you still want to learn guitar?  Yes?  Great, then go get one.  You’re in for an awesome journey.  People who are excellent at their craft are usually doing it for the craft.  The money and the fame may be an additional benefit, but that isn’t the reason for getting into the hobby (or in some cases, maybe it is, but it <strong>shouldn’t</strong> have been).  For example, electronic music has hit mainstream popularity over the last decade or so.  DJ Tiesto is an incredibly well respected electronic artist, and because of its new popularity, his concerts are killing.  But DJ Tiesto has been making electronic music since 1994, when it only appealed to a small, niche audience.  He truly likes making electronic music, and it shows in his work.</p>
<p>So the next time you’re thinking of pursuing something you believe you want, just ask yourself <strong>“do I really want this, or do I just want to be known as somebody who wants this”.  </strong>If the answer is that you really want it, then congratulations, you’ve found a legitimate interest, and you can pursue it to mastery.</p>

<p>I want to understand. I need to understand. But dammit, I just do not understand what the hell is going on here.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re spacemen. Four spacemen. Or, by some complicated and/or hilarious twists and turns, you&#8217;re four strangers who each have somehow had fishbowls dropped on your heads. Or, you know, is that a thing? A kink? Like armpit sniffing or back-hair trimming?</p>
<p>No, there&#8217;s a spaceship. You&#8217;re all spacemen. Is that <em>The Enterprise</em>? Is it coming to rescue you? You don&#8217;t look happy. Are you being cast out on some godforsaken planet? Was it the armpit sniffing? Kirk might go for that, but not Picard. He&#8217;d cast you out faster than it takes a Shakespearean actor to make a fortune playing relatively wise older guys in Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>Fast.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s that <em>The Enterprise</em> is saying? &#8220;Thrilled Cheese&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worse than I thought. It&#8217;s some kind of dairy product perversion that&#8217;s led Captain Jean-Luc Picard to discard you, a quartet of Camembert Pervs, on some lonely oxygen-free world, with nothing for company but your regrets, each other, and the fish in your helmets.</p>
<p>Which, however you slice it, has got to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Well, shame on you space dudes. And that shame is forever immortalised on the side of a van driving around Austin. There is no escape from what you&#8217;ve done. And that&#8217;s how it should be.</p>
