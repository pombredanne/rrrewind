			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46682" title="applekeynote" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/applekeynote.jpg?w=545&#038;h=325" alt="" width="545" height="325" /></p>
<p>And so it begins again. BGR has an exclusive scoop from an &#8220;unproven&#8221; (ooh!) source: <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/07/28/does-apple-have-any-interest-in-buying-barnes-noble/">Apple is in talks to buy Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, the country&#8217;s last remaining national bookseller. As BGR points out, the acquisition would get Apple B&amp;N&#8217;s digital books and other publications (which it might conceivably want) and Nook hardware (which it surely doesn&#8217;t), along with hundreds of retail outlets which it could either shutter or convert into Apple Stores. (Enormous Apple Stores! Usually located conveniently close to existing Apple Stores!)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of deep insight from another BGR source (the story doesn&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s a proven or unproven one):</p>
<blockquote><p>It also almost makes <em>too</em> much sense for Apple to do this, said another source of ours, mentioning that Apple doesn’t make moves that appear logical to most outside observers at the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said. For years, Apple has confounded the rest of us by not buying things that it should clearly be buying. Not purchasing other well-known companies is so core to Apple&#8217;s strategy that it must have a whole department devoted to non-mergers and un-acquisitions.</p>
<p><span id="more-46659"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been <a href="http://technologizer.com/2009/05/05/twapple-lets-recap-a-dozen-other-apple-acquisitions-that-arent-going-to-happen/">over this before</a>, but it&#8217;s worth a recap:</p>
<p><strong>2003:</strong> Apple shows it&#8217;s not that serious about this music thing after all when it <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/11/apple_in_talks_to_buy/">doesn&#8217;t buy Universal Music</a>!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-46660 alignnone" title="apple-universal" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-universal.png?w=545&#038;h=394" alt="" width="545" height="394" /></p>
<p><strong>2004:</strong> The world wonders if Steve Jobs has lost all common sense when <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/30/technology/apple/">Apple doesn&#8217;t buy Pixar</a>, a company Jobs already runs!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-46661 alignnone" title="apple-pixar" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-pixar.png?w=462&#038;h=440" alt="" width="462" height="440" /></p>
<p><strong>2005:</strong> Industry watchers the world over do a double-take in unison when <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/02/23/apple_to_acquire_tivo.html">Apple doesn&#8217;t buy TiVo!</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46662" title="apple-tivo" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-tivo.png?w=545&#038;h=317" alt="" width="545" height="317" /></p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong> Apple tips its hand to its disinterest in the phone market by making a strategic decision <a href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/02/6140.ars">not to buy Palm</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46663" title="apple-palm" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-palm.png?w=545&#038;h=422" alt="" width="545" height="422" /></p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong> It makes no sense at all, but Steve Jobs&#8217; large ownership stake in a legendary Hollywood company doesn&#8217;t lead to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-could-bid-for-disney-barrons?source=blq%2Fyhoo&amp;dist=yhoo&amp;siteid=yhoo">Apple buying Disney</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46665" title="apple-disney" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-disney.png?w=545&#038;h=399" alt="" width="545" height="399" /></p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong> For reasons lost to history, Apple doesn&#8217;t take the easy route to success in gaming by <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6084895-7.html">buying Nintendo</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46666" title="apple-nintendo" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-nintendo.png?w=545&#038;h=399" alt="" width="545" height="399" /></p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong> Bizarrely, it turns out that Eric Schmidt didn&#8217;t join the Apple board so <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-schmidt-the-set-up-pitcher-for-an-apple-sun-merger">Apple could buy Sun</a>!</p>
<p><img title="apple-sun" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-sun.png?w=545&#038;h=436" alt="" width="545" height="436" /></p>
<p><strong>2007:</strong> I still recall my shock and disbelief when I learned that <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/54978-10-reasons-why-apple-should-acquire-amd">Apple would not be buying AMD</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46667" title="apple-amd" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-amd.png?w=545&#038;h=356" alt="" width="545" height="356" /></p>
<p><strong>2008:</strong> Steve Jobs&#8217; legendary fondness for Flash inexplicably fails to result in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080111_003899.html">Apple buying Adobe</a>!</p>
<p><img title="apple-adobe" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-adobe.png?w=545&#038;h=419" alt="" width="545" height="419" /></p>
<p><strong>2008:</strong> Two years after its mysterious refusal to buy Nintendo, Apple once again spurns the Japanese by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=columnist_pesek&amp;sid=aBUsWjRX0foE">not buying Sony</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46668" title="apple-sony" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-sony.png?w=545&#038;h=416" alt="" width="545" height="416" /></p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> Apple makes a rare strategic misstep when it ultimately decides <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2052987/Apple-Should-Buy-Yahoo-Why-Im-Now-Convinced">not to buy Yahoo</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46670" title="apple-yahoo" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-yahoo.png?w=545&#038;h=405" alt="" width="545" height="405" /></p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> Apple&#8217;s continuing disinterest in gaming is confirmed when it <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/05/05/analyst-rabble-rousing-chatter-suggests-apple-eyeing-ea-takeover/">doesn&#8217;t make a dramatic bid to buy Electronic Arts</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46671" title="apple-ea" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-ea.png?w=545&#038;h=662" alt="" width="545" height="662" /></p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> Apple&#8217;s WWDC is a memorable one as <a href="http://gawker.com/5240350/could-apple-buy-twitter">Steve Jobs doesn&#8217;t announce &#8220;one more thing:&#8221; Apple is buying Twitter</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46673" title="apple-twitter" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-twitter.png?w=545&#038;h=334" alt="" width="545" height="334" /></p>
<p><strong>2009: </strong>In a move surely made primarily to confuse us all, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/04/apple-acquires-lala/">Apple <em>does</em> buy Lala</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46677" title="apple-lala" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-lala.png?w=545&#038;h=345" alt="" width="545" height="345" /></p>
<p><strong>2010:</strong> With unprecedented boldness, <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/apple/wall-street-thinks-apple-may-buy-ea-sony-netflix-facebook-or-disney-20101025/">Apple doesn&#8217;t use its huge stockpile of cash buy EA, Sony, Netflix, Facebook, or Disney</a>&#8211;yes, simultaneously!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46672" title="apple-facebook" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-facebook.png?w=545&#038;h=665" alt="" width="545" height="665" /></p>
<p><strong>2011:</strong> Apple&#8217;s careful consideration of a Hulu bid continues to result in&#8230;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2011-07-25-apple-hulu-bid_n.htm">nothing</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46674" title="apple-hulu" src="http://technologizer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/apple-hulu.png?w=545&#038;h=459" alt="" width="545" height="459" /></p>
<p>Now, take this for what it&#8217;s worth&#8211;remember, I&#8217;m not a professional analyst&#8211;but a careful reading of history indicates that the news of Apple&#8217;s discussions with Barnes &amp; Noble can lead to only one outcome: Apple not buying Barnes &amp; Noble. Like BGR says, it&#8217;s simply too logical to happen.</p>
<p>[<strong>BONUS EXERCISE:</strong> Tell us what Apple would be like today if it had done the logical thing and acquired Universal Music, Pixar, TiVo, Palm, Sun Disney, Nintendo, AMD, Sony, Yahoo, EA, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, and Hulu.]</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4321.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4321.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4321" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1753" /></a><br />
<em>TarpTent Contrail in happier times</em></p>
<p>Outdoor pursuits had not got off to the best of starts this week. I managed to fall off the bike midweek in Blairadam Forest, due to looking at where my front wheel was going rather than where I actually wanted it to go. This was closely followed by a chain snappage, on-trail repair and hasty retreat home for a beer. A window of opportunity presented itself for a weekend overnighter, since taking a new job in May, such events have been rare &#8211; so best seize it!</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4217.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4217.jpg?w=720&#038;h=900" alt="" title="_MG_4217" width="720" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1755" /></a><br />
<em>Lone pine in Glen Derry</em></p>
<p>My old favourite, the Cairngorms were the destination. I had a vague plan to camp at the end of Glen Derry somewhere. I love this part of the Scotland. The free-draining grit underfoot, the Scots pines, the wide open spaces and remoteness. The journey up past Glenshee to Braemar and Linn of Dee <em>feels</em> like a journey &#8211; a great road especially in great weather. Under blue skies, the Cairngorms can feel un-Scottish, almost North American maybe? </p>
<p>I cycled up to Derry Lodge and left the bike. There were plenty of folk around and a fair number of tents too. Onward up Glen Derry, I was thinking of pitching up above Loch Etchachan, near a spot I&#8217;d enjoyed a couple of years ago. Despite the sun, the wind was pretty strong even down in the glen, and when I bumped into an Aberdonian coming back from Derry Cairngorm, he confirmed it was even worse up high. Two pairs of mountain bikers descending back down the glen were at least now enjoying the tailwind, having fought their way into the wind on their outward route.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4233.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4233.jpg?w=900&#038;h=720" alt="" title="_MG_4233" width="900" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754" /></a></p>
<p>I reached the end of the glen and swung north-west, into the pass between Derry Cairngorm and Beinn Mheahoin, climbing up toward the Hutchison Memorial Hut. I passed a group of three overdressed walkers coming the other way. Further up, the penny dropped, they&#8217;d been repairing the path, hence the PU coated waterproofs rather than bling brand names. They&#8217;ve put in a fair amount of drainage channels, but the path has not yet had enough traffic to be fully compacted.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4256-edit.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4256-edit.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4256-Edit" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1758" /></a><br />
<em>The Hutchison Memorial Hut and Creagan a&#8217; Choire Etchachan</em></p>
<p>I stuck my head into the bothy, to be confronted by a combination of musty/fresh paint smell, a note from the MBA confirmed they&#8217;d spruced the place up just last week. It&#8217;s now slightly less hovel-like than last time I visited. I briefly considered sleeping here, given the wind. But I hadn&#8217;t walked all the way up the glen to sleep indoors. I had a bit to eat and pressed on, up to Loch Etchachan. The wind was still strong, so I decided to carry on, dropping down steeply to Loch A&#8217;an. I hadn&#8217;t been this far before, but was struck by the green tinge to the water and the sandy shores. Unfortunately I could see there were a few tents dotted around. I wanted the place to <em>myself</em>, but wasn&#8217;t prepared to spend the night anywhere else, it&#8217;s an awesome spot, with high crags all around and waterfalls crashing down off the mountain. I&#8217;d just have to share. It occurred to me that I&#8217;d be testing the limits of the Contrail in this wind.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4284.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4284.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4284" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1759" /></a><br />
<em>Loch A&#8217;an &#8211; You don&#8217;t really get a sense of scale here. There are two tents and a person on the sand/beach by the inlet on the left</em></p>
<p>Losing altitude the wind dropped a bit. The path down is steep and loose. I could see figures leaping from boulder to boulder, over by the famous Shelter Stone. It was inhabited too. I picked a spot equidistant from the other tents. Imagine the horror of someone pitching up <em>right</em> next to you way out here. <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  I was in a spot below the shelter stone and was afforded some shelter of my own by a giant boulder. I tried to imagine the sort of force required to deposit such a sizeable chunk of geology in it&#8217;s current position, either through glaciation, or snapping off the crags above and thundering downhill into the basin. I imagined the splat such a thing landing on my Contrail in the night would make. Cheery thoughts.</p>
<p>I got fed and wandered about, taking photos and occasionally eyeing the Contrail to see if it was still standing. The wind had picked up again and was making any attempts at long exposures futile. The Contrail seemed to be doing okay, a wee bit flappy, but okay. I crawled into my sleeping bag, stuck the earplugs in and fell asleep. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4287.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4287.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4287" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1760" /></a><br />
<em>The crags above the Shelter Stone with Garbh Uisge and Feith Buidhe burn cascading down the mountain beyond. A couple of patches of snow clung to the deepest recesses in the rock.</em></p>
<p>I must&#8217;ve had around an hour or two sleep before waking with the tent half collapsed on top of me. The wind had upped it&#8217;s game. It was getting <em>nasty</em>. I assumed a peg had come out and jumped out to sort it. The wind had been changing direction regularly. The Contrail should have been end to the wind, but was getting blasted broadside. By this point it was dark, I was pleased to have kept my socks and goretex oversocks on in the sleeping bag, meaning I could jump straight out onto the soggy ground.</p>
<p>The Y-pegs were fine, they held tight, even in the soft ground. The adjustable peg point had come loose, I re-tensioned it and the others and was about to go back inside, when I noticed my walking pole sticking through the fabric at the door. It had jumped out of the metal grommet during the flapping and had gone straight through the silnylon. Bollocks. I reseated it and went back inside. If it rained, there would be some dampness in the porch, not a big deal.</p>
<p>Half an hour or so later, I was struggling to get back to sleep, when the pegging point gave again. I reluctantly decide to strike, pack up and make a night hike back to the Hutchison Hut. It probably says a lot about me that I didn&#8217;t really consider crashing the Shelter Stone. I&#8217;d rather just hike back over the bealach to the [hopefully deserted] bothy. </p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4272.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4272.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4272" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1779" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d only brought my Black Diamond Ion headtorch, which is fine for around camp, but has limited range. I immediately realised that I didn&#8217;t have an accurate mental picture of how to get back out. The number of criss-crossing paths on the lower slopes confused matters further. I&#8217;d have to pick my way out, up through steep/loose terrain, 2 metres at a time, as dictated by the reach of my headtorch. It was burning on the low output, wary of running down the battery before I&#8217;d safely made it to the bothy. It&#8217;s safe to say I was a bit anxious at this point, especially with the wind ripping at my pack and twisting me off balance. It was a battle to stay on course, and I was glad of the poles to help me balance and brace against the stronger gusts. Slowly I noted one familiar feature on the ground after another, I just had to keep finding them all the way back to the bothy.</p>
<p>There was a bit of relief as the gradient eased and I made the top of the bealach, although I was well aware that I still had to pick my way through the stream/bog/path past Loch Etchachan, the trails petered out a few times. To make matters worse, the cloud had come down, making the output from the headtorch into a ghostly fog, obscuring features from the terrain ahead. I shut it off once or twice to get my bearings and pick out my position relative to the loch. Those gritty Cairngorm trails glow nicely under torchlight, offering a bit of reassurance underfoot. If the trails had been muddier, routefinding would have been more problematic. I may have had to shelter by a rock until dawn allowed my to see where I was going. I was also lucky in that the rain stayed off, there was some drizzle, but nothing significant. I made the outflow on Loch Etchachan and rock hopped precariously to the other side. Another obstacle cleared. The worst was over. Now back down on the new path to the relative comfort of the Hutchison hut. I remember giving thanks to whoever had the foresight to wrap the bothy porch with reflective tape. Inside, I checked the time, 0300, it would be getting light in a couple of hours. I&#8217;d made it back without needing to take a bearing or check the map. Time for some shut-eye.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4339.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4339.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="" title="_MG_4339" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1761" /></a><br />
<em>Stacan Dubha at dusk</em></p>
<p>I woke in the morning to the wind ripping at the bothy roof. No let up then. Outside the window I could see clear skies. I decided I didn&#8217;t fancy following my proposed route up Derry Cairngorm and back to Derry Lodge. Anyone who&#8217;s been on the bouldery summit of Derry Cairngorm knows there&#8217;s plenty of potential for a leg break up there. One big gust at the wrong moment&#8230;</p>
<p>No doubt the views from the summit would have been outstanding, but the conditions put me off, I&#8217;d pushed my luck enough for one weekend. I retraced my steps back down Glen Derry, the wind dropped as I reached the shelter of the trees near Derry Lodge and it was warm in the sun. I enjoyed the walk by the river, through the pines and stopped for lunch at the footbridge over Derry Burn. A short blast on the bike to the car at Linn of Dee left me with a feeling the trip was over too soon, despite my uncomfortable night hike. The wind had become a light breeze by Braemar and the prospect of a late afternoon spent in the garden with a beer wasn&#8217;t so bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4350.jpg"><img src="http://mcalisterium.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mg_4350.jpg?w=900&#038;h=720" alt="" title="_MG_4350" width="900" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1762" /></a><br />
<em>In the bothy</em></p>
<p><strong>Post Mortem</strong></p>
<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever found myself in a &#8216;situation&#8217; in the hills. One entirely of my own creation, stemming from the decision to leave my Akto at home and take the Contrail instead, despite having seen the forecast beforehand. This sort of gung-ho attitude is not something I&#8217;d ever entertain in winter. In summer, you&#8217;ll get wet and cold maybe. But in winter you&#8217;d get dead.</p>
<p>Loch A&#8217;an is about as remote as you can get in the Cairngorms, so you&#8217;re a good distance from help, should you need it. But in summer at least, there are a reasonable amount of people around too. If I&#8217;d been really desperate, I&#8217;d have gatecrashed the Shelter Stone. I think I also spotted a smaller, less enclosed shelter nearby that someone has constructed under a large boulder, presumably when there was no room at the Shelter Stone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reasonably pleased with my response to the situation, I extracted myself without much fuss. Lessons to be learned: <a href="http://www.mwis.org.uk/">MWIS</a> should be obeyed. And if you&#8217;re going to push your luck, do it somewhere you&#8217;re more familiar with. I knew the trails as far as Loch Etchachan, but the last section over to Loch A&#8217;an was new to me, meaning I didn&#8217;t have absolute confidence in finding the right trail back to the bothy in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> To put all this into perspective, there&#8217;s an interesting article describing the Cairngorm Disaster of 1971 written by RAF Sqn Ldr Bill Campbell <a href="http://www.aircrew-saltire.org/lib128.htm">here</a> which happened around the same area.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts on Kit</strong><br />
I pushed the Contrail beyond it&#8217;s design parameters, I can&#8217;t blame Henry Shires for that. It&#8217;s still usable, despite the hole. But only for low level pitches in good conditions. <em>Time for a TrailStar?</em> There is a large amount of material in the Contrail, if anyone can think of a MYOG project that could use the fabric, you&#8217;re welcome to it, leave a comment. Lots of silnylon stuff bags maybe?</p>
<p>My Fizan poles were great [apart from puncturing my shelter]. The security and stability offered when climbing the loose, steep ground up to the bealach in high wind was most welcome. </p>
<p>My BD Ion was the star of the show. The £15 headtorch was just powerful enough to get me back to the bothy. Either of my Petzls would have been preferable, the XP2 would have illuminated much further ahead, which would have inspired confidence in my route finding skills. But without the Ion, I&#8217;d have be sat shivering under a rock until dawn. Given my reliance on it this trip, at 28g, maybe it&#8217;s time to start carrying it as a backup throughout winter.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_907" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://girlmeetsformosa.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/writing-spaces-01.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-907" title="Writing Spaces - 01" src="http://girlmeetsformosa.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/writing-spaces-01.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Xinbeitou in all of its environmentally sustainable architecture glory, from Beitou Park.</p></div>
<p>So as I may or may not have mentioned, I have spent the month of July WRITING EVERY DAY&#8230;. just about. My initial goal was to write six days a week, and then take a break on either Saturday or Sunday, but then I started devoting my days off to blogging, and/or research interviews, etc, and then I found myself working every day and taking the occasional Wednesday-afternoon burnout break after like two weeks straight. In total in July so far, I have sat down for extended writing time on 24 out of 28 days. Written documentation of this is 2 full notebooks, and 2 more notebooks just begun.</p>
<p>Phew.<span id="more-905"></span></p>
<p>This has meant that progress on the book manuscript is actually moving at a decent pace, and that I am re-reading and analyzing a lot of the research I have done in the past 11 months!  I hope to keep working in this way for my last two months here, since it will be a whole heck of a lot easier to go to a Taipei library and look up an unanswered or new historical question&#8230;.when living in Taipei. I do have some new people to meet and final sources to check out, but suffice it to say I have changed phases and am now putting writing first, so as to focus and optimize the rest of my research.</p>
<p>And this means, of course, that I need to find places to write.</p>
<p>Why, might you ask? Unfortunately, I have been a library and café writer for as long as I&#8217;ve been writing&#8211; I really need a room to work in, preferably with a door, my own music, and COFFEE, which is not also the room that I sleep in. And that&#8217;s that. Public spaces don&#8217;t bother me at all, in fact, I often find them more productive&#8211; the energy is nice, the presence of other people adds social pressure and makes me feel like a jerk if I spend hours on facebook or other internet surfing, and you can only drink <em><strong>so many cups of coffee</strong></em> before it is just time to call it a day (or night). Also, there is no bed, so I can&#8217;t &#8220;recline,&#8221; and inevitably, &#8220;nap.&#8221; I find that I can write at my desk in my room late at night, read and annotate sources, or to type up, edit, and scrutinize the day&#8217;s longhand-produced prose; but these are all different kinds of tasks from the daytime work. (My ideal full-time writing schedule is one daytime writing session out of the house, and one night session at my desk. But this is tricky, what with reality and life and all that jazz. And all this considering I am currently the freest I will be with my time for a looong time to come! End of writing schedule tangent.)</p>
<p>So here are three of my favorite places in Taipei for writing this summer, and this past month:</p>
<p><strong> 1) Xinbeitou Library, Xinbeitou MRT station, Taipei</strong></p>
<p>I recently discovered the Xinbeitou Library, which is a branch of the Taipei Public Library System, so I have a library card and can take out books and DVDs. But even more importantly, I have a great reason to go up there early in the morning to hammer out my next round of pages: it is one of the most peaceful and beautiful workspaces I have ever seen! Photos below&#8211; nestled into the rolling mountains of Beitou District, the Xinbeitou Library is one of the first completely green and sustainable buildings in Taipei (with in theory, the highest rating of energy-saving and renewal of resources possible for a green building). It&#8217;s also gorgeous&#8211; all in wood, with breezy outdoor porches, windows everywhere for natural light, and its very own WATERFALL, cascading mineral water from the natural hot springs through the stream that runs through the Beitou Park where the library is located. I think of it as a fantasy treehouse, a lovely place where I can write, far from the distractions of noisy downtown Taipei. The other day when I was sitting on the porch outside writing in the warm wind, some squirrels traipsed down a nearby branch, and it reminded me of sitting in a tree, at home on Long Island!</p>
<div id="attachment_908" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://girlmeetsformosa.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/writing-spaces-02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-908" title="Writing Spaces - 02" src="http://girlmeetsformosa.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/writing-spaces-02.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I mean, there&#039;s a waterfall on the path from the park to the library!

<p><strong>2) Salt Peanuts, ShiDa Night Market, Taipower MRT station</strong></p>
<p>Some awesome local and farther-afield cafés have also allowed me a place to nestle into this month&#8217;s writing habit. Both have excellent coffee, and terrific food and other drinks. One, Salt Peanuts, is about the most hipster café I have seen in Taipei, located near the ShiDa night market&#8211; but the coffee is divine, and served on wooden block coasters, and the egg panini is basically the best egg sandwich I may have ever had. The other day I had to do some synthesizing of old and new writing together, cannibalizing my Master&#8217;s Thesis from Emerson and butchering it for parts, as well as writing those parts back into the new chapter structures. Salt Peanuts was the perfect place to throw down my stack of papers and make sense of the mess!</p>

<p><strong>3) Orange Café, Shilin MRT station</strong></p>
<p>Finally, Orange Café is near and dear to me, and I am becoming more and more of a regular there&#8211; since in addition to having great coffee and mango lassi (a healthy fruit yogurt drink that originally hails from India), they have delicious food, and also serve booze! So I&#8217;ve gone there to work for hours on a deserted Sunday morning, to write a few pages before dinner on a weekday late afternoon, and to relax over drinks with friends at night. Versatile, a little funky (but don&#8217;t let the beads fool you, it&#8217;s also more hipster than hippie), and always playing GREAT music, Orange is the new neighborhood standard of awesome writing (and hanging out) space.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://iamagonistes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-725" title="images" src="http://iamagonistes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/images.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a>A few weeks ago I was in a conversation—actually a debate—about which decade boasts the best music: the 1970s or the 1980s. One guy I was with is a product of the 1970s so  you know which side he took. Another is a product of the 1980s. Of course he was sure that the 1980s had the best music. Also a product of the 1980s, I am most familiar with that decade but would like to see myself as, perhaps, more what you might call objective. Or maybe not. Like many conversations, I took on the role of the passive observer—I needed material for a blog after all— while my friends waxed on the merit of each.</p>
<p>One of the things I thought about during the back-and-forth was, &#8220;What do we mean when we refer to an entire decade of music?&#8221; Like most of the decades, there is a little overlap. What we mean when we say &#8220;the 1970s&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really begin until about 1974. The same goes for &#8220;the 1980s.&#8221; For the sake of argument I&#8217;m going to start the official 1970s era in 1971 when <a href="http://www.ledzeppelin.com/">Led Zeppelin</a> released <a href="http://discography.ledzeppelin.com/disc_lz4.html">Zep IV</a> late that year. And even though the 80s vibe was beginning to take shape pretty early in the decade with Air Supply and Kool &amp; the Gang (yeah I said it), acts like <a href="http://www.benatar.com/">Pat Benatar</a>, Queen, Olivia Newton-John, and <a href="http://www.blondie.net/">Blondie</a> (did you know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lines">Parallel Lines</a> is on <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/moby-grape-moby-grape-19691231">Rolling Stone&#8217;s top 150 all-time list</a>?) were carrying the prior decade&#8217;s banner. I don&#8217;t think 1981 is that much different. Because of this I&#8217;m going to begin the official era of the 80s music with … drumroll … what else but Thriller. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/">Footloose</a> is really really close to being the quintessential 1980s release—happy, tamed anti-establishment, visual—and it was only a year later.</p>
<p>And on the subject of overlap, as I listened to the two throw out artist after artist it became evident that acts like Elton John, Aerosmith, Kiss, Van Halen, and others had hits in both decades. So which decade gets to claim them? It&#8217;s a judgment call. The 1970s get Elton pretty much because he was so bad post 1980. Aerosmith is a little more difficult. They probably sold more records in the 1980s so that&#8217;s where I put them. Kiss has got to go to 70s while Van Halen goes to both, somehow. Journey, Chicago, and Foreigner … I&#8217;m non-committal. Springsteen? He is a statistical outlier in this debate. One thing I know: the 80s get U2.</p>
<p>My 13-year-old daughter recently asked me, &#8220;Dad how can you tell which songs belong to the 70s and which belong to the 80s?&#8221; I thought about it for a second or two before answering, &#8220;Listen for actual musical instruments. If you can hear instruments then it&#8217;s probably the 70s.&#8221; And it&#8217;s true. The music of the 80s seems over produced. Even Van Halen&#8217;s 1984 takes one of the great guitarists ever and puts him on keyboards. The music of the 70s, on the other hand, had dark places, mysterious corners, and strange twists and turns that gave us room to explore. The 1970s is so much more nuanced than the 80s and so much more of, in my opinion, what real life has in store for us. It has edges and corners. While the 70s had musical corners where you could go camp out, the 80s was much more cotton candy and polly anna.</p>
<p>In this debate I think we&#8217;ve got to consider the launch of MTV in 1981, too. Growing up in a rural community … don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t remember the day MTV landed on my black and white television when that guy dressed in an astronaut&#8217;s costume put the MTV flag on the moon. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Goodman">Mark Goodman</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hunter_%28VJ%29">Alan Hunter</a>, and <a href="http://www.marthaquinnpresents.com/home.php">Martha Quinn</a>? I mean, really, how cool were those guys. And don&#8217;t forget <a href="http://angellesmusic.com/ninablackwood/index.html">Nina Blackwood</a>. Looking back, however, MTV sounded the death knell for true musical artistry for more than a decade. Think about it. Once the era of the music video hit, &#8220;music&#8221; became less the cultural ethos of a generation and more about the dance, the face, the clothes, and the shock. MTV created Boy George for crying out loud!  Also because of MTV, music ceased being the collective story. And on that note, I hold MTV accountable for almost killing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album">concept album</a>, too. In some ways, MTV introduced an era of American music when music was no longer music.  With all due respect to the 80s songs I know by heart and love, the 1970s is the greatest musical decade. Not only is the artistry superior, but it&#8217;s the last decade of the true storyteller (until recently, but that&#8217;s another post).</p>
<p>Is this a trivial conversation to have? Good question—especially in light of our economic woes. But maybe that&#8217;s exactly this conversation is important. I&#8217;ve come to conclude that the playlist is never trivial. Right or not, the playlist has come to define us even if it&#8217;s just for moments at a time. I think most of us would agree that it&#8217;s in these moments when we feel most ourselves and maybe even most alive. And I&#8217;m not buying the position that music is mere escapism, either. Admittedly it can play that role. But more than escapism, our music gives us a means of expression and articulation—a means of expression when our words come up short. In fact, very often it&#8217;s the playlist that speaks on behalf of our deepest places. It&#8217;s the playlist that speaks for the heart.</p>

<p><strong>My hometown of Pittsburgh is the third worst dressed city in America</strong> according to the new write up from <em>GQ</em> about the 40 Worst Dressed Cities In America. According to the short article:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The citizens of Pittsburgh&#8230;indulge a style that could be referred to as &#8220;Game Day Casual&#8221; (or &#8220;Meth Lab Formal,&#8221; depending on your preference.) It stems from their love of a certain NFL franchise and an utter indifference to their personal appearance and what you think of them.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I personally prefer thrift store chic.</p>
<p>The piece concludes with:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230;there is no city on Earth that can equal the utter sloppiness of Pittsburgh.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em></em>When I asked a random Pittsburgher what he thought about being called one of the sloppiest urban humans in the country he had this to say: &#8220;At least we beat Cleveland again right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The clowns at the magazine know what they&#8217;re doing. They pretty much picked a city from every state in America except for places that will literally never buy one copy of <em>GQ</em>. You know, places like Montana.<span id="more-4805"></span></p>
<p>As a former editor who&#8217;s written pieces like this one, I know how it works. You look at a map and start spitballing, trying to come up with ideas based on first impressions of city names, personal experience, and whatever funny photos you have floating around. Then everyone starts firing out one-liners and writing abstracts until some copy is completed. After that, you just decide which markets you want to really get a response out of and insert the weaker entries throughout.</p>
<p>And the formula works. I heard about this as the local news played in the background one evening last week.</p>
<p>If you look at <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/fashion/201107/worst-dressed-cities-america#slide=1" target="_blank">the rankings</a> (and I wouldn&#8217;t waste my time if I were you), you&#8217;ll see that literally every style of dress in America with the possible exception of nudist is called worst-dressed at some point. I say this after an extensive analysis that involved me clicking through pictures for 20 seconds. So unless the writers at GQ are nude lumberjacks from Montana, they also fit into their own worst-dressed list which could probably be more accurately titled the &#8221;Cities In Which People Wear Clothes&#8221; list.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised that this list is made or that Pittsburgh is 3rd, but the rankings got my attention when I saw who rounded out the top 5. Those cities are Manhattan (#5), Chicago (#4), Los Angeles (#2), and Boston (#1). So all you have to do to increase web traffic is insult the largest cities in America? Why didn&#8217;t I think of this sooner? Let me try:</p>
<p>San Francisco can&#8217;t get a girlfriend! Ooh, burn. I hope I don&#8217;t crash the server.</p>
<p>I planned to mention the irony that Mr. Boston Tom Brady has been on the cover of GQ at least three times, but as I looked at the images in a quick Google search a new question came to mind.</p>
<p>Is this a men&#8217;s magazine? Because I&#8217;m kind of catching a <em>Playgirl</em> lite vibe.</p>
<p>I suppose I mean that facetiously, but I&#8217;ve had enough moments in life where I laugh at the brilliant humor of others only to realize later that they were actually being serious as humans. Then I felt awkward. So now I&#8217;m unsure. I think GQ is for guys and assumed that the funny parodies of American cities were created by clever satirists. But now I&#8217;m wondering if these people are serious, like elbow-patched professors in a private lounge who actually believe that the rest of the world thinks like them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna need your help on this one, so I&#8217;ll leave you with a couple questions. See you after I get back from the thrift store*.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Has anyone out there read GQ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>How does <em>your</em> city/town dress?</strong></p>
<p>*Seriously. Those places are the best <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962539166/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/5962539166_8e83eb68cd.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>The Pie and <em>il Principe</em> share a birthday.  Sure, the Pie is now 29 and IP is only 2, but they can still enjoy the festive atmosphere of a birthday party.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s a children&#8217;s birthday party without a <a class="zem_slink" title="Piñata" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1ata" rel="wikipedia">piñata</a>?  It&#8217;s &#8212; well, it&#8217;s pretty much just a party without a piñata.  But that&#8217;s besides the point.</p>
<p>The Pie and I thought that we would combine <em>il Principe&#8217;s</em> love of vehicles with his destructive tendencies, and a piñata filled with toys (because <em>this</em> 2-year-old has <em>enough</em> extra energy) was the perfect gift.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5955290192_48fb632eb3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5955290192_48fb632eb3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>First, I spent a peaceful evening with the dog when the Pie was out tearing strips of newspaper.  These are old copies of a certain legal newspaper popular in these parts.  While it&#8217;s a very good newspaper, I must admit to a certain satisfaction in tearing up all that legal verbiage.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6014/5954732437_1cbd41548a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6014/5954732437_1cbd41548a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>I also prepared my <a class="zem_slink" title="Helicopter rotor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_rotor" rel="wikipedia">helicopter rotor</a> blades (I decided that this particular helicopter has six blades, so there), as well as the tail and all the other bits.  I pulled old cereal boxes and such out of the recycling for this.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/5955292370_9a851811e4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/5955292370_9a851811e4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>And I cut up some clear plastic out of the recycling to use as windows.  This is going to be one classy chopper.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5955291604_ed6f83390a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5955291604_ed6f83390a.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>So now that you&#8217;ve got everything ready, you need to make your <strong>paste</strong>.  In a bowl, mix together <strong>2 cups flour</strong> with <strong>3 cups water</strong>.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/5955292942_9b1d4c1f7c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/5955292942_9b1d4c1f7c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>I like to use a spurtle to stir my paste.  That&#8217;s right.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurtle" target="_blank">spurtle</a>.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5955293442_bc3e92161c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5955293442_bc3e92161c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Mmm, pasty.  Everyone always makes jokes about &#8220;that kid who ate paste&#8221; in kindergarten, but we didn&#8217;t have that.  We did, however, have the girl who, when asked, DRANK (like I&#8217;m talking glug-glug-glug) Elmer&#8217;s School Glue.  Bleugh.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/5954735375_07cf307d10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/5954735375_07cf307d10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>And now we need ourselves a balloon, which forms the basis for many, many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" target="_blank">papier-m</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" target="_blank">â</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" target="_blank">ché</a> projects.  The last time I did <a class="zem_slink" title="Papier-mâché" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" rel="wikipedia">papier-mâché</a> I made an enormous head with a huge nose, cut out holes for eyes, borrowed one of my dad&#8217;s fedoras (he also has a large head), stuck a <a class="zem_slink" title="Press pass" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_pass" rel="wikipedia">Press Pass</a> in the brim and went around for Hallowe&#8217;en as a reporter.  It was a good costume.  I swear.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5955294482_b976b07be3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5955294482_b976b07be3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>I attached the tail to the balloon with tape.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5954736391_612d64c384.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5954736391_612d64c384.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Now we paste strips!  Run one side of your strip through the bowl of paste.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5954736933_dae662fcf3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5954736933_dae662fcf3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Use your fingers to squeegee off the majority of the paste.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6133/5955295874_02a6dcba56.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="500" /></p>
<p>Slap that baby on your structure and smooth it down.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6026/5955296434_1e5a6e3613.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6026/5955296434_1e5a6e3613.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Continue with more strips, being careful to slightly overlap each one.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5955298180_4b86a68662.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5955298180_4b86a68662.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>If you need help with balancing your project as you work, why not try propping it up in a bowl for stability?<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5954740729_062a9a5ef3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5954740729_062a9a5ef3.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have finished a complete layer, use your fingers to smooth on some extra paste.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/5955299858_d8d4fe4e02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/5955299858_d8d4fe4e02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Let that set for a bit to become tacky and sticky.  While you&#8217;re waiting you can put paper on your other bits.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5954741845_4f3579c478.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5954741845_4f3579c478.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>For the wheels, for example, I wanted a little bulk, so I dipped a few strips, crumpled them up, and stuck them to the wheel template before wrapping the whole thing in other strips.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6005/5955301226_f0f8b5360b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6005/5955301226_f0f8b5360b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Set those aside somewhere to dry.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5954743769_29d097e450.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5954743769_29d097e450.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Repeat the layering steps a few more times, creating three or four layers of paper on your main structure.  The focus should be on creating what will be a hard shell around your balloon.  I tried to add a bit more paper at the bottom of the chopper-balloon to help compensate, balance-wise, for the weight of the tail.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6136/5955304674_ee64afbf39.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6136/5955304674_ee64afbf39.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>When you have enough paper on your structure, put it somewhere out of the way to dry overnight.  The top of our fridge is as good a place as any.  Plus it&#8217;s nice and warm there (our fridge is ANCIENT) and with the current humidity I&#8217;m hoping it will give the paste a boost in drying.  <a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6147/5954746763_1402d2692b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6147/5954746763_1402d2692b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>I saved the extra paste, just in case.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/5955303118_acb124dc3d.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/5955303118_acb124dc3d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>Now to clean up!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6123/5954747551_cc2d6b2661.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></p>
<p>The fortunate thing about flour paste is you just have to wet it again and it comes off anything really easily.</p>
<p><em>The Next Day &#8230;</em></p>
<p>Actually, this was two days later.  It was so gloomy and humid that the darned thing just would not dry.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6008/5962554418_172e02b6c5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6008/5962554418_172e02b6c5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a>So now we get to get around to our painting and assembly.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5962000133_5c70750f4c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5962000133_5c70750f4c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a>We bought this lovely metallic blue paint at the dollar store and thought it would look good on a helicopter.  It did, but the problem was that it was transparent paint, something the made-in-China label didn&#8217;t tell us.  Nor did it tell us that the paint fumes were highly objectionable.  But you get what you pay for of course.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5961999237_c83ffbe8f7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5961999237_c83ffbe8f7.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a>Onto plan B, then.  I painted the props and the wheels with the silvery-blue stuff and went off to find a more opaque solution to the plane problem.<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5961997631_d58488ff82.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5961997631_d58488ff82.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></a>Thus I came up with India ink.  And ink is awesome because it dries really fast.<a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962550362/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/5962550362_46e8dfa79e.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a>Of course, you can still see the metallic paint through the ink, but I figured I would just paint over the quick-dry ink with more metallic paint.</p>
<p><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961996481/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6148/5961996481_86a1331b9f.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a>Mercifully, just as I&#8217;d finished, the sun came out, so I left everything to dry for a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962547806/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/5962547806_3c9ebe219e.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a>So now we need to cut out a wee hatch through which to insert the prizes.  Using a <strong>box cutter</strong>, carefully pierce your shell and the balloon underneath.  POP!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961993699/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5961993699_74c39ebf24.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Cut a hole only just big enough for your purposes, leaving a little flap so you can close it up again later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961993337/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5961993337_3afe2f458f.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There&#8217;s that shriveled balloon.  You can throw that out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962546110/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5962546110_ea6d3782a7.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My helicopter is going to have a window, so I measured the &#8220;glass&#8221; to the side of the chopper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962545614/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/5962545614_ca6e40178c.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Cut out a hole.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962544664/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/5962544664_912625027f.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I think I may use the piece I cut out to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascinator" target="_blank">fascinator </a>at some later and unrelated date.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962543832/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6010/5962543832_2574b7fcba.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I fixed the window in place with <a title="Handy Items Week: Hockey Tape" href="/2010/06/05/handy-items-week-hockey-tape/"><strong>hockey tape</strong></a>, that lovely universal adhesive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962544206/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6010/5962544206_65b2ff7b5d.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I used a paper punch awl to poke holes to hang the suspension wires from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962543316/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5962543316_1c00053bca.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You can see that balance is going to be an issue here.  I ended up taping a few rocks into the tail of the chopper to balance it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961989673/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6014/5961989673_686e0c4994.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I stuck the props on.  The wheels refused to stick and were therefore scratched.  Bye-bye b&#8217;ys.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961989221/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6123/5961989221_b6ff2b1ae8.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Don&#8217;t forget to put your prizes in!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962541592/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/5962541592_c5cd7b0981.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Then the helicopter needed some accents.  On one side of the tail I painted on <em>il Principe</em>&#8216;s initials and the year he was born, to look like some kind of ID code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961987417/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5961987417_96e9d80d4d.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On the other I did his birthdate (21 July) followed by HB &#8211; happy birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5962540230/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6003/5962540230_45dd53118f.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Then I added some dots that represent flashing lights, and blacked out the frame parts of the window.  And yes, I just made up where they went.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961986449/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6013/5961986449_8157069de6.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="283" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And there you have it.  <em>Il Principe</em> can&#8217;t wait to destroy it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="It's a Secret Part 2 by alio, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alio/5961984995/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5961984995_0e15ea12a3.jpg" alt="It's a Secret Part 2" width="500" height="283" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://femthreads.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/winehouse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1119" title="Winehouse" src="http://femthreads.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/winehouse.jpg?w=600&#038;h=325" alt="" width="600" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>I’d wager that Amy Winehouse fans – casual or otherwise – had a similar reaction to the 27-year-old singer and fashion muse’s death: tragic but not entirely unexpected. You’d only need to listen to a few tracks off her brilliant 2006 album <em>Back to Black</em> to know that Winehouse’s demons were the crux of her too-short existence.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://femthreads.com/2011/07/23/amy-winehouse-and-rehabbing-the-stigma-of-substance-abuse/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ojdbDYahiCQ/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Winehouse’s struggles with drugs, alcohol and mental illness became as much of a part of her identity as her black eyeliner and beehive hair. Her personal battles were relentlessly demonized in all-caps headlines splashed across the front page of tabloids and celebrity gossip websites.</p>
<p>We rolled our eyes when she was arrested – yet again – for drugs, assault or whatever trouble she found that day. We chuckled at yet another disastrous live performance caught on YouTube while quietly willing <em>Back to Black </em>producer Mark Ronson to dust her off and drag her into the studio for another round of that soulful, hip-hop-infused blues-rock we all craved – like in &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqtCmMS7oKY">Love is a losing game</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps we owe it to Winehouse to take a step back and consider the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on our friends, families, neighbors, co-workers – and how these struggles are stigmatized by media and society. We run marathons for lymphoma, wear red for heart health and convince pro athletes to don pink cleats for breast-cancer awareness. What about depression? Eating disorders? Alcohol abuse?</p>
<p>We loved Winehouse for her unapologetic honesty and her take-no-prisoners attitude. But addiction and mental illness are far from easily conquered for even the strongest among us with a hearty support network. Now as we’re left to shudder when <em>Rehab</em> pops up on our playlists, let’s start reconsidering how we view substance abuse and mental illness before we lose another star, famous or otherwise.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><em>How to Roast a Lamb</em> is full of elaborate sauces and spreads that can seem daunting to the average foodie. Michael Psilakis&#8217;s recipes sometimes include flipping back and forth across the book up to three or four times to other recipes &#8211; adding a teaspoon of another time-consuming confit or dressing. To me, it is the fun of the book. Navigating around it takes some time but once you conquer a dish &#8211; it is well worth the time and energy. The same feeling came about when completing his recipe for Roasted Lemon Puree. This sauce was surprisingly simple &#8211; only a handful of ingredients that you&#8217;ll most likely already have in your kitchen. It takes a couple hours but is a perfect weekend activity. Of course, it is even more fun when you have a friend by your side (a big thank you to Debbie who worked with me on this recipe!).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I love the way this puree is the consistency of a mayonnaise but only has whipped olive oil within a rich and flavorful roasted lemon concoction. We used the puree as a sauce for grilled lamb chops and a marinade for chicken kabobs. This would be amazing on a pita sandwich (or a BLT!), any grilled meats or veggies &#8211; or spooned out of the jar straight up.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Roasted Lemon Puree, by Michael Psilakis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 scrubbed lemons (scrubbing removes any wax on the lemons)</li>
<li>about 1/3 cup kosher salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon or orange juice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dijion mustard</li>
<li>2 crushed and pressed garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 cup olive oil</li>
<li>pinch of sugar</li>
<li>cracked pepper</li>
</ul>
<div>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Roll each lemon in aluminum foil. Place on top of a mound of salt with the seam side down. Roast until packages are soft &#8211; about 1 and a half hours. Allow to cool. Cut the lemons in half and scoop out the roasted flesh into a sieve (removing any seeds). Using a spoon, scrap the white pith off the remaining lemon peel. Discard the pith and chop the remaining lemon peel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In a food processor, combine the chopped zest, strained flesh and juice, mustard an garlic. Process into a smooth puree. Add the olive oil through the feed tube. Taste for sweetness and seasoning. Add any salt, sugar or pepper needed.</div>
