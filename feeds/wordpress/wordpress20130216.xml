				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_292" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://nikalikesmaps.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/signs.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-292" alt="A photo that I took in the center of Bordeaux at Place Gambetta ." src="http://nikalikesmaps.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/signs.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A photo that I took in the center of Bordeaux at Place Gambetta .</p></div>
<p>When you enter a small get together and know almost no one, you are &#8220;the other.&#8221; When everyone is on the same page, and you&#8217;re behind, you&#8217;re &#8220;the other.&#8221; When everyone knows the lyrics and you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re &#8220;the other.&#8221; And when you find yourself wandering in a country where everyone but you knows the language and the culture, you are, surely, &#8220;the other.&#8221; Only in this case, you can&#8217;t simply get to know the small party of mutual friends, or read ahead when you have a free minute, or memorize the lyrics. So, now what?</p>
<p>Now you wait. Wait and live and learn. You can&#8217;t possibly think you&#8217;ll fit in. You&#8217;re like an ice cube in a pot of boiling water: same substance but from different environments. Only humans aren&#8217;t as pure as water. We are more complex, and while the ice cube will become one with the boiling water, a foreigner will always have those moments where he or she feels a bit different. Even those who immigrated at a young age might feel displaced at times.</p>
<p>Now, what does this have to do with studying abroad? Study abroad students are the foreigners, they are &#8220;the others.&#8221; And like any foreigner, when someone feels &#8220;out of their comfort zone&#8221; (as many people like to call the feeling when recounting their abroad experiences), they are actually doing two things: 1) learning about another culture, and 2) understanding their own culture.</p>
<p>I have recently come to realize that if you grow up in a society, you might not know how rooted in it you really are. Sure, there are certain things you don’t agree with and that you detest, but they are familiar. You may know what is polite, what is unacceptable, and when to say “excuse me.” You know how to exist there. Living in a foreign town, you may see just how rooted you are in your culture. But you realize this through another one. In other words, being “the other” might just help you learn about “the self,” yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_937" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 307px"><a href="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/76003136.jpg"><img class="wp-image-937     " title="76003136" alt="" src="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/76003136.jpg?w=297&#038;h=176" width="297" height="176" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Great Plague of 1665. Crosses mark the doors of the infected and guards prevent anyone from leaving the houses. On the left, female searchers with staffs visit the houses of the dead. In the centre, a person kills a dog, believing it to be the cause of the epidemic.</em></p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:normal;">One could hardly imagine a more vile job than examining the putrid, bloated remains of diseased corpses during the early modern period. Yet that is exactly the task that befell the ‘searchers’ of the dead beginning in the 16th century. Who were they? And why do we know so little about them today?   </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The searchers are the silent voices behind one of the most important documents on mortality rates in early modern London: the Bills of Mortality. Begun in 1592 as a way of monitoring outbreaks of plague, the Bills of Mortality quickly became a weekly publication which detailed both the number of dead in each parish as well as the cause of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The office of the searcher was typically filled by elderly female pensioners in each parish. During this period, church bells tolled alerting the searchers that a death had occurred.  Once the body had been examined, and the cause of death determined, the searchers then reported their findings to the parish clerk where it was then recorded in the Bills of Mortality.</p>
<div id="attachment_3007" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 256px"><a href="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3007  " alt="Bills of Mortality form February 21 -28, 1664. A plague free week. " src="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/1.jpg?w=246&#038;h=346" width="246" height="346" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em> Bills of Mortality form February 21 -28, 1664. A plague free week.</em></p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The searcher’s job was certainly unpleasant, but it could also be dangerous. In 1665, Widows Briggs and Manton were appointed searchers and paid 2 shillings a week for inspecting plague-ridden corpses in St Dunstan in the West.<a href="#f1"> [1]</a> During outbreaks when high volumes of people were dying, searchers would walk through the dank, dirty streets shouting: ‘Bring out your dead!’ Those who had succumbed to the disease were piled in carts and carried off to mass burial pits outside the city’s boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Little is known about the individual lives of these women, but it is not difficult to imagine that some of them contracted diseases as a result of their roles as parish searchers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1768, the Quaker physician John Fothergill wrote: ‘These searchers are, for the most part, ignorant poor women’ with no medical training whatsoever.<a href="#f1"> [2]</a> Perhaps because of this, peculiar causes of death were recorded in the Bills of Mortality: horseshoehead, stoppage in the stomach, twisting of the guts, eaten by lice, and rising of the lights are but some of the strange descriptions that appear periodically in the publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That said, it is worth remembering that medical diagnoses could often be  varied and inconsistent during this period; and it is not to say that contemporary physicians would have been any better at certifying causes of death than the searchers.<a href="#f1"> [3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The searchers’ role in compiling the Bills of Mortality has remained somewhat hidden in history. In 1662, their reputation came under attack by Britain’s first demographer, John Graunt. Because they were elderly pensioners, he questioned their susceptibility towards bribes, especially with regards to recording deaths caused by venereal diseases.</p>
<blockquote><p>Foreasmuch as by the ordinary discourse of the world it seems a great part of men have, at one time, or other, had some <i>species</i> of this disease [syphilis], I wondering why so few died of it&#8230;<a href="#f1"> [4]</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Graunt was suspicious of their qualifications. Although women were ‘traditional caretakers of the body’ and granted ‘certain expertise in funeral matters’, they were distrusted as public agents.<a href="#f1"> [5]</a></p>
<div id="attachment_3012" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 263px"><a href="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/11.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3012      " alt=" Plague pit, London. " src="http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/11.jpg?w=253&#038;h=169" width="253" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em> Plague pit, London. </em></p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of Graunt’s baseless accusations, the searchers have melted  into the background of history while their legacy—the Bills of Mortality—remains a highly visible reminder of the past in which they lived.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the questions around the validity of their recordings, the searchers are undeniably an important part of what we know about death and disease in the early modern period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that, their silenced voices speak volumes about historical perceptions of women in roles of authority.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_97" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://virtuoussociety.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/obama-mw.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-97 " alt="Last night Pres. Obama proposed a federal minimum wage of $9/hr." src="http://virtuoussociety.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/obama-mw.jpg?w=300&#038;h=162" width="300" height="162" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Last night, Pres. Obama proposed a federal minimum wage of $9/hr.</p></div>
<p>A few posts ago I alluded to the fact that most economists <a href="http://epionline.org/studies/epi_minimumwage_07-2007.pdf">oppose rises</a> in the minimum wage, while non-economists in general support them. I&#8217;m not an economist. But I think we have to take economists seriously, just in case they know something we don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>During the State of the Union address last night, President Obama told Congress that he would like the federal minimum wage to be $9/hour, instead of $7.25/hour. His reasoning was that it isn&#8217;t right for full-time workers to earn less than $9/hr. That premise isn&#8217;t a bad one&#8211;I think we&#8217;d all like to see wages rise and the standard of living along with it. But the effect of the minimum wage isn&#8217;t generally to raise wages. What it tends to do is cause unemployment among unskilled workers. This is true especially for teenagers, who are new to the labor market and lack experience and skills. In the US, the minimum wage has also been shown to disproportionately hurt minority workers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the intuition behind it. Imagine the President had proposed raising the minimum wage to $40/hour. You, like just about everyone, would quickly write the idea off as ridiculous. And it would be. Obviously, the costs of employing people would rise so much that employers couldn&#8217;t afford it. They&#8217;d have to lay people off, starting with the least valuable employees&#8211;in other words, the ones whose labor isn&#8217;t worth more $40 to the company. But while not as drastic, minimum wages at any level work on the same principle. If the minimum wage were raised to $9/hour, then workers whose value to the company was less than $9/hour would over time lose their jobs, and companies would hire fewer low-skilled workers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sketched out a really simplistic model of the labor market. I don&#8217;t want to get into the involved, jargony theory behind why the minimum wage is thought to reduce employment. So here&#8217;s the empirical data. In 2008, David Neumark and William Wascher published a book titled &#8220;<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/minimum-wages">Minimum Wages</a>&#8221; that analyzed data from around 100 studies that included short-run and long-run data from many jurisdictions. They concluded that the minimum wage has a modest, but negative effect on employment, and that it especially makes it harder for teenagers and other new workers to find jobs. It has often been theorized that the minimum wage would delay entry into the labor market for new workers and reduce lifetime income for individuals, and the longitudinal data show just that. In other words, if you eventually want a high-paying job, your prospective employer wants you to have experience. But if you aren&#8217;t able to get experience because your base skills aren&#8217;t enough to justify a minimum wage, then the years you spend looking for a job will delay your wage increases throughout your whole life.</p>
<p>Others have analyzed the data since to check Neumark and Wascher&#8217;s findings. <a href="http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/workingpapers/157-07.pdf">One study</a> argues that Neumark and Wascher didn&#8217;t control enough for the differences in different geographic locations, and so the findings turn out a bit differently. But they also conclude that the minimum wage has a modest negative effect on employment which clearly outweighs any wage gains at the margin.</p>
<p>So when you hear voices from Congress (including some surprised Democrats) and the business sector arguing against this increase in the federal minimum wage, it probably doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t care about the poor. More likely is that they realize that the minimum wage is a well-intentioned but ineffective anti-poverty tool. A more effective way to promote a basic income would be simply to establish a basic income, via a negative income tax or earned income tax credits.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help myself from liking Pres. Obama, but I really hope the next president is more competent when it comes to economics, whichever party he represents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Made up of two halves,</p>
<p>the heart is divided by the septum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did the rift between us occur?</p>
<p>Left subclavian artery or aortic arch?</p>
<p>Perhaps the right atrium, always pulsing,</p>
<p>pumping out those feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or was it the oh so superior vena cava?</p>
<p>Most likely the inferior.</p>
<p>My inferior vena cava has always felt, well, inferior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all our history, your footprints</p>
<p>were all over my pericardium.</p>
<p>How could they not be</p>
<p>after confessing every heartbreak</p>
<p>every fear, every shameful secret?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And each triumph</p>
<p>when shared with you</p>
<p>more meaningful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you abandoned me</p>
<p>my left common carotid artery</p>
<p>bled out.</p>
<p>I was half a person</p>
<p>with half a heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I blame the septum.</p>
<p>Always divisive, controlling</p>
<p>what comes in and what goes out.</p>

<p>If, like me, you find yourself alone on Valentine’s Day, please do as I do &#8211; treat yourself well. As the spotlight shines down and reveals that you have yet to end your day looking into the eyes of your life’s love, or even that of a mere lover, use the day to look into yourself. And when you do, please do so with kindness. Fall in love with you.</p>
<p>It almost seems like a superfluous concept &#8211; to fall in love with one’s self. And yet, it is your self that will follow you wherever you go. It is yourself that will talk to you when no one is there. Your self will damn you. Your self will love you. The belief you have in yourself can cause you to crumble or it can cause you to reach unprecedented heights. The energy and perspective you put into you &#8211; you will receive from you in the form of inner knowing, conviction and peace.</p>
<p>On this day, instead of giving free rein to a mind that critiques and reminds us of our failures, come to peace with those moments when the outcome for which you had most hoped didn’t manifest. Think about giving yourself credit for having survived something that, at the time, felt like death. When you look in the mirror, instead of seeing the effects of time and stress, see a face that has viewed some of the ugliest of circumstances, and yet can radiantly shine when caught up in laughter. And when you look down at your body, try not to see those things that cause you disappointment. Try to remember that your body is giving you it&#8217;s very best, dependent upon what you are giving it. Furthermore, if your body is like mine, it has moved through hell and back, perhaps more than once. And when the time comes that you are confronted with your life’s love, they will see your beauty &#8211; because doing so is inherent to the nature of who they are. A divine love is divinely given, and thus sees the divine in us even when we falter and struggle to see it for ourselves.</p>
<p>Go easy on you. I would recommend that you take every day to treat yourself well. But if not, then please use tomorrow as a celebration of the love you are cultivating for you. Making peace with yourself. Loving your many attributes, thoughts, hopes and dreams is the beginning of the most important relationship one can have &#8211; the one we have with ourself. You will be with you during your greatest successes, your deepest disappointments and upon your final day. And if you are blessed to meet up with your life’s love, you’ll then be coming from a place not of insecurity, but of acceptance. You’ve accepted you, which will allow you to accept them.</p>
<p>I won’t deny that the favorable ending for tomorrow would be in front of a fire or wrapped in the arms of one’s lover. That would be my chosen route. But instead, I will endeavor to treat myself well. I will remind myself of my own beauty. My triumphs. My successes. My gifts. I will also spend the day spoiling me as I would wish to be spoiled by a partner. I will stop off and enjoy the taste of something delectable; its a fair assumption dark chocolate will be involved. I will peruse my favorite boutiques and I will allow my body to get pampered. Most of all, I will go easy on me. And my hope is that you go easy on you. Whether you are loved by many, loved by one or only loved by you &#8211; never forget &#8211; you are quite special.</p>
<p>Sane</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This week&#8217;s writing challenge on the Daily Post blog (www.dailypost.wordpress.com) is to describe a character from your life. Check out the challenge <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/weekly-writing-challenge-characters/">here</a>. This is my contribution.</em></p>
<p>I am twelve years old and I just woke up at Gido&#8217;s house. Gido is my grandfather and we will be spending the day together.</p>
<p>Gido slept on the floor all night, because that&#8217;s what he does. He lays on the hard floor in front of the television with a big body pillow and sleeps. I don&#8217;t ask why, but I think it has something to do with the war. Now that he&#8217;s older and has had more surgeries than anyone ever, and the scars to show it, I wonder why he still prefers the floor. Despite his many scars, he never complains about pain or the war. I don&#8217;t even know how he won his Purple Heart. He never talks about it.</p>
<p>In fact, he doesn&#8217;t talk much at all. He&#8217;s quiet, but observant. And handsome. Everyone says he&#8217;s handsome.</p>
<p>The first thing he does every morning, even when I am visiting, is feed the birds. He grabs a couple of slices of old bread and heads outside to the street.  I watch from the porch as he rolls the bread in his hands and walks backwards down the middle of the road, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs before him. I see the birds waiting patiently on the neighbors&#8217; rooftops for their breakfast. Hundreds of them looking for Gido.</p>
<p>He joins me on the porch and we watch the birds feast. We don&#8217;t talk much. Days with Gido are calm and quiet.</p>
<p>When I am with Gido, I get to take the public bus. Gido never learned how to drive. It&#8217;s just another thing that makes him different. He walks a lot, or takes the bus, or mom drives him around. Mom never complains about driving him where he needs to go because he was a single parent, and a good parent, when his wife died.  Mom respects him for that and loves and likes him. Mom was twelve when my grandmother died. The same age as me now. I wonder if I remind him of my mom when she was a kid.</p>
<p>Gido knows the bus driver since he often rides this route. They greet each other and Gido pays my fare since I don&#8217;t know how to ride the bus. Today we are going to the bank in the strip mall.  It&#8217;s not very far, but too far to walk.  We sit facing sideways.</p>
<p>People like Gido because he&#8217;s quiet. He only says things that are necessary, and he&#8217;s a good listener. He remembers what you tell him. Once, my aunt told him that she liked these pistachios he bought from the Syrian bakery, so he buys her a giant bag every Christmas, even though my aunt calls him our &#8220;gi-due&#8221; instead of &#8220;gi-daw,&#8221; the way we say it.</p>
<p>Sometimes he gets silly and sings wacky songs about buglers and the army and the moon and pretty ladies. He sings softly and smiles even when we roll our eyes and wonder if he&#8217;s crazy. He likes to play cards with his buddies at &#8220;the post&#8221; where the other Syrians and vets hang out, but he doesn&#8217;t drink and he quit smoking cold turkey in one day. He smoked a pack, wrote the date on it, and said it was the last pack he&#8217;d ever smoke. And it was.  But he still likes the company and the food at &#8220;the post.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we go places, we bring him with us. He is always gently pleasant, except for the two trips that he hated: apple-picking and off-roading over sand dunes. I can&#8217;t blame him though because apple-picking was exhausting, and the sand dunes were really bumpy and uncomfortable, even for me.  These are the only two times I&#8217;ve heard him complain.  He&#8217;s only human, after all.</p>
<p>We step off the bus and he shuffles his feet as we walk through the parking lot to the bank. He always shuffles his feet and he always wears black socks and shoes, and his one foot turns inward. My mom says my brother has that same foot and is a lot like Gido, but I don&#8217;t agree. My brother is annoying and Gido never annoys me.</p>
<p>We walk slowly. Normally, I have to walk fast, from here to there to everywhere, but Gido goes slow, and it&#8217;s a nice change. I breathe the air and realize the sun is warm today. I look up at him and see his face is tan, maybe from walking everywhere in the hot summer, or from his Syrian ancestry, or both.</p>
<p>He stops, looking at the pavement with his dark eyes. I follow his gaze and see a small doll. He bends down and picks it up and hands it to me. &#8220;If you go slowly and keep your eyes open you&#8217;ll find things,&#8221; he says. It&#8217;s not the first time he&#8217;s found stuff that way. Sometimes it&#8217;s old coins or bottle caps, keys, or flowers. He finds them because he takes his time and looks. I never wonder what he&#8217;s thinking when he&#8217;s quiet. I assume it&#8217;s none of my business, or he&#8217;s looking for stuff.</p>
<p>I hold the doll and she rides back on the bus with me. I tell myself to remember to always go slowly and keep my eyes open to find the treasures of the world. I look at the slow, simple, peaceful man sitting next to me and feel lucky that he&#8217;s my grandfather.  My Gido.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a humorous take on our affection for dogs and how they may have hypnotized the humans. Asimov fans of the Foundation series will recognize the &#8216;Mule&#8217; <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>The Mule was sterile.</p>
<p>Is that what you thought? That, when he died the random threat was over? You read the E<em>ncyclopedia Galactica</em> and assumed that was how things went? Ah, but emotions control the chemicals in the brain you know, and they in turn control the changes in the body. That is how it had always worked for the Mule. Emotional control was his tool and he used it to solve the problem with his body.</p>
<p>He knew he had two flaws, his inability to produce offspring and his jarring ugly physical appearance. The initial mutations must have induced parthenogenesis and subsequently, sexual differentiation. It was changing his appearance that proved tricky. There is no guarantee of conserving good looks,  and he wanted his offsprings to rule forever, over generations. Ultimately he made a choice.  He would alter the physical features entirely such that it would not resemble the humanoid form at all. He changed the limbs and added an extended coccyx, but he did not mess with the eyes. The eyes were important.</p>
<p>The control over the galaxy remained, though the inhabitants were not aware of it.  That was how he wanted it.  That was how he had managed to become the greatest conquerors the galaxy had ever seen. He was a random mutation himself, and he was born with the ability to reach into the minds of others and adjust their emotions. It was because of this that though he was ruthless, he did not have to kill or torture. The people he ruled over had once hated and feared him, but he had changed their emotional waves to adoration and respect for himself.  He had probed and felt emotional patterns of individuals and of masses, and he knew it to be true.</p>
<p>The Mule died a natural death but his progeny remained and bred and still rule over us. The mind control is oh-so-subtle. It is the soulful eyes that do it. They seem to look straight into your heart, but they  are actually probing your mind patterns and changing them till you feel the warmth of affection flood your senses.  The emotional adjustment inflicted is almost artistic . The behavioral pattern  and memories remain intact, the ‘adjustment’ works only to create affection and a willingness to please and obey orders.</p>
<p>They look at you and you are mesmerized, you take them home and look after them thinking you are the master, but then that is how they wanted it in the first place. Mind control so subtle that when you make them do ‘tricks’ you have not the faintest idea that it is they who have trained you to get them food. You are only a tool.</p>
<p>It is the eyes that do it, and also the extended coccyx, the tail. It wags and we move accordingly, in affection.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>P.S. i am under the control of a 3 month old labrador retriever. He has adjusted our mind patterns and is now part of our family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To anyone else she was just another old lady staring blindly in the general direction of the communal TV which was blaring out mindless daytime chat shows for its gathered audience. She wasn&#8217;t just any old lady though; she was Eleanor Craig, my grandma.</p>
<p>On first glance she was tiny and frail until her weary, watery eyes met yours in the doorway. The cloud of confusion slowly cleared from her pale blue eyes and was replaced by a sparkling of recognition. As you walked towards her, she appeared to grow, until her presence and welcoming smile filled the room. Arms outstretched as soon as you took your first step towards her, her hands beckoned you greedily into her embrace. A hug from Grandma was like no other. I swear it had medicinal properties. It seemed to wrap you into a cotton-wool world where only you and she existed, and no harm could come to you Despite her 5&#8217;2 frame, her soft, cushioned arms enclosed around your shoulders, dragging you into the crook of her neck. Once there, you were rocked from side to side and sang a ditty from her school days. It was comforting and magical; the world could never get you once you were with Grandma.</p>
<p>There was always something regal about Grandma when she sat in her chair. Her personality demanding the respect she had earned and deserved throughout the 94 years of her life. The straightness of her spine aligned perfectly with the back of the chair, hands often clasped in her lap as she listened eagerly to our stories, or crocheted the endless blankets that filled her cupboards &#8211; and ours. She wasn&#8217;t aloof, we were too poor to be aloof, her manner was affable and playful. Her dresses, conservative florals, were usually blue or purple and served as a blank canvas for the rest of her outfit. She made her mark through her accessorising; 3 or 4 set of plastic beads, bright, often clashing colours and a cardigan or two on a chilly day. brooches. Why choose one when you can wear all your favourites every day? And then there were her rings. Often a ring on every finger that told the story of her life. There was the engagement ring from the 19 year old soldier who didn&#8217;t make it back from the war; the engagement ring from Granddad Craig who at 9 years her elder, declared on the day he met her, she was the girl he was going to marry. The green plastic ring that came out of last year&#8217;s Christmas cracker but was kept for its colour. A colour that matched her crudely painted fingernails &#8211; or at least one or two of them. There was always a story.</p>
<p>It seemed perfectly natural for us to sit on the floor at her feet and memorise her poems. Looking up at her. It didn&#8217;t matter how many times we heard them or how many times she repeated herself. It was all part of the deal. All of us children and grandchildren would subconsciously surround her, hanging on her every word, laughing, teasing, looking up at her, looking up to her. We were protecting the family jewel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Jonah Lehrer gave the final address at the Knight Foundation’s <a href="http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/02/will-jonah-lehrer-discuss-his-journalist">Media Learning Seminar</a>. For an hour, he spoke about his journalistic <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/jonah-lehrer-2012-11/">transgressions over the course of the past few </a>years, which came to light over the summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/204005/jonah-lehrer-talks-about-plagiarism-at-knight-lunch/">He was paid $20,000 for his time. </a></p>
<p>What struck me the most wasn’t Lehrer’s robotic, characteristically arrogant speech, but one of the questions posed by a conference attendee. She stated flippantly that Lehrer’s plagiarism affected her less than a “typo on Wikipedia,” and didn’t understand why people expected public apology for something that didn’t specifically hurt them.</p>
<p>Alrighty then. Let’s talk about how Jonah Lehrer has hurt the journalism community. Come on, raise your hand if you’ve ever felt personally victimized by Regina George.</p>
<p>First of all, the public inherently trusts successful journalists, especially ones hired as staff writers for publications as reputable as <i>The New Yorker</i>. Should people be skeptical of everything they read? Yes! Please, be skeptical. Should readers have to wonder if every word written in a magazine they trust is a lie or a fabrication? Dear god, I hope not.</p>
<div id="attachment_256" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 437px"><a href="http://racheldoesscience.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-12-at-12-52-03-pm.png"><img class=" wp-image-256 " alt="A screencap from our furious twitter rampage " src="http://racheldoesscience.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-12-at-12-52-03-pm.png?w=427&#038;h=244" width="427" height="244" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A screencap from our furious twitter rampage</p></div>
<p>Lehrer was a public darling. I was never a fan of his writing (I found it over simplified and written with a cocky tone that rubbed me the wrong way) but I always appreciated how good he was at playing into what the mainstream wanted to read. To end up in a position like that and then abuse it is to tarnish public view of journalistic morality. Permanently.</p>
<p>Let’s get more specific, shall we? Lehrer wrote about science. Science journalists have another layer of public trust to navigate, because science has gotten a reputation for being confusing, boring, and elitist. It’s hard to get the public listening to you when you talk about science, and Lehrer had his finger on the pulse. So yes, I do feel that there’s something wrong with Lehrer ending up on a science journalism pedestal and then making shit up, pulling quotes out of thin air, and muddling facts so that they fit the narrative he knows will sell a book. Personally.</p>
<p>One more thing. Jonah Lehrer’s behavior was offensive to me. Specifically me. Me, and every other young, emerging science journalist. Do you know how unobtainable a staff position at The New Yorker is, especially for a science writer, in the age of dying print and literary cutbacks? I would cut out my own kidney if it got me a regular blog on Wired, let alone a longterm print contract. The respect, stability, and readership attached to that gig is the sort of thing I’m afraid to even dream of. Jonah Lehrer got it, and he abused it. He recycled old pieces. He copy and pasted from others’ work. He didn’t provide the content he was being paid to provide.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been caught, that job would still be his–and that would be one less staff position for a young science writer willing to actually write about science.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/02/jonah-lehrer-apologizes-surrounded-tweets-still-calling-him-plagiarist/62055/">Did tweeting live zingers</a> about Lehrer while he spoke make me feel better about what he’d done? Not really. Especially now that I know how much money he made for his lackluster public apology.</p>
<p><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel">Find a new playing field, Lehrer. The other kids don’t want you here anymore. </em></em></p>
