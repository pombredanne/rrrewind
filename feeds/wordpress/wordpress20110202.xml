			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://suzlipman.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/800px-groundhogday2005.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3954" title="Groundhog Day" src="http://suzlipman.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/800px-groundhogday2005.jpg?w=450&#038;h=337" alt="" width="450" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>Groundhog Day, February 2, has basically everything going for it that I love in a holiday &#8212; It marks a point in a season; it&#8217;s full of folklore and wisdom, superstition, ceremony, civic charm, mystery, agrarian history, and weather &#8212; and it was featured in perhaps my all-time favorite movie of the same name, which itself is a study in acceptance and inner calm while being outright hilarious in nearly every frame.</p>
<p>Altogether now: It&#8217;s Groundhog Day!</p>
<p>In an early morning ceremony today, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/02/AR2011020200882.html" target="_blank">groundhog Punxsutawney Phil</a> rose from his heated burrow at Gobbler&#8217;s Knob, PA, and signaled to his handlers that he saw no shadow today and accordingly foretold an early end to winter. Over the 125 years that the ceremony has taken place, Phil has seen his shadow 98 times and not seen it only 16, counting today. (Records don&#8217;t exist for every year.) The last time he didn&#8217;t see a shadow was in 2007. In 2008, the crowd booed the prospect of &#8220;six more weeks of winter&#8221;, as they no doubt would have today, when a smaller than usual crowd stood in the freezing rain to watch the ceremony.</p>
<p>The same article also notes that Phil&#8217;s &#8220;handlers&#8221; make the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/02/AR2011020200882.html" target="_blank">prediction</a> for him. What do we think of that?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008080;">How did the groundhog tradition get started?</span></strong></p>
<p>According to this excellent <a href="http://www.stormfax.com/ghogday.htm" target="_blank">Groundhog Day</a> site, German settlers arrived in the 1700s in the area of Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh, which had been previously settled by the Delaware Native Americans. The Germans celebrated Candlemas Day, originally a Medieval Catholic holiday to mark the mid-point between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere. The holiday also has roots in Celtic-Gaelic and Pagan cultures, where it is celebrated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbolc" target="_blank">St. Brigid&#8217;s Day</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbolc" target="_blank"> Imbolc</a>, and is a time of festival, feasting, parades, and weather prediction, as well as candles and even bonfires to mark the sun&#8217;s return.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbolc" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, the origin of the word &#8220;Imbolc&#8221; is &#8220;in the belly&#8221;, and among <a title="Agrarian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian">agrarian</a> people, Imbolc was associated with the onset of lactation of ewes, which would soon give birth to lambs in the spring.</p>
<p><a href="http://suzlipman.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/0202_groundhog_full_600.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6368" title="Groundhog Day" src="http://suzlipman.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/0202_groundhog_full_600.jpg?w=339&#038;h=400" alt="" width="339" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The German settlers of Pennsylvania put candles in their windows and believed that if the weather was fair on Candlemas Day, then the second half of winter would be stormy and cold. While this has always seemed counter-intuitive to me, this site explains the <a href="http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2010/02/02/the-science-of-groundhog-day/" target="_blank">science of Groundhog Day</a> and that cloudy weather is actually more mild than clear and cold. It makes sense, then, that the shadow would portend <a href="http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2010/02/02/the-science-of-groundhog-day/" target="_blank">six more weeks of winter</a>. (A lifelong mystery is solved.)</p>
<p>The English and Scottish had wonderful sayings to mark this occasion:</p>
<p>The serpent will come from the hole<br />
On the brown Day of Bride,<br />
Though there should be three feet of snow<br />
On the flat surface of the ground.</p>
<p>&#8211; Scottish saying<br />
(Note the serpent instead of the groundhog.)</p>
<p>If Candlemas be fair and bright,<br />
Winter has another flight.<br />
If Candlemas brings clouds and rain,<br />
Winter will not come again.</p>
<p>&#8211; English saying</p>
<p>Punxsutawney&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stormfax.com/ghogday.htm" target="_blank">first Groundhog Day celebration</a> was in 1886, and though other towns, particularly in the eastern U.S., have Groundhog Day ceremonies, none is nearly as famous as Punsxutawney&#8217;s. Some of this may lie with the groundhog&#8217;s official name, &#8220;Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators, and Weather Prophet Extraordinary&#8221;. Still more popularity, and tourists, have come as a result of the movie <em>Groundhog Day. </em>The first official Groundhog Day prediction in <a href="http://www.stormfax.com/ghogday.htm" target="_blank">Punxsutawney</a>? No shadow &#8211; early Spring.</p>
<p>This site has more information about the <a href="http://www.stormfax.com/ghogday.htm" target="_blank">groundhog</a> itself and about the <a href="http://www.stormfax.com/ghogday.htm" target="_blank">filming of the movie</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.gojp.com/groundhog/sequence.html" target="_blank">Groundhog Day movie</a> obsessive like me, you will enjoy this <a href="http://www.gojp.com/groundhog/sequence.html" target="_blank">site</a> that breaks down exactly how long Bill Murray&#8217;s character, Phil the Weatherman, experiences Groundhog Day in Gobbler&#8217;s Knob.</p>
<p>Shadow or no, here&#8217;s wishing you a happy remainder of the winter, a ceremony or two, a dash of lore and wonder, and a fruitful spring.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Official Google Blog, the tech company has <a title="Official Google Blog" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html" target="_blank">accused</a> Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine of stealing its search results from Google. Other sites reproduce search engine results all the time, though it&#8217;s probably bad form if not illegal to reproduce them without credit whatsoever. Of interest in all this is the way Google caught the miscreants: with made-up words.</p>
<p>The engineers at Google created about 100 made-up words and phrases that real users were unlikely ever to come up with on their own, such as <em>hiybbprqag</em>. They then caused Google to return one or two particular, recognizable results for each query, such as a seating chart for a theater in Los Angeles for the above word. Using computers with fresh installations of Windows, Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 8 browser, and the Bing Toolbar, they searched for the false words and phrases on Google and on Bing. After a few weeks, the exact results from Google started showing up on Bing. These words were not on the resultant pages themselves; the only pages on the entire Internet linking to these pages would have been those Google search results.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s operative theory is that Microsoft uses the Bing toolbar or something else to monitor what users are searching for, even on other search engines such as Google.</p>
<p>This high-tech method of catching copycats has some decidedly low-tech precedents. Dictionaries, encyclopedias and even maps have a long tradition of fictitious entries, both for the lexicographers&#8217; amusement and to provide evidence in case of copying. In 2005, it was leaked that the latest edition of the New Oxford American Dictionary had a false entry somewhere in the E&#8217;s. After quite a bit of detective work by a number of amateurs, the New Yorker <a title="New Yorker: Not a Word" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford" target="_blank">reported</a> that it had been discovered to be <em>esquivalience</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>esquivalience—<em>n.</em> the willful avoidance of one’s official responsibilities . . . late 19th cent.: perhaps from French <em>esquiver</em>, “dodge, slink away.</p></blockquote>
<p>After publication of the dictionary, the website dictionary.com fell for it, publishing the definition and citing <em>Webster&#8217;s¹ New Millennium</em> dictionary. (It&#8217;s not still up, sadly.) Such a fake entry, following the usage of the New Yorker article, has been termed a <em>Mountweazel</em>, after another such entry in the 1975 New Columbia Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>So it seems that Bing&#8217;s <em>esquivalience</em> made <em>hiybbprqag </em>a <em>Mountweazel</em>.</p>
<p><a title="Google blog" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html" target="_blank">Link</a> (Google blog)</p>
<p><a title="Mountweazel" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford" target="_blank">Link</a> (New Yorker article)</p>
<p><a title="Wikipedia: Fictitious enry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry" target="_blank">Extra credit</a> (Wikipedia entry for <em>Fictitious entry</em>)</p>
<p>1. It may interest you to note that &#8220;<em>Webster&#8217;s</em>&#8221; is not trademarked for dictionary names. Any old fool can call his dictionary that, and many do. Don&#8217;t ever start a speech with &#8220;<em>Webster&#8217;s</em> defines compassion as&#8230;&#8221; because you will look ignorant and hackneyed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://englishrussia.com/images/nerd_party/3.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Nerd Party" src="http://englishrussia.com/images/nerd_party/3.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="226" /></a>I talk about science at parties. Now, I know what you’re thinking – scientists don’t go to parties. Well, sometimes people invite us, and we try to behave ourselves as well as anyone else. The thing is, I often end up discussing evolution or genetics or any other aspect of science when I’m out in company. I don’t go out with an agenda to Spread the Word, but sometimes it just happens.</p>
<p>It can start in the most innocuous ways. Like the time I was in the garden of a friend’s house, and a guy, for some reason that must be related to a lull in conversation, said “Could my jacket <em>be</em> more red?”, to which two of us instantly replied, “Your jacket is orange”.&nbsp; I suppose in most circumstances the conversation would end there and we’d move on to something more entertaining. But that would be a different party.&nbsp; Now, I still maintain that the jacket is orange, and given my friend’s confident initial declaration, I doubt that he has changed his mind either.&nbsp; The interesting, and even <em>exciting </em>thing here is thinking about why we had distinctly different experiences of the same jacket.&nbsp; There’s only one jacket, so who is right? Is it red or is it orange? It turns out that that is a much more subjective question than you might initially think. Sure, the jacket reflects a particular wavelength of light which is unambiguously measurable, but the name we give to that colour depends on our <em>genes</em>.</p>
<p>An extreme and familiar example of this is colour-blindness, where an individual is missing one colour receptor gene, so that everything that falls broadly in the red-green part of the spectrum looks the same and gets just one name instead of two (or perhaps both names are used, but differently from the majority of people). But there are much less extreme examples of differences in colour perception that probably go unnoticed by most people most of the time.</p>
<p>Genes frequently vary but by quite small degrees – small changes that result in differences much less obvious than colour-blindness.&nbsp; We detect colour because proteins made by our colour vision genes react to particular wavelengths of light. We have three types of these proteins each sensitive to red, green or blue wavelengths. If your “red” gene is sensitive to a <em>slightly</em> different wavelength from mine (which is actually a quite common occurrence), then the colour that you perceive as pure red will be different from the one I perceive as pure red. It is differences like these that lead to two people disagreeing on the colour of the same jacket, not to mention the differences between the sexes in their genetic capacity to distinguish colours (women have more, but you knew that already), and all the neurogenetic differences that can lead to different processing of that same visual information by the brain.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating. And I hope the others at the party agreed, because they ended up listening to all that.</p>
<p>So, should I feel ashamed of myself for nerding-up my friends’ parties? Well, I think not. Not only is it actually interesting to talk about these things on occasion, but I believe that it is also<em> important</em> that there is a stronger culture of scientific reasoning and critical thinking.</p>
<p>If you disagree with me, then think of the MMR scandal. Some shoddy science led to a safety scare regarding MMR vaccines. The initial scare was widely reported, and fear is a very powerful emotion – many people stopped vaccinating their children. The vaccine uptake rates continued to drop even after subsequent research revealed the flaws in the initial study. The general public was ill-equipped to digest the scientific information, especially because it was, and still is, usually phrased in terms of probabilities and risk factors – these can sound frighteningly insecure.&nbsp; However, the real fright came from the outbreak of measles in populations that now had lower than necessary numbers of vaccinated individuals, and ultimately the first deaths of children from measles in Ireland and in the UK for over a decade.</p>
<p>The power of scientific knowledge often rests upon the understanding and acceptance of that knowledge by the wider public.</p>
<p>It’s good to talk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I generally think that meteorologists are akin to the Boy Who Cried Wolf, forever banging on and on about dire climactic conditions that never seem to materialize. Well, I should have believed them today! When I went to work (at about three this afternoon), the roads were clear and things just looked winter-ish.</p>
<p>At least I had the presence of mind to wear my fuzzy little boots! They let me out a half an hour early (at 10pm), and I ventured forth into winter’s raging fury. The weather peeps weren’t fibbing this time – my commute usually takes about twenty minutes ….it took me an hour to get home tonight.</p>
<p>To be honest, I doubted the sanity of choosing to even drive home pretty much the minute I turned out of the parking lot. There was zero visibility, the wind tearing sheets of snow over my windshield and across the roads. I was able to see about five feet in front of my car with any kind of reliability. And when I passed an unsheltered area, that dropped to zero – as though someone dropped a blanket over the windshield blocking out everything.</p>
<p>I inched home, slow and steady, trying my best to stay on the road, avoiding the massive drifts that popped like ninjas out of the swirling darkness. I finally made it back to the city proper, and the streetlights’ glow illuminated the changed world. I muscled my little trooper of a car into the parking garage, and buttoned and zipped and tugged and pulled all my winter gear into place.</p>
<p>And then I stepped out into the maelstrom. It stole my breath, the snow biting my cheeks – tiny razors flung from maddened skies. The drifts on the sidewalks were up past my knees, and I trudged home, marveling at the world gone white and shrouded and mysterious.</p>
<p>It was strange – I felt like the last girl alive. Below the rush of the wind, there was a hush. I’ve never seen the city all buttoned up this way. We live in Wisconsin – snow is par for the course, and we just tend to deal with it. But this? This was the kind of blizzard that I remember being awed by when I read about them in the Little House on the Prairie books. The drift in front of the apartment door was up to my thighs, and I had to kick my way in. It gave me enough time to read the memorandum that someone from the city had posted on the door telling tenants that this was considered a snow emergency, and that all cars must be parked in a lot or be towed, and that to venture out [essentially] was to take your life in your hands.</p>
<p>So, naturally, I skipped upstairs, changed my clothes, grabbed my camera, and went out exploring. I plunged through snow drifts up to my waist, my laughter torn away on the gusting wind. I made it all the way down to the river. The snow softened everything – no straight lines anymore, everything gone fuzzy and obscured. It was a brief reconnaissance – good sense kicked in when I couldn’t feel my hands anymore.</p>
<p>You just gotta have adventures when the opportunity for them drops, literally, onto your doorstep! Enjoy the fruits of my madcap mission!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://sinaiandsynapses.com/2011/01/14/wait-whats-my-sign-and-why-do-i-care-so-much/" target="_blank">I posted about our natural desire to want to &#8220;create&#8221; our identity</a>. The idea is that we want to be the ones in control of how we see ourselves, and when we are denied that opportunity, we&#8217;re likely to push back.</p>
<p>In the last few days, there have been several new articles about how Americans don&#8217;t want to be boxed in when it comes to our sense of identity. Sunday&#8217;s New York Times had an article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/us/30mixed.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=choose%20all&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1" target="_blank">More Young Americans Identify as Mixed Race,</a>&#8221; and author Susan Saluny notes that</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">[m]any young adults of mixed backgrounds are rejecting the color lines  that have defined Americans for generations in favor of a much more  fluid sense of identity. Ask Michelle López-Mullins, a 20-year-old  junior and the president of the Multiracial and Biracial Student  Association, how she marks her race on forms like the census, and she  says, “It depends on the day, and it depends on the options.”</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s not a surprise that young Americans want to choose how they present themselves in different situations, what <em>is </em>surprising is that when people <em>do </em>have a chance to embrace multiple aspects of their identity, they end up being significantly more creative. Author Jonah Lehrer explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">According to a <a href="http://www.jeffreysanchezburks.com/Jeffrey_Sanchez-Burks/Research_files/Psy%20Sci-Identity%20Integration%20and%20Creativity.PDF" target="_blank">study</a> led by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, people who describe themselves as both Asian <em>and</em> American, or see themselves as a <em>female</em> engineer (and not just an engineer), consistently display higher levels  of creativity.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the first experiment, the researchers gathered  together a large group of Asian Americans and asked them to design a  dish containing both Asian and American ingredients. In the second  study, they asked female engineers to design a new mobile communication  device. In both cases, subjects who are better able to draw on their mixed  backgrounds at the same time were more creative than those who could  only draw on one of their backgrounds. They designed tastier dishes and  came up with much better communication devices.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Because their different  social identities were associated with different problem-solving  approaches, their minds remained more flexible, better able to  experiment with multiple creative strategies.In contrast, Asian  Americans who felt that they had to “turn off” their Asian background in  an American setting – this is an example of “low identity integration” –  or  female engineers who believed that they had to be less feminine to  be effective at work, had a harder time drawing on their wealth of  background knowledge. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/the-advantage-of-dual-identities-a-case-study-of-nabokov/" target="_blank">Jonah Lehrer&#8217;s &#8220;Frontal Cortex&#8221; blog &#8212; &#8220;The Advantage of Dual Identities&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a clear reason why people with multiple senses of identity were more creative &#8212; they had started by needing to create their <em>selves</em>.  If we have to think about <em>who we are </em>&#8211; a most basic and fundamental question &#8212; in new and inventive ways, then we&#8217;ll be that much more likely to start thinking of programs, products, and situations in new and inventive ways, as well.</p>
<p>And that provides a great opportunity to the American Jewish community, which by definition, involves at least two aspects of our identity &#8212; &#8220;American&#8221; and &#8220;Jewish.&#8221; As Rabbi Elie Kaunfer notes in his book <em>Empowered Judaism</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">That Jews are increasingly unwilling to settle for a broad definition is a positive. Why? Because someone can no longer get away with telling you &#8220;I am Orthodox&#8221; (ed. note: or equivalently, &#8220;I am Reform&#8221;) and assume that you understand what kind of Jew she is. Instead, people are forced to explain <em>why </em>they practice in a particular way or <em>what</em>, specifically, they believe in. A world without convenient categories is a world that calls on people to take more ownership of the type of Judaism they want to practice in the world&#8230;It is a major step forward because it leads to a rich discussion about what being Jewish means in our richly textured, highly individualized, twenty-first-century lives. (Kaunfer, <em>Empowered Judaism</em>, 147-148)</p>
<p>Quite simply, creativity leads to ownership. Indeed, at a recent session to learn about community organizing (a  process <a href="http://bethelnw.org" target="_blank">Temple Beth El</a> is going through now), there was a line  that stuck with me: &#8220;People are  not transformed by what  they receive. They are transformed by what they  create.&#8221;</p>
<p>For better or for worse in our society, we get to create our identity. So the question is whether or not that&#8217;s the end of the discussion. Do we simply say, &#8220;This is who I am,&#8221; or do we go further and say instead, &#8220;This is who I am&#8230;and this is what I want to <em>create </em>with it.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before coming to Thailand, I considered myself a curry lover, and still do. I grew up eating Panang curry at home and have loved every variation of this Indian delicacy ever since. Back home, heading to <a title="Mt. Everest" href="http://www.mteverestrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Everest</a> in Evanston with the family and indulging in Indian food is always a treat. Even though you smell like an Indian restaurant for days and you all but have to roll me out of the restaurant, it is worth it every time.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that <em>Kaeng khiao wan</em> (literally translated to sweet green curry) is a staple at every Thai restaurant and green curry paste is as prevalent in a market as fresh coconuts. The first time I tried green curry I was surprised by the sweetness of the sauce. But something was off… How could I not like something made with Keffir lime leaves, coconut milk and Thai basil?</p>
<p>The only conclusion that I have made is that I am not a fan of Thai eggplant and Pea Aubergine (I will admit, I had no idea what this vegetable was the first few times I tried it). Both vegetables have a slight bitterness to them and when cooked, seem to forever keep their coarse, crunchy texture. I guess I am used to eggplant that melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://alexastuart.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/thai-eggplants.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-294" title="thai-eggplants" src="http://alexastuart.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/thai-eggplants.jpg?w=216&#038;h=144" alt="" width="216" height="144" /></a> <a href="http://alexastuart.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pea-aubergine.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293" title="pea aubergine" src="http://alexastuart.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pea-aubergine.jpg?w=240&#038;h=180" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I do not prefer green curry, the entire country of Thailand swears by it. So, if you have a recipe that you love for green curry, send it my way, I will always give something another try. Or better yet, next time you are out for Thai, order the green curry and make your own conclusions about this famous Thai dish!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagesca9qr6bq.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-412" title="imagesCA9QR6BQ" src="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagesca9qr6bq.jpg?w=276&#038;h=183" alt="" width="276" height="183" /></a>One month into the WordPress PostaDay 2011 challenge…31 Days and approximately 18,000 words later…I’m still going strong!</p>
<p>I had no real idea of what to expect when I signed up for this challenge.</p>
<p>My original intention was to learn how to set up my blog and to post a simple daily celebration message. </p>
<p>I asked my lovely daughter (who works in web design) to help me set it up and was met with the usual response of; <strong>‘Oh mum…why don’t you just read the instructions on the Word Press site…after all &#8211; that is what they are there for!’</strong></p>
<p>Of course she was right – and this is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>I had been hoping that she would have given me a crash course on the subject, led me through some short cuts and shared some trade secrets with me &#8211; instead of forcing me to plough through so many complicated instructions (for a technophobe like me anyway!)</p>
<p>With no other choice, I settled down with said instructions and spent a few days learning what I needed to do to set up a basic blog. While everyone else around me was sleeping off the excesses of their New Year’s Eve celebrations; I was writing my first post.</p>
<p>Pressing the ‘publish’ button, I felt like I was pressing the button on a whole new adventure. I was excited…and terrified…in equal measure!</p>
<p>I was now officially a ‘Blogger’ &#8211; and part of a whole new world!</p>
<p>Apart from a few loyal friends – bless you all – I had no idea whether anyone would even want to read my posts&#8230;let alone feel moved enough to leave me a comment…or subscribe to my blog.</p>
<p>I was amazed to find that within the first few days the blog had an energy and a life of its own. To discover that comments were being left by people from all around the world was such a thrill!</p>
<p>One month on and I’m even more excited to see how this journey is going to unfold over the coming year.</p>
<p>I am determined to succeed in this challenge; even more so now that I realise just how huge an undertaking this is going to be.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge is not the actual writing, as this is a real pleasure and brings me great joy. It is my time management skills – or lack of them – that are proving to be my greatest adversary.</p>
<p> <a href="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagesca5y19an.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413" title="imagesCA5Y19AN" src="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagesca5y19an.jpg?w=293&#038;h=172" alt="" width="293" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m happily sitting at my laptop for hours on end &#8211; writing or researching my next post, reading other blogs, clicking through to links for recommended websites, responding to comments, obsessively checking the stats to see if anyone has visited during the previous 10 minutes(!), or exchanging ideas with other bloggers…</p>
<p>…the rest of my life is beginning to fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>Letters and paperwork are growing into large piles; my inbox hasn’t been cleared for weeks; my social life is taking place mainly on line; my ‘to do list’ is growing longer by the day and I’ve not seen my bed before 3am for ages!</p>
<p>I need to get on top of this and put some discipline into this process. I am addicted…and need to do a <strong>‘blog detox</strong>’.</p>
<p>Trouble is &#8211; my blog has become my <strong>‘blog baby’</strong> and I want to nurture and <a href="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagescax978is.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-414" title="imagesCAX978IS" src="http://1961girl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/imagescax978is.jpg?w=223&#038;h=167" alt="" width="223" height="167" /></a>protect it above all else (or maybe I should just buy a kitten – much lower maintenance!)</p>
<p>What has truly delighted and surprised me has been connecting with so many lovely people from all around the world.</p>
<p>The blogger community is a wonderfully supportive one and whenever one of us has been flagging &#8211; or losing momentum &#8211; someone always steps up with words of support and encouragement to keep us on track.</p>
<p>I have learnt so much over the past few weeks and my world has opened up overnight. I’ve joined a community of people who really care about each other and it feels so good to be here.</p>
<p>From <strong><a href="http://whatsbuggingmetoday.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Classy Rose’s</a></strong> wonderful blogging tips and easy to understand technical know how; <strong><a href="http://joejimgregory.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Papa Joe’s</a></strong> warmth and gloriously simple words of love and wisdom; <strong><a href="http://eof737.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Eliz’s</a></strong> daily posts of mirth and motivation; to <strong><a href="http://pigletinportugal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Piglet’s</a> </strong>‘toilet’ humour and fantastic photos…each of you…and many others who’ve stopped by to say ‘hello’ along the way … have brought so much joy into my life that I don’t know how to thank you.</p>
<p>You have all freely given of yourselves and for whatever you have chosen to share with me, I am truly grateful. Blogging has brought me a wealth of unexpected gifts and I look forward to continuing my journey with you all.</p>
<p>I may well be sitting here in a year’s time with my neglected house falling down around my ears, suffocating under piles of dirty laundry, gazing wistfully at food that has become fossilized and looking in the mirror with waist length hair turned completely white…but if I still have my laptop and my blogging friends to nurture and sustain me…I will know that it will have been a year well spent.</p>
<p>Now that will be a real cause for celebration!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Day 31 – 365 Days of Celebration</span></strong></p>
<p>Today I am celebrating the gift that is this wonderful blogging community &#8211; I am so proud and humbled to have been invited to join you all. Thank you for making me so welcome.</p>

<p><a href="http://nolafemmes.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/my-hipstaprint-0.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2992" title="My HipstaPrint 0" src="http://nolafemmes.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/my-hipstaprint-0.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I have a confession to make. A book lover’s confession. The kind of secret that could get me thrown out on my ass in certain bibliophilic circles around the city. I can’t stand William Faulkner, and before last May I had never attended even one book club gathering. That’s two confessions. Let’s stick with the second and just let the first one exist. (Although, I have to say here that Faulkner is the inspiration behind one of New Orleans&#8217; <a href="http://www.wordsandmusic.org/">best annual literary festivals</a>.)</p>
<p>Last May I started working at <a href="http://www.gardendistrictbookshop.com/localinterest">Garden District Book Shop</a>, one of the oldest and quirkiest independent book stores in New Orleans. (You just try and figure out how we organize our shelves. There’s logic to it, I swear!) An absolutely wonderful woman named Deb MacDonald had run the book store’s monthly book club for the last fifteen years, and due to unavoidable circumstances, she could no longer. She asked me to take over. If you were ever lucky enough to have met Deb MacDonald in her many capacities as book lover and reading promoter throughout New Orleans, you know there was no way I could tell her no.</p>
<p>I have to admit skepticism on my part at first. Many of these women had been attending this book group for the entirety of its fifteen-year existence. They’d formed friendships, deep attachments to one another, and certainly to Deb. I worried they wouldn’t accept me. I worried over what we would talk about. I’d attended dreadful lectures in the past where an overbearing audience member forced a writer to defend the moral choices of a character. Would we spend most of our time talking about our personal lives? What if they picked terrible books? And what was the role of a book club leader anyway?</p>
<p>What I encountered was a large group of incredibly intelligent and well read women who opened their circle of fold out chairs to me so that we could sit together and discuss our shared passion: books. In small and unrecognized ways, these women seem to me the backbone of the city. They are lawyers, artists, librarians, editors, teachers, and writers. Many have spent their lives in New Orleans, and many others have transplanted themselves and adopted this place as their own.</p>
<p>We’ve never unanimously agreed on a book, and I’d probably fall out of my chair in shock if we did. But we’ve consistently <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780312429980">read incredible books</a> I may have not picked up on my own. Whatever our opinions, we defend them in the circle with fire. During the best meetings, we change one another’s minds, broaden perspectives, shift ways of thinking. We also do a lot of laughing.  And just a tad bit of drinking afterward. It is, after all, a book club. In New Orleans.</p>
<p>I’ve come to think that perhaps this book club wasn’t a great introduction to the world of book clubs. If my time with it ends, my expectations of my next book club are now so high they can’t be met. This book club has offered me a community unlike any other. While it is similar to the MFA program I’ve attended in terms of a deep love for writing, the book group allows for a unique dynamic of such disparate individuals to come together and share a reading experience. There is a beauty in this that I didn’t expect.</p>
<p>I know throughout I’ve kept saying women. We just haven’t had any men in our book group yet, but we would certainly welcome them. And we always welcome new members. You can join us every second Wednesday of the month at 6:00 inside <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;cp=12&amp;qe=dGhlIHJpbmtuZXcgbw&amp;qesig=woh_BfaTY000q6nsXRImqA&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tnomAn_PBan-UWWyxWUpMibgTSgXy5S5ddw2XqTApWn60-uJmi_ucOJiPLloBzy1Nbs-9FO5BOtWio1LjPgYQrZSusEfA&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+rink+new+orleans&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=the+rink&amp;hnear=New+Orleans,+LA&amp;cid=0,0,6932395425901020205&amp;ei=BlRJTdaJMIWRgQfMy5kC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBgQnwIwAA">The Rink at the corner of Washington and Prytania</a>. We always like seeing fresh faces. Or, there are <a href="http://www.octaviabooks.com/reading-groups">other book clubs</a> you could check out around town. You could also always start your own. I highly recommend it. A book club engenders deep friendships where there is always something interesting to talk about.</p>
<p>Do you all belong to book groups? Have they been good experiences?</p>
