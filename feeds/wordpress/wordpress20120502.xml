			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lookingforthesweetspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/the-wave.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-503 alignleft" title="the wave" src="http://lookingforthesweetspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/the-wave.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300" alt="" width="214" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I like <strong>The Wave</strong>.  I want <strong>The Wave</strong>.  I want to kick the person’s butt who denies me <strong>The Wave</strong>.  Do you know of what I speak?   I am not talking about that thing in the sports stadiums that makes you get off your behind, flail your arms like a Muppet on crack, and spill stuff.  I am talking about that little acknowledgement you get from a fellow driver on the road.  The simple hand gesture that can say “please”, “thank you” or just “I acknowledge you exist”.  <strong>The Wave</strong>.</p>
<p>Never gave it much thought?  Well, neither did I.  That is, until The Wave was gone. (Feel free to hum a few bars of “Don’t know what ya got, ‘til its gone”, I did)…</p>
<p>Even during my 10 years in LA, where driving is sometimes like something out of a Mad Max movie (only without Tina Turner riding shotgun), you can still get The Wave – and I don’t mean the one where the middle finger is prominent (although, that one is generously given as well). I am talking about a true and significant appreciation Wave, enough, at least, to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>But then, I moved to New Orleans.  Now (disclaimer coming), New Orleans is a <em>great</em> city, with many wonderful attributes and people – boy, do they know how to throw a party. However, when it comes to The Wave, they are a big, fat void.  In my 5 years living there, no matter how hard I tried, begged, frantically waved, offered beads and occasionally even a boob flash (ok, not that one) I could never illicit a return or acknowledgement Wave in any way, shape or form.  And, I missed The Wave, desperately.</p>
<p>However, our next big move was to the Mid-West.  And, much to my pleasant surprise, Mid-Westians (Mid-Westers?) really know how to work The Wave.  You know how the Eskimos have <a title="Inuit words for snow" href="http://www.mendosa.com/snow.html" target="_blank">100+ words </a>to express “snow” related things?  Well, that is how prolific Mid-Westians are with The Wave.  I kid you not (‘cause that would be so unlike me).  Here are just a few that come to mind:</p>
<p>The “Thank You” Wave.</p>
<p>The “No problem” Wave.</p>
<p>The “Go ahead, I’m in no hurry” Wave.</p>
<p>The “Sorry I did not see you there” Wave.</p>
<p>The “That’s Ok” Wave</p>
<p>The “Thanks for not honking at me even though I deserve it” Wave.</p>
<p>The “Sorry to make you wait while I cleaned up the juice my kid just spilled” Wave. (followed by…)</p>
<p>The “I can see that you are stressed and I won’t make it worse by honking at you” Wave.</p>
<p>The “We are just two cars passing on a country road” Wave.</p>
<p>The “I’m cool” Head-Wave.</p>
<p>The “I’m even cooler” Chin-Lift Wave.</p>
<p>The “I don’t want to take my hands off the wheel but want to greet you” Finger-Lift Wave.</p>
<p>The “You are welcome to pass my slow farm vehicle” Wave.</p>
<p>The “I’m sorry I was just a dork for cutting you off/getting in your way” Wave.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I possibly overuse this wave and therefore often receive back…</em></p>
<p>The “Never mind, it is ok that you are a dork” Wave.</p>
<p>The “Hello fellow truck owner” Wave<em> (hubbys favorite)</em></p>
<p>The “I won’t smile at you but will still acknowledge you exist” Wave<em> (my visiting Mom’s Fave).</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>And the truly unique, from my elderly pedestrian neighbor…</em></p>
<p>The “I am too involved in what I am doing to look up at you but here is my hand” Wave.</p>
<p align="center"><em>To which I always respond with…</em></p>
<p>The “I know you can’t see it but I will reciprocate anyway” Wave.</p>
<p>I love them all. Who knew such a small thing could speak volumes when silenced.  There are many things in life I can definitely live without – <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">coffee </span> a 2nd cup of coffee,  an ab six-pack, shoulder pads, another social network, <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> <strong><em>Part 3.  </em></strong></p>
<p>But The Wave?  No, I know now, I need The Wave.</p>
<p>In fact, I <em>deserve</em> <strong>The Wave</strong>.</p>
<p>And so do you.</p>
<p>So, if you are ever out Mid-West way, look for me.  I’ll be the one giving you</p>
<p>The “Nice to see you ‘round these parts” Wave.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally Posted March 11, 2012</p>
<p>Who loves having extra cash in their pockets? I know I do! That&#8217;s why I try to save as much as possible on anything I buy. There are many ways to save money, but not everyone knows where to begin. As consumers, our best interest is to spend less to get more. My goal for this article is to help you find new ways in saving money that you may not have thought of. With that extra money, you could spend it on buying something else or put it in your savings account. But be wary: most of these methods require some time and dedication. So if you need something in a hurry, you probably won&#8217;t be able to save much.</p>
<p>Remember: you may have different methods and these may not work for everyone. I just wanted to present my ideas on what works for me, not tell you what to do. So please take into consideration your knowledge and your situation before you do these.<span id="more-82"></span></p>
<h1>Key Points</h1>
<p>I want to start off by revealing my &#8220;secrets&#8221;, or the tools I use to find good deals. After that, I&#8217;ll get into some common categories that you can save money at.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Just ask</span></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with the hardest one: asking for a deal. A lot of consumers are afraid to ask or even bring up the topic of getting a discount or a deal on an item because they are either afraid or don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth it, think about this: your usual cable/internet bill is $100.00/month. You end up calling your cable company and get your price lowered to $80.00/month, keeping the same services. So now you are saving $20.00 every month, and you can do whatever you want with that money. Now, in this sense, some people still might think it&#8217;s not worth it to call and spend 20 minutes just to save 20 dollars. It&#8217;s a hassle. But it adds up. The 20 dollars in savings every month ends up being $240/year. Not bad, right? Now, the reason I chose cable and internet as an example is because most people need these in their everyday lives (internet more so than cable). So this &#8220;savings&#8221; won&#8217;t go away after just a few months or years. In 5 years, if you keep doing this, you&#8217;ll end up having an extra $1200 in your pocket. Think of everything you can do with that money!</p>
<p>Now, for those that are afraid, there is nothing to be afraid of. The worse they will do is say no. They won&#8217;t cut your service off, increase your fees, or yell at you (although if they do, you can report them for doing so). So what exactly are the risks for asking to save money? There are none! You have everything to gain, and nothing to lose. Why? Because you&#8217;re the customer with money and they want your business. They will usually do whatever it takes to keep your business. They would rather take a $10/month loss rather than not having your business at all, and losing out on $100/month. And if they do say no, remember that each representative that you speak to is different. Feel free to call again and see if you have better luck with someone else.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Patience</span></h2>
<p>This may not be something you can always do, but patience is one of your best friends. I have learned to live with what I have until I find a deal that is worth it. When I was upgrading my sound system, I didn&#8217;t buy all of my devices at one time. I already had a 5.1 system with a decent receiver, but it was very old. I remember buying my front 2 speakers first, the center speaker next, then the 2 rear speakers, and finally the receiver (I didn&#8217;t bother replacing the subwoofer because the one I have is good). It took me about 3-4 months to finally get everything, but I ended up saving a few hundred dollars in the process because of the sales that went on and the coupons I had received.</p>
<p>For my TV, I knew exactly what I wanted and how much I was willing to pay. I looked online to see if I could find any deals and I even visited my local stores. I went to Best Buy each week, because they would have new sales every Sunday, and some of these were cheaper than buying the TV online. After about 4 weeks, I found the TV I wanted with the price I would pay for it.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Manners</span></h2>
<p>This is something I cannot stress enough: be nice! Don&#8217;t forget that whomever you are talking to are also human, just like yourself. Do you remember the old rule: treat others the way you want to be treated? Well, it definitely applies here. Will it work every time? No, but you have a better chance of it working in your favor. In my experiences, I&#8217;ve learned that being polite is one way that I can get better deals. Who knows, you could be that one person that turns the representatives day around, and they may be willing to work with you more just for cheering them up. And if they can&#8217;t help you, don&#8217;t be rude and get angry. It&#8217;s ok. Just say &#8220;Thank you for your time&#8221;, and call it a day. Try again tomorrow with someone else.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Look Around/Price Match</span></h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to look around at different stores or internet retailers. Look to see what the prices are at each store before you decide to make a purchase. If you are looking online, don&#8217;t forget to add taxes and shipping/handling to your final cost. Amazon and NewEgg might have the same product at the same price, but if Amazon is giving you free shipping, then in the end that is who you should go to.</p>
<p>I tend to shop at Best Buy if possible because of the RewardZone program ($5 back for every $250 spent). But I only buy something if it&#8217;s the cheapest there. I&#8217;m not going to sacrifice price just so I can get points. This is where price matching comes in. Many times, as long as there is a competing store in the same or nearby city, they will be willing to price match. So for myself, if I see a TV on sale at my local Sears in which the price is lower than Best Buy, I would go in and ask the Best Buy employee to match it. If they do, I&#8217;ll purchase it from there. Not only that, I would use my RewardZone membership to get the points, hoping to get a few $5 certificates in the end. If they don&#8217;t price match, then I would buy it from Sears instead.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#808080;">Payments &#8211; Cash vs. 0% Interest</span></h2>
<p>Credit cards are very convenient for consumers, as it allows you to make purchases without actually having the cash on-hand. You can go on for a month without even thinking about making a payment. No worries, right? Well, for the most part I agree. It&#8217;s great, but only if you can pay it back at the end of the month. Once those interest rates start to take effect, you&#8217;ve pretty much lost the purpose of spending time to save money.</p>
<p>The best way to make purchases is just to pay it with cash if possible (my next subsection will talk about credit cards that give you points). This is the easiest way to save money in the long run, especially if you are the forgetful type. Many cardholders lose a LOT of money on interest rates every month, and this is one way how the credit card companies make money. If you have the cash, use it to just pay it and forget about it. The item is yours, no more payments to be made on it. You know the final price and you are done.</p>
<p>Now, there may be items that you may want that are just a tad more expensive than you can afford in one go. Many places do have their own credit cards that you can open and offer some good financing. But you should not wait until the last minute to decide whether you want to do this or not (ex. deciding to open a new credit card at the register after the cashier tells you about it). You can get information about the credit card offers on each retailer website, along with the terms and conditions. Be sure to check up on any yearly fees. Some credit cards charge to have the line of credit open (with some being as much as $100/year). It is not worth it.</p>
<p>When I bought my entertainment center equipment, I did open up a Best Buy credit card. It wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t have the money, but I didn&#8217;t want to spend all that money at one time. The card offered me one to three years of no interest (dependant on the total cost), as long as I continued to make payments. With everything I bought, I ended up with three years of no interest. What I ended up doing was calculating my payments so that I could pay it off in half the time (1.5 years). This gave me enough time to pay it without having to worry about hitting the three years. If I had an emergency during one month, I could pay less and continue my payments the following month. During tax return seasons, I usually paid a bit more to get it paid off even sooner.</p>
<p>You may be wondering: what happens after you hit the three years and you still haven&#8217;t paid off the balance? You start paying interest on whatever is left, right? WRONG! On your credit statement, no matter what retailer/credit card company you go to, there should be a section that shows your &#8220;Deferred Interest&#8221;. This is interest that you did not have to pay because of the three years no interest (or whatever it may be). If you don&#8217;t finish paying your balance in that time span, that deferred interest will get added to your balance, and you&#8217;ll end up paying for it. That means instead of saving money, you will have just paid even more. Also, be sure to pay the minimum payment for each month, because if you miss even one payment, your promotional &#8220;No Interest&#8221; terms will be gone, and you&#8217;ll have to pay for the deferred interest as well.</p>
<p>Finally, once you open up a line of credit, don&#8217;t close the account after you&#8217;re finished with it (unless there are fees associated with it). Opening and closing a credit account can hurt your credit score. Instead, let it sit open, even if you are not going to be using it. This will help your credit in two main ways: your average length of credit will increase and your overall open credit amount (the amount of available credit you have on your credit line) will be increased. Both of these will increase your credit score. If you&#8217;re afraid that you may start using the card because you have it, lock it up somewhere. Put it in your lockbox at your bank or in a save at your house. Just don&#8217;t keep it with you. And be sure to check up on your account (either online or through your paper statements that they mail you) to make sure that your balance remains zero each month. By the way, don&#8217;t open up a credit account at every store you go to. This will hurt your credit. Keep the number of credit cards to a minimum if possible.</p>
<p>Having a credit card takes a lot of management, because if you don&#8217;t pay them on time each month, you&#8217;ll get charged fees and end up with higher interest rates. That is why this is only recommended to those that can manage their payments on time and understand what the consequences are if you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>Note: the above paragraphs are just suggestions and methods that I use myself personally. It&#8217;s completely up to you whether you want to get a credit card or not, whichever way works for you at saving money. If you don&#8217;t think you can handle being on time with your payments or be responsible with a credit card, then please do not sign up for one. It can only hurt you more than help.</em></p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Credit Cards &#8211; Rewards</span></h2>
<p>There are also other credit cards out there that give you points when you use them to purchase things. One of the main ones I use is my Chase Freedom card. I get 1% back for every purchase I made at the store. But because I also have a Chase bank account, I get an additional 10% on top of that 1% (1.10% total) and 10 points for each purchase. On top of that, every 3 months there are categories in which you can use your card on and you&#8217;ll get 5% instead. For example, for January through March, they could have gas stations and movie theaters as their categories. Each time you use your card in those places, you&#8217;d get 5% cash back instead of the usual 1% (up to $1500, after which will go back down to 1%). The one downside is that you have to sign up for the 5% categories every time they switch (so every 3 months, but it&#8217;s free). When redeeming points, you typically get $1 for every 1000 points. So $10 dollars for every 10000 points, which may seem like very little but it does add up after a few months.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a way for Chase to entice you into using their card. But if you&#8217;re like me and very careful, you can actually use the program to your benefit. Both my wife and I use our Freedom card to pay for our purchases, such as gas, groceries, eating out, etc. We make sure never to go over for that month in terms of how much we have in our bank account for spending purposes. At the end of the month, we pay the full balance and start over. It&#8217;s quick, easy, and we&#8217;re making money! And don&#8217;t forget that there may be services that you&#8217;re paying with your bank account that you can pay with your credit card for free. For example, we pay our cable bill, cell phone bill, and car insurance with our credit card. Those are some big bills that can help you get extra points.</p>
<p>We just started using this card recently, so we haven&#8217;t been able to redeem any points, but I did have a Chase Ultimate Rewards Debit Card I was using earlier (before they stopped giving rewards on Debit Cards). The points system was different, and they had a deal where you can pay $25/year to get 4 times as many points (which I did opt-in for). Doing this, I was making about $25 PER MONTH through rewards. I am not joking. Just for buying the things I would normally buy, I was getting paid. With those points, I was using them to get $25 gift cards to various retailers each month.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to visit your credit card website to see if they have partnerships with retailers. They may have links that you can use to purchase goods online instead of the usual website, offering more points. For example, the Chase Freedom credit card offers 10x points if you make purchases at HomeDepot.com and 5x points if you make purchases at Macys.com. Use these to your advantage as well!</p>
<p><em>Note (same as before): the above paragraphs are just suggestions and methods that I use myself personally. It&#8217;s completely up to you whether you want to get a credit card or not, whichever way works for you at saving money. If you don&#8217;t think you can handle being on time with your payments or be responsible with a credit card, then please do not sign up for one. It can only hurt you more than help.</em></p>
<h1>Cable/Internet</h1>
<p>Having an internet connection is almost a necessity nowadays, with everything starting to go online now. This is also one area that is fairly expensive, even more so if you add cable and a phoneline. But I&#8217;ve found that you can actually get a discount on these services, and all you have to do is ask.</p>
<p>I currently have an internet connection and cable service through Comcast. I&#8217;ve had these services for quite a while, and I&#8217;ve always managed to keep my prices low. I started off with a new customer special offer that lasted 6 months. At the end of my 6 months, my bill went up, almost doubling. So I went to the Comcast website and clicked on the link to speak with an online chat representative. Be aware that this could take up to 30 minutes, so be sure you have some time on your hands.</p>
<p>I politely told him/her that I couldn&#8217;t afford the new rates and that I&#8217;d be interested in a cheaper rate, but I will wanted to keep the same services that I currently have. Now, this has a 50/50 chance in working. If the representative is nice, they will take the time to find you a better rate. As I explained earlier, be nice to them. Remember they are not the ones that own the company; they are just working under them. They might have the power to help you, they might not. If they can&#8217;t help you, then politely thank them for trying and close the chat. You can then try again the following week and hope that the new representative will be able to help you. The nicer you are to them, the better chance you have of getting the things you ask for.</p>
<p>If everything was successful, you will have a special rate for the next 6-12 months. After the rate expires again, you&#8217;ll have to talk to them in order to reduce it for additional months. I have been doing this for the past 3-4 years and have yet to have them decline me on a better rate. They want my business, but I don&#8217;t always need their services (I can cancel my cable service and cut my bill in half if I wanted). In that way, I have a better chance of getting what I want. In fact, I had to call them just a few days ago because my rates had expired. I was able to get my bill down to the lowest it&#8217;s ever been in the past 5-6 years! I just looked at my new bill today, and I was amazed at how low my bill was. And all I did was ask.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed that you have a better chance of lowering your bill if you talk to them online than if you talk to them on the phone. One reason could be the tone you give out when you speak. When you&#8217;re chatting online, they don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;re mad, happy, scared, and so on. On the phone, if they hear that you&#8217;re angered, they themselves might get agitated and refuse to help you as much.</p>
<h1>Vehicles</h1>
<p>Here is a big purchase that can take a big chunk of your money, but you can have some savings if you&#8217;re careful. The ideas I&#8217;m about to present in this section are based on buying a new car. I don&#8217;t have much experience buying a used car or a lease, so I won&#8217;t be covering that (there are tons of ideas out on the internet if you search).</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Research</span></h2>
<p>As with every other topic I&#8217;ve covered so far (and will cover), researching what you want out of a vehicle and what everyone else is paying will help you out tremendously. If you already know what car you want, do a search online and look at some forums to see what other people paid for it. Keep in mind, however, that prices will increase/decrease depending on the location, but you&#8217;ll at least get a general idea of your min/max prices. Also take a look at what other consumers think of the car. Read about some of the positives and negatives about each car. If you buy a car that&#8217;s fairly cheap because you want to save money, but might need to be taken in for repairs because of on-going issues, you&#8217;re just going to end up spending more. Don&#8217;t go to the dealership until you get these questions answered.</p>
<p>Once you have a basic idea of what you want and how much you want to pay for it, then this is a good time to go to your local dealership. Any questions that you were not able to answer, the dealership should be able to answer them. Take a test drive of the car you want and make sure it&#8217;s comforting to you. You don&#8217;t want to drive a car that makes you feel awkward, especially since you&#8217;ll have this product for quite a while.</p>
<p>If you are serious about buying a car, be sure you go with a lot of time because you will want to negotiate the pricing. No matter the car (for the most part), you have the ability to negotiate with the sales person. Do your best to take the price down to what you want, but DO NOT tell them what you want to pay. The reason I say this is because if you have in your mind the price of $350/month that you want to pay for your car, they can easily work this out messing with the interest rates and the loan term (more on that later). Also, what if you could&#8217;ve bought the car for $320/month instead? Giving away what you want to pay will make you lose this advantage. So don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask about any promotions that they may have. One promotion that many people miss is the &#8220;New Graduate&#8221; discount. This seems to imply that you have to be straight out of college to get this discount, but many dealerships allow you to get it as long as you&#8217;ve graduated in the past few years. And it won&#8217;t hurt to ask, so why not? It could shave off $500-$2000 from the total price.</p>
<p>Also ask about their financing if you don&#8217;t have financing secured already. You always want to get the lowest interest rates, because paying interest will add up very quickly, especially on a big purchase such as a car. You might even be able to get 0% interest, if your credit is good enough.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Don&#8217;t go alone</span></h2>
<p>Try to go to the dealership with a friend or a family member who can stop you from making your purchase at any point. Someone you can trust and someone you can listen to. The reason I say this is because imagine you&#8217;re at the dealership and the car of your dreams is right in front of you. All you have to do is sign some papers, pay a down payment, and that car is yours. You might not care how much it costs each month, but you will once that first statement comes to your mail. And once you drive that car off the lot, it&#8217;s typically yours (although I think you can sell it back within 24 hours, but not 100% sure about this &#8212; not worth the risk).</p>
<p>You never want to get into this situation, so it&#8217;s nice to have someone take you to the side and have you think a bit about what you are about to do. Also, I&#8217;ve found it helpful in that your friend might think of questions or comments that you may not have thought of. Every little bit of information that you can get from your purchase will help you out.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Go to other dealerships</span></h2>
<p>Once you go to one dealership, and they give you an offer, that offer should last at least 24-48 hours before its considered invalid (and you have to start over again). Don&#8217;t feel pressured to buy at that point just because you think you have the best deal. Be sure to go around to the other dealerships, even if they&#8217;re outside your home area, and see what they can do for you. Mention what the previous dealership was willing to do, and they may give you an even better offer. Don&#8217;t be afraid to use the offers that you get from each dealership to your advantage. Although you may be going to a &#8220;Nissan&#8221; or &#8220;Toyota&#8221; dealership, each one is usually managed different by the manager. And they want you to buy a car from their dealership, not another one.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">It will take time</span></h2>
<p>When looking for cars, be aware that if you want the best deal, it&#8217;s going to take you some time to find it. Car prices are always changing and it doesn&#8217;t help that they are negotiable. You want to check as many places as you can. Each visit can last anywhere from 5 minutes up to a few hours, depending on how your conversation with the sales person goes. So be aware that if you&#8217;re planning on getting a car in the near future that you may want to start looking around a few months in advance.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Check the loan terms</span></h2>
<p>You found the car you want. All of your questions have been answered, you&#8217;ve test drove the car and now you&#8217;re ready to sign the papers and go home with it. The sales person takes you in, enters in your information for the financing and goes to the back to speak with the accounting office. He comes back and puts a paper down in front of you. The only thing it shows is your monthly payment, the loan term, and a dotted line for you to sign. What do you do?</p>
<p>If the monthly payment seems like something you want, you may be tempted to go ahead and sign the paper. But that is the last thing you want to do. The first thing to look at is the loan term. Is it for what you want, such as 5 years? Or is it longer? Sometimes, dealerships will give you a low price to lure you in but may fail to point out that the loan is for 7 years. In my experience, 5 years is the magic number you want to try to hit, if not lower. With 5 years, you&#8217;ll typically balance out on what you owe on the car and what the car is worth in the second or third year, which is what you want. With 7 years, you won&#8217;t hit that middle number until closer to four to five years. If something happens and you need to sell your car, you want to be as close to what you owe as possible. This will prevent you from having to owe the dealership any money when you sell or trade your car. Also, the longer you pay for your car, the more interest you will pay.</p>
<p>When you get your first offer, you&#8217;ll want to ask some questions such as how long the loan is for and most importantly, what is the interest rate. Rarely will a car dealership give you the best price at the first offering, because they want to make money as well. So be sure to spell out your terms and what you are looking for. This process can take quite a while, so be sure you have the time available (it took me almost an hour when I last bought my car, but I went from 7 years and a high interest rate to 5 years and 0% interest).</p>
<p>If they can&#8217;t work with you, don&#8217;t feel like you HAVE to buy the car at what they want. Feel free to say thank you and walk out. You have other dealerships you can go to. You&#8217;re the customer and as long as you&#8217;ve done your research, you are in control.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Timing</span></h2>
<p>There are some times that you want to go buy a car at the dealership. I can think of two of them on top of my head. The first is at the end of the month. Dealerships usually have quotas that they have to fill at the end of each month. The closer to the end of the month it is, the more lenient they are at giving you a good deal just so they can meet their quota. Even if they don&#8217;t have the particular car on hand, they can have the car shipped to their dealership and let you know when it is in, which is worth it considering the savings you&#8217;ll have by waiting one more week.</p>
<p>The second time is right when the new year models are coming in. These are the cars that the dealerships will want on their floor, so to make room they&#8217;ll be willing to negotiate more on last year&#8217;s models. Many of the car manufacturers only make big changes to their models every 4-6 years. During the other years, even though the new model is coming out, the changes may be very small (such as a front bumper being slightly angled more). These are the times that you can get the older model for a lower price. This is where your research will come into play. If the old model is almost exactly like the new one, then you have some automatic savings in buying the older model. However, if the older model has had issues that the new incoming model fixed, then you might want to consider the newer model to save you some headache (and even some money).</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Warranties</span></h2>
<p>Every new car comes with a standard warranty, which can last from 3 years (36,000 miles) up to 10 years (100,000 miles). As you&#8217;re filling out papers to finish your purchase, you might be asked to purchase an extended warranty. If you already have a 10 year warranty, you really won&#8217;t need to worry about it as you&#8217;ll be covered for quite a long time. But if you have a 3 year warranty and plan to keep it around for more than that, you may be thinking about purchasing an extended warranty. I personally don&#8217;t have recommendations on whether to get it or not because it will really depend on each experience. You never know when a car will and won&#8217;t have issues. But if you decide to go for the extended warranty, you CAN negotiate those terms. Every month that someone pays for extended warranty and don&#8217;t use it, its money in the dealerships pocket. This is another way they make money. That&#8217;s why they are willing to negotiate, because even at a lower price, it&#8217;s still income to them.</p>
<p>As an example, my dealership offered me a tire warranty on top of the extended warranty, which would replace my tires if I blew any of them out due to a natural cause. They started by asking me for 10 dollars a month for the tire warranty. Now, I&#8217;ve never had my tire blow on me and if it did a new tire would cost me roughly 100 dollars. 10 dollars a month for my 5 year loan would end up costing me 600 dollars total, which I did not think was smart. So I refused, and they decreased it to 5 dollars. Once again I refused and they went down, all the way to 2 dollars a month. I thought some more about it and decided I would do that, because it would at least pay for one tire if something did happen. And as luck (I guess) would have it, I ended up hitting a pothole about a year after I bought my car and blew out my tire completely. I was able to get a new tire installed at no cost. This was one time I was glad I bought the tire warranty (which I still have).</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Other costs</span></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve paid your down payment, you have your car and you&#8217;re done paying for anything until your first statement comes in. Nope. Don&#8217;t forget you have to register your car and get insurance. But you can get a pretty good estimate on these costs before you even go to the dealership. All you have to do is call the license bureau and your insurance agent and let them know what car you are thinking of getting and they should be able to give you a fairly close estimate of how much you&#8217;ll have to pay after you make a purchase. This won&#8217;t save you any money, but a lot of people forget about these costs when they are purchasing their car. Don&#8217;t forget, because they could be quite high depending on the vehicle.</p>
<h1>Electronics</h1>
<p>Many people dream of having that big screen HDTV in their living room with a great 5.1 sound system to go along with it. Or maybe even a high performance gaming PC, but you don&#8217;t want to or don&#8217;t know how to build your own. But many people think it&#8217;s too expensive to get. In the past, that was true. As time passes, these devices are becoming cheaper to get, but you need to know what you want.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Televisions</span></h2>
<p>HDTV&#8217;s used to cost quite a bit a few years ago when they were still fairly new. Now there are so many options out there that you can find a TV in your price range with no problems. You just need to know what you need in your HDTV (and not what you want) and what your budget is.</p>
<p>Do your research online first to see what you want from your HDTV. Do you need 240 Hz or even 120 Hz? Do you need LED? Do you want a specific brand? For answering all of these questions, Google will be your best friend. For example, go to Google and you can do a search for 120 Hz vs. 240 Hz, and get a list of websites that will offer you some comparisons. But don&#8217;t just read one website; be sure to read a couple. Go to some user forums and see what other consumers who bought the product are saying. Take the time to do some thorough research before you make a decision. While doing so, you&#8217;ll probably get a few brand names and even some specific models that you can look into. Check various websites (Amazon, Best Buy, hhgregg, NewEgg, Radio Shack, Sears, Tiger Direct, etc.) to see what their prices are. If you see it lower at one website, check to see how much shipping will cost. If it&#8217;s a local retailer, you may be able to price match (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to go to your local stores, even if you&#8217;ve already checked out their website. Each store is managed separately, so there may be some in-store deals that will not show up on the website. And these deals could be specific to that one store. If you have any open questions, you can ask the employees there. Just be aware that the answers you get from them may be tailored in a way so that they want you to spend more money from their store (they are sales people, of course). So if you get an answer and seem iffy about it, go back home and do research on it. Don&#8217;t go to the store without an idea of what you want.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#888888;">Computers</span></h2>
<p>For those who are into PC gaming or just want a laptop as a secondary computer, there are ways you can find one for cheap and still get one that will last you for a while. Just like HDTV&#8217;s, you first need to figure out what you need, not what you want. Do you need a high-end video card if you&#8217;re only using it for word processing? Do you need that high end sound card if you rarely will be listening to music? Each part in the computer will cost you more money depending on how high-end it is. So only get what you will be using.</p>
<p>If you can have the confidence to build your own PC, this will probably be the way you want to go (especially if you want to build a high-end one). Buying your own parts online and putting the PC together yourself will usually save you a few hundred dollars in the long run. Plus you&#8217;ll have it easily customized with whatever you wanted it to have.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have that confidence, then it&#8217;s the same steps as buying a TV. Research online, see what you need, compare prices and go in-store to learn more about the product and see if there are any in-store deals. Keep shopping around until you find a computer in your price range. Check for any open promotions as well, such as free monitors and free printers. Opt-out from any services they may offer you (such as installing virus protection software or &#8220;optimizing&#8221; your PC). These services can cost a few hundred dollars and you can easily do these yourself by just doing a search online. It won&#8217;t even take you more than an hour.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope I was able to give you some new insights on other ways you could save money, along with my own personal experiences. As a consumer myself, I love being able to help people save money. Why spend more on something when you don&#8217;t need to? I&#8217;m sure there are many other things that can be done to save even more, but I didn&#8217;t want to go over every little thing. I was trying to find the main areas in which you might not have thought of and things that I often repeat to my friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">I don&#8217;t run for medals. I don&#8217;t run for racing shirts or fancy gear. I don&#8217;t run for PRs. I don&#8217;t run for weight loss. I don&#8217;t run for popularity or recognition.  I don&#8217;t even run for fitness. I&#8217;ll tell you why I do run though&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because there is no sweeter taste than that of fresh air</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-568" title="Photo1-1" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because nature paints colors that beat out any 3D movie or HDR photo</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-585" title="Photo1-18" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-18.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because when the breeze hits my face I feel peaceful and free</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-580" title="Photo1-13" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-13.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run to be the only moving thing in a landscape of stillness</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-573" title="Photo1-6" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-6.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because it makes the smallest moments last an eternity</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-574" title="Photo1-7" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-7.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run to sightsee</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-578" title="Photo1-11" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-11.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because there is nothing that calms me more than miles of open country roads</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-579" title="Photo1-12" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-12.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run for that moment when the sun comes up and all of the world awakens</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-583" title="Photo1-16" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-16.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run for the view at the top of the mountain</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-577" title="Photo1-10" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-10.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And the view looking up from a grassy mattress</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-572" title="Photo1-5" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-5.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because my favorite smell is forest</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-569" title="Photo1-2" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-2.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And there is something magical about being around water</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-581" title="Photo1-14" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-14.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because I can see the sunrise and set a million different ways</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-571" title="Photo1-4" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run because I love the city before everyone wakes up</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-584" title="Photo1-17" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-17.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I run to explore</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-570" title="Photo1-3" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And I believe, despite what people may say, the trail never ends&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-575" title="Photo1-8" src="http://mismegs.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/photo1-8.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://aliceslitblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/please-look-after-mom.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-167" title="please look after mom" src="http://aliceslitblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/please-look-after-mom.jpg?w=181&#038;h=300" alt="" width="181" height="300" /></a>For Mother’s Day, I want to share a great book I just finished, “Please Look After Mom” by South Korean author Kyung-sook Shin. This book, published last year, won the Man Asian Literary Prize and was picked by Amazon as one of the best books of the month in April 2011.</p>
<p>Fancy awards aside, this book is endearing in the most humble and loving way. Instead of fancy prose and complex plots, this book wins the reader over with one of the most primal human feelings: The love between a mother and her children.</p>
<p>Set in modern South Korea, the story begins when a family finds out that their mother has vanished from a busy subway station inSeoul. Her children, who are now fully grown and have homes and families of their own, begin to remember their relationships with their mother and wonder what they may have done to prevent her from disappearing. The reason this is such a great book for Mother’s Day is that it is a perfect example of how you often do not appreciate something until it’s gone. In the case of this family, the mother was the loving rock that held them all together and helped the children transition for a poverty-stricken life in the country to success in the big city. Now that she’s gone, her children and husband begin to think of her in a whole new light- as a person who once had dreams of her own and sacrificed everything for her family. It’s almost instinctive to take parents, and especially mothers for granted. As you read through this book you may have an overwhelming desire to call your own mother up and say hello.</p>
<p>Though it shares many traditional Korean customs, the story feels very universal. For many people around the world, the last 2-3 generations have lived the great migration from country to city. This story may very well be the story of my own grandparents or the parents/grandparents of millions of people in the world. It is also the eternal story of generational gaps and how modern society can seem so distant from traditions that have been around for centuries. The children in this book, who all lead busy lives in the city, see the traditional ancestral rites of the parents as an almost superstitious practice.</p>
<p>I also love the voices that tell this story. The story is told by several of the children and parents, each one adding a piece to the portrait of this loving, if somewhat misunderstood country matriarch.</p>
<p>Genre: Fiction</p>
<p>Stars (out of 5): ****</p>
<p>I recommend it for: Those who enjoy family dramas and deep emotional stories, as well as those who are interested in learning about Korean culture.</p>
<p>Occasion: Reading aloud to your mom on Mother’s Day (as you try to hold back a few tears).</p>
<p>What I loved: The universal themes and the intimate view of family life in Korea.</p>
<p>Not for: Those who are looking for a light, uplifting book. This novel is likely to bring a few tears to your eyes, or at least a bit of nostalgia.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1566" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 727px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1566" title="Utah bike tour part 1 1" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-1.jpg?w=717&#038;h=273" alt="" width="717" height="273" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bryce Canyon, Utah</p></div>
<p>In June, 1999 we rode our touring bicycles from Salt Lake City, Utah to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  It was a simple idea:  Explore some of the American West by picking two airports, finding a flight we could afford (in our 20s we were far from financially flush), and riding from one to the next via back roads.  We knew little about Utah, or Southern Colorado, or Northern New Mexico; it just sounded like a fun adventure and the distance seemed about right for the time we had.</p>
<div id="attachment_1584" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 742px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-19.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1584" title="Utah bike tour part 1 19" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-19.jpg?w=732&#038;h=194" alt="" width="732" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Southern Utah has some unbelievable roads</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1586" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-21.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1586 " title="Utah bike tour part 1 21" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-21.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="330" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Family portrait at one of the scores of unmarked intersections in the middle of nowhere.</p></div>
<p>The trip ended up being 1,200+ miles over three weeks, mostly on obscure back roads, with about 300 miles on dirt roads on our touring bikes.  We had only a few hard destinations along the way:  Bryce Canyon National Park, and to visit one of H&#8217;s college friends in Durango.  All other destinations and routes were chosen by spreading out the map each morning and evening.  &#8220;This road looks smaller&#8221; was often the guiding principle of route finding.  Taking the road less traveled seems to be an ongoing theme.</p>
<div id="attachment_1583" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 559px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-18.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1583 " title="Utah bike tour part 1 18" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-18.jpg?w=549&#038;h=374" alt="" width="549" height="374" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red meadows and miles of dirt roads</p></div>
<p>It was also a trip that set our relationship in motion.  H and I had been dating for just a few months when I asked her if she wanted to go on a bike tour.  Going bicycle touring together can either make or break your relationship.</p>
<div id="attachment_1568" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1568" title="Utah bike tour part 1 3" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=205" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Family photo</p></div>
<p>There is nothing like freezing in driving rain, baking on 100+ degree days, sleeping in the dirt off the side of the road, bathing in snow melt streams, and 100+ mile days in the saddle to learn about yourself and each other.  Love it or hate it, no one feels indifferent after bike touring.</p>
<p>1999 seems like a century ago in terms of technology.  All of our planning and route mapping came via map, compass, guidebook, taking wrong turns at unmarked intersections, and asking directions in the little towns we visited.  Cell phone?  Nope.  Internet? Nope. GPS?  Nope.  Digital camera?  Nope.  Ipod?  Nope.  Our technology was limited to a film camera and a little AM/FM radio with one speaker.</p>
<div id="attachment_1581" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-16.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1581" title="Utah bike tour part 1 16" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-16.jpg?w=300&#038;h=172" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We traveled on little rural road like this one, or dirt roads for most of the trip</p></div>
<p>Most of our pictures were taken with either disposable box cameras (easiest to take pics while on the bike), or with my &#8220;real&#8221; camera.  In the end, digging my hand-me-down SLR with it&#8217;s manual F-stop and shutter speed settings out of the panniers was a pain.  The constant road vibration also didn&#8217;t do the focus any favors.  The grainy, vintage look of the pics was because they were scanned from film.</p>
<p>We flew into the Salt Lake City Airport and assembled our touring bikes in the baggage claim of the airport.  Prior to 9-11-2001, airport security was lax.  We built up our bikes in the baggage claim with gear strewn about,  loaded them up, and abandoned the bike boxes in the airport next to a garbage can; something probably not possible today.  In those days, bikes could also fly free with a USCF racing license.</p>
<div id="attachment_1582" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 498px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-17.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1582 " title="Utah bike tour part 1 17" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-17.jpg?w=488&#038;h=334" alt="" width="488" height="334" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Miles of dirt roads and big skylines stretching to the horizon</p></div>
<p>Inside jokes in a relationship build through common experiences.  One that has continued for H and I nearly 13 years later is &#8220;REI miles.&#8221;  We asked directions at the airport to the local REI for maps and camp fuel and were told it was &#8220;about a mile.&#8221;  Awesome!  Nearly two hours later, we arrived at REI. (According to Google maps, it&#8217;s 15.5 miles away <em>by freeway</em> from the airport, much longer on unfamiliar surface streets).  An &#8220;REI mile&#8221; in our relationship means that it&#8217;s really far away.</p>
<div id="attachment_1571" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1571" title="Utah bike tour part 1 6" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-6.jpg?w=300&#038;h=204" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of our many free camp spots hidden just of the road.</p></div>
<p>On our first night we camped off the road next to a little creek.  The best camping on our trip came by just finding a nice place along the way (we always pack everything out and leave no trace except flattened grass where the tent sat).  On the second day when we climbed up to 8000&#8242; only to find our way blocked by snow.  A bit of rerouting, and we were on our way again.</p>
<div id="attachment_1578" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1578" title="Utah bike tour part 1 13" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-13.jpg?w=300&#038;h=163" alt="" width="300" height="163" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">8000' Woo Hoo!</p></div>

<p>We rode toward Bryce along back roads stopping here and there in little towns for directions.  Some of the &#8220;towns&#8221; were little more than a dot on the map with perhaps a general store and a few houses.  This is Mormon country, and we were clearly outsiders with our bikes and funny clothing far from the beaten path.  In more than one little &#8220;town,&#8221; women hurried their children out of sight and &#8220;the man&#8221; came out to talk to us.</p>
<div id="attachment_1574" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-9.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1574" title="Utah bike tour part 1 9" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-9.jpg?w=300&#038;h=181" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of my favorite free campsites of the trip. The rain started soon after this pic was taken</p></div>
<p>A day&#8217;s ride from Bryce Canyon, we found a beautiful little campsite well off the road surrounded by willows at the confluence of two streams.  As we were having breakfast, clouds began to roll in.  The temperature dropped and the wind picked up.  The first drops began to fall as we were hurriedly packing up.  It was about 60 miles to Bryce Canyon, mostly on dirt roads into a stiff headwind.  Funny how relationships build vivid memories. H, in an effort to stay warm was absolutely hammering on the bike.  I was struggling to stay on her wheel on a dirt road, with muddy, gritty spray blasting off her back wheel into my face.  The snow line was only a few hundred feet above us, and the nearby hills were turning white.  I did my best to take my turn at the front, but H was the hero and did the lion&#8217;s share of pulling that day.  We arrived with teeth chattering and drenched through our rain gear at Ruby&#8217;s Inn outside the park, where we warmed up with hot cocoa and packaged danishes.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have decent rain gear and gore-tex socks.  H had a cheap clear plastic cycling cape, blue plastic rain pants, and her feet were stuffed into plastic produce bags.  I offered her mine, but she refused.  More than a decade later, she still tells me of being insanely jealous of my rain gear.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark and near freezing when we set up camp in Bryce Canyon.  We went to bed grumpy and cold, not knowing why Bryce Canyon was such a big deal.  In the morning, we found that our hiker/biker camp site was perched on the rim of the Canyon.  In the morning, as the sun was rising- Wow!  The pictures, grainy and scanned as they are, will tell the story better than I can.</p>

<p>From Bryce Canyon we pedaled East to Escalante, UT.  Southern Utah has such an incredible color pallet.  Those who remember watching Road Runner cartoons have seen the crazy rock formations.  Riding through Southern Utah was just like a Road Runner cartoon.  Cliffs and rocks seemed to defy gravity among a sea of color.</p>

<p>The road to Escalante was stunning.  Every mile could have been in a travel guide.  The next morning, we were stuck in our tent  in the campground in Escalante, UT that morning as frequent cold, dumping thunderstorms rolled through.  It&#8217;s funny how people remember things differently.  I&#8217;m a detail guy:  I remember miles, details, roads, directions, etc.  H has an incredible memory for songs, and voices, and easily associates memories with things that happened along the way.  She reminded me about the Escalante campground.  In a nearby camp site, a guy was playing his guitar all day as thunderstorms rolled through.  He played only one song, for 6-7 hours:  The Beatles, &#8220;<em>Here comes the Sun.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><em>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, </em><br />
<em>And I say it&#8217;s all right </em></p>
<div id="attachment_1605" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-40.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605" title="Utah bike tour part 1 40" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-40.jpg?w=300&#038;h=153" alt="" width="300" height="153" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scaring sheep in the middle of nowhere</p></div>
<p><em>Little darling, it&#8217;s been a long cold lonely winter </em><br />
<em>Little darling, it feels like years since it&#8217;s been here </em><br />
<em>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun </em><br />
<em>And I say it&#8217;s all right </em></p>
<p><em>Little darling, the smiles returning to their faces </em><br />
<em>Little darling, it seems like years since it&#8217;s been here </em><br />
<em>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun </em><br />
<em>And I say it&#8217;s all right </em></p>
<p><em>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes&#8230; </em><br />
<em>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I made the decision that we needed to get going in the afternoon.  As soon as we got the tent packed up, a cold drenching thunderstorm rolled through.  H was furious with me as we took refuge in the visitor&#8217;s center, only to be told by the Ranger, &#8220;looks like the heaviest rain is coming.&#8221;  This early in our relationship, I was just beginning to learn of her hatred of being cold.  She told the ranger, &#8220;You can blame, Mr. Smarty Pants here, he thought it was a good idea to leave now!&#8221;  Boy was she mad.  Later we took refuge at a gas station/convenience store with a cook-your-own-burger conveyor belt Rube Goldberg machine (laden with grease), and a cashier with the biggest glam rock hair ever (think motley crue on steroids) and freakishly long fingernails who watched us with disdain she filed her nails.</p>

The thunderstorm just missed us but was dumping just up the road</p></div>
<p>When we asked about the road to Boulder, UT, we were told by several people in Escalante that we couldn&#8217;t make it on bicycles.  The roads were too steep and too narrow to be ridden on bikes.  Not the first or last time we&#8217;ve been told that what we were doing was impossible or crazy.  The fear of getting drenched and cold was our biggest fear (it took several hours to warm up from our trip into Bryce).  We set out for Boulder along a beautiful, winding highway.  At one point, we were climbing up a steep grade being chased by thunderstorms.  When it looked like we were going to be drenched yet again, we stopped and hurriedly put on our rain gear.  The thunder storm missed us by about 100 yards, and we were only hit by a few stray raindrops; just up the road, we could see the rain coming down in heavy sheets with lightning strikes and the cracking of close thunder.</p>
<p>We rolled into Boulder, UT without incident and without getting wet.  In Escalante, we made the decision to ride dirt roads through Capital Reef National Park on the Burr Trail (naturally, we chose the obscure way to travel through Capital Reef).  Thunderstorms and heavy rain cells were still moving through the area.  Afraid that the rain would make the dirt roads impassable on our skinny-tired touring bikes, we stayed in a motel for two nights waiting for it to pass.</p>
<div id="attachment_1570" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1570" title="Utah bike tour part 1 5" src="http://tahoesux.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/utah-bike-tour-part-1-5.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="394" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Road to the Burr Trail, Capital Reef National Park</p></div>
<p>It was worth the wait.  Capital Reef was an incredible ride.  Massive geologic formations rise out of the ground like castles and buttresses.   Trying to explain the scale of the rocks is difficult.  It was an incredible, but hard day of riding.  We were each carrying at least 2 gallons of water on the already laden touring bikes.  The riding was incredible and technically challenging.  We definitely put our mountain bike skills to work keeping the loaded bikes upright on loose dirt roads.  We made our way to the Lake Powell ferry and were passed by a vintage car group.  Model Ts chugged past us as we chugged over steep climbs.  When we took the ferry, the ferry dude must have been impressed that we rode there on touring bikes.   He held all the cars and let us board first and exit first.</p>

<p>From Lake Powell to Durango was a bit of a blur.  We rode through Cortez, Colorado then crossed into Colorado on a tiny, two lane road.  The only indication that we had crossed into Colorado was that the roadside mile markers changed.  We were traveling on such rural roads that we found ruins native American cave dwellings and petroglyphs just off the roadway; a testament to history without fanfare or national parks.  Very cool.</p>
