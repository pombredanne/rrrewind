				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="The Perfect Bookmobile" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/8074804516_ea28a265f0_c.jpg" height="800" width="554" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking lately about my former dream of owning a bookmobile. It was always a dream that stemmed from two of my deepest desires: to be surrounded by books and to make a home on the road. These days, though, that dream is little more than a fantasy that I only occasionally indulge, more frequently when I&#8217;ve been following the exploits of this traveling <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.thebookbarge.co.uk/"><span style="color:#808080;">book barge</span></a></span>. Recently, too, it&#8217;s been on my mind as I was reading Erin Morgenstern&#8217;s <em>The Night Circus</em>, which reminded me in many ways of Audrey Niffenegger&#8217;s graphic novel, <em>The Night Bookmobile</em>. Both feature magic, both feature a venue that, for modern readers, because they are rare and migratory in nature, feels wholly magical. It&#8217;s fitting, then, to infuse both these venues with actual magic. And so, if i were designing the perfect bookmobile, it would have to have something magical about it.</p>
<p>1. An <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.airstream.com/travel-trailers/classic/"><span style="color:#808080;">airstream caravan</span></a></span> would be the shell of my bookmobile, gutted and filled with retractable wall shelves and space-saving benches. I&#8217;d keep the kitchenette.</p>
<p>2. We would serve free tea (or coffee), an idea pinched from two of my favorite bookstore (<span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://fortheloveofbookshops.com/2012/09/26/the-book-barge-part-ii/"><span style="color:#808080;">here</span></a></span> and <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.mrbsemporium.com/"><span style="color:#808080;">here</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>3.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.artmeetsmatter.com/penguin_classics/penguin_deckchair_-_the_garden_party.htm"><span style="color:#808080;">Deck chairs</span></a></span> inspired by Penguin classic book covers for reading newly purchased acquisitions on the lawn.</p>
<p>4. Here&#8217;s where the magic comes in. I quite like the idea explored by Morgenstern and Niffenegger of the venue in question arriving unpredictably and operating at unconventional hours. So I would carry <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=580&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=FE4y2J_Z_xBHXM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.luxist.com/tag/exhibit/&amp;docid=Ypj9DnKwIkDOZM&amp;imgurl=http://www.blogcdn.com/www.luxist.com/media/2009/07/breguet-ref.-1160-pocket-watch.jpg&amp;w=470&amp;h=600&amp;ei=7NR1UOGWC4a69QTo8IDIBg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=98&amp;vpy=223&amp;dur=373&amp;hovh=250&amp;hovw=196&amp;tx=118&amp;ty=157&amp;sig=116091458863172429414&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=122&amp;tbnw=96&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=21&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:96">a <span style="color:#808080;">pocket watch</span></a> set for midnight, or whenever I plan on opening my doors.</p>
<p>5. Shoppers would have the option to pay for their book with a story of their own telling. I&#8217;d quite like to make the bookmobile a space where the oral tradition is celebrated.</p>
<p>6. Of course, we&#8217;re not total Luddites. All titles would have <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://fortheloveofbookshops.com/2011/03/11/selling-ebooks-instore-a-progress-report/"><span style="color:#808080;">QR codes</span></a></span>, which browsers can scan with their SmartPhones. Customers would then have the option to purchase and download the ebook from our website.</p>
<p>7. <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.riteintherain.com/inventoryD.asp?item_no=954T"><span style="color:#808080;">Rite in the Rain All Weather Notebooks</span></a></span>, would be for sale for the visitors who become inspired suddenly while browsing the many rows of literature. Hey, it happens, and when it happens, you want to be prepared with the most weather impermeable notebook on the market.</p>
<p>8. A functional <span style="color:#808080;"><a href="http://www.photo-dictionary.com/phrase/603/typewriter.html#b"><span style="color:#808080;">typewrite</span></a></span>. Again, for the inspired visitor.</p>
<p>9.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/stationery-set?before=1336827483"><span style="color:#808080;">Handmade stationary</span></a></span>: Have wheels, will deliver mail. Will also keep a well-stocked supply of fountain pens, bottles (with corks), stamps for purchase and wax seals.</p>
<p>10.<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=153225101393277&amp;set=pb.153222811393506.-2207520000.1349900432&amp;type=1&amp;theater"><span style="color:#808080;">Secure shelving</span></a></span> so books do not dislodge while caravan is in motion.</p>
<p>11. The most important part of my vision is<span style="color:#808080;"> <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=580&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=oD2pDA5YRvlAkM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.primaryignition.com/2010/12/20/the-night-bookmobile-graphic-novel-review/&amp;docid=6LSGBWqqmdqcwM&amp;imgurl=http://www.primaryignition.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/guardian.co_.uk_.jpg&amp;w=460&amp;h=298&amp;ei=49h1UIrTJIOi9QTRuoG4DQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=87&amp;vpy=285&amp;dur=340&amp;hovh=152&amp;hovw=223&amp;tx=182&amp;ty=60&amp;sig=116091458863172429414&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=157&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:93"><span style="color:#808080;">summed up</span></a></span> perfectly by Audrey Niffeneger in <em>The Night Bookmobile. </em>As you know if you&#8217;ve read the book, the Night Bookmobile magically reflects each visitor&#8217;s personal library and reading tastes. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of impression I&#8217;d want every visitor to my bookmobile to have: that the inventory was selected exclusively with them in mind. I&#8217;ve transcribed the paragraph below.</p>
<blockquote><p>I drank my tea and explored the farthest recesses of my collection. Each spine was an encapsulated memory, each book represented hours, days of pleasure, of immersion in worlds. At the very end, on the lowest shelf, was the book I had been reading that morning. I picked it up and opened it. There was my bookmark, but the text continued on, for I had read the book many times. I replaced <em>The Complete Short Stories of H.G. Wells</em> on its shelf.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t actually have a guide for this yet, but I am newly pregnant and figuring things out! I dunno if it&#8217;s the case for every pregnant lady but I am HUNGRY, and especially hungry for iron-rich, red meat-y things that aren&#8217;t on my typical eating plan. Weight Watchers won&#8217;t allow you to attend meetings while pregnant, which is probably really good because there was a tiny part of me that was planning on losing the last 15 pounds while pregnant. When I have a day off, I find that I need at least a handful of naps, and sometimes I fall asleep sitting up. I&#8217;m working out still, but currently keeping it to prenatal yoga and pilates and long walks.  I haven&#8217;t had a major sweat in at least a month, and when I hit the doctor for confirmation that I was with child, I had gained three pounds.</p>
<p>I am crazy, insanely stressed out about weight gain, but I also suspect that carrying this pregnancy has the potential to fully and forever change my relationship to the body I&#8217;ve been struggling with for almost 30 years now. Josh doesn&#8217;t like it when I poke my tummy irritably because the baby is hanging out in there. My breasts are supposed to be fuller and heavier, my body is supposed to be fatigued, and I am supposed to be going a little slower. I think there&#8217;s the potential to find a lot of harmony during this time, if I honor what this experience is and fight through my anxieties about what it will mean for the temporal form of my body. It&#8217;s extremely unlikely that I&#8217;ll gain back 90 pounds&#8211;although Josh jokes that if we find out this week we&#8217;re having twins, all bets are off&#8211;and even if I DO gain back EVERY SINGLE POUND I have the framework and the knowledge to work my way back.</p>
<p>The loveliest thing that the partner of an anxious pregnant woman can say, by the way, is that they had a day-dream in which they were watching the baby while you got a chance to work out. I wouldn&#8217;t say that to any lady who hasn&#8217;t expressly explained her post-pregnancy weight loss regime though. We pregnant people have the hormonal strength of, like, bears. When those hormones rush through me, I could punch a dolphin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping this is nine-ish months of learning to love my body as the full miraculous piece of divinity I think it might actually be. I feel full and lovely and strong and my skin looks AMAZING. I&#8217;m off my anti-anxiety meds, with the world&#8217;s best psychiatrist a phone call away, and I am learning a whole bunch about full, holistic living. Also, I am crying. A LOT. I was just watching SNL and Christina Applegate introduced Passion Pit and the way she looked so proud of them got me weepy. That part is maybe the least fun.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! I hit the midwife this week for the first appointment, and I&#8217;m hoping we spend some time talking about diet and exercise and health. I&#8217;ve been scoping out cute maternity wear&#8212;there really IS some, I&#8217;m happy to report. I&#8217;m looking forward to designing a nursery and making Josh do all the work. I&#8217;m excited to get to a point where I&#8217;m clearly pregnant because my students have been asking me if I&#8217;m having kids since we first met. If things go according to plan, I&#8217;ll have a baby in late May and have the whole summer off for bonding. I don&#8217;t count as much of a mom yet but jeez if I don&#8217;t already love the experience a lot. Sometimes Josh comes home and says hey to us both individually and I feel like my heart might explode.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first picture I&#8217;ve taken since I found out. I was off that night for a haunted DC walking tour, and since I get cold pretty easily, I layered up. My friend Kelly swore I&#8217;m glow-y already, but I think it was really just a combination of Friday afternoon relief and ghostly excitement. I love Halloween.</p>

<p>That is a University of Maryland beanie, a Fossil scarf, my cute warm new sweatshirt material jacket, Sweetheart cut old navy denim, and my new Adidas runners. Those runners get me so many compliments, and they really are just a great pair of shoes.</p>

It takes a lot of living to make a house a home</strong><br />
<strong>It doesn&#8217;t make any  difference how rich you get to be</strong><br />
<strong>How much your chairs and tables cost, how great your luxury;</strong><br />
<strong>It isn&#8217;t home to you though it be the palace of a king,</strong><br />
<strong>Until somehow your soul is wrapped round everything.<br />

<p>During my undergraduate days, I took a few semesters of fencing to earn my physical education credits.  I took that and ballroom dancing.  I guess I figured both would come in handy if I were to apply for a job as Zorro, a pirate, or one of the Musketeers.   For the record, I was a terrible fencer.  Also for the record, I was the most sought-after partner in the ballroom dance class.   What can I say?  I&#8217;m a lover, not a fighter.</p>
<p>Competitive fencing is nothing like swashbuckling or the swordplay you see in the movies.  There are long periods of deliberate, measured, uneventful maneuvering until somebody sees an opening and lunges.  Bam.  It&#8217;s usually over before the buzzer stops buzzing.  The VP debate last night reminded me of all the fencing matches I competed in, and usually lost badly.  Both Ryan and Biden chose their words carefully, circled each other strategically, and looked for an opening which never really came.  Like a fencing match, it was terribly boring to watch &#8211; long periods of nothing with only an occasional lunge or parry.   Both men made an equal number of attacks, and both successfully parried throughout the evening.  No buzzer.  No hit.  No great, memorable &#8220;You&#8217;re no Jack Kennedy&#8221; moments.<span id="more-1306"></span></p>
<p>If I noticed any real differences, it was in their choice of weapons.  Ryan fought with a foil, the lightest and most precise of fencing weapons.  He went after specific targets, attempting to hit Biden in vital areas that would kill a man if it were a real duel.  I&#8217;m not sure any blows struck with much effect, but it did require Biden to respond in kind.  More importantly, it showed that Ryan would not be toyed with.  Its like those scenes in the movies where the two antagonists try a few probing lunges and jabs to establish their prowess with the blade. Ryan wanted to show he could fight.  He succeeded.</p>
<p>Biden chose a much heavier weapon, the saber.  The saber is designed for slashing and hacking, and taking off a man&#8217;s arms and legs.  Its designed to maim rather than inflict a swift death.  Biden continually tried to break Ryan&#8217;s concentration with a series of feints in the form of guffaws, chuckles, exasperation, and interruptions.  He wasnt trying to refute anything in particular.   He was executing a strategy to get Ryan off his game,  make him drop his defenses, and create an opening.   Biden was hoping that Ryan would lose his cool, get angry, get flustered and say something silly.  The intent was to inflict damage on the Romney/Ryan brand so people could say &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s not yet ready to be President.  He&#8217;s too young.  Come back in a few years young man.&#8221;  But Ryan didn&#8217;t take the bait.  His discipline and training prevailed.   It was like a scene from Return of the Jedi, with an evil Emperor Biden saying through rotted teeth &#8220;Take your weapon and strike me down.  I feel the hatred within you.&#8221;  But Ryan, master of his own emotions, passed the test.</p>
<p>Fencing is a boring sport.  For that matter so is politics.  They only become interesting when somebody gets hit.   Last night was a draw with few fireworks and little blood.  The competitors have left the arena, but left their weapons on the floor for Tuesday night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://blogactionday.org/about-us/">Blog Action Day</a> is an annual event, that has run since 2007. It’s aim is to unite the world’s bloggers by posting about the same issue on the same day, in order to raise awareness and trigger a global discussion around things that impact us all. This year the focus is on &#8220;The Power of We&#8221;, a celebration of people working together to make a positive difference in the world, either for their own communities or for people they will never meet half way around the world. I&#8217;ve chosen to profile <a href="http://www.shockingpink.co.nz">Shocking Pink</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://sweetmamam.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/shockingpink.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-461 aligncenter" title="ShockingPink" alt="" src="http://sweetmamam.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/shockingpink.jpg?w=300&#038;h=298" height="298" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 by two young women undergoing cancer treatment, <a href="http://www.shockingpink.co.nz">Shocking Pink</a> has been established to provide a point of contact, knowledge centre and forum for young women with breast cancer. They also work to raise awareness and highlight research of breast cancer in the young and represent the unique views and concerns of young women with breast cancer.</p>
<p>Kylie Richardson is one of the co-founders. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 at the age of 27. A mastectomy, six months of chemo and one month of radiation followed but with the support of family and friends she made it out the other side. She maintains a positive outlook on life, saying &#8220;Now on hormone therapy for 2 years, my ideal life plan has been altered somewhat, but I have been afforded new opportunities out of this &#8211; like co-founding Shocking Pink!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheryle Robins is the other co-founder and her cause is near and dear to me as she was diagnosed with the same rare breast cancer as my mother.  At just 34, she was diagnosed with rare and aggressive Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) while still breastfeeding her 1-year-old son. After 16 treatments of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy and 25 sessions of radiation, she is now out the other side but having continued hormone therapy. She also has inherited the BRCA2 breast cancer gene mutation and faces further prophylactic surgery in the future. All of this could understandably get you down but she states &#8220;With the unconditional love and support of my boys, my family and amazing friends I have been able to co-found Shocking Pink and create something positive from my situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their website  has a whole host of articles that can be useful when first diagnosed with cancer and they are not afraid to say it how it really is &#8211; some honest advice include <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/dealing-with-feelings/questions-questions-questions/wtf/">WTF?</a>, <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/dealing-with-feelings/questions-questions-questions/why-not-her/">Why not her?</a>, <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/dealing-with-feelings/touchy-subjects/the-boob-obsession/">The Boob Obsession</a> &amp; <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/brightyoungthings/frisky-business/">Frisky Business</a> &#8211; yes, about what your sex life may be like post-cancer diagnosis and treatment. Of similar usefulness is the Little Pink Book directory which shows you where to access products and services that can help you during treatment &#8211; any charitable organisation that compares the Ministry of Health to <em>Harry Potter</em>&#8216;s Ministry of Magic is alright by me!</p>
<p>Ways you can support Shocking Pink:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase a fundraising item from their online <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/product-category/fundraising-products/">store</a></li>
<li>making a donation &#8211; the variety of ways in which you can do that are shown <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/share-the-love/donate/">here</a></li>
<li>contribute <a href="http://shockingpink.org.nz/share-the-love/contributer/">content</a> &#8211; be it through telling your own story, leaving your feedback or becoming part of their Little Pink Book directory</li>
<li>Run your own fundraising event or volunteer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many great breast cancer awareness and support organisations out there but I think that Shocking Pink really fills a void in terms of information that missing. Breast Cancer is not only an elderly women&#8217;s disease &#8211; my mother was diagnosed at 45 and passed away at 49 &#8211; yet many of the resources out there are targeted at that older age range. Support Shocking Pink and help them harness the power of we!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/121012_biden_double_hands_up_ap_605.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2025" title="121012_biden_double_hands_up_ap_605" alt="" src="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/121012_biden_double_hands_up_ap_605.jpg?w=300&#038;h=162" height="162" width="300" /></a>Last night America had the chance to watch Vice-President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan engage in a wide-ranging debate as they represented their respective tickets for the November election.  It was, for the most part, a rather serious evening&#8230;and far from the &#8220;fun romp&#8221; I had characterized <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="The Lighter Side of Presidential Politics" href="http://joshuaziefle.net/2012/10/11/the-lighter-side-of-presidential-politics/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yesterday</span></a></span></strong>.  For this, perhaps, I ought to apologize.</p>
<p>I took some notes during the debate, and the following represent my thoughts about the &#8220;second-in-command&#8221; contest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martha Raddatz, the debate moderator, did a TERRIFIC job.  I thought that she was tough, focused, and willing <a href="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/story.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2026" title="Story" alt="" src="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/story.jpg" height="210" width="210" /></a>to push both candidates on the issues of the day.  I&#8217;m not sure if that is what her role was supposed to be, but for what it is worth, I liked her approach.</li>
<li>Coming into this debate, I would have almost certainly told you that Biden would have the edge in foreign policy (he&#8217;s an old pro) and Ryan in economic matters (it is where a significant amount of his attention has been focused).  How surprising, then, that over the course of the debate the exact opposite result seemed to emerge.</li>
<li>The Vice-President didn&#8217;t seem as effective in the foreign policy issues&#8211;especially early on&#8211;and Ryan seemed to know his stuff.  To be sure, Iran and Libya are particularly sticky issues for Biden and the administration, and the opposition has an easier job here.  Yet Biden&#8217;s discussion of the matter did not help; at one point when discussing Iran he even said &#8220;let&#8217;s all calm down a bit here,&#8221; something that I suspect might not play so well with parts of the American population.</li>
<li>Depending on your perspective, Biden&#8217;s tone was either 1) feisty and aggressive or 2) condescending and <a href="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1350015587929-cached.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2041" title="1350015587929.cached" alt="" src="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1350015587929-cached.png?w=150&#038;h=84" height="84" width="150" /></a>aggressive.  This will almost certainly be known as the &#8220;Joe Biden smile&#8221; debate, as he mockingly rejected Ryan&#8217;s words in split screen.  For my money, he adequately conveyed a feeling of disgust with the Ryan position&#8230;and while brusque, I think it worked for him.  Based on some of the comments I have seen thus far online, a good number of people feel the opposite.</li>
<li>Paul Ryan seemed much more nervous and perhaps less rehearsed than Biden.  Time and again he seems to <a href="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/paul-ryan1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2028" title="paul ryan" alt="" src="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/paul-ryan1.jpg?w=105&#038;h=150" height="150" width="105" /></a>have reverted to &#8220;canned&#8221; statements or lines of arguments that revealed either a lack of response or a desire to return to a more comfortable line of conversation.  It made him seem less assured than Biden.</li>
<li>With regard to economic issues, Biden played the angry populist, and did a nice job doing so.  He came off as a fighter for the American people.  Ryan had an opportunity to show how he too was a fighter, but failed, I think, to really integrate his economic philosophy and solutions in the midst of his arguments.</li>
<li>Ryan&#8217;s problem was a lack of specificity about economic plans and issues.  Biden and the moderator both pressed him for details, and he wasn&#8217;t able to offer as much as he should have.  At one point, he was very nearly pushed into a corner; for his sake I&#8217;m glad the conversation turned elsewhere.  President Obama is a smart man, and will likely seek to press Mitt Romney in the very same way in the next debate.  If the Republicans wish to continue their comeback in the polls and hearts of the American people, they are going to have to do much better than what Ryan had to offer last night.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2032" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/0710-obama-romney-money_full_600.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2032" title="0710-obama-romney-money_full_600" alt="" src="http://joshuaziefle.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/0710-obama-romney-money_full_600.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" height="200" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Show us the money (details), Romney.</p></div>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t guessed by now, I give this one to Joe Biden.  Though he may have been a jerk at times, I feel that his attitude was calculated to be about his rejection of the Romney-Ryan set of ideas.  Ryan&#8217;s failure to show or indicate anywhere near as forcefully that the Democrat&#8217;s ideas are suspect means that Biden wins the day.  If the Republicans fail to double down on their economic philosophy and show specifically how their plans will work, I&#8217;m just not sure how they win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this with a tequila bottle in one hand and a five dollar cigar in the other. That&#8217;s not totally true, I guess, or even true at all in the technical sense. But I could be writing with booze and smokes in my hands if I wanted, and every writer in literary history would envy me. Today for the first time I&#8217;m attempting to use speech to text software to write a real thing that real people might read.</p>
<p>I’m trying this in anticipation of a neurological rebellion that might hold my hands hostage, like socialist guerillas occupying a power plant, but I’m finding it a problematic exercise. For example, in the prior paragraph the speech to text software thought that the word &#8220;for&#8221; should be &#8220;from.&#8221; When I tried to edit the word, the software obtusely led me on a Maypole dance through four or five incorrect commands. The most entertaining was when I said &#8220;select four words right,” and the software interpreted it as &#8220;Open World of Warcraft.” I am not making that up. I haven’t logged on in years, so it was a surprise. Also, it&#8217;s really hard to get this program to type the phrase “Open World of Warcraft” when it thinks you want to open the program World of Warcraft whenever you say those words.</p>
<p>The preceding paragraphs took me five minutes to write. They took seven months to edit, otherwise known as 30 minutes, but anyone who challenges the seven months interpretation can put on this god damn headset and try it themselves. It also aggravates me that the stupid software doesn&#8217;t understand the word &#8220;obtusely.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick experiment has just shown me that this program understands almost no profanity. That is a F you see Kay I in G shame, and I expect that&#8217;s going to slow down my words per hour considerably.</p>
<p>Holy frijoles! (I just found out it doesn’t understand Spanish, and I had to type “frijoles.”) I don&#8217;t know why, but all on its own this software just tried to take something I said and post it to Twitter. I hope it wasn’t “F you see Kay I in G.” That&#8217;s a little bit scary if you ask me.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I&#8217;m having is that I&#8217;m not verbally oriented. I have a hard time learning things by listening to people, especially if they&#8217;re really boring people like most of my college professors. I learn things by doing them. That&#8217;s handy when you write by typing on a keyboard with your actual fingers. But in order to speak the words I want to write, I have to stop and think about every phrase before I say it, so that it doesn&#8217;t come out sounding like a Neanderthal on Quaaludes. (Holy crap! This program understands what Quaaludes are. I bet that&#8217;s because the people who use this program have to take them a lot.) So, for these few paragraphs that would normally take me about half an hour to write and edit, this program has demanded an hour and a half, a liter of Diet Coke, and a surreptitious pull off the Cuervo bottle. (I see it understands Cuervo too.)</p>
<p>Despite all that, I admit that this would be better than not being able to write at all. So I&#8217;m going to call this test successful, maybe have a party, and definitely have a celebratory bag of peanut butter M&amp;M&#8217;s. Technology is a damn fine thing, but I will say that I never want to have software integrated into my body, no matter what technologists say. It would take me 45 minutes to pee.</p>
