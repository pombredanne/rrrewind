				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">For more than a few months (and years, honestly), I&#8217;ve grown increasingly distraught at the shell games business and consumers play with each other in the name of &#8216;savings&#8217; and, now that &#8216;couponing&#8217; has entrenched itself firmly in the mainstream of public conscience and every store in the universe has seemingly adopted a rewards program of some sort, it&#8217;s to the point where someone has got to stand up and ask why we bother at this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">/stands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why do we bother?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">/sits down</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt we have seen them: those dedicated folks who truck the binders of coupons around the store and hold up checkout lines to make sure every cent is accounted for. I know a few of them myself, and I mean no disrespect to anyone who carries the couponing torch. But it warrants mentioning that the marketplace is not a static environment; at some point, like the casinos, the stores will respond to the hit to the bottom line. And most of them have. The house always wins, and card-counters are, politely or otherwise, when the tactics are recognized, asked not to return. In the same way, you don&#8217;t see manufacturer&#8217;s coupons without an expiration date anymore, do you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It didn&#8217;t take me long to discover the hollow nature of &#8216;savings&#8217;. Even when I was a small boy, the allure of savings never made sense: &#8216;savings&#8217; mean that something has to be invested first in order for the savings to take place, and thus the stores could set any price they cared to and discount from there, competing with no one but themselves. When a store engages in this kind of economic solipsism&#8211;and ultimately, they all do, collusion is how every store from groceries to gas operate these days; to wit, when was the last time you saw a full-on, community-wide gas war?&#8211;it can claim a sale price based off whatever mark-up they&#8217;ve pinned on an item.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone these days is looking for a way to save a buck; I get this, and try to be as fiscally-responsible as possible. Indeed, couponing was a way to keep merchants honest and social discounting sites like Groupon were great ways to try to get a business&#8217; name out into the public, while rewards programs encouraged customers to keep shopping to see greater rewards. Now, all of them are counter-productive exercises in screwing us all over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there are enough cutthroat couponers out there to dent the gross revenues of a business, that business has no choice but to control costs to support themselves, either by cutting hours of the workforce or raising prices. When the binder-brandishing set descends on a marketplace, they may be leaving with a cart full for a fraction, but the rest of us are forced to pay more, while the store has to engage in more gimmicks and tactics to avoid the law of diminishing returns, figuratively and literally. Target, for a time, honored expired coupons. That didn&#8217;t last long. Eventually, the coupons are worth less, and even the frugal end up spending more. The house wins. Especially in a market that is watered down by cheap money, stealth inflation, and a flagging economy [overly] reliant on consumer spending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking of the Bullseye&#8211;and, in the interest of full disclosure, I used to work for their credit card division, first for the original parent company, Dayton-Hudson, then rebranded to, as it is now, Target Corp&#8211;as soon as their Red and Red Debit Cards became eligible for a 5% discount across the store&#8211;SAVINGS!!!!!1!1!!&#8211;I mentioned to a manager of the local Target in passing how I needed to sign up in order to avoid the 5% mark-up that was coming. She didn&#8217;t disagree, and all but said how the prices had already gone up. When Panera Bread, the usual haunt where I have written for this site in the past (lackluster coffee and all), started their MyPanera program, I asked the cashier when the prices were going up. She looked at me blankly, then, within weeks, they unrolled new magnetic menus with&#8230;you guessed it, higher prices. In fairness, the freebies that come with Panera&#8217;s program are typically pretty generous, but the fact is that though the program doesn&#8217;t cost the consumer any, the consumer pays via higher prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JCPenney, the fading American retail behemoth, with former Target and Apple exec Ron Johnson at the helm, tried stopping this tide of bait-and-switch sales gimmicks by promoting everyday values and minimizing said gimmickry. The public, so drunk with the thrill of couponing and anything to save a buck, didn&#8217;t bite. Steve and Barry&#8217;s, the flash-in-the-pan retailer who fell victim to their overexpansion, thrived by offering quality clothes at deep discounts, and then imploded by overextending its supply chain in time for the first economic implosion in the late 00s. With the S&amp;B threat gone, the rest of retail America went about the business of protecting themselves against the recession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what happens when this kind of downward spiral goes unchecked? After while, emboldened merchants begin to skew the promotions to their advantage: using fine print, technicalities and ambiguous phrases, what appears to be a good deal ends up being not much of a deal. Grocery stores with gas promotions where the savings on gas come at a premium throughout the store (as regional grocer Hy-Vee just launched this week, that is, both a gas rewards program and massive storewide mark-up&#8230;what happens when oil goes up again? It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re not even trying!), advertised sale prices actually not discounted from the regular price (Hy-Vee again, in their pet section), &#8216;selected varieties&#8217; of products being valid for discounts, retailers working with suppliers to make sure model numbers differ to avoid price competition (Best Buy&#8217;s calling card for years now.) Target, for the longest time, even refused to compete with its own website&#8217;s prices!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The allure of the sale triumphs over any real savings actualized by customers. For each time a couponer makes out like a bandit, a hundred others now end up having to pay more, in the exact same way that shrink requires at least $500 of additional sales to recover. Couple that with loose&#8211;charitably put&#8211;fiscal policies from Washington, and we wonder why prices skyrocket and Black Friday deals haven&#8217;t actually been worth waiting up for in three years. (And the things that are the subject of BF doorbuster deals seem to be cheaper and crappier than ever before.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh, and by the way, firsthand experience in monitoring hotel revenue dictates that deals on hotel rooms via third-party deep discount websites are largely savings-neutral, and end up raising rack rates for everyone else, which then results in even less savings next time you log on. Different segment of the retail industry, same principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, the answer isn&#8217;t as simple as not patronizing retailers with rewards programs and gimmick keycard programs: it&#8217;s a ubiquitous part of commercial life. Unfortunately, the Ron Johnsons of the world have the right idea: cut through the smoke and break the mirrors and provide real value directly to consumers. We don&#8217;t bite because we don&#8217;t see flashy advertisements and sales signs. We&#8217;ve allowed the free market to be controlled, and refuse to vote with our pocketbooks. Something about the eternal price for liberty being vigilance. (Meh. ZOMG!!!1!!!1!! another weekend sale!) Couponing and Grouponing fail to solve the problem, rather they contribute to it by giving businesses license to raise prices without consequence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The same can be said for the whole health care debate and the ACA, but that&#8217;s another discussion for another day. Suffice it to say that we can&#8217;t complain about escalating prices while expecting discounted rates without consequence. Last I checked, effects have causes, which have effects, which have causes&#8230;you get the idea.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, when we clip coupons and refuse to demand wholesale changes in retail dynamics (truth in pricing, call retailers&#8217; bluffs, etc.), we&#8217;re only bleeding ourselves dry, and hurting other people&#8217;s pocketbooks in the process. Running with scissors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Plus, what does one do with 647 bottles of poppyseed vinaigrette salad dressing bought for 31 cents, anyway? OK, fine, that was a cheap shot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, we can never claim it&#8217;s a corporate greed problem when we are equally complicit in allowing stores to raise prices without the restraints built into a truly free (read: truly competitive) marketplace. Freedom requires both responsibility and accountability, and the current state of affairs demonstrates that neither buyer nor seller are particularly interested in either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saving a buck for the sake of saving a buck, be it a store&#8217;s rewards program, or a consumer&#8217;s thirst for savings at any cost, leaves us all all the poorer.</p>

<p><em><strong>Myself and Friend Nawab standing at the entrance to Chicken Street</strong></em></p>
<p>As I’ve stated in earlier posts, Afghanistan was once famous as a passage from East to West for trading empires.  And Kabul, while an ancient city, was not really historically the center of Afghanistan, until relatively recently.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-shuja_shah_durrani_of_afghanistan_in_1839.jpg"><img id="i-1212" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-shuja_shah_durrani_of_afghanistan_in_1839.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>Kabul used to be a place where livestock and other trading goods were exchanged and stored.  It is my theory that the city was founded where it is because the Kabul River came so close to the mountains in the part of Police District 1 known as “The Lion’s Gate”, that it made a handy place to pen up livestock.  Traders only really needed to put some barriers across the narrow corridor there and they had an instant pen.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-upper_bala_hissar_from_west_kabul_in_1879.jpg"><img id="i-1214" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-upper_bala_hissar_from_west_kabul_in_1879.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Bala Hisar circa 1879 &#8211; Photo by John Burke</strong></em></p>
<p>From there, the city grew along natural patterns based on terrain and socio-cultural pressures.  The area just past “The Lion’s Gate” made up the Shar-e Bazaar of Kabul, which was dominated by the fortress Bala Hisar.  The other main fortress was across the Kabul River in farm country, and that fortress was called Sher Pur.</p>
<p>In 1879, the British invaded Afghanistan for the second time, (the first time was from 1838 – 1842, which ended in the complete destruction of the British Army there) and when the British consul was killed, they burned the original Shar-e Bazaar, which was located at the foot of the Bala Hisar, in what is now known as Police District 1.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/move-to-chicken-street.jpg"><img id="i-1193" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/move-to-chicken-street.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Map from the paper &#8220;Recent Developments in Kabul&#8217;s Shar-e-Naw and Central Bazaar Districts&#8221; by Andreas Dittmann</strong></em></p>
<p>The area still has an extensive market, but the city grew northwest, across the river, towards the Sher Pur fort after the destruction of the old Bazaar, in an area that is now known as Shar-e Naw, which means “New City”.  And when the Civil War came, Bala Hisar was fought over extensively, which resulted in even more destruction of Shar-e Bazaar.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/storefronts.jpg"><img id="i-1217" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/storefronts.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Chicken Street </strong></em></p>
<p>Shar-e Naw was largely untouched by the Civil War, which preserved two of its most noted features; Shar-e Naw park and the Central Bazaar, more popularly known as “Kuchi Murgha” or “Chicken Street.”</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/clothes.jpg"><img id="i-1219" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/clothes.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>Chicken Street is a wondrous place, where Westerners may come to see, smell, touch, and purchase nearly everything that is exotic about the East.  80 carat Emerald?  I’ve seen and fondled one there. Lapis lazuli, rubies, tourmaline, you name it.  Afghan carpets?  Tons of them.  Exotic foods, to include a French bistro, where one can hang out with supermodel-looking girls?  Check.  How about a one of a kind Model 1895 big game rifle, just like Teddy Roosevelt used?  I’ve played with one there.</p>

<p>There are artists painting and selling their paintings.  Fresh fruits, vegetables and exotic spices, including really high quality saffron at bargain basement prices.  Nuristani carved furniture.  I’ve even seen the cape from an endangered Snow Leopard.  Ancient coins and other antiquities abound.  And the beggars are plentiful and even entertaining, with my favorite being a young man who does a comedic imitation of a beggar, intentionally making ridiculous claims of his families’ hardships and then laughing about it after.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/old-man.jpg"><img id="i-1222" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/old-man.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>But starting about 2010, the people who own the property made a huge mistake.  In their excitement to maximize profits and to make the experience more modern, they started destroying the cozy run down little shops that made the experience so cool.  Some of the old shops are still there.  My friend Wahid, whose carpet shop appears to be an 8 x 10 foot room, but if you check out as being “ok” you are invited back to a rat’s warren of passageways until you arrive at the upper floor, which is large and luxuriant.  Some of my best memories are of sitting at his table, drinking chai and eating his Herati snacks while discussing the problems of Afghanistan, America and the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rubble.jpg"><img id="i-1224" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rubble.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Rubble from the shop tear down </strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/modern.jpg"><img id="i-1226" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/modern.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Modern buildings replace the old</strong></em></p>
<p>But these little shops are gradually being torn down and are replaced by huge, chrome and glass multi-story mega-complexes.  Unfortunately, as this construction is going up, potential customers for the business they promise were not going to Chicken Street anymore because of Western risk aversion and withdrawal from Afghanistan. And for Westerners, the greatest attraction to Chicken Street was its cool and exotic feel.  Ironically, if you want the flavor of the “old” Chicken Street, you need to go back South East, over the river to Shar-e Bazaar.  Shar-e Bazaar has been somewhat restored to its mysterious, intriguing and inviting self.  But I have yet to see another Westerner there.  Really adventurous shoppers will stop and have a bowl of Shorwa, or soup, at one of the many mobile carts, there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="alignright zemanta-img" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22476926@N03/3640140647" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Formica rufa" alt="Formica rufa " src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2469/3640140647_87f2d98143_m.jpg" height="240" width="162" /></a>Several years ago, scientists published an excellent study about how desert ants find their way home after foraging.  The story got a lot of media attention; unfortunately,  much of the coverage described the ants &#8220;counting steps&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t what the researchers reported and feeds into existing myths rather than broadening our scope.  To explain what I think is wrong with that approach, I&#8217;m going to tell you a story about ants on stilts, body swapping and how we perceive space.<span id="more-2322"></span></p>
<p>The actual study was quite straightforward. Unlike many other ants, Saharan desert ants (<em>Cataglyphis fortis</em>) don&#8217;t use chemical trails to navigate between their nest and a food source.  Instead, they use a &#8220;path integrator&#8221; to calculate the direct route home after their meandering outward journey.  Scientists knew that the ants used a compass based on sunlight to judge direction, but not how they determined the distance. Researchers had already shot down several ideas, like using visual cues or estimates of energy usage, so the team decided to test a very old idea: that the ants might be using the number of steps taken to reckon distance. The crucial experiment was to change the length of the returning worker&#8217;s steps by gluing pig bristles to their legs to artificially lengthen them. When this was done, the ants took longer strides and ended up overshooting their return trip. The converse experiment also worked: ants with shortened legs had a shorter stride and so overestimated how far they&#8217;d gone, stopping before they had reached the nest entrance.  After spending a day in the nest, the ants had adjusted to their new legs and were able to make it out and back to the feeding site without any trouble.  It was a really neat experiment and did a great job of showing that these ants calculate distance based on how many steps they&#8217;ve taken.  The researchers called this a &#8220;step integrator&#8221; or &#8220;loosely speaking, a step counter, although the ants most probably do not literally count&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Unfortunately, a lot of the coverage of this story gives the impression the ants really are counting, which isn&#8217;t what the paper claimed. NPR wrote about it under the headline &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2011/06/01/120587095/ants-that-count">Ants That Count!</a>&#8221; while Livescience went with &#8220;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/871-ants-marching-count-steps.html">When Ants Go Marching, They Count Their Steps</a>&#8220;.  To their credit, I think New Scientist actually <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9436-ants-use-pedometers-to-find-home.html">covered the story</a> quite well.  A &#8220;step integrator&#8221; gives the ants a sense of distance based on how many steps they&#8217;ve taken, but that&#8217;s not the same as counting steps.  Science writers always face the challenging task of simplifying a complex subject which is often full of nuances.  There&#8217;s always the risk of oversimplifying, which not only does a disservice to readers but can also feed various social myths and constructs, including how special humans are and the onward march of progress.  In this case, I think the simplified version draws from and supports the pervasive and enduring myth of a chain of being, with humans at the top and &#8220;lower&#8221; animals, little more than automata, at the bottom.  In fact, at its core a step integrator might not be so different from the way we build our sense of time and space &#8212; which is where the body swapping comes in.</p>
<p>The neuroscientists at the Brain, Body and Self lab of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm regularly make volunteers swap bodies with different kinds of dolls and mannequins to investigate our sense of self.  In 2011, they decided to see what the world would look like from bodies that were much bigger or smaller than usual.  Participants wore a headset which gave them a first person view of a doll&#8217;s body lying in the same position as them.  They saw the leg of the doll being stroked at the same time as someone stroked their leg; the combination of touch and sight tricked their brain into thinking the doll&#8217;s body was their own.  When the doll was threatened with a knife, participants unconsciously responded &#8212; breaking into a sweat and showing a change in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=skin+conductance&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSkin_conductance&amp;ei=ANycUNS0PMrH0QXPoYH4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzwSGNYo-BY7etwfIO2XftcF6o1A">skin conductance</a>.  As though body swapping wasn&#8217;t enough, the team wanted to see how this would affect the perception of size and distance.  The participants consistently over- or under-estimated, depending on how big the doll was. People who had swapped bodies with a little Barbie doll thought they were in a world of giants, vastly overestimating how big or how far away everything was.  Meanwhile, those who had swapped into 400cm tall bodies felt like they <em>were </em>giants, thinking everything was tiny and close by.  This was true regardless of whether people estimated the distances verbally or tried to walk to an object while blind-folded.  It turns out that our brains use our body size to measure space; when we look through the eyes of giants or Lilliputians, everything gets scaled up or down accordingly.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, the ants most probably aren&#8217;t literally counting their steps.  Instead, the number of steps taken gives them a sense of how far they&#8217;ve travelled.  The body swapping experiments show that humans do something similar, estimating distance based on the size of their body, and make the same kinds of mistakes when their stride length doesn&#8217;t match their expectations.  Though the particulars of the mechanism might be very different, in both studies distance is estimated through some kind of sensation of a body &#8212; whether it&#8217;s based on stride length or body size.  Yet we persist in describing many organisms as simple automata, sensing and counting and responding, while reserving &#8220;awareness&#8221; for ourselves.  This viewpoint informs how we approach the world around us, as well as how we conduct and report science.  I <a title="Five common biology myths (or “Science in the service of the anthropocentric patriarchy”)" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/five-common-biology-myths/">disagree with it</a> and am glad to see <a title="Social wasps are specialists at recognizing faces" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/social-wasps-are-specialists-at-recognizing-faces/">mounting evidence</a> for <a title="Thinking bees and the concept of “sameness”" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/thinking-bees-and-the-concept-of-sameness/">unexpected faculties</a> in <a title="Pointing ravens and theory of mind" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/04/pointing-ravens/">other organisms</a>.  I have no idea how self-aware an ant is, but the findings fit with the possibility that they are aware of their body size and stride length, which they use to estimate distance.  To me, that&#8217;s a far more exciting and interesting take on the story, broadening our conception of other organisms and their own unique perspective, rather than reinforcing our illusions of superiority and dominance.</p>

<p>So, this thing happened.  It was called <a class="zem_slink" title="NaBloPoMo" href="http://www.nablopomo.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">NaBloPoMo</a>, and it was a national blog posting month, where some bloggers committed to trying to post in their respective spaces every single day for the entire month.  You know, I&#8217;m not sure why we pick November for this when it is already <a class="zem_slink" title="No-Shave November" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-Shave_November" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">No-Shave November</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">National Novel Writing Month</a> and contains Veterans&#8217; Day and Thanksgiving, but I&#8217;m pretty okay with it nonetheless.  Here are a few thoughts I have about the experience and some ideas I&#8217;ve gathered for making my blog better in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson one: substance matters <del>as much as</del> more than frequency.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, more-frequent blogging keeps my page views up, but page views aren&#8217;t everything when the quality of your work starts to suffer.  Lame, awkward, cliché posts are only going to keep even the most dedicated readers [Hi, Mom and Dad!] coming back for so long. After a few lame posts I started to feel embarrassed of my content and decided that I&#8217;d have to really write <em>something</em> or not post at all.  This decision was made the day after a photo-only post that I thought would hold down the fort on the day I was too tired to write.  A dear friend told me the next day, &#8220;So that fake blog you wrote?  I clicked over and was disappointed.&#8221;  And honestly, that&#8217;s how I felt too!  So, here are my goals for the blog in the coming year:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>A Content Calendar. </strong> So many blogger advice posts out there say that this is the way to go, and I think it is time for me to try it out too.  Now, having a content calendar may reduce the spontaneity of my blogs, but I think it will help keep things consistent and help me to meet my readers&#8217; expectations.  So, I&#8217;ve made plans for the rest of the month and will be trying out a few new things to see how it goes.  I&#8217;m not committed to a full calendar &#8212; it may be better for my style to pre-select topics for one or two posts each week and let the remaining posts come as the inspiration does, but we&#8217;re going to try it out before making that decision.
<p></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Target content. </strong> The most successful blogs have a subject matter or two that attract a certain type of reader &#8212; a niche, in other words.  To build up a readership that will actually leave comments and engage in dialogue about issues I care about, I&#8217;ll have to actually write about those issues and maintain relationships with the kind of readers who will leave those kinds of comments.  Thus far, my content is a little all-over-the-place, and I kind of like that.  So, I won&#8217;t be picking one topic, but I will be keeping this in mind and will try to tie each blog post back to the things that this blog is really about:  maintaining a positive work-life balance, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and adventure-ly.  I&#8217;ll still write about what I am passionate about:  cooking, religion, politics, social justice, travel and history, but I will try to keep in mind the reason I&#8217;m writing at all &#8212; to remember that no matter how busy and crazy life gets, who I am inside really matters, and what I care about deserves to have a place in my schedule.
<p></em></li>
<li><em><strong>A network of bloggers.</strong>  This year, I have fallen in love with some new bloggers.  As I study and attempt to emulate their successful blogging patterns, it is clear that these bloggers are real-life friends with many other bloggers, and that they all work together to cross-promote, collaborate, encourage and support each other.  When one blogger writes a book or joins an exciting initiative, their network supports the action, sends over blog traffic, and provides public and enthusiastic encouragement. It&#8217;s kind of beautiful. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to find my own network, but I know that really connecting with my subject matter and readers is the first step.  So, I&#8217;m going to work harder at &#8220;Like&#8221;-ing and Commenting on other posts, at using my twitter accounts to encourage dialogue and at supporting my special friends who are also blogging about their life-encounters.  Lately, my blog reading has been done by <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Google Reader</a>, so my favorites may not even know how dedicated I am to reading their content.  That is about to change. </em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson two:  words aren&#8217;t enough.  </strong></p>
<p>When I decided to start this whole thing, one if my first tasks was to download a photo widget from <a class="zem_slink" title="BlogHer" href="http://www.blogher.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">BlogHer</a> to add to my sidebar.  I discovered (1) that my sidebar had disappeared sometime since I last revised my blog theme, (2) that a full sidebar with a single photo widget is kind of awkward-looking, and (3) that lazy plans for filling up a sidebar can only get you so far.</p>
<p>Basically, my blog needs a makeover, in the beauty department.  Nothing screams AMATEUR like poorly photoshopped headers, random formatting glitches, and blurry snapshots.  Here are my plans for the new year:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Professional photography</strong>. And no, not by me, obviously. I&#8217;m thinking it would be cool to have some new photos related to the blog&#8211;I&#8217;m going to pick out a cool new briefcase and try to get really creative and fun. And honestly, it&#8217;s time for this. I need a professional headshot for my linked in account and with this I can kill two birds with one stone.
<p></em></li>
<li><em><strong>To learn all about widgets, sidebars, and other blogging gadgets and  gizmos</strong>.  I honestly have no idea what a lot of these things are about.  What in the world is <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HTML</a>?  And how do I change fonts, font sizes, etc.?  I have no idea, but I want to find out.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson three:  Blog challenges are fun!</strong></p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m going to post a blog every single day forever &#8212; but it was a pretty fun challenge!  I did pretty well at it for about 60% of the month, and was almost perfect during pre-Thanksgiving November.  There are blog challenges going on all the time, and trying something different with your writing shifts your perspective and deepens your sensitivity as a writer.  It&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>First up</strong>:  <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">WordPress</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/tag/writing-challenge/" target="_blank">weekly writing challenge.</a>  I may not do it every week, but I&#8217;m going to throw in the ones I find interesting from time-to-time and encourage you to do it with me.  It could be really fun!
<p></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Community challenges</strong>.  Once I find a blogging community or two that fits into my writing genre(s), I&#8217;d like to participate in link-ups as well.  This connects back to the first and second lessons too, but I would really like to learn how people network together, how bloggers choose partners and get guest bloggers, and how to build a conversation in this space.  All in due time, of course. </em></li>
</ol>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a wrap.  NaBloPoMo, or post-almost-every-day-in-November-until-Thanksgiving-distracts-you-from-everything was a success.  I&#8217;m so glad I did it and hope to carry these lessons into my blogging for the next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since it happened.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years, actually.</p>
<p><span id="more-3873"></span></p>
<p>I made clear in a previous post that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://meizac.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/i-blame-him/">I blame him</a></span> for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://meizac.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/here-it-is/">this</a></span>. As with any relationship, I know I have to take responsibility for my own shortcomings, and I do. They pale in comparison to what he did to me; what he did to us.</p>
<p>And why does it still have to hurt so much?</p>
<p>When will it stop hurting?</p>
<p>Without question, I am over him. I no longer love him. I haven&#8217;t for a long time. I do not hate him. It would not bother me in the least if I never spoke to or saw him again. (Of course, this can&#8217;t happen (and I won&#8217;t allow it to happen), because we have Z and M.)</p>
<p>What I am not over is how much he hurt me. He&#8217;s not only hurt me, he&#8217;s hurt me in such a way as to have a long-term impact on any and all relationships I may have. He&#8217;s hurt me in such a way as to have a long-term impact on any and all relationships I already have.</p>
<p>When I need to talk to or just be in the presence of someone the most, I can&#8217;t bear the thought of it. I can&#8217;t bear the thought of confiding in someone else.</p>
<p>The depth of the pain is too much to bear.</p>
<p>When will it stop hurting?</p>
<p>When will I be able to return to some version of the woman I was before this?</p>
<p>I thought I was getting better. I mean, I&#8217;ve told the story of what happened to so many people these past few months, and I&#8217;ve done it nearly every time without feeling anything. Like it was just something that happened. That, sure, it was a big deal at the time, but I&#8217;m good now. In fact, I told the story to someone today, and I was fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not fine.</p>
<p>I came home to relieve him from his childcare responsibilities, so he could go back to his place, and we, of course, got into an argument. He was angry with me about something. I can&#8217;t even remember what. Then, he made me feel like hell about all the time I&#8217;ve been away from the kids lately (even if I am still with them more than he is) because of work and school.</p>
<p>Then, I was sorting through some things looking for items to donate to the local women&#8217;s shelter, and I came across all the e-mails, letters and receipts from seven years ago. (I had them tucked away in case I need them when it comes time to get into all the legal stuff.)</p>
<p>I forgot they were there.</p>
<p>I immediately broke down.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even need to read them (and I didn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Sunk to the floor and started sobbing.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t stopped crying, actually.</p>
<p>I can barely see through the tears as I write this.</p>
<p>And, as much as I need to talk to someone, I don&#8217;t feel I can.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no one close by that I either trust enough or is in a position for me to bother with my stuff. And, for the couple of friends I do trust (but who aren&#8217;t in a position for me to bother them), when does it stop? Even if I did call them or ask them to come and just sit with me, when is enough enough?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply I feel the humiliation of him telling other people the most intimate details of our life, in explicit detail&#8230;so they could spit them back at me or so I could read about them in e-mail exchanges.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply I feel the betrayal&#8230;after he managed to break down the walls to get me to trust him; to get me to declare him &#8220;the best person I know,&#8221; when someone asked why I was marrying him.</p>
<p>I doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply it all hurts.</p>
<p>I often feel like I&#8217;ll never fully recover from this.</p>
<p>Why does it still have to hurt so much?</p>
<p>When does it stop hurting?</p>
<p>And why does it make everything else that hurts hurt so much more?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I admit it – I’m a <b>word nerd</b>; derived from the Latin <i>Dictum Nerdica</i>.  I’m also a <b>Grammar Geek</b> (ok, ok <i>Grammaticus Geekicus). </i>I think I was the only kid in 7<sup>th</sup> grade typing English that <b>liked </b>to diagram sentences.  My typing sucked but I could spot an appositive a mile away.</p>
<div id="attachment_580" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://themercenaryresearcher.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/doubleplusungood/wordnerd/" rel="attachment wp-att-580"><img class="size-large wp-image-580" alt="Credit: http://www.someecards.com" src="http://themercenaryresearcher.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/wordnerd.jpg?w=295&#038;h=212" height="212" width="295" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: http://www.someecards.com</p></div>
<p>I’m fond of adjectives, adverbs, nouns, verbs, gerunds, prepositions etc. (Please be advised: I don’t quite trust the subjunctive case, however). Our lexicon is rich with variety – we have so much freedom to express ourselves using layers of meaning, double entendre, metaphor, subtle shades of description; we have synonyms abound to choose from; we have slang – we have it all.  Yet we also have this:</p>
<p><i>I don’t understand why we have to have so many words to describe something- why can’t we just have the one and be done?</i></p>
<p><i>Why do you have to use such big words? Do you think you’re better than me? </i></p>
<p>I want to rip my hair from my head and run screaming at these sentiments.  Why would anyone want to relegate themselves to a limited vocabulary? Who wants to live with the choice of <a title="Newspeak" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" target="_blank">plusgood </a> or <a title="Newspeak" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" target="_blank">plusungood</a>*? I do not.  I need words – I love words. I love to collect them, pore over them, roll them around in my mind until I find the precise word to express exactly how I’m feeling or the message I want to convey.  And I often misuse words, at times to my chagrin, but there’s a lesson to be learned in that as well. It takes a little courage to use a new word. We are all of us vulnerable when trying out a new skill – and like many things, it takes practice before we feel truly confident.</p>
<div id="attachment_581" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 532px"><a href="http://themercenaryresearcher.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/doubleplusungood/words/" rel="attachment wp-att-581"><img class="size-large wp-image-581" alt="Interesting words ~ Photo Credit: http://djmorel.com/2010/06/09/a-caboodle-of-fancy-words-from-the-new-york-times/" src="http://themercenaryresearcher.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/words.jpg?w=522&#038;h=295" height="295" width="522" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Interesting words ~<br />Photo Credit: http://djmorel.com/2010/06/09/a-caboodle-of-fancy-words-from-the-new-york-times/</p></div>
<p>I also love sharing words – I want you to find delight in a new word. I don’t want to obfuscate with words &#8211; I want to open up a window to something new.  But you might think “I don’t know that word – it intimidates me”.  Words do not intimidate; they just are – they may be new and unfamiliar but you always have the ability to rectify the situation from ‘the unknown’ to ‘the known’.   A dictionary is a beautiful reference tool.</p>
<p>And never be afraid to inquire about the meaning of word. It does not imply ignorance – it shows a willingness to expand one’s mind and absorb something new. It means someone is listening to what is being said and desires to learn the meaning.   It expands one’s world as well.  My son is never shy about asking the meaning of an unfamiliar word – he never feels intimidated by ‘big’ words – it is that child-like wonder and curiosity that allows his mind to grow and take in new experiences. Adults need that too.   I firmly believe that the more we are willing to explore knowledge unknown to us the more we are open to new ideas. If I choose to limit myself to 4 adjectives, for example – my world is that much narrower and my mind that much more closed to anything that is not covered by those 4 adjectives.  I may not be willing to accept something unknown or different because I have made myself believe that ‘not knowing’ is equated to admitting ‘ignorance’ or I’ve convinced myself that the other person thinks they are superior to me.  This is just not so -</p>
<p>I’m not denying that people use language to obscure meaning – however, many people take wonderful things and use them for a nasty purpose – but we shouldn’t blame words when clearly the bloviating idiot uttering them is at fault.  I sincerely hope that when I use language in a playful manner that people are not thinking that I’m showing off or trying to make them feel dull &#8211; I’m just writing that which tickles my fancy.  I’m a huge fan of an awkward turn of phrase and arcane words.</p>
<p>Where am I going with all this? I don’t know – I just wanted to talk about words and how much I love them and how I think about them…Expressing these random thoughts makes me less <a title="Go on - look it up - " href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/fratchy" target="_blank">fratchy</a> (It’s ok – you can look it up, I had to as well – I hope you like it…it’s become a favorite of mine).</p>
<p>If you’re interested &#8211; this is one of my favorite daily emails: <a title="MMMMMMMM....Words....." href="http://www.wordsmith.org/awad/" target="_blank">A Word a Day</a>; if not – that’s ok too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping for a wedding dress is awkward. vulnerable. Fucking scary.<br />
First of all, they make you write all of your identifying information down on a pretty piece of paper.  They even ask where you keep all your porn, so you know they really have you by the ladyballs.</p>
<p>Each boutique is different on purpose, because <em>they</em> don&#8217;t want you to get too comfortable.  Who are <em>they</em>, you ask?  <em>They</em> are the The Powers That Be.  The bridal industry.  Those doctors who insist you get an exploratory colonoscopy &#8220;just to rule some things out.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>different</em>?  I mean that all the rules change, bro.  In one place I was allowed to paw through the gowns like my cat paws through a pile of dead rodents.  <em>Expensive albino</em> rodents.  And in another place I wasn&#8217;t allowed to touch anything.  Indeed, I couldn&#8217;t even scratch my own ladyball without my <del>keeper</del> attendant yelling at me and swatting my hand away.</p>
<p>Another variable involves <em>unmentionables</em>.  When I first went dress shopping, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, and so I made sure I wore my best skivvies with minimal amounts of unsightly holes and skid marks, just to be safe.  You know, I even removed my leg hair and made sure my head hair was in socially acceptable condition.  The preparation that went into this expedition wasn&#8217;t unlike the grooming needed for a blind date where you were promised some <del>second base action</del> good conversation.</p>
<p>Once I was half naked in front of huge mirrors and cold because I was missing all my winter leg fuzz, I had to actually put some dresses on.  Getting into a dress was like trying to claw my way up through an igloo that had collapsed on top of me.  I could feel my world closing in on me.  It was hard to breathe.  My arms were stuck up over my head, groping through endless, fluffy white matter.  I could hear my attendant, just barely, reassure me from the other side.  <em>Don&#8217;t worry</em>, she said, <em>I&#8217;ll get you out.  Even if I have to </em>cut<em> you out!  </em></p>
<p>I requested that if she couldn&#8217;t get me out to please refrain from cutting of any kind and call <a href="https://psychobabblepants.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/vote-with-me-baby-one-more-time/">some hot firefighters to sexily rip me out.  And have some cold glasses of milk ready and waiting</a>.  At that point, who needs a bachelorette party, amirite?</p>
<p>Once I emerged with a second degree tulle-burn from the white abyss, a complicated pattern of zipping, tugging, lacing, and clamping ensued.  For a moment I was not sure if I felt more like Kate Winslet in Titanic when her mom is doing up her corset and reminding her -yet again- that the money&#8217;s all gone, or if I felt more like the stuffing in a Thanksgiving turkey.  Eh, the latter involves more butter so I&#8217;ll go with that.</p>
<p>Then I was made to stand there displayed on a platform while people took my picture and commented on various parts of my body as if I were that amazingly tasty-looking pig from Charlotte&#8217;s Web.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong, because I <em>am</em> rather tasty, but where the hell is my motherly, not-at-all-creepy, talking spider who is supposed to save me from torture and almost certain death?!  You and your web of <em>lies</em>!</p>
<p>Taking all this into account, I am somehow supposed to have an opinion about which dress<del> I like the best</del> doesn&#8217;t make me look like a <a href="http://www.film.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fat-greek-wedding-2-250-1345063817.jpg">Big Fat Greek sparkly snowstorm</a>.  There are so many things to take into account.  It&#8217;s gotta be slutty, but not <em>too</em> slutty.  Pure and chaste, but not <em>too</em> pure and chaste.  It&#8217;s a delicate balance. And remember, all this is provided the dress costs less than what Oprah&#8217;s &#8220;s&#8221; shaped poop goes for on eBay.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I feel like a poor barnyard animal lost in a snowstorm.  With no firefighter milk and no under the shirt action in the car on the way home from that cheap restaurant with the colorful crap on the walls because Blind Date Man &#8220;thought it would be fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>I must be a masochist, because even after all this, I am still going back for more.  I have an appointment at yet another new boutique for a week from Sunday.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
