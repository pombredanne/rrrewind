				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/809bulgan1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7156" title="Ger Kindergarten" alt="Jessie T. Ponce Photography" src="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/809bulgan1.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>They call them &#8220;<em>Ger</em> Kindergarten&#8221;.  Yes, they are right in the middle of nowhere and yet they are fully functional, some with as many as 20 kids in the enrollment list.  The name comes from the structure used, the <em>ger</em> &#8212; traditional mobile tents (<a class="zem_slink" title="Yurt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">yurts</a>) of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Mongolian language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Mongolian</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Nomad" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">nomads</a>.  The kindergarten is usually composed of 2 gers, one is used as the classroom / activity room, the other as the kitchen and feeding area.  A short distance from the <em>gers</em> is a flimsy outhouse.  Supported by an international donor, the <a class="zem_slink" title="Kindergarten" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">kindergartens</a> are equipped with <a class="zem_slink" title="Solar panel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">solar panels</a> for lighting, books, sleeping materials, and other equipment.</p>
<p><a href="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/290bulgan1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7139" title="Ger Kindergarten" alt="Jessie T. Ponce Photography" src="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/290bulgan1.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>The concept is an ingenious one.  Mongolian nomadic herder families move around a lot and, because of this, their kindergarten aged kids miss the chance to go to a formal kindergarten school.  The solution: provide a kindergarten school that was mobile and used a structure that has been proven effective against the unpredictable weather in the steppe. The <em>ger</em> was the best answer.</p>
<p><a href="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/623bulgan1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7150" title="Ger Kindergarten" alt="Jessie T. Ponce Photography" src="http://travellingartist.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/623bulgan1.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>Parents help determine the location of the kindergarten.  It should be within a relatively accessible distance to where most herder families have built camp for the season (the average distance between households/ger camps in the steppe is 30 kilometers).   Parents bring their child to the kindergarten via a car or a horse in the morning and then pick up the child late in the afternoon.  In some cases, parents ask the kindergarten staff to care for their child overnight.</p>

We had to meet with the kindergarten director in the soum (town) center before visiting the ger kindergartens. It always took us at least 2 hours in our Land Cruisers from the town center to the place where a ger kindergarten is located.</p></div>

An oven is used for cooking and to provide heating inside the structure. The only difference is that books and instructional materials line the walls of the ger kindergarten instead of the usual household items.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--StartFragment-->After watching Brett Gaylor’s documentary “<a title="RiP!: A Remix Manifesto" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/88782">RiP!: A Remix Manifesto</a>,” I was even more shocked by the harshness of the United States’ Copyright laws. Having known just how strict some of these laws were, it was still surprising to have seen what was considered illegal. I never thought of music by artists like Girl Talk who create mash-ups of several popular songs to be stealing. The first time that I had heard Girl Talk I thought it was some of the most creative music I had ever heard and developed an appreciation for his art and music. When the documentary further explained just how much it should cost Girl Talk to pay for the royalties to compose these songs, my mind was blown! Over four million dollars for one album? Over 200,000 dollars for one song? Pure insanity. This is a man using inspiration that he gathered from other musicians to create something completely new and extraordinary. Why should he have to pay for making something new and original?<a href="http://fivegirlspixelsandswirls.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/girltalkgt.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Girl+Talk+GT" alt="" src="http://fivegirlspixelsandswirls.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/girltalkgt.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" height="199" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the same goes for people’s writing. Yes, there is a fine line between completely stealing one person’s work and making no alterations to it whatsoever and calling it your own versus using bits and pieces to reference other’s works to enhance your own writing. In Kevin Kelly’s article “<a title="Becoming Screen Literate" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print">Becoming Screen Literate</a>,” he makes a valid point by stating:</p>
<p>“In fact, the habits of the mashup are borrowed from textual literacy. You cut and paste words on a page. You quote verbatim from an expert. You paraphrase a lovely expression. You add a layer of detail found elsewhere. You borrow the structure from one work to use as your own. You move frames around as if they were phrases.”<a href="http://fivegirlspixelsandswirls.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/creative-writing-prompts.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-103" title="creative-writing-prompts" alt="" src="http://fivegirlspixelsandswirls.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/creative-writing-prompts.jpg?w=300&#038;h=209" height="209" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Writing is somewhat similar to creating music or creating any type of art for that matter. The process can begin by being inspired by something, whether it is a quote from a movie or favorite author or something that made a lasting impression from an article. Someone takes that inspiration and develops ideas of something to create out of it. So far it looks as though there has been no stealing whatsoever and there isn’t! I think that writers should be encouraged to reference other writers or use quotes that hold a special meaning within their own writing. How else would some of the best works of our time be created?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we all be entitled to our own creativity and make or do whatever it is we want? Where is our freedom? If people actually followed these copyrighting laws, would there even be any music or books or movies or any forms of entertainment at all? As said in “<a title="RiP!: A Remix Manifesto" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/88782">RiP!: A Remix Manifesto</a>,” “Culture always builds on the past.” If it weren’t for certain musicians who paved the way for new genres and sounds, what would we be listening to today? It really makes one wonder.<!--EndFragment--></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="il_fi" style="width:450px;" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nqSJqVJamXY/TN8_4KK6ETI/AAAAAAAAALU/4nVy1bDV4CY/s1600/Warhol+soup+cans.jpg" height="394" width="437" /></p>
<p>What is it about consumerism that transcends culture and class, and what aspects are exclusive to our own experiences?</p>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t grow up in a wealthy family, my parents worked hard and chose to live beyond their means. They provided their only daughter with luxuries unheard of in former USSR: the best private schools, vacations twice a year and countless extra-curricular activities. We often watched Fashion Television together, and I quickly learned how to distinguish Versace from Valentino. We couldn&#8217;t actually afford couture, but we had a taste for it. Shopping was a highly anticipated part of every vacation. I was taught to look past brand names and pay attention to design. Rarely wasting time in high-end department stores, we headed straight for discount designer shops like Loehmann&#8217;s or Century 21. I loved getting deals on coveted designer names; it was empowering.</p>
<p>Despite my interest in fashion, I never devoted time to understanding why I felt  drawn to it. Did I just want to be socially accepted or admired? Was I trying to mask feelings of insecurity? As human beings we want to feel connected with others. Interestingly, we rarely discuss how effective consumerism is in achieving this goal. Andy Warhol&#8217;s pop art placed a spotlight on American consumerism, illuminating the obsession with labels, brands and fame.  Brand marketing sells a lifestyle; we buy the illusion. Warhol&#8217;s <em>Campbell&#8217;s Soup Cans,</em> for example, are the iconic image of mass production. Campbell&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t just produce soup, they sell the <em>security</em> of an American family tradition. Advertisements for virtually any high-end brand sell sex, power, security and happiness. Ultimately, I believe the indirect goal is always happiness. Yet, I am skeptical anyone really feels secure as a result of eating tomato soup. However, the idea of security is sufficient to solidify the brand in American tradition. In a similar vein, I doubt anyone feels happiness by accumulating shoes, even if they are Louboutins. I would argue people experience pleasure when they shop, and pleasure when they buy. Unfortunately, pleasure doesn&#8217;t last. We feel compelled to buy more because we are perpetually unsatisfied.This is also an integral component of addiction: chasing feelings of pleasure that can never be harnessed.</p>
<p>Lynne Layton, a Harvard professor who specializes in understanding social class and politics wrote an article titled, &#8220;That place gives me the heebee jeebies.&#8221; It highlights various experiences of class and consumerism through a psychoanalytic lens. Each of us are thought to have an internal representation of the class level we grew up with. Throughout our lives we replay this internalized experience in ways that are beyond conscious awareness. This theory may explain why people experience anxiety in certain shopping environments. For example, an individual who grew up with wealth may walk into a thrift shop and get the &#8220;heebie jeebies.&#8221; Their internalization of class is reflected in their anxiety, as they have an unconscious wish to distance themselves from the lower classes. Alternatively, someone from the middle class who became rich in adulthood may feel guilt shopping in high-end stores because they surpassed their parents&#8217; success. Alternatively, individuals who came from lower class homes may feel out of place in a store like Nordstrom because their perception of themselves is firmly held in their socio-economic status.</p>
<p>When I reflect on my own development, I recognize how my upbringing plays out in my shopping preferences. Although I love high-end designers, I tend to avoid wandering around Saks or Neiman Marcus, even though I admire the styles and designs found there. From a practical standpoint, I don&#8217;t go there because I can&#8217;t afford anything. Yet, there is something underlying that choice. I admit there is a frustration that goes along with seeing, touching or trying on things that you can&#8217;t possess. When I am persuaded into these stores I feel compelled to dress up in trendy outfits and pretend to deliberate between the Marc Jacobs bag or the Tory Burch. In my experience, the admiration for the upper-class lifestyle had to be mediated by middle class means, resulting in my dual perception of consumerism. It is both rejected and admired. The fact that I can intellectualize the trivial nature of consumerism, while pining over an Alexander McQueen dress, demonstrates the power of this phenomenon.There is an internal struggle that goes along with being a consumer in North American society: We all have to concede who we are with who we want to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The magician disappeared from the middle of the crowded room, never to be seen or heard from again. He left only one ice-cube on the floor, from the drink in his hand. This was at the after party. After he disappeared, we all went home. The next week, and because we had nothing better to do, we went to the magic show to watch the magician&#8217;s principal assistant pull limp flowers from the magician&#8217;s old hat. She levitated above a table, although only maybe, if lucky, by an inch. Finally, she invited an audience member to come forward and to the sound of terrible, piercing, cries for mercy from the very box inside which she had locked the volunteer, cut her in half.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  few recognizable journalists in the crowd were yawning, and the box seats were emptying out, when the magician&#8217;s principal assistant finally asked for a glass of water. When the second assistant brought it to her, we understood that she was drinking the very ice-cube (now water) that the magician had left behind. In this way,  really, she was also drinking the magician. After she drank him, we expected him to materialize, to come plunging breech-style out of a cello case.</p>
<div id="attachment_910" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 204px"><a href="http://sashersund.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dsc059131.jpg"><img class="wp-image-910  " title="SONY DSC" alt="" src="http://sashersund.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dsc059131.jpg?w=194&#038;h=129" height="129" width="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of <a href="http://yonaphoto.com">Yona Photo</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But nothing happened, and then we realized that nothing <em>should </em>happen. That was just it. Life isn&#8217;t magic, after all. Or most of the time, anyway, that was the case. Most of the time life was about standing in front of a crowd of bored people trying to figure out what to do next. She was making a statement. It was breathtaking, if not brilliant, and we applauded her for this, for seeing, even in this somewhat small but nevertheless ingenious way, into our very souls.</p>

<p>And that won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><span id="more-2340"></span></p>
<p>Take this press ad from Bulmers as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://interacter.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/story.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2341" title="story" alt="" src="http://interacter.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/story.jpg?w=169&#038;h=300" height="300" width="169" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that the brand has a wonderful story to tell.</p>
<p>Something that will make me all warm and fuzzy on the inside, sending me scurrying for the alcohol aisle in my nearest multiple.</p>
<p><strong>But I have questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One</strong> &#8211; do I really care?  As a prospect (I don&#8217;t currently drink cider), what difference is this heritage going to make to me?  Why should I buy it over another brand or &#8211; gasp &#8211; Strongbow which has visibility, brand presence and a track record stretching far back into my youth?</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong> &#8211; what&#8217;s the story going to give me (apart from the aforementioned warm and fuzzy feeling)?  I&#8217;m going to have to do something to find out.  Can I be bothered?</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong> &#8211; what&#8217;s the driver here?  I assume that the ad is aimed at current cider drinkers, more specifically at the ones wavering on the fringes of brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just not the target audience.</p>
<p><strong>The nature of stories</strong></p>
<p>We tell stories to build understanding, context, record events or create parables.</p>
<p>The narrative strands build, interweave, reinforce, communicate meaning, form feeling.</p>
<p>But this takes time.</p>
<p>The best stories aren&#8217;t told quickly.</p>
<p>They grow, develop, envelop.</p>
<p>As the prospect or the consumer, would you have the time to spend on such a story?</p>
<p><strong>There are two great ways to deploy storytelling in marketing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Visible Stories</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a cause marketer, then stories are perfect for you.  You&#8217;re probably already talking to people in the right mindset, people who will be likely to support you if only they could get just that little bit more information.</p>
<p>You can invite all of these people onto the mat, get them sitting comfortably and tell them a story.</p>
<p>In fact, you can advertise your story.  They&#8217;ll like that &#8211; and plan their day accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>2) The invisible story</strong></p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re a non-cause brand (that&#8217;s most of us then), your storytelling needs to be invisible.</p>
<p>You need to snare the prospect with stunning content, content which leaves them hungry for more.</p>
<p>The prospect must then be taken somewhere &#8211; online, instore etc &#8211; and infused with the story at every point.</p>
<p>But you <strong>mustn&#8217;t</strong> call it a story.  It must be invisible.</p>
<p>Each narrative strand must weave its way gently through the touchpoints, leaving enough of a tail for the consumer to grab onto, should they so wish, in order to find out more.</p>
<p>Because stories take time, the average prospect won&#8217;t be able to devote enough of their day to following yours to its present conclusion.</p>
<p>But if you can entice and beguile, they&#8217;ll make time &#8211; and they won&#8217;t call it a story.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll call it discovery.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there is one large problem with the whole storytelling ethos.</strong></p>
<p>Stories don&#8217;t include the listener.</p>
<p>The Harry Potter series doesn&#8217;t include you.</p>
<p>The Never-Ending Story doesn&#8217;t include you.</p>
<p>Folk tales and legends don&#8217;t include you.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have a starring role in anyone else&#8217;s story.</p>
<p><strong>Now imagine that you are the prospect or the customer.  When  a brand tells you a story, what are they actually doing?</strong></p>
<p>They&#8217;re telling you all about them in a way that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not telling you about you.</p>
<p>Their story might involve you somewhere along the line, but it doesn&#8217;t really include you.</p>
<p>After all, why would it?  It&#8217;s not your story.</p>
<p><strong>So here are my recommendations.</strong></p>
<p>1) Stop advertising the fact that you&#8217;ve got a story &#8211; just get on and tell it. Prospects probably don&#8217;t have the time to waste seeing if your story is any good or not.</p>
<p>2) If you&#8217;re not a cause brand, drop the big story entirely. <a title="More than playing with semantics: Don’t tell a story, communicate a narrative." href="http://interacter.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/brand-narrative/" target="_blank"> Develop a narrative</a> which contains small stories, points of discovery to surprise, delight and beguile.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, the big one:</strong></p>
<p>3) Construct your narrative  in such a way that the customer can use it to tell their own story.</p>
<p>Be a part of their story, and let them become part of yours.</p>
<p><strong>It might sound simple to do, but the execution will be anything but.</strong></p>
<p>Good luck&#8230;</p>

You&#8217;re at Auschwitz! (pic from blog <a href="http://atinainvienna.wordpress.com/">http://atinainvienna.wordpress.com</a>)</p></div>
<p>I was in London last week, marvelling at the efficiency of its underground rail service, the aesthetic coherence of its built landscape, and the unrelenting <em>rush</em> of its denizens. Quite a place.</p>
<p>As I wandered through some of the most popular tourist attractions &#8212; the Tower of London and St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral among them &#8212; I got to thinking. At the Tower of London, I, like most of the visitors, queued to <em>get in</em> to the former prison. I couldn&#8217;t wait to be set loose on the relics of its grim history: the armoury, stocked with the best contemporary weapons for hacking chunks from your enemies; the courtyard where royal heads had rolled; the windowless room in the basement of one of the towers, where prisoners had been broken on the rack and into which other unfortunates had been bundled and left to wither, die and rot. &#8220;Bring it on!&#8221; I thought.</p>
<p>As I slowly shuffled forwards in the queue of eager tourists, I wondered how the experience could be improved even more for us. Wouldn&#8217;t it be more realistic to have cadavers delivered to the Tower, then dress them in rags and scatter throughout the prison? Some could even be mutilated and decapitated for added verisimilitude. After all, it is a place of <em>misery</em> and <em>death</em> that we are visiting, no? Shouldn&#8217;t the sense of horror and outrage at the punitive measures that were deployed in the Tower of London be the focus? Shouldn&#8217;t we leave a place like this shaking and traumatised, instead of feeling satisfied that we&#8217;ve chalked off a major tourist attraction on the standard &#8217;10 Things To Do In London&#8217;?</p>
<p>Parents mingled with the Tower of London crowds on the day that I visited. They chaperoned their children through the sites, watched with pride when they were well-behaved in the torture section, and explained with relish how the rack worked. Good, wholesome, family fun all round, it seems.</p>
<p>Things were similar in St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral. I always thought that places of worship like this were supposed to be quiet, but instead, a hum of tourist babble echoed through the huge building. We tourists filed dutifully downwards, towards the crypts, where we blithely strolled over graves, slowly wearing away the deceased&#8217;s details etched there on stones, as we sought out the resting places of &#8216;famous&#8217; people. When the families of these people interred them in St Paul&#8217;s, did they have any premonition that the graves would in time become no more than flagstones to carry curious tourists from one side of the crypt to the other?</p>
<p>Is it a rule of thumb that respect for the dead ends after an appointed time; say, a century or more? Once the appointed time elapses, it presumably becomes an open house for marauding tourists. Give it a few more centuries, and your humble remains might even be the focus of an archaeological dig. Your bones might be unearthed, scrubbed and assembled for display in a badly-lit museum. Things of significance that might have been buried alongside you could end up elsewhere, cleansed of their once-precious relevance.</p>
<p>Some people argue that places like Auschwitz should be obliterated once the last survivors of the place die. They say that the structure should be razed to the ground, for fear that, over time, it would become stripped of the immense injustice that it symbolises, showered in toxic tourist credentials, and enjoyed by visiting families looking for no more than a pleasant day out. Sometimes, I am inclined to agree. Auschwitz will not be forgotten if its physical remnants are removed. Destroying it would also save it from the fate of becoming divorced from its context and bedevilled by banality, a mere tourist site to be exploited. In a much smaller scale, places like the prison cells of the Tower of London &#8212; where the misery of its inhabitants is literally etched on the walls &#8212; show what happens when they become significant primarily as tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Or maybe I just need to lighten up, don an &#8216;I love Science&#8217; t-shirt and plan a summer visit to Chernobyl&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A week or two ago, I had the pleasure of two customers have a few drinks at The American Bar at The Savoy. It turns out they were both bartenders &#8211; whose names and place of work will go unnamed &#8211; with one having visited before and the other visiting for the first time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like some specialist bars in London, we too are also subjected to the odd visit from industry folk on a Sunday, which is great to see, especially as five of their seven days are spent in bars talking and serving people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hosting industry folk on a Sunday has something I&#8217;ve always found fun. All kinds of subjects are brought up, from football to films, though the subject of booze talk is always inevitable, and it&#8217;s great to share views, opinions and information with like minded people whilst knocking up a few drinks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This particular evening I convinced one of the guys to try a new drink I&#8217;d been working on, and one that may be in contention for the new menu that we&#8217;re looking to put out at The American Bar over the next few months (the recipe follows this article). Even though I was only making one drink, I had the attention of both gentlemen, describing the thought process behind the drink and what led me to mix what it was I was mixing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it turns out, the chap whom I made the drink for said it was one of the best drinks he had ever tried. I was taken back a little at his forthcoming flattery, though I showed my gratitude nonetheless and thanked him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what followed next left me a little confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the recipe, or are you keeping it a secret?&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_761" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 342px"><a href="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/little-sisters-sharing-secret-by-viewimages-dot-com-72482743-415.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-761 " title="little-sisters-sharing-secret-by-Viewimages-dot-com-72482743-415" alt="" src="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/little-sisters-sharing-secret-by-viewimages-dot-com-72482743-415.jpg?w=332&#038;h=206" height="206" width="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bitches telling each other secret stuff.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without thinking, I chuckled (or laughed, or humored the situation, or whatever) and told him I would be delighted to give him the recipe, in the hope that he could make the drink for someone else in the future if the opportunity was right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sticking to the subject of drinks and new cocktail lists, the gentlemen informed me they themselves were involved in putting together a new drinks list for their venue. However, when I asked outright about the drinks, they said they were keeping it under wraps, and that they weren&#8217;t at liberty to divulge any recipes, or give any indication as to what kind of influence of direction the menu would be taking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem with this attitude was not so much the arrogance of the bartenders thinking that their product was better, wanting to keep it for themselves so they can maximize its potential and the effect that such exclusivity might have with regards to their respective audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where the problem lay, however, was that it was an example of what reinforces the social barriers that exist within modern cocktail drinking, the ones associated with those who put the cocktail on a pedestal and therefore put it out of reach of themselves because of its mistaken identity that only those with money and taste consume drinks in such a manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the speakeasies took over the old saloons and hotel bars of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the 18th amendment that brought in Prohibition did one of the greatest things within the history of drink; it brought women right into bar alongside the men. Set against a back drop of illegal alcoholic consumption, the speakeasy became a melting pot for the working and upper classes, and everything in between; no-one was above or below anyone, everyone&#8217;s opinions counted for something, including the women, who before the 1920s, rarely, if ever, set foot into the male dominated saloon.</p>
<div id="attachment_751" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 255px"><a href="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/prohib_lastcall_tx700.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-751  " title="prohib_LastCall_tx700" alt="" src="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/prohib_lastcall_tx700.jpg?w=245&#038;h=210" height="210" width="245" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Citizens of Detroit heeding a &#8220;last call&#8221; in the final days before Prohibition went into effect, 1920.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tiki movement that followed the years of prohibition and into the 1970s supplied the world with creative and tropical-themed escapism drinks, a trend that lasted more than 40 years, which in modern day drinking circles translates as several lifespans in an environment which see trends come and go fleetingly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the secrecy behind some of the drink-making aspects of the the tiki movement inspired the effect of curiosity amongst the general public, which in turn helped circulate the cult and craze that surrounded the Tiki movement in general. At the heart of the Tiki restaurant and Tiki bar were the drinks they spawned, conducted in such a way that top level secrecy was needed in the form of unmarked bottles and coded recipes. Tiki restaurants tried to outdo each other in terms of exotically-themed drink making, and employed the most secretive tactics to make sure their drinks weren&#8217;t leaked to rivals or competitors.</p>
<div id="attachment_758" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 159px"><a href="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/zombie.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-758 " title="Zombie" alt="" src="http://apintofgreenchartreuse.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/zombie.jpg?w=149&#038;h=224" height="224" width="149" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A zombie, holding a zombie.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the most famous bars and bartenders in the world have made their methods and recipes known to all and sundry. A perfect example arose in 2004 when Vincenzo Errico, a bartender at Milk &amp; Honey in New York, created the <a href="http://ohgo.sh/archive/brooklyn-cocktail-variations-red-hook-greenpoint-bensonhurst-recipe/">Red Hook</a>, a 21st Century version of the Brooklyn. Both the drink and the style of the drink became so popular, that it not only spawned another five spin-offs, all of which originated from Vincenzo&#8217;s drink, but also prompted Jim Meehan to produce <em>another</em> a twist on the drink, recognizing the popularity that was friendly plagiarism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Milk &amp; Honey in New York have recently released a new cocktail app with around 400 recipes, some of which have become famous over the last few years because their ability to be recreated and the willingness of the bartenders to share their recipes (and that&#8217;s even before you talk about the rife plagarism and recipe lifting that existed during the cocktail books of the 1880s and the 1940s).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The cocktail scene has come a long way in the last 25 years, though for the bartender who see the &#8216;exclusive&#8217; cocktail as a way to empower their position behind the bar, and thus increase their control over what the customer drinks, seem to miss the point of serving alcohol in an a hospitality-based industry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The UK isn&#8217;t blessed with the talent and infrastructure that is found within literary circles in the US. Sure, the UK can boast talents such as Tony Conigliaro, Ryan Chetiyawardana and Erik Lorincz to match the best of what the US has to offer in terms of drink making and innovation. But when it comes to food and drink writing, bloggers such as Camper English, Darcy O&#8217;Neil and Jeffery Morgenthaler have been writing about drink subjects for a number of years in a country that has embraced the concept of quality over quantity, to a point where the online content blossomed due to the dedication of quality research and interesting blog posts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even though the cocktail blog boom of the mid to late 2000 era has died off, there&#8217;s still very little to suggest that the higher end of print and online media in the UK will even come close to talking about the next twist on The Last Word or how bartenders are working Italian amari into their drinks to give customers new flavor combinations in a contemporary drink setting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this in mind, bartenders need to be mindful about what they create and how their drinks interact with the general public&#8217;s perception of how the cocktail scene is viewed and judged, especially those who are exposed to cocktails within mainstream popular culture (Mad Men et al).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secrecy and exclusivity isn&#8217;t a trend that is either fashionable or sustainable, especially in a financially soft atmosphere that has been effected by double-dip recessions. The power and satisfaction gained by a bartender that serves a product seen as mythical and en-vogue serves only to restrict the bright future the cocktail scene has, instead of strengthening the already solid foundations that transparency and information sharing has given the modern day drink environment.</p>
