				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a title="domokun-paddington station by shboom, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiger-lily/30505653/"><img alt="domokun-paddington station" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/21/30505653_6560fde0bd.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Domo-kun at Paddington Station | Fujifilm FinePix A101</p></div>
<p>Domo-kun, the fuzzy brown mascot of NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), has enjoyed a worldwide cult following ever since the internet exposed him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:God-kills-kitten.jpg" target="_blank">storming after a kitten</a> across a rolling hillside in 2001. But that scandal and his flatulent nature haven&#8217;t slowed him down. In fact, nowadays, you may see him in seasonal costumes at Target or emblazoned across the chests of hipsters, Hello Kitty buffs, and everyone in between.</p>
<p>Back in 2003, I coaxed this pointy-toothed curmudgeon out of his underground cave and have since accompanied him on various adventures around the world. He has gnawed on Slim Jims from a Nebraska gas station and indulged in decadent delights from Parisian patisseries. He has spied kangaroos in the Australian wild and witnessed the changing of the guards in South Korea. He has chilled with chicks in Italy and dodged bulls in Spain.</p>
<p>How did he come to allow me into his inner circle? Easy—I rescued him from what would&#8217;ve been a rather invasive investigation conducted by FBI agents Mulder and Scully, whom you might remember from <em>The X-Files</em>.</p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t taken a trip together since 2010 because he&#8217;s a busy critter and it&#8217;s hard to coordinate our schedules. Hopefully we&#8217;ll re-unite soon. Until then, here are some photos from our first two trips to England, when we hit London&#8217;s main attractions, enjoyed high tea at Leeds Castle, and explored the mystical landmarks of Salisbury Plain. The first batch of him was shot with my very first digital camera (a compact 1.3-megapixel Fujifilm FinePixA101), the second with my second (Canon PowerShot A80, which had manual functions and a handy flipscreen).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing photos from our other forays together so please check back soon. And for those of you who can&#8217;t get enough of my 1994 <a href="http://kalx.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">KALX</a> playlists, redundant as they&#8217;ve been so far, here&#8217;s one from 19 years ago on this very day. How did I think Operation Ivy would segue nicely after John Coltrane? And Miles Davis after Pinhead Gunpowder? My mind boggles&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Emily</p>
<p>My children aren’t great sleepers. But then why would they be? Although I’ve tried everything to encourage them to love their beds, yesterday’s Easter celebration made me realize I’ve also inadvertently told them all sorts of terrifying things, things that have planted little seeds of fear that they can’t really name or understand.</p>
<h2>The Easter Bunny:</h2>
<p>“Oh, come on,” you’re thinking. “Bunnies are adorable.” Maybe when they’re not the size of a human being. But you’re probably right, there’s nothing scary about a giant rabbit magically entering the house while the little ones are sleeping, depositing eggs in dark nooks and crannies. Where do these eggs even come from? The same place babies come from?! Isn’t the Easter Bunny a he? Gross.</p>
<p>And what was the ONLY animal that bit Noah at the Farm Show? It wasn’t a horse or a goat or even a chicken. It was a rabbit. Now it has a taste for blood. But no worries.</p>
<h2>The Elf on the Shelf:</h2>
<p><a href="http://fourtuitous.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_7094.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1935" alt="IMG_7094" src="http://fourtuitous.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_7094.jpg?w=440&#038;h=660" width="440" height="660" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a large portion of my days telling my kids not to tattle. And then Christmas comes, and I rely on a tattle tail to get me through the holiday unscathed. I even teach my children to love that little snitch. To make matters worse, I’m tempted to make her a year-long visitor.</p>
<h2>Santa Claus:</h2>
<p>It pains me to say anything negative about Santa. I love him. But he wears a red velour track suit, entices children to sit on his lap and then slides down the chimney when they’re tucked in their beds. This is the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<h2>Leprechauns:</h2>
<p>These mischievous little buggers reek havoc when no one is looking. And then they hide pots of gold where no one can ever find them. Worst. Hide. and. Seek. Ever. Just close your eyes, Chloe, that’s just a leprechaun hiding behind the curtains waiting to pull out all of the toys you just put away. They’re so silly.</p>
<h2>Cupid:</h2>
<p>A baby with a weapon. That’s not scary at all. Sylvie still throws behind her when she intends to throw forward. A baby with a bow and arrow. Oh good. And poor Noah thinks there is something inherently wrong with girls. The thought of Cupid butting in and making him fall in love with one could keep my boy up worrying for days.</p>
<h2>The Tooth Fairy:</h2>
<p>Just a flying creature with a fetish for human teeth. Nothing strange here. What is she doing with all of these baby teeth, anyway? Really. At this point, she’s probably built a kingdom made entirely of human canines. That seems fine. How about she comes under the cloak of darkness wearing this to finish the creepy tale:</p>
<p><a href="http://fourtuitous.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/toothnecklace.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1936" alt="toothnecklace" src="http://fourtuitous.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/toothnecklace.jpg?w=440&#038;h=440" width="440" height="440" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Etsy Necklace from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/102226012/vintage-tribal-tooth-necklace-huge-teeth?ref=sr_gallery_15&amp;ga_search_query=tooth+necklace&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_facet=tooth+necklace" target="_blank">TheDeeps</a></p>
<p>It’s surprising my children feel safe and secure anywhere. Noah, Chloe, Sylvie, I am so sorry. Let me comfort you with a soothing lullaby about a baby falling out of a tree on a windy day. Rock-a-bye Baby on the tree top&#8230;</p>
<p>Shhhh&#8230;Noah, that real wind won’t blow your bed away. Kids. Where do they get this stuff?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;">By Intelligence Operative Jay Holmes</h2>
<p>On April 15, North Korea will celebrate its 68<sup>th</sup> anniversary of independence. While the Western world will barely notice the celebration, it will undoubtedly be a big occasion in North Korea. Unlike the 4<sup>th</sup> of July in the US, there will be no hot dogs or hamburgers on the grill. Maybe there will be one half of a hot dog per person at maximum, and no ketchup. Generally, celebrations in North Korea take the form of televised military and party cadre parades with a strong dose of religious worship for whichever unimaginative Kim happens to be in charge at the moment. Other than that, it will be just another miserable day in North Korea.</p>
<div id="attachment_9899" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://piperbayard.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/korean-nuclear-test-usgs-info-poster-showing-intensity-wikimedia-public-domain.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9899" alt="USGS info poster showing intensity of Feb. 12, 2013 North Korean nuclear test." src="http://piperbayard.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/korean-nuclear-test-usgs-info-poster-showing-intensity-wikimedia-public-domain.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">USGS info poster showing intensity of Feb. 12, 2013 North Korean nuclear test.</p></div>
<p>On February 12, 2013, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test, detonating a weapon with a seven kiloton yield. Fortunately, yields from nuclear detonations are easily measured by other nations, and we know that the explosion was one-third the size of the yield of the atomic bomb that the US dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.</p>
<p>It was hardly the massive Armageddon weapon that North Korean dictator Kim Un’s propaganda machinery described. However, it represents a technical leap forward from previous North Korean nuclear detonations, and it is sufficient yield to cause thousands of deaths in any South Korean city or US base.</p>
<p>This missile test was yet another predictable violation of the latest nuclear weapons agreement between North Korea and the rest of the world. Why anyone in the US government would ever believe that North Korea would hold to an agreement remains one of the more curious mysteries of US foreign policy. My suspicion is that diplomats are instructed to pretend to believe that they have some quiet agreement in place with the Kim dynasty for political value at home in the US.</p>
<p>Even Madeleine Albright had to know she was talking nonsense when she pretended to be giddy with the “successes” of her miserable diplomatic efforts with Kim Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, during the Clinton era. The upshot of Madeleine’s diplomatic “victory” was to exchange US aid for the assurance that North Korea would not pursue nuclear weapons. Only the staunchest of Clinton administration supporters were able to convince themselves that Madeleine’s diplomatic performance was anything more than self-delusion. Madeleine’s “work” with North Korea did, however, fulfill one critical purpose. It allowed President Clinton to pass the buck to the next administration.</p>
<p>No US president since Eisenhower has wanted to deal with North Korea. Bill Clinton was no exception. Every US president arrives to his first day of work with his heart and mind filled with optimistic projections of how he will build his particular version of the “great society.” These optimistic visions generally start with something like a beautiful No Child Left Behind butterfly. Those visions then end up devolving into some ugly No Corporate Donor Left Behind parasite, but that’s a topic for yet another day.</p>
<p>And therein lies the second motive for the North Korean Kim Machine. If the first urgent goal of the North Korean government is to convince North Koreans to remain obedient, then the second goal is to be noticed by the US White House.</p>
<p>North Korea desperately needs the West for two important reasons. It needs us and the rest of the world to feed them. Like any undeveloped infant, North Korea is not grown up enough to feed itself. It’s too busy playing with military toys to learn that basic survival technique. Also, the Kim Dynasty’s entire 68-year-old Kim Marketing Plan relies on the perceived great and urgent threat to North Korea from the outside world.</p>
<p>Any time the North Koreans can broadcast a genuine video clip of a US president uttering the words “North Korea” without having to rely on their unskilled photo-shoppers, it’s a propaganda victory. In North Korea, a day without “international tension” is like, . . . well, we can only imagine what that would be like. Who knows? It hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>North Korea has also been developing a missile that has the ability to reach Alaska. Kim claims that missile can hit Los Angeles and Austin. It can’t. In fact, it is highly unlikely that North Korean missiles could reach the US mainland as of yet. It’s also unlikely that North Korea could equip a long range missile with a light enough nuclear weapon in a reentry device that would enable delivery to US soil and detonation.</p>
<p>In spite of the lack of a real threat, the US Defense Department has reinforced missile defense systems on the US West Coast. That reinforcement was intended for psychological rather than tactical benefit. Precisely what, if anything, occurred as a result of the announced reinforcement is a matter that I will leave to the Defense Department to (not) talk about. That “(not) talk” session would likely consist of a terse statement that the precise details of military deployments are classified.</p>
<p>For folks living in South Korea and Japan, including the 63,000 US forces stationed in those two countries, the view is less comical. For one thing, North Korea has about sixty-five percent of its military at or near the border with South Korea. Thousands of artillery pieces with hundreds of thousands of shells are within range of the South Korean capital of Seoul. While some media pundits like to point out that the US and South Korea could easily wipe out that North Korean artillery, they are assuming a massive first strike by US and South Korean forces before North Korea could launch a barrage of missiles and artillery shells against Seoul and other targets. And a preemptive strike by South Korea and the US is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>To people living in South Korea and Japan, the clownish threats by Kim are not just rhetoric. North Korea does represent a real threat to its neighbors, and it has a long history of attacking South Korea. Remember that in March 2010, a North Korean submarine sank a South Korean Navy Corvette in South Korean waters, killing 46 South Korean sailors. The following November, North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing three South Koreans. The South Korean island garrison responded with their artillery and killed about ten North Korean soldiers.</p>
<p>On March 26, 2013, after listening to a month long series of nuclear threats by North Korea, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye stated that North Korea’s only path to survival was through abandonment of its nuclear weapons program. North Korea responded by cutting its “hot-line” communications system with South Korea. Given that nobody in South Korea was ever going to believe anything that was spoken by a North Korean on that hot-line system, it hardly matters.</p>
<p>On March 29, Pyongyang announced, “The time has come to settle accounts with the US imperialists.” It then ordered North Korean missile teams to be prepared to fire on US bases in the South Pacific. We in the US could afford to laugh, but there was less laughter in South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>On March 30, North Korea stopped pretending to be <i>on the verge</i> of all-out war with South Korea and the US and, instead, announced that it is in an <i>actual</i> state of war. Fortunately, Kim has remembered that he is only pretending to be at war, and no unusual troop movements or communications have been detected in North Korea. The US responded by moving high tech F-22 Raptor fighters from Japan to South Korea. Any changes in deployment of US ballistic missile submarines in the waters of East Asia would be classified, but we may reasonably assume that, in the event of a nuclear attack by North Korea, the US would respond with strikes by US submarine launched missiles.</p>
<p>This morning, North Korea did something interesting. It announced the appointment of Pak Pong-Ju as the new premier. The premier would not be in the top five of the power structure in North Korea, but he would formulate and present economic policies to Kim Un. Pak was fired from his post as prime minister in 2007 after proposing some very minor U.S.-style economic policies.</p>
<p>This appointment is seen by Western leaders as a rare, positive bit of news from North Korea. The appointment of a North Korean who has dared to utter a few non-hateful words about the US is interpreted by some as a signal from Kim Un that he would like us to remember that he knows that he cannot hope to survive any war with South Korea and the US. It is also good news because North Korea’s most serious threat to South Korea and to its ally China is the threat of the complete economic collapse of North Korea.</p>
<p>While an economic collapse in North Korea might seem like a welcome possibility to distant observers, it is far less appealing to South Korea, to China, and to half of the 25,000,000 North Korean people who suffer from chronic malnourishment. China and South Korea quietly agree about two things concerning North Korea. One is that Kim Jong Un is an annoying twerp. The other is that if North Korea collapses, both South Korea and China will be flooded with millions of hungry North Koreans. Neither country wants to deal with such a large humanitarian crisis or the chaos that it would introduce inside their borders.</p>
<p>So what does this mean to those of us fortunate enough to not live in North Korea? It means that the US and South Korea have no choice but to remain prepared for war with North Korea. To the White House, that means annoying distractions from urgent domestic economic issues. Even the most loyal Obama lovers do not believe the White House’s recent optimistic self-assessments concerning the US economy. While Los Angeles will not be destroyed by a nuclear device from North Korea any time soon, it and the rest of the nation remain under attack by a home grown economic weapon of mass destruction. With so many foreign policy challenges to deal with in the Middle East, and so many millions of Americans slipping into poverty, Obama and the rest of the nation would prefer to not have to spend time and money dealing with North Korea.</p>
<p>However, Iran would love a war between the US and North Korea or between the US and any nation not named “Iran.”  To the north, Russia seems confused about what it wants in Korea. It can’t tell if a war in Korea would represent a net gain or loss to the Russian economy or to Russian foreign policy goals. The rest of the world is either unaware of the situation in Korea or simply hopes that war does not erupt there.</p>
<p>The greatest danger in North Korea is the possibility that, based on North Korea’s complete lack of understanding of the world outside of its borders, Kim Jong Un and his hard line pals in the North Korean military might miscalculate and trigger an all-out war. This morning’s announcement of their selection of a new “pro-Western” premier may indicate that, in lieu of a reasonable diet, Kim urgently needs to keep feeding his own subjects a heavy diet of war propaganda, but that he hopes that the US continues to not take him too seriously.</p>
<p>Yet in his confusion about the world outside of North Korea, Kim apparently feels that the only way to be taken seriously is to remain a military threat. He wants to be taken seriously enough to rate bribes from the rest of the world in the form of desperately needed food and oil shipments. My estimate is that North Korea wishes to remain one inch from that threatened war, but wants the US and South Korea to remain able to accurately measure that ever important last inch. In an ironic twist of any intelligence service’s basic goal, North Korea desperately wants everyone outside of North Korea to know more about their intentions than their own people know at home.</p>
<p>So far, North Korea’s war rhetoric has not been matched by military moves. Let’s hope it remains that way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thepurposeofwork.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lean-in.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-68" alt="Lean In" src="http://thepurposeofwork.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lean-in.png?w=198&#038;h=300" width="198" height="300" /></a>It has been hailed as a turning point in the feminist debate. It has also been written off as an apology for Big Business. And everything in-between. Sheryl Sandberg’s <em>Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead</em> has created the media whirlwind that its author intended in her quest to disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p>One hesitates to add yet more words to those column inches. But there’s an important connection that seems to have been overlooked. It’s why this fine book is ultimately flawed.</p>
<p>And it is a fine book. Sandberg may be wildly rich, absurdly well-connected and bossy – but it’s easy to like her [just watch her <a title="TED - Dec 2010 - Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders.html" target="_blank">TED</a> talk]. She’s clever and sincere and kind and, in some places, LOL funny. And she’s trying to be a peacemaker: “The gender wars need an immediate and lasting peace”, she writes.</p>
<p><em>Lean In</em> is helpful. It abounds with nudges &#8211; ideas on how we can dismantle the barriers that our subtle prejudices create. From the Goldman Sachs partner who cancelled his dinner schedule and insisted on holding one-to-one meetings with his team only at breakfast or lunch – so that he could mentor women equally and without any hint of impropriety. To the story of the hospital physician who decided never to ask for a show of hands when he turned to his junior medics on the ward rounds (men being typically far more confident of their own abilities) but instead would ask his questions directly, and always evenly between the male and female junior doctors. And the CEO of American Express who, knowing that women are more likely to interrupted, will always stop a meeting to point it out when it happens.</p>
<p>Sandberg cites, as an example of what can be done, an initiative at Harvard Business School to address the under-performance of women and international students. The school’s culture was rigorously examined and ‘soft’ adjustments introduced to foster collaboration and respect. In just two years, the performance gap virtually disappeared – <em>and</em> overall student satisfaction levels rose. In a more equal environment, everyone was happier.</p>
<p>Sandberg is not blaming anyone in particular &#8211; we&#8217;re all complicit. She’s trying to inspire us all to engage in a ‘final push’ that will give birth to a world where there are no female leaders, just leaders. And she’s optimistic that things are changing as younger people, both men and women, look for new models of family life.</p>
<p>But ultimately – as The Times reviewer described it – <em>Lean In</em> is a manifesto for ambitious women. That’s not meant unkindly. Sandberg recognises that everyone should be able to make their own choices, and that most women don’t have anything like her resources or opportunities: “I am fully aware that most women are not focussed on changing social norms for the next generation but simply trying to get through each day”.</p>
<p>To change the world, says Sandberg, we need women to reach leadership positions. Women at the top will, she believes, lead to fairer treatment for all women, and a whole new dynamic in the workplace.</p>
<p>It’s a worthy aim. But is it as ‘simple’ as this? Is it maybe even a mirage?</p>
<p>The work environment within which Sandberg operates is brutally demanding. ‘Commitment’ boils down to being what we used to call a workaholic. It&#8217;s received wisdom that only the paranoid survive. Sandberg cites research that 69% of corporate managers can’t even go to bed without checking their inbox. OK, she is a self-styled alpha &#8211; so she enjoys the pressure. But this increasing addiction to work is not confined to Palo Alto. Crazy hours are expected across many professions nowadays. And it seems to be going global as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it’s not necessarily because employers demand total commitment, overtly at least. Sandberg quotes a McKinsey managing partner calling a town hall meeting to urge the entire team in his office to take their vacation. Most of the people who were resigning reported that they felt ‘burnt out’ &#8211; but they all had unused vacation that they had chosen not to take.</p>
<p>Almost wherever we look, the workplace is becoming relentlessly competitive. It’s an assumed ‘passion’ that jeopardises family life. And as work becomes more hyper-competitive, women’s opportunities shrink. Pregnancy and maternity leave especially become huge issues. Sandberg acknowledges her own fears that – even at her level and with her talents &#8211; her job and prospects at Google would be diminished if she took ‘too much’ time off [that is more than a week or two] after her first child was born.</p>
<p>Sandberg acknowledges that it’s a rat race. “A career is a marathon”, she writes. She believes that getting more women to win the race will change things. Maybe that’s true, but there’s surely a delusion here? We can’t all be leaders. Indeed, by definition, very few of us can. We’re still stuck in a rat race.</p>
<p>What if we try instead to slow down and step off this devilish hamster wheel that we’ve created?</p>
<p>First off, I think, we would want to reflect on the <a title="Beyond The Culture Of Contest" href="http://thepurposeofwork.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/beyond-the-culture-of-contest/" target="_blank">culture of contest</a> that is embedded into our societies and so into our working lives. We have to recognise the <a title="Alfie Kohn - No Contest. Why We Lose In Our Race To WIn" href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Contest-Case-Against-Competition/dp/0395631254/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364578431&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=alfie+kohn+no+contest" target="_blank">myth</a> of the inevitability of all–pervasive competition.</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the attitudes that enable this, the behaviours that can best shift our work environment from hyper-competition towards cooperation are precisely the ones in which women typically excel: humility, empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sandberg isn’t asking women to drop these qualities. Her focus is on developing assertiveness. [And, as someone who often struggles with assertiveness, I have to say that I found her advice wise and helpful.]</p>
<p>But even if <em>Lean In</em> assertiveness can win the day for women, it’s likely only to further increase hyper-competitiveness. Women can’t fight their way to the top and then work 9-5 (unless they start their email at home at 5am, and continue to work late into the night after the kids have gone to bed).</p>
<p>The real challenge, surely, is to escape the culture of contest, to create new forms and structures [Enterprise 3.0?] that reflect the accumulating evidence of the desire for work that is characterised by reciprocity, sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>If we can do that, we can <em>really</em> change the world. Because in a workplace built on cooperation and reciprocity, women’s contributions would be naturally and unremarkably accepted. Mothers would be able to follow Sandberg’s advice to ‘Do What You’d Do If You Weren’t Afraid’ and take whatever maternity leave they think is right for their child &#8211; without paying a big career penalty. It would be the world for which Sandberg is calling, where “expectations will not be set by gender but by personal passion, talents and interests”.</p>
<p>Sandberg says that: “I have written this book to encourage women to think big”. It’s a book from the heart, and well worth reading. But to truly change the world, maybe we must <em>all</em> think bigger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been three months since you left to plan spaceship routes on Jupiter. My family is really impressed by you. Its a great opportunity and I&#8217;m in full support.  Fortunately and unfortunately, we are in love with each other , and now we are on different planets. So now I am sick and feel like I might die.</p>
<p>I read a Huffington Post article that said I should share with you the things I tend to do since you left for Jupiter, but I don&#8217;t trust my mind, so I have written them all down on these post-it notes.</p>
<p>I have been working a lot on this space shuttle I bought from IKEA. I&#8217;m going to come see you with it.  There are a hundred million thousand pieces and the instructions are in morse code, but I&#8217;m making do.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time with the old man next door.  He is always coming over, constantly looking over my shoulder and telling me how terrible I am at putting space shuttles together.  Why didn&#8217;t you pay them to put it together for you, he always says. I think I might poison him tomorrow.</p>
<p>When I am not building the space shuttle, I am doing things we use to do because they remind me of you. Is that weird?  Sometimes I will walk the same path we took to this place or that. Sometimes I will talk to you but you aren&#8217;t really here, you are on Jupiter. But even then, sometimes you talk back. I will see a doctor about this.</p>
<p>I made a pillow and I have been calling it by your name. This is your pillow doppelgänger now. Of course I don&#8217;t sleep now, so we just talk about you all night. I will see a doctor about this too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will go to the park and find a boulder and I will push it up a hill. This reminds me of all of the time I spent not being with you before I was with you before you went away to Jupiter.</p>
<p>I think about all of those space men. Are those space men leaving you alone?  Do they know that you are mine?</p>
<p>I think about all of those alien men. Are those alien men leaving you alone?</p>
<p>I have no use for Earth girls now. There is only this Jupiter girl.</p>
<p>I go to that bad mexican place for every meal. It reminds me of you. I know it made both of us sick, but I can&#8217;t help it. I scream a lot at night now, but there is a trace of you left there.</p>
<p>I spend the nights I am not screaming at the launch pad. I like to gaze at the path you took to Jupiter. Sometimes, if I squint, I think I can see Jupiter. Can you see Earth?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/800px-weirdtalesv36n1pg045_casino_suicide.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729" alt="800px-WeirdTalesv36n1pg045_Casino_Suicide" src="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/800px-weirdtalesv36n1pg045_casino_suicide.png?w=500&#038;h=311" width="500" height="311" /></a>I read a lot posts about marketing and selling books. For the most part, they say the same thing. To succeed, a writer (indie or otherwise) needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Have a website or &#8220;landing page&#8221; for his/her book</li>
<li>Use social media (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.)</li>
<li>Develop a &#8220;platform&#8221;</li>
<li>Build connections with a community of readers</li>
<li>Develop an email list/newsletter</li>
<li>Have an amazing book, a professional cover, and a catchy blurb</li>
<li>Make smart use of sales tactics like price points and free Kindle days</li>
<li>Never, never, never, never give up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering, though, if one more thing shouldn&#8217;t be added to the list: To succeed, a writer needs to be really lucky.</p>
<p>I can hear the howls now: Luck has nothing to do with it! It&#8217;s all about talent and perseverance and building a community of readers&#8230;</p>
<p>True. It&#8217;s hard to imagine success without those things, but I still think a measure of luck has something to do with it, at least in some cases.</p>
<p>And let me add right away that I&#8217;m not blaming my shortcomings as a writer on my lack of luck. And I&#8217;m not bitching about other people being luckier than me. I place most of the blame for my shortcomings on the fact that I&#8217;m a novice marketer, trying to learn the ropes as I go after having spent the last thirty-plus years learning my craft and living with the illusion that I&#8217;d eventually land a deal with a publisher who&#8217;d do all that marketing for me.</p>
<p>For the most part, I&#8217;ve been trying to do all those things in the bullet points above, some better than others. Success hasn&#8217;t exactly been forthcoming, but it depends on how one measures success. To keep from failing at that last bullet point, I measure success in terms of just <em>having</em> books that are out there and having had <em>some</em> readers find them through my efforts (directly or indirectly) and be entertained by my storytelling. If I measured success in the hundreds of dollars or in averaging one sale per day in an average month, then the measurement would fall short. I&#8217;m not there yet. But I can live with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m just finishing a week of free promos for my books after having launched the second in my Ace Stubble series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unfinished-Business-Ace-Stubble-ebook/dp/B00C02KRFY" target="_blank"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a>. I noticed that on the days when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-Back-Tomorrow-ebook/dp/B0071DMIDQ" target="_blank"><em>Take Back Tomorrow</em></a> was free, there were a lot of downloads (68) through the German arm of Amazon. Out of curiosity, I did a Google search and found that a German free-book-promo site had picked up the listing for my book and featured it; so there are 68 English-speaking German readers with my book in their Kindles, and a handful of them are likely to read it.<a href="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-31-at-6-19-57-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-730" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-31 at 6.19.57 PM" src="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-31-at-6-19-57-pm.png?w=500&#038;h=218" width="500" height="218" /></a></p>
<p>Those are 68 (potential) readers I hooked up with strictly by chance. Yes, the people who say you make your own luck will argue that I put myself out there and thought positively and created the opportunity by making the book free in the first place. But so did several thousand other indie writers on the same day. The people who run that German site picked my book out of thousands and featured it without any other input from me. Maybe they liked the cover, or the selections from book reviews I included in my blog post about the free day. And maybe if I&#8217;d listed the book on a different day, the site administrators would have been in a different mood or had their eye caught by a different book. And so it goes.</p>
<p>On other free days, I&#8217;ve had other promo sites feature my books, resulting in thousands of free downloads. And on still other days those same books (with the same covers and blurbs and the same outreach on my part to the promo sites) have gone unnoticed, resulting in a couple hundred downloads instead.</p>
<p>It strikes me as rather random. As do other aspects of success.</p>
<p>I was reading another indie writer&#8217;s blog where he was analyzing the wild but temporary success he had on Amazon after his novel was featured in an Amazon-generated list of recommended books; his was the only indie book on the list, and he suddenly found himself with sales comparable to the pros his book was rubbing elbows with. Upon investigating, the writer discovered that his book had been included in the list because it looked so good, so professionally put together, that the Amazon editors had assumed this self-published book had come from a small press. While the author did a fantastic job of designing and marketing his book, the fact that it got noticed by these Amazon editors and recommended on a list of professionally designed books was, really, just a matter of luck&#8211;something the author was quick to acknowledge.<a href="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/1926whybeunlucky.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-731" alt="1926WhyBeUnlucky" src="http://richardlevesqueauthor.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/1926whybeunlucky.jpg?w=324&#038;h=211" width="324" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Why that book and not one of the other thousands of solidly designed indies, or even other professionally published books? Random chance maybe? The editors in a particular mood on a particular day and having some indefinable thing catch their eye that on another day would have slipped right past?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer, but it does seem to me that random chance has something to do with the reason some writers shoulder ahead of others who are equally good, and oftentimes even better. And those better books never get noticed.</p>
<p>The same probably holds true in traditional publishing where one skilled writer gets picked up by an agent or editor on a given day while an equally skilled writer gets rejected&#8211;partly because the first one was in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Imagine the previously unpublished author of a teen vampire romance whose query comes up in an agent&#8217;s queue the same week that the first <em>Twilight</em> book shoots into the literary stratosphere. The agent snaps the book up and is pitching it to publishers in a heartbeat while the other queries in the queue&#8211;all by equally unknown writers, some with more talent and some with less than the author of the <em>Twilight</em> clone&#8211;get rejections because the agent can take on only so many new clients.</p>
<p>Surely there are books that deserve rejection, but there are others that, in a different week, would have outshone the book that got signed. Does being lucky guarantee this hypothetical author success? Not at all. But it gives that writer a hell of a better shot at it than the others who go back to the slush pile.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to sound defeatist or to say it&#8217;s <em>all</em> about chance. This isn&#8217;t sour grapes (I don&#8217;t have a bestseller because I never got lucky, etc.). No, talent and marketing and skill and savvy all help put the writer in a position where the odds are better. But it really does seem to me that, at least in some cases, luck is as much a factor as talent.</p>
<p>And in some cases, more.</p>
<p>No one seems to talk about it, though. Maybe because it&#8217;s something that can&#8217;t be taught&#8211;or sold&#8211;on a website.</p>

<p>You may well know this, but April 2nd marks <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/world-autism-awareness-day" target="_blank">World Autism Awareness Day</a>. Buildings and backdrops will be illuminated in blue to mark the occasion. There will be a bunch of articles in the papers, next to the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9703255/Traffic-fumes-linked-to-autism.html" target="_blank">reactionary studies about how the condition is caused by road fumes</a>. Even the day itself is loaded with preconceptions, advocated as it is by <em>Autism Speaks</em>, a foundation which appears to look upon autism as a disease to be cured, rather than a condition to be accepted.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ambivalent about it &#8211; there are days I wish Thomas could be fixed, but if he was, he would no longer be Thomas. I know too little about the scientific specifics of autism to know what&#8217;s best, but perhaps it&#8217;s better to have a day that&#8217;s created for slightly murky intentions but that you can use to your advantage. Whichever side your bread is buttered, there is much work to do: <a href="http://www.mysonsnotrainman.com/" target="_blank">clarifying misconceptions</a>, challenging prejudice and fighting for support.</p>
<p>But in our quiet part of Oxfordshire &#8211; for now, at least &#8211; the battle for acceptance is won. I have been overwhelmed by the grace and love that have surrounded Thomas in the past year and a half as a bunch of us figured out what was wrong and how we could set about fixing it. Nick Hornby, in the closing chapters of<em> About A Boy</em>, has his deuteragonist explain that in any monogamous relationship, &#8220;you need backup&#8221;. The same applies for families, and the backup we have here &#8211; from friends, family, and indeed from the system &#8211; is to be cherished and appreciated. We would not be where we are today without it.</p>
<p>This time last year I wrote a piece on <a href="http://thingsmychildrensaid.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/the-boy-in-the-bubble/" target="_blank">what it was like being the parent of a child with autism</a>. I stand by everything I said then. But this year I felt it prudent to let Thomas have a say. Except we&#8217;re not at the stage &#8211; not yet &#8211; where we can really ask Thomas about what&#8217;s going on in his head, and instead we are left with the breadcrumbs of his behaviour, where the things he says and does help form a composite. Or at least a sort of composite. You must be cautious, you see, when you are dealing with this, in order to make sure that the condition does not become the child. Because it is not everything he does and it does not define everything he is.</p>
<p>Still &#8211; until we have a hard and fast scientific principle for filtering the neurotypical from the &#8216;other&#8217;, we have nothing but warning signs discerned from books, observed patterns of behaviour, and gut instinct. Oh, and this, which is something Thomas dictated to his mother back in January, reproduced as is. They call it <em>New Doctor Who.</em></p>
<p><strong>Episode 1. The Broken Console.</strong></p>
<p>First I saw a broken console in my time machine. So I goed off to find the missing parts. I goed to the land of dinosaurs and had a piece of meat and a potion so I gave it to the dinosaur and then the dinosaur was fast asleep. And then inside some dinosaur eggs I found a dinosaur tooth. And then I found a time machine piece. I put it into the console and then I goed to a garden centre. I gave the dinosaur tooth to somebody who looks like a knight. I telled two things about the dinosaur tooth. Then he gave me a gem. Next I goed to Egypt. I had a box of matches and then a metal rod. I found the first broken stone then the second piece. I put it in the middle and then the broken stone was fixed. It helped me do the pattern right to open the coffin. Inside the coffin I saw a mummy and the time machine piece and I got it by giving the mummy the gem. I goed back to my time machine and put the time machine piece in the console. Then I goed to the lab and I opened a cupboard and inside was a heart. I put the heart inside a monster&#8217;s tummy. Then I found a brain. I put the brain into the monster&#8217;s head. Then I tried a machine. I pushed the lever then I made the monster alive. After that I found another time machine piece and I put it into the console. I digged up a plant a bit like a pineapple and gave it to a man then he gave me some spinach. I gave the spinach to myself and then I touched the sword and then the sword got out of the rock. Then I saw somebody. Her name was called Merlin. She gave me a time machine piece and I put it into the console. Then the console was fixed so I goed to a treasure island and then I said &#8220;Hurm this doesn&#8217;t look like home.&#8221; Then I was strapped up in pirate ship but I managed to get out with the sword and then I gave the pirate the sword then he climbed up the mast. Then I found everything I needed and then I made the cannon ball hit the mast, I made the pirate go into the sea. Then I goed back to my time machine. The End.</p>
<p><strong>Episode 2. The Fixed Console</strong>.</p>
<p>First I was on the pirate&#8217;s desert island. Then I saw my time machine. And then I said &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been messing with my time machine! How do I get in?&#8221; I could only go to a prison and then I found some oil. I filled it up in some bolts. Then I used the screwdriver to turn them. Then I moved the panel and inside was a circuit board. I put it in my time machine and then there were new places to go. I goed to all of them, then I got to my HQ. The End.</p>
<p><strong>Episode 3. The Great Boss Cube.</strong></p>
<p>I was walking along a path when I was in a silver house. It was cold in there but a bad guy cube rolled me up with his attacks. His attacks was fire. He was trying to defeat me. But I defeated him. The End.</p>
<p><strong>Episode 4. The Family met Saw.</strong></p>
<p>I was trapped inside a house with falling marshmallows. There were 100 and thousand of them. After that I found a TV. I wanted to watch TV so I turned it on. On there was a good guy Saw. He told me what he did. And then he did a very special job. He put blood on the bad guy Saw and removed the locks off the doors, then we could get out. Next Saw goed home, and I goed home. The End.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>There are multiple readings of the above. On one level it&#8217;s a juxtaposition of his obsession with <em>Doctor Who</em> &#8211; an obsession I&#8217;ve <a href="http://thingsmychildrensaid.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">written about elsewhere</a> &#8211; and the <a href="http://www.inkagames.com/j_categorias.php?lang=en&amp;inicio=0&amp;codcategoria=8" target="_blank">Pigsaw adventure games</a> with which he is currently fascinated, and which I reluctantly let him play on the grounds that they seem harmless enough (and I have checked, honest). On another level&#8230;well, perhaps there is no other level. With Thomas, you can never be quite sure. But you know there&#8217;s always something going on beneath the surface. And that always makes it fun.</p>
