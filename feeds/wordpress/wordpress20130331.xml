				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I came across this Solar System sampler in the Museum’s textiles store. It was uncanny &#8211; the arrangement of concentric rings was so familiar and immediately recognisable, but so strange when seen as a piece of Georgian embroidery.</p>
<div id="attachment_178" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 255px"><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0194.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" alt="Solar System sampler. T.92-1939" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0194.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300" width="245" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Solar System sampler. T.92-1939</p></div>
<p>The sampler is a piece of linen 35cm tall and 35cm wide, with the title ‘The Solar System’ followed by five lines of text. At the centre is a large diagram of the six innermost planets orbiting the sun. <span id="more-176"></span>At the bottom are two tables of data, either side of the date 1811. The design has been transferred onto the fabric with ink, creating a template for the embroiderer. However, only small areas have been completed in silk thread. Quite early in the project, this sampler has been abandoned.</p>
<p>The unusualness was reinforced by the other samplers in our collection, which bore familiar decorative alphabets and floral patterns. In the eighteenth century embroidery featured large in girls’ education. But practical uses like mending clothes and decorating soft furnishings paled in comparison to embroidery’s supposed moral benefits. Needlework required patience and concentration, and it kept women at home, focussed on a virtuous domesticity.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn1">[1]</a> Most other samplers of this time show suitably ladylike subjects.</p>
<div id="attachment_185" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 241px"><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0196.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-185" alt="Elizabeth Musto sampler. T.6-1935" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2006ap0196.jpg?w=231&#038;h=300" width="231" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Musto sampler. T.6-1935</p></div>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/history-of-samplers-18th-century/" target="_blank">V&amp;A website</a> for several excellent histories of samplers.</p>
<p>The turn of the nineteenth century was an extremely exciting time in all the sciences, including astronomy. New telescopes and methods in the hands of enthusiasts kept surprising the world with new discoveries. In 1781, England’s foremost astronomer-composer William Herschel confirmed the existence of another planet, orbiting beyond Saturn. He named the star after his King and patron, George III.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel-quote.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-181" alt="herschel quote" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel-quote.jpg?w=580&#038;h=139" width="580" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>Four more planets were discovered between 1801 and 1804: Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta. They were soon reclassified as ‘asteroids’. The census of comets, fixed stars and other galaxies also grew yearly.</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/detail.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-186" alt="detail" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/detail.jpg?w=266&#038;h=300" width="266" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>But the sampler doesn’t include new developments. Georgium Sidus appears over to the right without an orbit, as if it doesn’t quite have a place in the existing order. Its distance from the sun and duration of revolution were known by the mid-1780s, however they don’t appear on the tables. The asteroids don’t appear at all. Maybe the diagram for the sampler was copied from an older book, published before 1781. That might explain why the sampler wasn’t finished. Who, in 1811, would want to spend weeks or months working on a picture of the Solar System that didn’t include the newest, most exciting planets?</p>
<p>Women didn’t find it easy to participate in late eighteenth century science. Experimentation and discovery were not easily compatible with the ideals of domestic femininity – but there were women who rejected these social expectations and became active and renowned. Botany was dominated by female amateurs, and education campaigner Maria Edgeworth considered chemistry to be particularly suitable. In 1798, Priscilla Wakefield wrote encouragingly,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘there are many branches of science in which women may employ their time and talents, beneficially to themselves and the community, without destroying the peculiar characteristics of their sex, or exceeding the most exact limits of modesty and decorum’.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn3">[3]</a></p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_190" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 253px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel"><img class="size-medium wp-image-190" alt="Caroline Herschel" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/herschel_caroline_1829.jpg?w=243&#038;h=300" width="243" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caroline Herschel</p></div>
<p>One of the most successful was Caroline Herschel, William’s sister, who performed her own observations and discovered a number of comets. She even earned her own salary of £50 a year.</p>
<p>Girls interested in astronomy, if they were from rich families, could have private lessons. In the 1760s and 1770s this was quite common among daughters of the Bluestockings. Anne Emblin, born 1753, was tutored by James Ferguson, who wrote an account of their lessons as a set of Dialogues.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ferguson-title-page.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-179" alt="ferguson title page" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ferguson-title-page.jpg?w=232&#038;h=300" width="232" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The lessons provide a very detailed introduction and explanation of astronomy, staged as conversations between a girl called Eudosia (meaning ‘good thought’) and her brother Neander (‘new man’) who has returned from university at Cambridge.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn5">[5]</a> Books, of course, were cheaper than tutors and Ferguson’s publication remained popular into the 1820s. Among the scientific talk of light particles and gravity, are commentaries like this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/why-do-you-sigh-eudosia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" alt="why do you sigh eudosia" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/why-do-you-sigh-eudosia.jpg?w=300&#038;h=266" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/too-common.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-182" alt="too common" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/too-common.jpg?w=300&#038;h=280" width="300" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Another contribution to the body of astronomy books for girls appeared in 1787. Richard Wynne wrote his Geography and Astronomy textbook in English, and then it was translated into French and Italian by his daughter Catharine.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn6">[6]</a> He explains:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wynne-preface.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-184" alt="wynne preface" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wynne-preface.jpg?w=300&#038;h=298" width="300" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>In the early 1800s there was a general fear for the morality of England’s young women. The recent French Revolution had overturned the monarchy, the church, the family and the whole established way of life, and the establishment were terrified that revolutionary spirit would erupt on this side of the channel. Any change seemed threatening. If young women started thinking of their own education and interests above the needs of the family and the nation, this would surely lead to moral deterioration, collapse and revolution!</p>
<p>The Solar System sampler was made in this context of heightened fear, which makes the choice of inscription very interesting. The lines of text are taken from John Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>These are thy glorious works, parent of good,<br />
Almighty, thine this universal frame,<br />
Thus wondrous fair; thyself how wondrous then!<br />
Unspeakable, who sittest above these heavens<br />
To us invisible or dimly seen<br />
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare<br />
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine</p></blockquote>
<p>An apposite choice to caption the frame of the heavens. But Milton’s work was fraught with moral ambiguity – he was a great English poet with a clear Christian message, but he was also a republican who supported Cromwell in the Civil Wars.</p>
<p>In the next decade, both the Solar System and John Milton were drawn into the mainstream of educational practice, and in the process sanitised and moralised. The Religious Tract Society commissioned Thomas Dick to write their first astronomy pamphlets in the 1820s. Their diagram, so similar to the one on the sampler, includes all the new planets:</p>
<p><a href="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/religious-tract-society.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188" alt="Religious Tract Society" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/religious-tract-society.jpg?w=300&#038;h=252" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>And in 1828 Eliza Weaver Bradburn published ‘The Story of Paradise Lost for Children’. This reduced version of the full text was framed as a mother telling Milton’s story, but avoiding the political aspects. This was a common method of introducing classical and literary works to children, especially girls, to avoid corrupting their virtue.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In these books, access to knowledge is mediated by the specialist brother or father, or the watchful mother, in the domestic context of the lesson. And the most prominent Georgian female writer on astronomy used the same format.</p>
<div id="attachment_189" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 237px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Bryan_(philosopher)"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" alt="Margaret_Bryan" src="http://collectingchildhood.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/margaret_bryan.jpg?w=227&#038;h=300" width="227" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Margaret Bryan, from the frontispiece of her book.</p></div>
<p>Margaret Bryan published three books of Natural Philosophy for ‘the use of schools and private families’, and she ran a small college for ‘young ladies’ in London. Teaching gave Margaret a way to write and publish scientific work, without threatening to overstep the bounds of ‘modesty and decorum’. The introductions to her books overflow with maternal sympathies and religious fervour. She assures her pupils that learning science will…</p>
<blockquote><p>‘arm you with a perpetual talisman, which… will secure you from all pernicious doctrines, and guard your religious an moral principles against all innovations. Omit no opportunity of applying the lessons they impart to perfect every thing that gives either value or grace to the female character… Cull the sweets of religion, as you rove through the flowery paths of Natural Philosophy’<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn8">[8]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Bryan’s descriptions of natural phenomena continually reinforce the domestic, conservative point of view:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘In the centre of the solar system… is placed the sun, like the father of a family, surrounded by bodies dependent on his emanations.  These are called planets.’<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn9">[9]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Marina Benjamin has written that Bryan’s references to herself as a mother, teacher, and amateur, and her overstated respectability and piety, made it possible for her to stretch the boundaries of acceptability in other ways.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn10">[10]</a> By being overtly, even overly, feminine, she could publish her own work. Indeed, Bryan was well-received and reviewed in astronomical journals. To speak as a woman in science, she had to find a different, feminine language.</p>
<p>Writing about women shell collectors and embroiderers, Ariane Fennetaux has made a similar point about crafts. They ‘allowed women to experiment with fields and ideas that were traditionally associated with masculine pursuits’.<a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftn11">[11]</a> Women developed serious expertise in conchology while producing ‘feminine’ shell sculptures and grottos.</p>
<p>My experience of the uncanny with the Solar System sampler may have arisen from this same tension of scientific ideas in a craft form. This might also be a tension between what women wanted to do and how they had to do it &#8211; needlework was a way for this young girl to represent scientific, conventionally masculine ideas, without reproach. The resulting object refuses to fall easily into either category of craft or science, and simultaneously calls into question the associated ideas of what women should do and how they should do it.</p>

<p><a title="" href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/asage/Desktop/Solar%20System%20sampler.doc#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Rozsika Parker describes how the process of making a sampler using thousands of tiny, planned stitches was ‘intrinsically disciplining’ in her groundbreaking book about female embroidery, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine</span> (1984)</p>

As we know, this name didn’t stick for long. Understandably, French astronomers after the Revolution refused to use the name of a monarch for a heavenly body, so ‘Herschel’ was tried for a while, but eventually ‘Uranus’ caught on.</p>

tl;dr: read <a href="http://libcom.org/library/army-altruists-alienated-right-do-good">this</a>, <a href='http://jacobinmag.com/2011/01/hipsters-food-stamps-and-the-politics-of-resentment/'>this</a>, <a href='http://monthlyreview.org/2004/03/01/the-right-not-to-work-power-and-disability'>this</a> and <a title="pollitt column" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/167928/attachment-parenting-more-guilt-mother">this</a> in combination with <a href='http://nymag.com/news/features/retro-wife-2013-3/'>this</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently <em>New York Magazine</em> published <a href='http://nymag.com/news/features/retro-wife-2013-3/'>a long piece</a> about what it identifies as a trend of wealthy women who identify as feminists choosing not to work and instead to care for their children full-time. I&#8217;ve had a version this post sitting in my drafts folder since last spring, when some of these same issues popped up partly in response to the publication of Elisabeth Badinter&#8217;s book <a title="badinter book" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YO5CR1B5wtMC"><em>The Conflict</em></a>. I chose not to post it then mostly because, for good reason, it&#8217;s all so contentious. Maybe I&#8217;m less risk averse now. (Also for some reason I thought a good title would be &#8220;attachment parenting is a consumer good,&#8221; which is true, but man that&#8217;s a stupid thing to call a post about parenting on this internet.)</p>
<p>Katha Pollitt (who is right about everything), wrote <a title="pollitt column" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/167928/attachment-parenting-more-guilt-mother">a very good column in the Nation</a> last May about &#8220;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting'>attachment parenting</a>,&#8221; responding to a sensationalist piece in <em>Time</em> about the &#8220;mommy wars.&#8221; (I won&#8217;t link since it&#8217;s the worst sort of trolling link bait.) Pollitt&#8217;s point is similar to the one I was trying to make <a title="Sherry Turkle’s reproductive futurism" href="http://blog.tylerbickford.com/2012/05/16/sherry-turkles-reproductive-futurism/">in response to Sherry Turkle</a>, that most commentary about parenting and concern for children is really about disciplining adults—disciplining women—and that holds true for a certain version of attachment parenting.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m on record as thinking that claims that childrearing is a fundamental value are mostly just mechanisms for controlling women. But I do think we need a more complicated critique of things like attachment parenting that hopefully doesn&#8217;t require us to only value public activities and devalue private ones.</p>
<p>I want to highlight this point from Pollitt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Badinter blames intensive mothering for distorting feminism and pulling women back into the home. But <strong>one could also say it’s a socially approved way of withdrawing from a workplace that, in addition to all the usual sorrows and pains, has been sexist in general and hostile to mothers in particular, and of resolving the frustrations of the double day</strong> &#8212; women’s greater domestic burden. (These are also features of French life, despite France’s excellent daycare system.) America is famously unfriendly to mothers &#8212; no paid parental leave, a lack of affordable daycare, patchy after-school, long workdays, little vacation. Even legally mandated paid sick days are controversial. Individual mothers manage to negotiate these shoals &#8212; after all, most mothers are employed &#8212; but overall, lack of social supports is America’s way of telling them they don’t really belong at work. Their real job is at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the bolded part is pretty tremendously insightful, and I want to push on it point a bit, and also to question the implication that the specific reason to bemoan this state of things is that having a job is good in itself. Certainly we live in a society in which work is the primary source of social value, and there are very good reasons for valuing women&#8217;s participation there and for being strongly skeptical of attempts to encourage or really even legitimate a retreat to the private sphere that looks strongly like a retrenchment of gender hierarchies. (Pollitt: &#8220;As long as women’s primary focus is domestic, men will run the world and make the rules.&#8221; True story.) </p>
<p>But I also don&#8217;t think we can say enough that jobs suck. With a very small number of exceptions, jobs are alienating, humiliating, boring, stressful, time-consuming, unproductive, wasteful, physically and psychologically debilitating, exhausting, joyless, and terrible. Caring for children also sucks (because caring for children is work, and jobs suck), and it&#8217;s intensely wrong for folks like Turkle or attachment-parenting guru William Sears to tell women that their child&#8217;s well-being demands their complete sacrifice of time, attention, ambition, and individuality. I think maybe it&#8217;s also wrong to tell people they must have personal ambitions involving wage labor. Childcare sucks. Work sucks. We should revise our values around <em>both</em> of these things.</p>
<p>I think the issue is similar to a point David Graeber makes (<a title="graeber harpers" href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/01/0081344"><em>Harper&#8217;s</em> paywall</a>; <a title="graber full text" href="http://libcom.org/library/army-altruists-alienated-right-do-good">full text</a>; <a href='http://inequalityandsocialclass.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/army-of-altruists-graeber-harpers.pdf'>full text pdf</a>) when he compares enlisting in the army to getting involved in campus-based left activism: both decisions are about sidestepping the unfulfilling world of wage labor in favor of work that expresses one&#8217;s values. And both decisions are pretty easy to criticize as themselves alienated—I wouldn&#8217;t say that actively participating in US military hegemony is a great way to express one&#8217;s values, though I think I understand and respect the sense of solidarity and commitment to a (nationalist) community that such a choice expresses:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I always tell activists engaged in the peace movement and counter-recruitment campaigns: why do working-class kids join the army anyway? Because, like any teenager, they want to escape the world of tedious work and meaningless consumerism, to live a life of adventure and camaraderie in which they believe they are doing something genuinely noble. They join the army because they want to be like you.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how things like attachment parenting make sense to me, as an expression of noble purpose, purchased by relatively wealthy people the same way they purchase things like health care and education for loved ones. What&#8217;s being purchased is time away from work, and time focused on what they understand to be of much higher value: their children and families. Graeber again:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is really at stake here in any market economy is precisely the ability to make these trades, to convert “value” into “values.” All of us are striving to put ourselves in a position in which we can dedicate ourselves to something larger than ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Pollitt and Badinter that these parenting ideologies can be a real problem. But I also think that what we <em>want</em> is a world in which any person is free to reject wage labor, and I think that we want a world where care of any sort (for children, for the elderly, for other dependents, for oneself) <em>is</em> valued. We can and should be critical of the particular formulation of this value placed on the family (<a title="Sherry Turkle’s reproductive futurism" href="http://blog.tylerbickford.com/2012/05/16/sherry-turkles-reproductive-futurism/">again</a>, reproductive futurism is no good, or rather, it is all bad), but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right to say that acting on the value of intimate relationships over commodified relationships is necessarily bad. Rather, what I&#8217;d say we want is a world in which many <em>more</em> people are free to bypass wage labor and pursue the activities and relationships they value (and, of course, hopefully, for those values to themselves be valuable, where intimate relationships <em>are</em> but the gender hierarchies they presuppose are <em>not</em>). Similarly, here&#8217;s Peter Frase on <a href='http://jacobinmag.com/2011/01/hipsters-food-stamps-and-the-politics-of-resentment/'>hipsters and privilege</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The false (but not without a grain of truth!) intimation that hipsters are all white kids who are subsidized by their rich parents legitimizes this position, but even if it were accurate it wouldn’t make the attitude of contempt any more sensible. For even if creative and enjoyable lives are only accessible to the privileged, that’s not a damning fact about them so much as it is an indictment of a society that has so much wealth and yet only allows a select few to take advantage of it, while others are forced to waste their lives chained to their useless jobs and bloated mortgages.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, dropping out of the workforce in order to be able to spend time with people you love (or do any number of other things you might actually value and want to do) really is kind of <em>the goal</em>, and I think we&#8217;re missing something if we don&#8217;t recognize that this is <em>part</em> of what&#8217;s happening with things like attachment parenting. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite the same as the simple anti-politics of &#8220;choice feminism.&#8221; I&#8217;m interested in something more akin to the politics outlined in <a href='http://monthlyreview.org/2004/03/01/the-right-not-to-work-power-and-disability'>this amazing essay about work and disability</a> by Sunny Taylor. Taylor argues that disability activism has implications for many more people than those normally identified as disabled, partly because we will almost all be impaired at some point in our lives by illness or old age, but also because it entails fights for things like the right for <em>everyone</em> not to work: </p>
<blockquote><p>Western culture has a very limited idea of what being useful to society is. People can be useful in ways other than monetarily. . . . The same rule that often excludes the impaired from the traditional workplace also exploits the able-bodied who have no other choice but to participate. The right not to work is an ideal worthy of the impaired and able-bodied alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Valuing work too highly necessarily devalues care and intimacy and dependence, and certainly doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of room for the value of people who are unable to work or excluded from work. Or what&#8217;s almost the same thing, valuing work too highly can place such <a href='http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5452.html'>priceless, infinite value</a> on things like children and the family that they are all but value-less, so we get the reproductive futurism that we have, which is what leads to the current perversion in which actual care work is done for extremely low wages, or by mothers who are sacrificing significant earnings, social prestige, social insurance contributions, etc. One reason the parent-friendly policies Pollitt would like to see are missing in the States is precisely <em>because</em> work is over-valued here. The bizarre contradictions of a &#8220;family values&#8221; rhetoric that has no time for family-valuing policies like paid medical leave to care for dependents (like during the 2012 presidential campaign when <a href='http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/04/15/the_gendered_welfare_state_.html'>Mitt Romney was simultaneously claiming</a> the value of his wife&#8217;s role as a mother while arguing that a single parent&#8217;s focus on caring for their children denies them the dignity of work) make sense if fully distinguishing those spheres is the whole point of reactionary family values rhetoric. </p>
<p>This sort of parenting is interesting for how it involves many people who identify as liberal doing something that looks a lot like a more characterisitically right wing move—as Graeber puts it, it enhances the division between egoism and altruism (by enhancing the division between public and private), rather than trying to efface that division in the more traditional manner of the left. (<a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/02/homeschooling_and_unschooling_among_liberals_and_progressives_.single.html'>See also Dana Goldstein on the contradiction of &#8220;progressive homeschooling.&#8221;</a>) One response to that is just to say that these practices clearly aren&#8217;t recognizably liberal or left, and that&#8217;s right. But I think they are practices that can help expose or reveal where value is located in people&#8217;s lived experiences, and if I&#8217;m right to make these connections to Graeber and Frase and Taylor maybe that can also help reveal some intriguing points of odd commensurability between radical and reactionary cultural politics. Or something.</p>
<p>(For the record, the answer to all this is &#8220;<a href='http://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/09/15/silvia-federici-wages-against-housework/'>wages for housework</a>,&#8221; though as Federici argues, that&#8217;s not so much a policy solution as &#8220;the only revolutionary perspective from a feminist viewpoint and ultimately for the entire working class.&#8221; So let&#8217;s do that.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2100" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2100" alt="A pile of tat, image by watchsmart" src="http://callumjhackettdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A pile of tat, image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/watchsmart/463558212/">watchsmart</a></p></div>
<p>&#8216;Tat&#8217;, for those unfamiliar with the word, is cheap and nasty junk. Not broken or useless or second-hand knock-offs, but things that are tasteless, garish, and flimsy. When thinking of tat, you might think of those heavy bauble ear-rings worn by the woman across the street, or of the brown and chipped crockery your tenth-best friend owns which never looks clean no matter how much it&#8217;s washed. But would you ever think of a diamond engagement ring? Not an obvious fake bought from a market stall, but one with a pristine, $2,000, 18-carat diamond? You wouldn&#8217;t, but maybe you should. Rohin Dhar has written an interesting article about the commercial history of diamonds as a wedding gift from a groom to his bride, and it&#8217;s aptly called, &#8216;<a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/45768546804/diamonds-are-bullshit">Diamonds are Bullshit</a>.&#8217; His argument can be surmised by two choice paragraphs, although you really should read the whole thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next time you look at a diamond, consider this. Nearly every American marriage begins with a diamond because a bunch of rich white men in the 1940s convinced everyone that its size determines your self worth. They created this convention &#8211; that unless a man purchases (an intrinsically useless) diamond, his life is a failure &#8211; while sitting in a room, racking their brains on how to sell diamonds that no one wanted.<br />
&#8230;<br />
So here is a modest proposal: Let’s agree that diamonds are bullshit and reject their role in the marriage process. Let’s admit that as a society we got tricked for about a century into coveting sparkling pieces of carbon, but it’s time to end the nonsense.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2108" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2108" alt="The Great Star of Africa - what's the point of even trying?" src="http://callumjhackettdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/great-star-of-africa.jpg?w=300&#038;h=247" width="300" height="247" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullinan_Diamond">Great Star of Africa</a> &#8211; what&#8217;s the point of even trying?</p></div>
<p>Diamonds have been lauded and valued for centuries, as attested by reverent references to precious gems in medieval literature, but at that time they were scarce and so were the exclusive indulgence of the royalty and aristocracy. It was not until a boom at the end of the 19th century that diamonds could finally start their journey towards becoming a bourgeois status symbol &#8211; yet another conduit for men to compare the size of their crown jewels. But this was not a simple case of men finding yet another expression of vain materialism; the predominance of the diamond as a necessary feature of a wedding engagement is a peculiar phenomenon of the 20th century brought about by a few crooked businessmen who established a monopoly on the supply of diamonds to drive up their prices, and who then mounted a hugely successful marketing campaign to grab every groom&#8217;s cash with the threat of making them feel socially deficient or deviant if they didn&#8217;t buy into it.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t want to take away Dhar&#8217;s responsibility for explaining that history, nor yours for reading about it. Instead, I think this is a useful case for considering some broader implications. If you take a look at the comments section on Dhar&#8217;s article, you will (for one miraculous time on the internet) find some interesting thoughts. Dhar spends a considerable amount of time demonstrating that the diamond is worthless as an investment; once bought, its value instantly depreciates, so its only purpose is as a token demonstrating the disposable income of the purchaser. But if it is a sentimental item, then what does it matter that it isn&#8217;t a good investment? Well, it&#8217;s precisely <em>because</em> it isn&#8217;t a good investment that corporate shills sitting on diamond mines sought to emotionally manipulate people into accepting the diamond as of essential sentimental importance. The fact that you can so easily rationalise the expensive purchase of a useless item which isn&#8217;t anywhere near as rare as you would guess is thanks to their marketing strategy.</p>
<div id="attachment_2112" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2112" alt="Though contentious, this may be neanderthal jewellery" src="http://callumjhackettdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/neanderthal-jewellery1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=175" width="300" height="175" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Though contentious, this may be neanderthal jewellery</p></div>
<p>However, this success &#8211; one might go so far as to call it a con &#8211; could not have taken place were we not ripe to accept the idea that we really <em>should</em> measure our individual worth in accordance with the weight of the gem we can buy. There is something about rare things, shiny things, and otherwise useless crap that we seem to have a psychological yearning to possess. Humans have been fashioning jewellery and drawing pictures made from ground-clutter for thousands of years (and even <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jun/14/neanderthals-first-create-cave-paintings">neanderthals may have had such a culture of their own</a>), as we like to find inanimate, useless, unimportant <em>stuff </em>and imbue it with emotional and sentimental significance that exists nowhere except inside our own fantastical minds. Diamond companies found it easy to sell us the myth that diamonds are necessary wedding gifts because so many of us actively <i>want</i> this kind of bullshit in our diet of social convention. We may not have taken so kindly to it if we knew quite how much we were being had, but if we didn&#8217;t turn to diamonds, we&#8217;d have turned to something else.</p>
<p>So putting aside the dirty history of diamonds, we&#8217;re led to ask a more fundamental question about whether this valuing of symbols and tokens is a feature of human society that we should embrace or attempt to outgrow. There is a convincing case to be made for their central place in high art and culture, as the impetus which leads us to treasure a glistening shard of carbon might be the same that allows us to instil paintings with visual metaphor, and poetry with linguistic imagery. These are certainly distinct characteristics of human culture, but they are each founded upon the ability and desire to connect something mundane with something mystical, turning the insignificant into the significant. Oil becomes paint which becomes a complex and riddlic vision; words become rhymes which become a verbal transmission of universal feeling; and carbon can become a diamond which can become a sentimental display of life-long love. The fact that these emergent properties are not intrinsic to the physical objects that constitute them does not degrade their significance, though we should certainly recognise what direction the significance travels in &#8211; the object does not exude an essence of beauty or intrigue, that sense is something we impose upon the object ourselves.</p>
<p>Yet, just as the same raw materials can give rise to Beethovens and Biebers, innovators and imitators, so sentimentality can give us antiques and tat, and diamonds may still be tat. When it comes to these curious little stones &#8211; one of our hardest substances which can both be found deep in the earth and also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3492919.stm">make up an entire star</a> - we need to ask that essential question about where their significance is coming from and whether we ought to accept it. Personally, I consider myself both pragmatic and frugal, so I rarely think about any kind of item in sentimental terms (at least not for long), and when I do, I think <em>cheap</em>. I don&#8217;t express my love by obliterating my finances as much as I dare, I express it by thinking damn hard about something meaningful and then putting effort into making it. But that is not to say that this is the <em>right</em> way to think; it is just <em>one </em>way, and others who prefer to trundle along accepting cumbersome traditions should be free to do so as much as it satisfies them. But let&#8217;s not fool ourselves into thinking that the diamond is an innocent indulgence &#8211; the diamond industry is and has been a vicious one, and even if I were inclined to deplete my bank account, I don&#8217;t think I could do so on a diamond with a clear conscience. When you buy a diamond &#8211; when you enter the jewellery store with its tantalising array of expensive trinkets, all neatly arranged to catch your eye and tug at your consumerist guilt &#8211; you&#8217;re supporting a trade that has a long and dreadful history. Diamonds are very much the Biebers in the world of accessories, and though you might like to pretend that your unique choice exists in a vacuum and expresses your feelings for your loved one without regard for anyone else, you should remember that you would be placing yourself as a cog in a vast corporate machine that churns out these useless rings en masse, controlling the supply to control the price, with every last one of them as devoid of true meaning as every other because they are the epitome of unthinking materialism. If you can&#8217;t help but feel drawn to unnecessary knickknacks, think of something original, something worth the outlay and which can be bought without financing crooks. Diamonds are bullshit. Bullshit and tat.</p>

<p>These photographs document a trekking and 4&#215;4 journey through the Western Desert of Egypt. Starting at Bahariya Oasis we travelled through the Sahara Suda (Black Desert) and Sahara Beida (White Desert) ending up near Farafra. As a compliment to these images I produced a second, more abstract series of photographs entitled<a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/2013/03/18/sahara-sands/"> &#8220;Sahara Sands&#8221; </a>from the same trip.</p>
<p>The journey was undertaken with desert explorer <a href="http://www.sam-mcconnell-expeditions.com">Sam McConnell</a> who runs highly recommended adventure travel expeditions to the region in collaboration with Abou Anis of Sub Sinai, off-road driver Khaled, and the bedouin of Bahariya Oasis</p>
<p><strong>Signed limited edition prints of this series are available at £195 each (60x40cm). To purchase please <a href="http://blog.quintinlake.com/contact/">contact me</a>. Larger sizes also available</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Only a beautiful city can repair a broken heart. After having been turned away from my alma mater and missing the opportunity to bid my students adieu and congratulate them on successfully completing high school, I took my loneliness out for a walk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As usual, most of the crying was done on the train and by the time I reached the last station upon which I was to alight, I wasn&#8217;t sure if coming all this way was worth the effort. I risked disappointment and foreignness and being in a city that was so cruel to so many of its inhabitants. I boarded a jeepney, wary and out of sorts&#8211;but somehow, Manila embraced me in a way I didn&#8217;t ever think possible&#8211;especially in broad daylight, when the city itself showed its own scars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There we were, two vulnerable souls, each seeking refuge in the other. Thank you, Manila, for your quiet streets filled with birdsongs and bridges that lead me back to myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_1992" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01347.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992" alt="The Manila Post Office seen from Jones Bridge by way of jeepney." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01347.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Manila Post Office seen from Jones Bridge by way of jeepney.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My grandparents met at the Post Office when they were younger and that&#8217;s when my  grandfather claims to have noticed this beautiful, shy woman who would later become his wife. When I see this building, I miss them a lot and I remember the many times we drove past this bridge when they were still alive. They would brighten up at the sight of this building&#8211;even in their late eighties.</p>
<div id="attachment_1993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01348.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993" alt="Manila Cathedral" src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01348.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Manila Cathedral seen from its side.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You walk along these streets and you remember for a moment that once upon a time, Manila was the Pearl of the Orient. Its architecture and its people were cosmopolitan and though today we&#8217;re wont to say that this feels a lot like another place, I&#8217;ve finally come to be proven wrong. This is exactly what Manila ought to feel like&#8211;beautiful, opulent and still, very much our own. The ambulance was also a dead give-away of my state of mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_1994" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01349.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994" alt="Manila. " src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01349.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the older buildings in Intramuros that&#8217;s fenced and appears ready for demolition.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The birds sing loudest in empty spaces where the threat of man is so remote. They don&#8217;t sing sad songs and I love that when I was lonely, an even lonelier building cheered me up because of the life it allowed to flourish within itself. Reminds me of the true meaning of giving. Assuming the edifice felt anything, it would long to be whole again, to be used&#8211;but instead, it is seemingly at peace, giving birds a place to live, a place to sing. No matter how sweet the song, the birds can never repay the building&#8211;kindness without a cost.</p>
<div id="attachment_1995" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01355.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995" alt="San Agustin Church seen from the Ristorante delle Mitre." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01355.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a class="zem_slink" title="San Agustin Church, Manila" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Agustin_Church%2C_Manila" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">San Agustin Church</a> seen from the Ristorante delle Mitre.</p></div>
<p>The food was wonderful. It&#8217;s the kind of home-cooked set of meals you hope to arrive at after taking your loneliness for a walk. From across the table where I sat, I could see the San Agustin Church and I still recall the many field trips and school visits we would have that had this lot as our marker.</p>
<div id="attachment_1996" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01384.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996" alt="The former Philippine Constabulary." src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01384.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The former Philippine Constabulary.</p></div>
<p>Set against the backdrop of Cumulus clouds at sunset and paired with the moon looking over us all, this scene was quite dramatic. I had come to witness some theater based on historical events&#8230;more on that next time but for now, this. How could any theater outdo this sky?</p>
<div id="attachment_1997" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01392.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997" alt="San Agustin Church at nightfall. " src="http://toynbeeconvector.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img-20130324-01392.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">San Agustin Church at nightfall.</p></div>
<p>It was Palm Sunday, after all. I had waited months for this day to come, for a completely different set of reasons. I was excited for my young ones&#8211;as I still am&#8211;but instead got served a heavy dollop of disappointment. Regardless, perhaps more than the joy of commencement, something can be said about going back home?</p>
<p>I knew my Holy Week would be meaningful when I found myself in San Agustin, attending mass spontaneously. Sometimes the Spirit calls and I don&#8217;t listen as much as I ought to&#8211;but as always, instead of punishing me, I am just led back home when I am most broken.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://xomariee.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-social-media-activism.jpg" width="100%" class="alignnone" /></p>
<p>Maharashtra is worst hit with <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/03/25/western-india-hopes-for-rain/" target="_blank">drought</a> this year since 1972 as 13 out of 35 districts are facing acute shortage of water. The situation in Vidarbha and Marathwada is dire. People don&#8217;t have enough water to drink. Every village is not lucky enough to get water tankers on time. It won&#8217;t be long before we start hearing reports of cattle and even people dying due to lack of water.</p>
<p>This has created ripples in the urban areas of Maharashtra, such as Mumbai and Pune, especially in the digital arena. People have decided to show solidarity with the drought-hit region by not wasting water in the festival of Holi. They are urging other people to play &#8216;dry Holi&#8217; through Facebook statuses, tweets and WhatsApp messages. Even celebrities have <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/03/26/celebrities-call-for-dry-holi-amid-drought/" target="_blank">joined the chorus</a>. This has generated a fair amount discussion about the issue on various social media forums and even off these platforms; and most of the people have agreed to the pledge of not wasting water.</p>
<p>But there are some dissenting voices too, who like to call this whole exercise tokenism. According to them, this digital activism farce is not going to change anything. It doesn&#8217;t take much efforts to post a comment or share or like a post (a post can be a text message, an image, a link to an article, a video, etc.) and most of these clicks are half-hearted. According to them, this is not activism, but <a href="http://www.cracked.com/funny-6978-slacktivism/" target="_blank">slacktivism</a>. (Read this New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all" target="_blank">piece</a> by celebrated author Malcolm Gladwell, which made this argument famous).</p>
<p>I disagree. Participants in digital activism are mostly students and young professionals. If they did not have an outlet like social media, what other options would they have? Rallies, protest marches, hunger  strikes, public gatherings or distributing pamphlets on the railway platforms? How many of the participants could give either their time or efforts for such activities, balancing college or workplace commitments? Is it fair to expect them to become full-fledged activists? Social activists have their own commitments and resources and they are fighting their own battles somewhere else. But does that mean, we, normal citizens can&#8217;t play any role in changing our society?</p>
<p>Calling digital activism slacktivism is outright derogatory. Though it basically tries to ridicule netizens who participate in such campaigns as lazy, it also unconsciously assumes that digital sphere is a separate entity. Nathan Jurgenson terms this argument digital dualism (you can read his critique on digital dualism <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/" target="_blank">here</a>). I am a staunch opponent of digital dualism, as it bifurcates digital and physical into two different worlds. It makes us believe that there is no interplay between the two, while I believe that they are enmeshed and affect each other&#8217;s behaviour.</p>
<p>People who participate in digital campaigns are not serious activists, but that does not mean they do not care about the society. They may not have studied the issues they are talking about thoroughly. Their solutions to the problems may be half-baked. But their intentions and the desire to do something meaningful is very genuine. And I believe, some of these very people are going to be tomorrow&#8217;s Medha Patkars, Arundhati Roys and Harsh Manders.</p>
<p>The major benefit of digital campaigns is that they create awareness about the issues they are espousing. The movement that emerged after Delhi Gang Rape is a case in point. Now we are at a better understanding as a society as far as women rights, violence against women and sexism is concerned than before and internet played a major role in this. Even the dry Holi campaign will not give water to the people suffering from drought, but it has at least brought their plight in limelight. I consider it a valuable contribution to the cause. (Here is an <a href="http://www.meta-activism.org/2012/02/digital-activism-101-the-5-activist-functions-of-technology/" target="_blank">article</a> which lists five other functions new technology plays in activism).</p>
<p>Internet offers a lot of resources to study a particular issue. Everybody who likes a post on Facebook about saving water on Holi will not go and read about <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/how-the-other-half-dries/article4456130.ece" target="_blank">drought in Maharshtra</a> in another tab, but there will be a small bunch of people who will. This small bunch mostly consists of people who are influencers and leaders in their own way, as they shape the opinions and lead the debates in their own circles. And I am banking on these people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m writing in response to Word Press’ Daily Post Writing Challenge about “<a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/writing-challenge-government/">The State of the State.</a>” The question was posted today, March 25th, “Where do <em>you</em> draw the line between a reasonable government attempt to maintain stability or solve a problem and an unnecessary infringement on your decisions?”</p>
<p>Interesting question; this is right up my alley.</p>
<p>NYC Soda Ban: preposterous. I cannot and will not support a nanny state mentality.</p>
<p>When you look at ordinances like the large soda ban in New York City, what do you think? Do you honestly think that the government cares about you individually, or do you think that perhaps there is an exertion of power beyond the limits of the functionality of a successful government? I think the latter. If the NYC government, with bologna Bloomberg at its helm, honestly cared about the health of each citizen of the city of New York, it/he would not focus on the menial task of banning sodas. That’s child’s play. It is so condescending and offensive to assume that people do not have enough self-control to regulate the amount of sugary beverage they intake in any given setting. Maybe some people cannot exercise that self-control as well as others, but it is not the role of the government to go around telling those with health issues how much they can or cannot consume at any given time&#8211; just as your parents no longer have control over minor decisions such as these in your life once you are over a certain age. Did Bloomberg just adopt 9 million children? Sure seems like he wants to.</p>
<p><i>Please</i> give the people education. That is far more important. Nutritional education would go a lot farther than banning a large soda. Lifestyle modification is what a lot of people need, not a quick fix substance ban. People who struggle with obesity or food and beverage self-control do not need someone breathing down their neck and demanding that they take measures to change. These people need encouragement and support, and a system to guide them to choose better options on their own. Rarely do people adhere to regulations forced upon them, but those who decide for themselves to make healthier choices are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Do I think that the government should play a role in education? Yes, to a certain extent. I think that Bloomberg’s efforts to curb the obesity epidemic in his small corner of the world would see better results if he were able to offer some kind of city-funded nutritional program, or some kind of reimbursement for a lifestyle modification program such as the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program, which is hosted at local YMCAs or other community centers throughout the city. Not only are programs such as these proven to better the health status of individuals who commit to them, but individuals enter these programs as a matter of personal choice. You see, people must make their own decision to change; Michael Bloomberg (or any government) cannot make that decision for them by punishing them like foolish schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Is the government overstepping boundaries by taking away a person’s choice in beverage? Absolutely, unequivocally, resounding YES. Would society be better off if the government offered the choice of education, which provides resources for people who need to make lifestyle changes? Oh yes. Please do not undermine the ability of a human being to make an educated decision when he is given the tools to do so. And do not underestimate the power of the resources that are already available and underutilized to help those in need make the decisions for a healthier life.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloomberg, back off of the rights of the people of New York City.</p>
