</div>
<p>2. Express their extreme annoyance at this work day today and hint that it deserves a much needed alcoholic beverage at the end of it. WINK WINK.</p>
<p>3. Thank their hubby for being the best hubby in the world while their hubby is sitting right next to them.</p>
<p>4. Complain about bad service at restaurants. &#8220;Never eating at Applebee&#8217;s AGAIN!&#8221;</p>
<p>5. Express their extreme excitement to see their best friends tonight, Brintney, Whitney, and Sarah!!! Love YOU GIRLS!!</p>
<p>6. Take pictures wearing a lot of makeup and looking really preppy while simultaneously making a &#8220;hard&#8221; facial expression and holding up what they consider to be a gangster sign. Potential caption: &#8216;Straight thuggin.&#8217;</p>
<div id="attachment_272" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://25pillsaday.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/n23409964_38915611_10781.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-272" title="n23409964_38915611_1078" src="http://25pillsaday.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/n23409964_38915611_10781.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#039;re hard!!!</p></div>

<p>8. Make their status the song lyrics of any Kings of Leon Song.</p>
<p>9. Take a picture of someone they deem inferior to themselves in some way with the question: Really?</p>
<p>10. Write angry letters to companies (Dear EZ PARK, I hate you!), unorganized groups of people (Dear slutty freshmen who think that leggings can be worn as pants..), and non-entities (Dear unseasonably cold weather, WTF?!)</p>
<p>11. Subtly yell at no one in particular while being <em>very specific</em>. &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s hard to believe that you think you know someone and then they turn around and STAB YOU IN THE BACK. Will never make that mistake again. EVER.&#8221;</p>
<p>12. Document exceedingly mundane activites for the day. &#8220;Getting my oil changed today. Then getting much needed groceries. Then it&#8217;s off to the post office to mail some bills. Then stopping by the gyno. Will probably need some gas by the end, so I may stop at the gas station. But I might be tired so I&#8217;ll probably just get it in the morning on my way to pick up a prescription. But if I&#8217;m not very tired I&#8217;ll probably just get the gas on the way home. Again, unless I am tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>13. Express their distaste for facebook on facebook and threaten to leave facebook to their facebook friends.</p>
<p>14. Ask seemingly rhetorical questions. &#8220;It&#8217;s cool to do a bunch of meth and babysit 20 six year olds, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>15. Write a status in another language. Parce que, Je suis tres intelligente!!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Mary. A white girl on facebook, guilty of most of these things.</p>
<p>**My friend Matt Damon (aka Kaitlin) collaborated on the trends of facebook with me. A much more detailed version will be in our book we&#8217;re writing. Which will be published&#8230;.one day&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December 3rd 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written on Day 3 at Velidhoo</strong></p>
<p>A shoal of banner fish glide a few feet away from me. Their striking colours of white and black making geometric patterns in the absolutely clear blue Maldivian waters. I reach out my arm to touch them, but they move away effortlessly. I regret that I&#8217;m only in snorkelling gear and unable to admire the brilliant abundance of sea-life in the depths they live in.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. My diving day will come soon.</em></p>
<p>As a part of <a href="http://www.tinyislandvolunteers.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Island Volunteers, Maldives,</a> we are expected to behave with decorum, and set an example for the island community we are based in. Our mission is marine conservation, but we are also expected to teach English and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Our welcome reception on 1st December on the island of Velidhoo, in the Noonu atoll, left nothing to be desired. Brad Pitt could not have elicited a more pompous ceremony. Our speedboat docked to the sound of loud-speakers and music, school children dressed in their best holding out garlands of sweet-smelling jasmine. Town councillors and other officials all lined up to greet the island&#8217;s first marine conservationists from abroad. Expectations are high but can we live up to it? By &#8220;we&#8221;, I mean Louise, Stefan, Penny and I, all UK volunteers.</p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9" title="The Welcome" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome1.jpg?w=216&#038;h=300" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10" title="The Welcome 2" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-welcome-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>Getting to this island took all of 2 days from the UK. After a night in Male, Jo (a fellow Tiny Islands volunteer who I teamed up with at Gatwick) and I boarded a speedboat to Naifaru island where she disembarked to join the turtle project there. Another speedboat journey with the other three volunteers finds me on this 2500-populated island with gorgeous yet simple people.</p>
<p>We are put up in a 3 bedroomed house &#8211; perfect as for the four of us as Penny and Stefan are a couple. The heat and humidity is made bearable by ceiling fans in every room, but the climate is stuffy and draining. I&#8217;ve settled down to the theory part of my of diving course, but the other three are already experienced divers, particularly Louise. As marine conservationists, we are expected to &#8220;fish-watch&#8221; and this is best done whilst diving at different depths.</p>
<p>The food is mainly Maldivian, with Indian, Chinese and European influence &#8211; it has not been disappointing so far. Incidentally, the restaurant we have our meals in appears to be the favourite meeting place of locals who gather there for coffee and &#8220;faur&#8221; (local snack made from betel leaves, cloves and nuts).</p>
<p>Its our third day, and we have just returned from a day&#8217;s picnic to a little uninhabited island, a reward for our first day&#8217;s hard sessions of snorkelling/diving the day before. Here, we were finally able to shed most of our restrictive clothing &#8211; Maldives as a strict Muslim country frowns on exposure. The reefs around the island are a snorkelers dream; coconuts straight off the tree are fresh and delicious, our fun only shadowed by unrelenting attacks from swarms of mosquitoes.</p>
<p><em>Never mind. Nothing can spoil this gorgeous day.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/on-the-boat-to-picnic-island.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11" title="On the boat to picnic island" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/on-the-boat-to-picnic-island.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15" title="IMG_3046" src="http://bablimaldives.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_3046.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Back at Velidhoo, we gather tonight with the heads of various clubs for a meeting to brainstorm on ideas on how to celebrate World Volunteering Day on Monday the 5th of December, ways of getting the whole community involved and becoming more environmentally aware. The local heads are eager and surprisingly full of ideas &#8211; an encouraging sign and positive move forward in the right direction.</p>
<p>I am content and raring to make an impact. The community is poised, full of anticipation, and set to advance thanks to the enlightened work of the <a href="http://www.velidhoofuturefoundation.org/" target="_blank">VFF &#8211; Velidhoo Future Foundation</a> who have teamed up with Tiny Islands and the <a href="http://lazygeckomaldives.com/velidhoo.html" target="_blank">Lazy Gecko Diving</a> Centre to raise standards of living and environmental awareness on the island. Together, we are committed to the goal of helping the town make best use its natural resources &#8211; the sea and the sun &#8211; to the optimal. The island has a beautiful future ahead, and can be an example to the rest of the country.</p>
<p><em>Our work is just beginning.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img title="Teaching is cool" src="http://miketidd.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/thumbs_up.png?w=439&#038;h=400" alt="" width="439" height="400" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘It isn’t what you say that defines you but what you do’ </strong></p>
<p>These are the wise words of Batman that every aspirational teacher should know.</p>
<p>Teaching is a<strong> popular profession</strong> for many graduates. Last year <strong>16, 845 people completed a secondary PGCE</strong>. The number of graduates completing PGCE’s has steadily risen over the last few years. It is a role that people find <strong>exciting, challenging and extremely stimulating</strong>. It is a profession where we are able to move people forward in their aspirations and assist their learning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was sad to read earlier this year that the number of<strong> teacher training places</strong> at universities and colleges is to be<strong> cut by one fifth</strong>. The Coalition wants more teachers to learn their skills on the job in schools rather than in training colleges. Now I agree that we should have more on the job training – it’s where I learnt my skills and it was where I did most of my learning– but fewer teachers and training opportunities? Universities and teaching colleges offer fantastic teaching expertise and facilities that should be further funded. This maybe in response to subject demand but I am sure we will need teachers in the future and these cuts maybe putting off hundreds of potential brilliant teachers.</p>
<p><img title="Teaching is cool" src="http://miketidd.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/teacher-training.jpg?w=500&#038;h=374" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.radipole.dorset.sch.uk/">Nicholas Hargreaves</a> of <a href="http://www.radipole.dorset.sch.uk/">Radipole School</a>, Weymouth says, ‘teaching is a wonderful career choice for anyone. From a young age several teachers and friends helped and encouraged me to aspire to become a teacher. To provide young minds with the knowledge, skills and passion to take control of their lives and become the experts of tomorrow. Personally it has given me the chance to inspire young people with my knowledge and expertise. Working with a group of like-minded teachers and young people is extremely inspirational. It is a role I have always been determined to succeed in and work hard for.’</p>
<p>The role teachers’ play in their local community is also central to a student’s development. <strong>Schools’ and communities must work collaboratively together</strong> for an area to benefit.<strong> Economic investment is a necessity</strong> with schools. <strong>Schools are the training ground for our future generations</strong> and they need to be at the <strong>forefront of technology</strong> for our young learners with the very best facilities for them to achieve their potential. The local community and schools’ must be incorporated into working together to <strong>create an ethos of self belief and to achieving their personal best</strong>. The community must be involved in their local schools creating community centres, so local people can benefit from the facilities and technology a school has. A community that sees the benefit of an education can help generate our leaders of tomorrow but they must work in partnership with the local schools. We as teachers are the facilitator of this role and can help enrich a wide variety of lives in the process. Working with the local community to enhance the school ethos and help an area develop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Russell Wait</a>, <a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Curriculum Leader of Global Studies</a> at <a href="http://www.cove.hants.sch.uk/">Cove School</a>, Hampshire; ‘I was inspired by my secondary school Headteacher who encouraged me from the tender age of 12 to reach my aspirations and goals. I find that teaching is an ever-changing occupation that keeps you on your toes. To teach the future generation of Britain with a passionate voice can create change and can only be a benefit for the country’.</p>
<p><strong>Many professionals from industry are turning to a career in teaching</strong> because of the many benefits the role brings. They bring with them a vast range of experiences from industry that can only enhance the profession. Experience from outside the classroom and shared with the students is vital.<strong> Young people do need to have role models</strong> and even though they sometimes might not want to admit it, teachers are a very important one. It is very clear that many people want to train as teachers but cannot afford to take a whole year off for training. With the recent credit crisis it is understandable, but it does show that people do want to be teachers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, young people choosing to become a teacher may not get a job at the end of their training. If the government get their way we will all be working till at least sixty-eight &#8211; where is the opportunity for the young, fresh and talented teachers?<strong> We need teachers, inspirational teachers with new ideas and outlooks.</strong> <strong>Choose teaching &#8211; be a teacher!</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of shipwreck books out there and I have a teetering pile of them on my nightstand. I read and read but just can&#8217;t seem to make any headway&#8211;for every book I finish two or three more are published. Some are great, some are not. But all attest to the enduring lure of shipwrecks to readers, dreamers and bookophiles alike.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I finished<em> <a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/books_writings_books.htm#ShipAblaze" target="_blank">Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat </a></em><a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/books_writings_books.htm#ShipAblaze" target="_blank">General Slocum</a> by <a href="http://www.edwardtodonnell.com/" target="_blank">Edward T. O&#8217;Donnell</a>, Associate Professor of American History at the College of Holy Cross. I had high hopes for this book, it being one of the few shipwreck titles written by an academic historian. In many ways O&#8217;Donnell did not disappoint. Thoroughly researched, <em>Ship Ablaze</em> tells the story of one of the worst maritime disasters in American history with intricate detail. O&#8217;Donnell situates the wreck, which claimed more than 1,000 lives, in the social and cultural context of turn-of-the-century New York City. We learn not only learn who the passengers on the steamboat were but also the repercussions of the disaster on the German community devastated by the fire. So too do we read about corrupt government agencies, the cutthroat news industry and the range of public, private and civic responses to a major disaster.  Indeed, <em>Ship Ablaze</em> is a fine example of what a shipwreck monograph can be. I only wish I could still watch <a href="http://shop.history.com/ship-ablaze-the-general-slocum-disaster-dvd/detail.php?p=68305" target="_blank">the <em>History Channel</em> documentary.</a></p>
<p>But there are limits to this kind of shipwreck book (or any &#8220;disaster&#8221;-specific book for that matter). Yes, shipwrecks are fascinating topics. Yes, they offer a unique window onto the past. Yes, they sell. But few answer the &#8220;so what&#8221; question. Why, besides bearing witness, should we care about this or that particular wreck? Most shipwreck monographs, like <em>Ship Ablaze</em>, are &#8220;insular&#8221; texts; or, to borrow a phrase from my advisor, they are &#8220;conversation enders&#8221; rather than &#8220;conversation starters.&#8221; The former are important for populating the past with names, dates and trends, but they tend to swerve towards chronicle rather than history. Conversation starters, however, are the stuff of history&#8211;books that suggest new ways of conceiving the past, books that raise more questions than they answer, books that make an argument that grates against others&#8217; conceptions of the past. When defending my dissertation prospectus I told my committee I wanted to write a conversation starter. Now I&#8217;m finding out just how difficult that is&#8211;I see the appeal of writing a shipwreck monograph.</p>

<p>At the start of the second set at Greenwich Village’s <a href="http://jazzgallery.org/">Jazz Gallery</a> last week, pianist <a href="http://www.krisbowersmusic.com/">Kris Bowers</a> was playing for a packed and eager house.  A packed, eager, young, and particularly diverse house, to be more exact, with a look, vibe and mood much closer to a college music festival versus what the typical jazz audience tends to resemble.  For a brief moment, I thought I was having auditory hallucinations with the amount of hoots and hollers being emitted from young, female voices.  It is a rare occurrence within the jazz club setting.  In Bowers’ performance debut as a leader, that would not be the last series of eyebrow-raising observations for the evening.</p>
<p>Bowers’ band for the evening was an assemblage of up-and-coming fresh faces in jazz with saxophonists Kenneth Whalum III and Godwin Louis, trumpeter Mike Cottone, bassist Earl Travis, and drummer Joe Saylor, with special guest vocalist Jehbreal Muhammad. The band of twenty-somethings played with a fire and focus beyond their years, performing an impressive amount of original material.  Bowers, who is an orchestrator, founder of an <a href="http://campusounds.com/">online music company</a>, and appears on the most significant hip hop album of the 2011, closed the moving set with a song from Bon Iver, the cutting edge indie-folk band, which was been recently riddled with Grammy nominations.  At twenty-two years old, it would be impossible to prognosticate a journey that is just beginning, but it is clear that Kris Bowers is setting a precedent of individuality, pushing the jazz envelope with a fierce, yet understated momentum.</p>
<p>If I’ve misled you to believe that his musical boundlessness and vast experience compromise his significance as a bonafide jazz musician, let me set that record straight nice and early.  He is a tremendous pianist, with a world of history under his fingers, and a conspicuously original sound, balanced by mature restraint.  He’s a bad cat.  He convinced a panel of pianistic paramountcy (which included Herbie Hancock, Ellis Marsalis, Danilo Pérez, Jason Moran and Renee Rosnes) of just that, taking first place at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition earlier this year, beating out some of the best undiscovered pianists in the world.  An experience Bowers described as nothing short of nerve-racking, “I was nervous, definitely.  Because you know, those were like all of my favorites [on the judging panel].  I hadn’t really met any of them&#8230;I knew Jason but other than that I hadn’t met any of them, so to be playing all this stuff that I pretty much got from most of them [laughs] I was trying to&#8230;play the best that I could.”</p>
<p><a href="http://alternate-takes.com/2011/12/06/on-the-rise-a-conversation-with-kris-bowers/krisbowersrockrollhallfamehonorsarethazihcseggwpyl/" rel="attachment wp-att-1907"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1907" title="Kris+Bowers+Rock+Roll+Hall+Fame+Honors+Aretha+ZIhcsEGgwpYl" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/krisbowersrockrollhallfamehonorsarethazihcseggwpyl.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Like most musicians on the New York City jazz scene, Bowers hails from outside of the five boroughs.  Los Angeles, specifically.  Initially studying classical music, Bowers made an organic transition to jazz, which he studied at both Colburn School for Performing Arts and Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA).  After graduating in 2006, Bowers moved to New York, continuing his studies at the Juilliard School.  “The jazz scene in LA&#8230;I mean it’s kind of sad.  It’s pretty bleak,” says Bowers who is now a second-year master of music degree student in the Juilliard Jazz program.  “Mostly because of the geography of the city.  It’s so spread out, it’s kind of hard. Like, we don’t have an area like the Village where there’s a bunch of clubs you can go around to, and to get together to play&#8230;it can take an hour to drive to somebody’s house, [for example].  And then unfortunately, a lot of the clubs are closing down, like The Jazz Bakery.  There’s just not many places to play out there.  I think most of the people want to come to New York once they feel like they’ve gotten to a certain level, or feel like they’re ready.”</p>
<p>Bowers’ New York state of mind has proved a to be a wise one many times over.  If you’re going to be in the right place at the right time, New York is always a good place to start.  Twists of fate work their magic best in The Big Apple, as Bowers explains how a chance subbing gig landed him on the Kanye/Jay-Z <em>magnum opus, Watch the Throne.</em>  “Casey [Benjamin]  plays with Q-Tip and he was on tour with [Robert] Glasper, and he recommended me to do this gig at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival, and it just so happened that at that gig, there were special guests like Busta Rhymes, Black Thought, Monie Love, and Kanye, and at the time they were finishing up a couple tracks from <em>Watch The Throne</em> that Tip was working on, and they wanted me to play some string parts on one song, and to write some piano parts on this other song, so it kind of all happened in a matter of days.”</p>
<p>The idea of writing string parts on a hip-hop album was likely intriguing, as you can add budding film scorer to Bowers’ resume.  “That’s something I definitely want to get into, honestly more than playing&#8230;especially eventually,” admits Bowers.  “I’d love to be able to dig into that.  I’ve always admired the role that music plays in a film and how it helps tell the story and how great music can enhance a film and bad music can ruin a film&#8230;just how much power the music has.  And also that it’s a literal translation of emotion; trying to compose and trying to write music that sounds scary, or sounds like this person is falling in love, or this person is angry&#8230;”</p>
<div id="attachment_1918" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://alternate-takes.com/2011/12/06/on-the-rise-a-conversation-with-kris-bowers/krisb_at/" rel="attachment wp-att-1918"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1918" title="KrisB_AT" src="http://alternatetakesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/krisb_at.jpg?w=238&#038;h=300" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Gianina Ferreyra</p></div>
<p>With so many facets to Bowers’ career, and his expansive musical inclinations, it’s exciting to think about what is in store in terms of his debut album, scheduled for an early 2013 release on the Concord label.  “I have a couple of ideas, a couple of special guests brewing who are pretty awesome,” says Bowers who is currently forming his band, something he is particularly thoughtful about.  “The main thing I’m going for with the band is that I want to feature a band full of guys in our generation. Just because I feel like a lot of these guys with their first albums, it’s just [about] names and they have these veterans, and that’s understandable&#8230;but I feel like playing with the people I’m friends with and who I know is going to put as much energy [into the record] as possible.  They’re not just doing it for a paycheck.”</p>
<p>He elaborates further taking a cue from a master with whom he shared recent company.    “Like Herbie’s debut album <em>Takin’ Off</em>.  He had Dexter Gordon &#8212; he was a veteran &#8212; but everybody else on the record was around Herbie’s age. Even though now they’re jazz legends, at the time they were just like one of Herbie’s contemporaries, so I feel like what I want to do is play with people who are <em>my</em> contemporaries.”</p>
<p>There is certainly no shortage of worthy peers for Bowers to choose from.  The well of young talent in jazz today is startling; most notably on Bowers’ own instrument, particularly as it pertains to African Americans.  Not in the last fifteen years (at least) has there been such a surge of rising Black pianists, all making their mark in the same generation.  Bowers is in great company with the brilliant likes of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Sullivan-Fortner/4301839">Sullivan Fortner</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127032469">Christian Sands</a>, <a href="http://firehouse12.com/performers.asp?id=39477">David Bryant</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaWhite.MusicPage">Joshua White</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/artists/91420634/jonathan-batiste">Johnathan Batiste</a>, to name a few.  “It’s pretty great,” says Bowers of the strong representation.  “I remember even being in high school and kind of realizing that there were like three black kids in the jazz department&#8230;in an arts high school&#8230;in LA.  And when you think about the fact that this is our music&#8230;so yeah, it’s pretty great to see some young, Black piano players and all be kind of on the rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>And climbing fast.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;">There was a story read to me as a child, about a grandmother who rides a motorcycle. I was never envious of the little boy in the story, because I knew that he was wrong for thinking his grandma was the coolest grandma in the world. His grandma couldn&#8217;t be the coolest grandma in the world because mine was. She has the mouth of a sailor and the dirtiest, funniest, sense of humour. Anyone who has spent any amount of time with her, can&#8217;t help but love her. My friend Jessi, upon hearing I was visiting my grandma this weekend, said, &#8221; Doris! Tell her I say Hi and I love her.&#8221; My grandma, Doris, just has that type of magic. She is literally one of a kind. </div>
<div style="text-align:center;"> </div>
<div style="text-align:center;">Grandma has always been the most encouraging of me and my crafting, so I couldn&#8217;t go visit without a little homemade something. I had picked up this little paper mache elephant at Michael&#8217;s a while back, not knowing what he would become, but unable to resist his dollar price tag. When I went downstairs (to my dungeon craft area) to whip up a little something for Grandma, the little elephant practically honked at me. He would easily become the perfect addition to my Grandma&#8217;s elephant collection. She has the elephant figurines scattered around her apartment, always facing the door, as per the superstitions that this positioning allows them to protect the home. All of her elephants have trunks pointed upward as well, because if an elephant&#8217;s trunk is downward, then all it&#8217;s luck scatters away, but an upward trunk stores the luck for the recipient, in this case Grams.</div>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-elephant.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-689" title="grandma elephant" src="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-elephant.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="278" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">Keeping in mind, that a white elephant is the luckiest of all, I decorated the elephant. I used leftover magazine cutouts from <a href="http://tobefrankblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/first-diy-flower-pots/">this project</a>. I chose shades of blue and turquoise and I modge podged them to the top and around the front. Then I painted the remainder of the elephant white. He was perfect. I knew she would love him and she did. I hope there are more similarly priced animals like this at Michael&#8217;s as I&#8217;d love to decorate other ones to use as tree ornaments.</div>
<div style="text-align:center;"> </div>
<div style="text-align:center;">My visit to grams, was atypical. Some of her magic is veiled by her illness, but I was happy to spend the weekend cleaning and cooking for her. I made her chicken soup, as soup is one of her all time favorite meals, along with chicken cutlets, spinach, and roasted root veggies. I couldn&#8217;t tell you how the soup or cutlets tasted, since I still don&#8217;t eat meat but as always, she loved everything I made for her, even if she didn&#8217;t eat nearly as much as usual. I froze some large portions for her and my grandpa to eat at later dates. I&#8217;m sure she appreciated the present &amp; future home-cooked meals even more than the crafted elephant.</div>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" title="grandma pot" src="http://tobefrankblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/grandma-pot.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="424" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">While there, I came across several  crafted-by-me things; a relatively recent mermaid painting, a mermaid card, a necklace, and this beautiful hand painted pot. Judging by the crude depiction of her, my grandpa, flowers, and the sun, I made the pot circa 1998 or 1997, when I was eleven or twelve.  And there it was, on her screened in porch, with a plant thriving in it, twelve or thirteen years later. I had to take a picture because it was just so sweet.  On the top, it reads, &#8220;World&#8217;s Greatest Grandma,&#8221; which she was then, still is today, and always will be, even when all the paint has cracked off the pot and I&#8217;m a grandma myself.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_473" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 567px"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/radiosilence-by-tatiana-plakhova.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-473   " title="RadioSilence by tatiana plakhova" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/radiosilence-by-tatiana-plakhova.jpg?w=557&#038;h=742" alt="" width="557" height="742" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">RadioSilence, by Tatiana Plakhova</p></div>
<p>Our world is all but digitized. Analogue is becoming a thing of the past, and will likely die with my parents generation, or my own. It will be seen as something collectible, cool, retro, and unique, but nevertheless, dead. Yes, people still flip through books, buy records, and learn instruments, but for how much longer? The pushing of tactile buttons, pulling of levers, and turning of knobs, is about to disappear. Soon the distinction between being online and offline will fade. There will be no offline, and thus, no online. Everything and everyone will be forever connected. If we want to disconnect, we&#8217;ll have to painstakingly go out out of our way to do so.</p>
<p>If you are like me, then you feel amiss when you can&#8217;t get online. Usually it happens when visiting parents, grandparents, or rural friends. On one occasion – before I bothered to turn on my laptop – I asked someone what their Wifi password was. They stared at me blankly for a few seconds, before uttering, “Wifi?” The horror. The horror.</p>
<p>But, honestly, there is a certain anxiety that comes over people in my generation when we can’t connect. Technology critics and primitivists usually claim that this anxiety is innately bad, and stems from my generation&#8217;s need for instant gratification. But what&#8217;s so bad about instant gratification? Should I have to work to find the information I want, or need, when it is conveniently at my fingertips? Shouldn&#8217;t information be easy to access?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/mays_8.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-522 aligncenter" title="mays_8 by butdoesitfloat" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/mays_8.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>Then again, maybe I am too &#8220;connected&#8221;. Half of my daydreaming is spent in my head, the other half online. To an outsider – typically someone over forty – it must look strange. Blue links highlighted. Flashing windows. Twenty tabs open. Music playing. Headphones on. Lukewarm coffee on desk. Occasionally, I feel less like a person, and more like an amoeba that feeds on tweets, notifications, and followers.</p>
<p>Enter my parent’s generation. The first thing to notice is their sociality. Older people are always talking, or always listening. Rarely are they absorbed in some task on a computer, hunched over with a stiff neck and squinting eyes. (That is, unless they are trying to find the vexatious, &#8220;forward to all&#8221; button). Older generations can get lost in a conversation; yet, their conversations lack something. They tend to get stuck on bits of information that, for the life of them, they cannot remember.</p>
<p>Who was that actresses name? What was that restaurant in San Francisco called? How can we get to the freeway from here? Questions always linger when talking to older people. This isn&#8217;t because they have bad memories – though they certainly can – but, because they aren&#8217;t whipping out their phones, or flinging open their laptops. There is an odd elegance to this. I have to remind myself that for my parents, the world isn’t about information, or, &#8220;instant gratification&#8221;. My mother spends her time watching classic films, visiting family, and reading books. My father rides his mountain bike, shoots guns, and fixes things. <del>I can’t tell if he particularly enjoys this last activity, as much of the time it is littered with “fuck”, and “god damn it”.</del> (Edit: he claims he only cusses when he can&#8217;t fix things).</p>
<p>My parent&#8217;s generation have a laudable simplicity about them. They are sometimes frustrating, asking us to hook up their internet for fix their computers, but those things are essentially foreign to them. Our parents don&#8217;t really belong in the digital world, they just visit it. They are record players, and we are iPods. Besides, I can&#8217;t pretend I&#8217;m entirely used to our digital world either. I still remember the days of connecting to the internet through screeching analogue dial tones, so that I could work on my geocities website into the tiny hours of the morning, or until someone called and I was disconnected. Sometimes I have to remind myself that my generation was the last to grow up before the Internet became truly monolithic. From now on, children will grow up in the shadow of that monolith. While it may be frightening, I think younger generations will be fine. My niece and nephew&#8217;s computer skills already rival their parents, and none are over the age of six.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/old_recorder-by-but-does-it-float.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-524" title="Old_Recorder by but does it float" src="http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/old_recorder-by-but-does-it-float.jpg?w=367&#038;h=490" alt="" width="367" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>So, how is my generation – the information generation – handling things? How can we begin to answer this question? Information is violently changing our lives. The Arab world has ignited with social protests, <a title="partially catalyzed by social media" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/25/twitter-facebook-uprisings-arab-libya" target="_blank">partially catalyzed by social media</a>. WikiLeaks has released over 400,000 confidential government documents. The Occupy movement is still going strong, <a title="with rallies being organized online and through social media" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-elder/occupy-wall-street-and-social-media_b_1077047.html" target="_blank">with rallies being organized online</a>. <a title="The first digital currency, bitcoin, showed signs of being practical, and used on a wide scale" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/1" target="_blank">The first digital currency showed signs of being practical</a>. For the first time, Artificial Intelligence is being used widely, <a title="(even if it is rather silly)" href="http://shitsirisays.com/" target="_blank">(even if it is rather silly)</a>. And, somewhere, a twenty-two year old kid writes a blog post about all of it, which could be seen by millions. (I said <em>could</em>.)</p>
<p>My generation is starving for useful, thoughtful, intelligent, and inspiring information. If we want to learn how to do something &#8211; <em>anything &#8211; </em>we can google it, and be on our way; there&#8217;s even a <a title="how-to-do-everything podcast" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/" target="_blank">how-to-do-everything podcast</a>. If that weren&#8217;t enough, Wikipedia has an entry on just about everything, with all links eventually leading back to philosophy. We can learn about the fundamental stuff of the universe – or whatever philosophers ramble about &#8212; with a few mouse clicks. For those of us that don&#8217;t like reading, there are infographics and videos on every topic out there. When we aren&#8217;t absorbing information, we&#8217;re expressing ourselves by the millions, through sites like DeviantArt, Flickr, Tumblr, Etsy, WordPress, and more. Perhaps we are too entitled, too lazy, or too impatient, but, we aren&#8217;t stupid. I don&#8217;t accept that. We have access to more information than any other generation, and we are using it. We are becoming smarter with the information we are using, even if much of it drips through the cracks of obnoxious YouTube videos and incomprehensible memes. Perhaps I&#8217;m being sophomoric, but I think the internet is fundamentally good, because knowledge is fundamentally good. Maybe that crazy greek bastard was onto something when he said, “The only good is knowledge, the only evil is ignorance”. And, if you don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m talking about, just google it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to try macaron-making again since <a href="http://allisoneats.com/2011/07/18/demystifying-the-macaron/">the first attempt</a> back in July. So, in the spirit of the holidays and an upcoming &#8220;White Elephant Party,&#8221; I decided it was a good opportunity to give it a whirl-this time with a more festive flavor combo. I&#8217;d heard that chocolate shells are the most difficult to make, so this time I went with a basic shell that&#8217;s flavored with peppermint extract. Naturally white chocolate is a good match for this, and pretty holiday-appropriate. Since the Chocolate-Caramel macarons, I&#8217;ve learned some tips in perfecting the texture of the shells:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first time I used a coarse almond meal, which gave the shells a grainy texture. I found they came out much nicer using a fine meal. I think this had a lot to do with the ingredients being able to blend better and gave me a smoother, thinner batter.</li>
<li>Make sure you let your tray of piped batter sit for at least 15 minutes. This gives your shells and smooth and shiny top.</li>
<li>Bake one tray at a time! I learned this after an entire tray of shells cracked during my first batch. I also think a thicker tray helps a lot-I&#8217;ve read that some people stack 2-3 trays on top of one another as well.</li>
<li>Really let them cool before removing from the tray-or the soft interiors will stick to the pan and peel off.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here you go! The recipe for peppermint and white chocolate holiday macarons. Though I must forewarn you, eager bakers, this was an all-day cooking affair! Since I wanted to make a lot of cookies (I ended up with about 50),  you may prefer to halve the recipe. Or, like me, just make sure you plan something to do while you wait for your trays to dry, bake, and cool. I ended up wrapping most of my Christmas gifts! So, while a bit exhausting, the day was extremely productive and the outcome was worth the effort!</p>
<p><strong>Peppermint Macaron Shells </strong><em>adapted from </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811868710?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpalliwanti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0811868710"><em>I Love Macarons</em></a><em></em><em> </em><strong></strong></p>
<p>1 1/3 cup almond flour<br />
3 cups powdered sugar<br />
6 large egg whites, left out, uncovered overnight<br />
½ Cup + 2 TBSP granulated sugar<br />
1/4 tsp peppermint extract<br />
Red Food Coloring (optional)</p>
<p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 2 cm) ready. Using a pencil, draw 1-inch circles approximately 1-inch apart on your parchment paper.</p>
<p>In a food processor, blend the almond flour and powdered sugar until well incorporated.</p>
<p>In a stainless-steel bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs whites on high speed until they are foamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar, peppermint extract and about 20-30 drops of red food coloring to the egg whites and continue to beat until it forms a stiff meringue.</p>
<p>Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold the almond flour/powdered sugar mixture into the meringue in a couple additions. Blend by scopping batter up from the bottom and pressing it against the sides of the bowl. Do this a few times until well incorporated.</p>
<p>Fill pastry bag with the batter and carefully dispense into your drawn circles. Once the tray is filled, rap the baking sheet on the counter to help settle the batter. Let tray sit out at room temperature for 15 minutes so that a slight crust forms on each shell.</p>
<p>Bake at 375 F for 9-12 minutes, until the shells are slightly crisp on top. Allow to cool before removing from the trays. Repeat, one tray at a time until you’ve used up the batter.  Make sure you use a new piece of parchment at least every other batch to assure smooth and round shells.</p>
<p><strong>White Chocolate Ganache</strong></p>
<p>2/3 cup heavy cream<br />
10 oz good quality white chocolate, finely chopped<br />
1 ½ TBSP unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into 3 pieces</p>
<p>Put the white chocolate in a heat proof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil, then pour over the chocolate. Using a whisk or rubber spatula, stir together until smooth. Once smooth, stir in the butter. Place the bowl over a larger bowl filled with ice water, stirring constantly until ganache is thick enough to pipe cleanly.  Work quickly, as the ganache will begin to harden again. If this happens, you can set the bowl over a simmering pot of water and stir it until smooth-then repeat the cooling process.</p>
<p><strong>Peppermint Chocolate Macaron Assembly</strong></p>
<p>Pair your cooled macaron shells into like sizes; I recommend you do this before making the ganache filling. Fill a piping bag fitted with a wide, round tip with your white chocolate ganache. Carefully pipe filling onto the flat side of one shell, leaving about 3mm space from the edges. Pick up your filled shell and its empty pair, and place them together, gently twisting as you press.</p>
<p>Store your macarons in the refrigerator. This allows the filling to soak into the shells and give them that distinct chewy bite. They&#8217;re best enjoyed the following day, brought to room temperature.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started running in 2006. Want to know why? I was afraid of putting on newlywed weight! I had seen so many of my friends get married, and well gain weight. I was determined to starve off the pounds associated with newlywed bliss. There was no agenda, no plan, no time goals, I just started running. The good news was that I had some background in exercise and had gone to the gym off/on for most of college. But, running for 30 minutes became my challenge. My husband and I would go to the gym every day and run for 30 minutes. And, to be honest, that was the extent of my running. Then, something happened. I became not just a gym rat, but a runner. How did it happen? What separated me from those that trudge to the gym daily with those that gracefully prance along well worn trails and paths? Like anything meaningful in life, it was a gradual change.</p>
<p><img src="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/29417_737351863809_1816159_42950804_6128487_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We all have reasons for why we start running. But, the reasons we keep doing it are very different. For me, running became a challenge. Challenging myself is what I love most about life. I love pushing the limits. So, I started with 5k. I ran these races trying to get my time down. Then, I progressed to 10k and 1/2 marathon, never thinking a marathon was possible. But, then, there I was standing at the finish of the Boston Marathon wondering, how did this happen? If I am being honest, a lot of it happened selfishly. I wanted to be better than everyone else. I wanted to have something to brag about. But, now, with a baby on the way, my prospective is so much different. I enjoy the breeze on my face, the way my body knows what to do, the fact I can run any time in any place. What makes me a runner? The fact that I never want to stop!<br />
<img src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/162850_820316961089_1816159_45659475_5508236_n.jpg" alt="" /><br />
I want you to know that whether you run 3 miles or 33 miles, you can be a runner too. You are a runner even if your pace is more of a jogger. You are a runner even if your form needs work or you are still figuring out how to breathe and talk at the same time. What makes you a  runner, is your passion for it! If you get up every day thinking about running, you are probably a runner. I promise you this is a great identity. There is a sense of commitment that our world lacks today in being a runner. And, you possess it.<br />
<img src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/206959_933175776119_1816159_46654889_7592840_n.jpg" alt="" /><br />
I would say I recently became a runner. Not after my first marathon, not after Boston. But, in the last few months. I have learned that no matter how fast, how far, how long I run, I will love every minute of it! I will run with fast runners. I will run with slow runners. I will run with just about anyone! I will run on the treadmill. I will run in the great outdoors. I will run just about anywhere. This is what makes me a runner. Not a Boston qualifying time, although it would be nice, not a contract with Asics, but rather my love for running, makes me a runner. It is no longer a way to shed pounds. But, it is a daily activity that I cherish!</p>
<p>So what makes you a runner? Tell me about it.<br />

<p><strong>How Carrie Oeding Became a Writer</strong></p>
<p>This is the next installment in the <em>How to Become a Writer</em> interview series, which will post here at Ph.D. in Creative Writing every other Sunday (er, or so) until I run out of writers to interview, or until they stop saying yes. Each writer answers the same 5 questions. Thanks to Carrie for saying yes!</p>
<p><strong>1.  Why did you want to become a writer?</strong></p>
<p>I was really in my head as a kid. Books excited me, but they excite a lot of young people, so who knows. When I grew older, I knew I wanted to make art, and I was closest with language as an outlet. When I was a junior in high school, I started telling people I was going to major in creative writing at the University of Minnesota, and then I did.</p>
<p>I was born on a small Minnesota farm, a small working farm where my dad grows corn and soybeans and sometimes raised sheep. I never write poems about where I grew up. There’s no negative or traumatic reason for this. I have, however, one piece in <a href="http://www.creativenonfiction.org/brevity/past%20issues/brev24/oeding_rural.htm" target="_blank">Brevity: A Journal of Concise Creative Nonfiction</a> that is about my relationship with growing up on a farm. I want to say &#8220;in isolation on a farm,&#8221; but I think of my husband laughing when I said we lived 5 miles from town, which was hardly isolation. But it might as well have been 50 miles, as I spent most of my life on the farm. And, anyway, the &#8220;town&#8221; was Luverne, MN&#8211;population: less than 5,000. My husband also likes to chuckle at the image of me stretched across my bed, literally waiting for something to happen, anything. People like to look back and find meaning after the fact about how they got here, some of this is true and some is storytelling. Storytelling is meaning-making, I understand, but I don&#8217;t always trust it. This distrust works well in essays as it creates a constant need for questioning and rethinking.</p>

<p><strong>2.  How did you go about becoming a writer?</strong></p>
<p>In a pretty conventional way. B.A. in English with creative writing emphasis. Attending an MFA program immediately after at the age of 22. Ph.D. in creative writing right after that. But this doesn&#8217;t necessarily explain how I became a writer. I became a writer by writing. I remember almost all of my undergraduate creative writing teachers saying, “Just write, and things will happen,” and when I began to see it was true, I never doubted this. I still don’t. Even when I’m anxious about what’s next.</p>
<p>Was I too young to leave Minneapolis after undergrad and pursue an MFA at 22? Probably. But I was right to make the decision, and I immediately had a real writing life because if it. If I hadn&#8217;t left Minnesota to get an MFA at that time, I likely would be a very unhappy person today who doesn&#8217;t write. Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to go back in time and find out.</p>
<p>I heard someone on NPR a number of years ago, a fiction writer, who said he taught himself how to write stories by retyping Grace Paley&#8217;s short stories. It was an &#8220;I had no idea what I was doing&#8221; confession, but I loved the idea of it. And Grace Paley should be retyped by all of us. I can&#8217;t remember who it was, but then I think he went on to somehow fall into some famous novelist&#8217;s lap who schooled him.</p>

<p><strong> 3. Who helped you along the way, and how?</strong></p>
<p>This is another interesting question, because I again want to answer it in different ways. Some of the people who helped me in the beginning of my writing life were practically strangers whom I had brief encounters with. For instance, a mysterious poet visitor was sitting in an undergraduate workshop at the U of MN. Someone said he was a famous poet from China, and honestly I don’t remember what his name was. I wouldn’t have known who was famous then. Why was he there? He came up after class once and said, “You’re going to be a good poet one day.” It kind of shook me. It didn’t stay with me, though. I just remembered this recently.</p>

<p>The writers I read whom initially helped open up the idea of what writing could do&#8212;Stevie Smith, Amy Hempel, Mary Ruefle, Frank O’Hara, Barry Hannah, Larry Levis, Claire Bateman, Russell Edson, Lydia Davis. I feel incredibly unsatisfied stopping here, but I’m just making lists.</p>
<p>My editor, <a href="http://seventeenfingeredpoetrybird.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Dodd Lee</a>, for being such a smart reader of my first book (and of poems, period), seeing that it is doing something new, understanding its humor and seriousness, and publishing it. Publishing it in a gorgeous book that completely lives up to my in-print dreams!  Also, my husband, Kent Shaw, who is a poet, who has read more contemporary poetry than anyone I&#8217;ve met and sees the book in the same vein. His writing keeps me excited about poetry, which is funny because when we first started dating we didn&#8217;t read each other&#8217;s work. We are both very critical, and we secretly worried we wouldn&#8217;t like each other’s poems. Our writing was a huge surprise to each other. Then we got hitched.</p>
<p>Some who currently help me are the writers and artists who keep me excited about making things: <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/767" target="_blank">Alice Notley</a>, <a href="http://www.eulabiss.net/" target="_blank">Eula Biss</a>, <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/authors/62-maggie-nelson" target="_blank">Maggie Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.mattheaharvey.info/" target="_blank">Mattea Harvey</a>, <a href="http://www.wernerherzog.com/" target="_blank">Werner Herzog</a>, <a href="http://mirandajuly.com/" target="_blank">Miranda July</a>. I am absolutely on fire about artist <a href="http://www.sarahsze.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Sze</a>, but you should see the installations in person.</p>
<p>Something that has helped me from stopping writing after I completed my first book, is taking art classes during my two years in Houston. I saw a Martin Puryear show at the SFMOMA in 2009. I had finished my first book, and it was unpublished. I was alone and at god-awful MLA, and it was one of the best art experiences of my life. Something about walking closely around his sculptures made me feel like I was breathing for the first time in two years. I moved to Houston nine months later and took art classes at the Museum of Fine Art’s Glassell School. I remember the first night of just intro to drawing and how it felt electric to be sketching terribly in the humid Houston August. I think there were times I slept with my art supplies. It’s stupid, I hate these kinds of narratives, but I am going to own this one. Two years of classes weren’t enough, but having that kind of excitement about making anything recharged my writing.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Can you tell me about a writer or artist whose biography inspires you?</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 257px"><a href="http://www.saraayers.com/graphics/darger/blenguin.jpg"><img src="http://www.saraayers.com/graphics/darger/blenguin.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Henry Darger</p></div>
<p>Joseph Cornell and Henry Darger were easy to get obsessed with. There is no line between their artistic and personal biographies. Going back to the writer who copied lines of Grace Paley, I like the idea of trying to figure things out on your own&#8211;having a hunch of what you want to do, and like Darger, finding ways on his own to get his collages &#8220;right&#8221; for him.</p>
<p>Also Ana Mendieta, I’m fascinated with, her performance pieces, during which uses her body in ways I’m usually very cynical about.</p>
<p>Louise Bourgeois is one of my favorite artists. Her wit, side view, darkness, and play are right up my alley. And she just works in so many mediums. Never stopped exploring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be around Marianne Moore. Have her as a neighbor, but I don&#8217;t want to read her biography.</p>
<p><strong>5.  What would you say in a short letter to an aspiring writer?</strong><br />
Write and read, and things will happen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a poet, consider making something in addition to poetry. You need to be making something all of the time, whatever it is. Poems, collages, pancakes.</p>
<p>Be humble. Don&#8217;t romanticize being humble. Don&#8217;t be so easily impressed.</p>
