			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend Sydney and I took a trip a couple of hours north-west of Denver to Rock Mountain National Park. Having been here in Colo. for a couple of years now I&#8217;ve been wanting to get up and camp in the RMNP for a while. We finally got our chance and made the trip up there this past weekend. Below are a few of my favorite images from the trip. Most of which were shot on our last morning up there when I finally managed to get up before sunset and get to some great locations when the light was just perfect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This semester was one of the most tiring periods of my entire academic education. Every single weekend and holidays were like precious diamonds for me. Luckily it passed away like the wind and when winter break was finally upon us, I have decided to visit my brother in Ohio and relax. Of course, it wasn&#8217;t just slacking off all day long and playing Skyrim(because that&#8217;s what Ece from two years ago would do), I also showed the decency to make small trips to nearby cities. I&#8217;ve been to Washington, Atlantic City, Philly and my favorite city of all time, New York! My final stop of my not-so-productive winter break was Buffalo, NY, with the intentions of seeing Niagara Falls. It kind of falls into the category of `Stupid things to do in the middle of winter` because it gets incredibly cold and windy in Niagara Falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" title="04" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/04.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>One of my first long distance train journeys was this one. It was only for three hours, but still, it included trains for a fair amount of time. Getting to the station was the stressful part because my know-it-all brother thought  he didn&#8217;t need any navigation. We ended up in a godforsaken(and wrong, I might add) train station and figured out which train station to go to 10 minutes before the departure. Luckily, I made it to the right station and got to the train. yes, stress had ended but something was wrong. As the sun shined upon my face, I suddenly got the urge to take a photo of the coach I was in along with the outside, and realized my camera lens wasn&#8217;t working. The pictures were blurry, shutter wasn&#8217;t working and I almost started crying because all my plans were on hold.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-557" title="01" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/01.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Above picture is the small summary of the pain I was in. Luckily for me, I texted my dear friend Hande immediately, and she told me we can go around the town to search for a cheap and compatible lens for me Nikon. As I got off the train, I started walking towards the voice that was calling me. It was coming from a pepper red Audi. Hande and his boyfriend Enver were there to welcome me to Buffalo. They were kind enough to search for a lens with me for my camera after a really nice breakfast that included bacon, eggs, pancakes and unlimited coffee!! We basically tried every single camera store—both local stores and Best Buy to find 18-55 mm lens(because lets face it I have no money). Our last line of defense was the successful one and I got my lens back after driving at least 25 miles around town.  This small adventure took us more than 2 hours, we then decided it was time to go home to relax and then head out for the Niagara Falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-558" title="02" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/02.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>We took a &#8220;lazy break&#8221; for about an hour, and this also gave me time to practice my blackjack skills, because we were obviously going to gamble after the falls. Our companions, tea, cigarettes, Oreo and internet didn&#8217;t let us go for a while, but then we knew we had to leave soon if we wanted to see the Niagara falls before dusk. So we grabbed our stuff and drove to Niagara Falls with the fire-red Audi! After thirty minutes or so, we saw the Canadian side of the falls with the fancy towers and casinos. We parked the car and started walking and MAN!!! IT WAS COLD AS HELL.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-559" title="03" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/03.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Seriously. If there is a hell, it&#8217;s not fiery and hot. It&#8217;s FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW ABSOLUTE ZERO(yes, absolute zero, I said!!) and it definitely is Niagara Falls because all the mist coming from the falls turns into small pieces of ice that sprays your skin like small bullets and if you&#8217;re not wearing any gloves like I didn&#8217;t(I admit this was a stupid thing to do), your hands are going to be the ones that suffer. And this becomes a terrible burden because it feels like small needles are piercing your skin as you&#8217;re trying to take some good pictures and have fun with your friends. Try to take a little break. Either put your hands in your pockets or try to warm up in the gift shop.<br />
So remember. If there is a hell, it&#8217;s going to be really cold and it&#8217;s going to be Niagara Falls. But hell is not always bad! Think of all the awesome things you&#8217;ve done to get there&#8230; Okay, this was a terrible metaphor so let&#8217;s drop all this and let me tell you why Niagara Falls is awesome in Winter:</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-565" title="07" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/07.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Because it&#8217;s as beautiful and white as heaven could be. All that ice, snow and water just turns this place into somewhere magical because it&#8217;s nothing but white there. There are several places you can see the falls and one of them is an observation deck just in the imaginary border between Canada and  United States. The above picture was taken in that observation deck. There is another place I completely fell in love with. It&#8217;s the rightmost end of the falls if you look really closely. Yes, as you can imagine, it takes a really long time to get there and road to that place is incredibly painful but beautiful as always. It took me around thirty minutes to walk that half a mile but it was definitely rewarding. This is how it looked like while walking:</p>
<p><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-561" title="06" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/06.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="858" /></a>As you can see, it&#8217;s all ice. Even the grass was covered with a really thick layer of ice because of all the mist coming from the falls. Trying to walk to the end of that road where the people are was one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. Seriously. I am a terrible ice skater by nature and walking on ice is even worse. Especially if you have a really large backpack and a huge camera with you. But in the end, it was all rewarding and the scene we came up with was this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="05" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/05.jpg?w=575&#038;h=384" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Luckily for us, Hande&#8217;s boyfriend came to save the day with his fire-red car and picked us up from the beautiful hell that is Niagara Falls. Later in the day we went to the Seneca Casino and guess what? There are shitloads of people in there. I felt so sad because one of the greatest wonders of the world only had 50 people around it because it was really cold but the casino just a couple of hundred meters away from it had all the people inside. Gambling is seriously a problem in everywhere. and believe me when I say this, because I&#8217;ve already seen Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-566" title="08" src="http://ecetopuzlu.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/08.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="384" /></a>Enough of the sadness. We should be enjoying the beauty nature has to offer to us! I, personally, consider myself lucky to have seen this wonder and would definitely recommend you to see it on winter when there aren&#8217;t many people around to ruin the joy of seeing the falls and when everything is white and gives you the illusion of purity. Maybe next time, I&#8217;ll go to Niagara Falls on summer and take the exact same pictures!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>And also, I&#8217;d like to thank Hande and her boyfriend Enver for enduring me the whole time I spent there and giving me the quick tour. Your hospitality is very much appreciated!</em> <em>I hope one day I could return the favor!</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a goal since 2003 to run a marathon in every state. I&#8217;ve now run 21 marathons and feel like I&#8217;m finally transitioning from someone &#8220;trying to run marathons&#8221; to a &#8220;long distance runner.&#8221; As a result, I&#8217;ve decided to start writing more about my running, the experience, the challenges, and what I learn as long distance running has become a much more central part of my life.</p>
<p>I was going to blog more about running on my blog at <a href="http://www.feld.com">Feld Thoughts</a> but I decided there was probably a limited audience, and possibly a different audience, for my running experience. So I&#8217;ll still write periodically over there about my marathons, but I&#8217;ll save the workouts, the long rambling thoughts, the frustrations, the injuries, and the philosophy for over here.</p>
<p>Join me if you dare &#8211; including for a run sometime.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6425787113/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6425787113_fc8aa391dd.jpg" alt="Souk archway" width="445" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>First, I noticed the doors.</p>
<p>I took a bus from Menara airport to Djemaa El-Fna, a large square in the heart of Marrakech’s old city. The bus swerved through a sea of motorized bikes, past flat stretches of fanned palms and arches marking unlit alleys. On the sidewalk I counted more feral cats than I’ve ever seen, and on the rooftops I caught glimpses of oversized nests and tall, toothpick-legged cranes.</p>
<p>We zigzagged between buildings the colors of rust, orange-pink and off white, with unpainted brick exposed on the sides. Elaborate grates decorated the arched windows. The Arabic tile was all geometric shapes and primary colors: chaos and balance. But the doors.</p>
<p>The doors were painted turquoise, seafoam green, red. Some were patterned with raised studs, others with thin scrolls or contrasting diamonds. As the bus sped towards the center square, the doors become vivid blurs against the burnt orange skyline.</p>

<a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555243545/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6555243545_c1b65f568b.jpg" alt="BlueDoor" width="445" height="445" /></a><br />
Night fell by the time my friends and I arrived at our riad, which was tucked in the maze of side streets of a residential neighborhood. We turned a few corners, walked through a children’s game of football, and found the right alleyway. I saw a door marked 18, just like our directions said, so I pushed it open and the six of us walked inside, backpacks and all.</p>
<p>Inside I saw richly threaded pillows, candles flickering through the cut-outs of metal tins, and… a family of four eating dinner? The woman herded us out of her living room, back into the alley, and pointed further down. Wrong door marked 18. I’d been in Morocco for an hour, and I’d managed to walk into a stranger’s home.</p>
<p>We found the right door, knocked first, and settled into our riad.</p>
<p>We sat in the lounge and planned out our trip over a pot of mint tea – a super sweet drink consumed in tiny, steaming cups. The riad offered a two day excursion into the Sahara desert. We argued amongst ourselves before realizing we couldn’t travel this close to the Sahara without going in. As we came to the decision, I felt a raindrop, and looked up through the open roof as the sky began pouring.</p>

<p>I woke up early for the excursion. I showered on the rooftop terrace, under the starlit sky, and listened to the roosters crow just as my hot water ran out.</p>
<p>We loaded into a van – our home for the next two days. We drove out of the city, around crumbling red mountains and over rocky cliffs, past cacti dripping with ruby fruit. We stopped at villages along the way, where I haggled for silver bracelets and drank an Arabic coke.</p>
<p>By sundown we’d reached the edge of the desert, where we mounted our camels and rode into the Sahara. Here’s what I’ve learned about camels: I don’t like them. Mine was too tall, too fat, a little bow-legged, and very fond of spitting. I also managed to get the camel with the sassiest hips, and when I dismounted two hours later, I felt every ounce of that sass in my aching legs. Can a camel look smug? I think so.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6425819161/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6425819161_c1ca0f7a4d.jpg" alt="My camel" width="445" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>But we set up our tents and ate vegetable tagines for dinner. We danced around the campfire and sang to each other. The sand, cool as the night air and finer than sugar, slipped through my fingers like silk. I stayed outside as long as I could, listening to the camels gossip, looking up at the clearest stars I’ve ever seen, until I woke up to a glorious sunrise edging over the dunes.</p>
<p>(For the record, the camel ride back in the morning is worse.)</p>

<p><a title="Moroccan spices by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555241303/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6555241303_4538ea5fca.jpg" alt="Moroccan spices" width="216" height="216" /> <a title="Untitled by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/6555312619/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6555312619_8f3f55872a.jpg" alt="Nightmarket" width="216" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>We drove back through the snow capped Atlas Mountains, and seven hours later, returned to Marrakech. That night I explored Djemaa El-Fna, a square full of snake charmers, henna artists, and monkeys with chains around their necks. The night market offers heaped spices, fresh orange juice, and bin after bin of roasted nuts. I devoured dried apricots, figs, and dates by the handful.</p>
<p>In the morning, Marrakech experienced a torrential downpour. My friends and I picked that morning to visit the Majorelle Gardens, and by the time we walked there, my socks squelched. But thanks to the rain, we were the only visitors to the garden, and the sight of thick palms, lilies in still ponds, and a forest of bamboo moved the rain to the back of my mind.</p>

<p>With two hours left in the country, I fell in love with the Souks, Marrakech’s mazelike market. The stalls sell everything from slippers and earrings to glazed pottery and gunpowder tea. The market only has a few entrances, and the knot of alleys and streets of stalls were impossible to navigate. For about twenty minutes, thoroughly lost in the heart of the Souks, I thought, “There’s no way I’m making my flight back.”</p>
<p>Now I’m back in Seattle, my semester abroad finished. I’ve seen my old friends and had family dinner, and I’m happy to be home. But a little part of me misses standing ankle deep in sand, scowling at my camel. The weight of lifting the lid of a tagine pot. I probably won’t stop missing the crumbling archways, the brilliant fabrics, the thrill of feeling completely foreign – until my next trip to Marrakech.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sony was gracious enough to send me the NEX-7 camera for my photo trip to Cuba.  Now that I am back in the states and have internet access once more, I wanted to take a moment and share with you my impressions of Sony’s new “wunderkind.”  I brought both my Canon 5D Mk II as well as the Sony NEX-7.  While I have a bevy of lenses for the Canon, I was only able to obtain the kit 18-55 and the 55-210 lenses for the Sony.</p>
<p>So, how did the NEX-7 fare?  In a word, “Amazing!”</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-1000-f-10-iso-400-80mm-55-210mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-81" title="Viva la Habana" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-1000-f-10-iso-400-80mm-55-210mm.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Viva la Habana</strong></em><br />
<em>1/1000 sec., f/10, ISO, 400, 55-210mm @ 80mm</em></p>
<p>I have been a professional photographer for some time.  These days, I work almost exclusively with Canon gear, and I am quite comfortable with it.  I know its “ins and outs” and have everything configured just the way I like it.  I only had a few days prior to the trip to become familiar with the Sony, so, I am not professing to be an expert in the system.  That being said, the system is quite easy to get around, and it took almost nothing to become comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Now, this is not going to be a review in any sense.  This camera has been so poked and prodded that if you want to know any detail you can easily find it out online.  I am also not going to provide images for the “pixel-peeper”set.  There are also tons of these images available, and they are of no interest to me.  I shoot photographs, not pixels.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to shoot with the camera in a unique setting, for real work, for a week.  This write-up is going to be strictly about my experience with the camera and my feelings about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-100-f-5-6-iso-250-55mm-18-55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-83" title="Where's My Mommy?" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-100-f-5-6-iso-250-55mm-18-55.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Butterfly<br />
</strong>1/100 sec., f/5.6, ISO 250, 18-55mm @ 55mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day One –</strong></p>
<p>We arrived the day before.  This was my first day roaming the streets of Havana.  I packed both the Canon and the Sony and headed out.  Given the size of the Sony, I packed both the kit lens and the 55-210.  Given its size, I bolted the 24-105 on the 5D MkII and packed the 50mm.  Wandering the streets you quickly are confronted with almost too much too shoot.  The decay is everywhere and the people are so friendly and unique.  Almost everyone wants you to take their picture.  This was the problem.</p>
<p>I did not want to take “posed” shots.  Every time I picked up the Canon, someone turned on their smile, gave me “thumbs-up” and posed for the camera.  Not the shots I wanted.  However, I found with the Sony I could simply flip up the screen, hold the camera at waist level, grumble as if I was secretly having problems with the camera, and get the shot.  This was perfect.</p>
<p>We spent the entire day wandering through the vast network of streets photographing everything that we came in contact with.  We were feeling our way through an entirely different culture – one very much suffering from arrested development.</p>
<p>When I got back to my hotel I was anxious to see how the images came out; to see how the Sony compared to its Canon brethren.  To my surprise, there was very little difference.  Ok, so the Sony lenses are not quite as sharp as the Canon’s.  Ok, so I made a few more errors getting to know the Sony (hit a few buttons I shouldn’t have).  However, the images on the Sony looked great.</p>
<p>One hitch though, I was shooting RAW+Jpeg.  The Jpeg engine in the Sony is not very good.  There is no way to turn off the noise suppression; you can only set it to LOW.  The Jpegs come out quite “smeary” and overly compressed.  However, once you load the images into Lightroom (ver. 3.6 is in testing), you really begin to get what this camera is capable of.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-88" title="Aged Cuban" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm_.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Aged Cuban<br />
</strong>1/60 sec., f/1.4, ISO 1600, 50mm (soft focus)</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Two –</strong></p>
<p>More wandering the neighborhoods.  Havana is a LARGE city; housing over two million people.  There is a lot to see.  This time I bolted the 70-200 f/2.8 IS II on the Canon and headed out.  Without a question, the Canon lens is sharper than the 55-210 on the Sony.  That is to be expected.  One costs over $2,000 and the other, just over $300.  However, if you stay away from the extremes on either end of the 55-210, it is an excellent performer, and quite sharp.</p>
<p>Today I got a little frustrated with the Sony.  You see, I kept hitting the RECORD button and the camera went into Movie Mode.  Once you are in Movie Mode, you are kind of stuck.  I couldn’t find an easy way to get back out.  When reviewing images, you are either looking at stills or movies.  Once I deleted my accidental movie, my display showed that there was nothing else to review – when I knew I had more than 300 still images on the card.  I panicked!  I eventually got back to still image mode and found all my images, but I can’t remember how I did it.  I need to check the manual, but this should be easier.</p>
<p>Also, I found that the Menu and Focus buttons are reversed in where they should be, and I found no way to change them in the Menu.  You see the Menu button is naturally under your thumb when shooting, while the Focus button is at the bottom of the camera’s back, a little awkward.  I hope this one is easily fixed in FW as they are not labeled on the camera and are just soft-buttons.</p>
<p>Got some great shots today, but due to the nature of using the camera, I found that I used the Sony about 75% of the time and the Canon only about 25% of the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-250-f-6-3-iso-500-161mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-89" title="Sneaky Pete" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-250-f-6-3-iso-500-161mm.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Sneaky Pete<br />
</strong>1/250 sec., f/6.3, ISO 500, 55-210mm @ 161mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Three –</strong></p>
<p>Went to a Tai Kwon Do tournament and a Boxing tournament today; fast action in low light.  Put the 50mm on the Canon, and put a Canon FD 50mm on the Sony with an adapter from Fotodiox.  Both lenses are f/1.4.</p>
<p>Got great shots with both cameras.  Using the Focus Peaking feature on the Sony I was easily able to focus, even in really low light.  Used the Auto ISO on the Sony.  I really wish they let you set the possible ISO range (another future FW update I hope).  ISO 800 is great, with 1600 just beginning to get a bit too noisy (though I found Noise Ninja cleans it up nicely).  Auto ISO will only go up to ISO 1600, though I would have restricted it to 800.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I retired to the hotel’s rooftop bar.  Took out the Sony and took some great sunset panoramas.  Then I discovered the vertical panorama function.  This is very difficult to do with a standard camera/tripod setup and a breeze with the Sony.  Loved it.</p>
<p>Today, about 50%-50% with images from the camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-5-0-iso-400-86mm-55-210mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-90" title="Blood Red on the Tracks" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-5-0-iso-400-86mm-55-210mm.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Blood Red on the Tracks<br />
</strong>1/160 sec., F/5.0, ISO 400, 55-210mm @ 86mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Four –</strong></p>
<p>Took a ferry across the bay to some of the small towns across from Havana taking as little gear as possible.  Once again I am carrying the entire Sony kit, as well as the Canon with the 24-105.  Trying to shoot with the Canon as much as the Sony, but the Sony is just so much better suited to street photography.  Decided to try out some of the “Creative Functions” on the Sony.  Turns out I dislike them just as much as I do any camera.  Great for the novice, and not really worthwhile for anything but vacation pics.</p>
<p>Also, the bracketing on the camera is basically useless as the range is not enough, only .3 EV.  This definitely needs to be addressed in FW.  Others have mentioned this, and I really want to be sure I add my voice to theirs.</p>
<p>Once again, most all of my images are from the Sony.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91" title="Tai Kwon Do" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-60-f-1-4-iso-1600-50mm-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Tai Kwon Do<br />
</strong>1/60 sec., f/1.4, ISO 1600, 50mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Five –</strong></p>
<p>Hired a guide and driver and headed out to Hershey, Cuba.  Yes, you read that right, the Communist version of Hershey, PA.  Also founded by the Hershey Company in the 1920’s to process sugar for the purpose of creating chocolate.</p>
<p>The place is falling apart these days, but there are still the remains of the factory, some parts of which are still in operation, though not making sugar for Hershey or anyone else.  There are also the remains of the planned town (think Levittown) and the electric train which Hershey built to move people to and from the major city centers.</p>
<p>I have decided that, since we will be walking quite a lot today to leave my Canon at home.  This is going to be a 100% Sony day.  I know I am taking a risk here, but so far, the camera has proven to be a real winner.</p>
<p>Since I was using the camera exclusively today, I ran out of battery and had to swap with the spare.  When I did that, I noticed that the camera lost some of its settings (most noticeably the settings for the EVF – in which I had a histogram display).  No problem to reset, but I am hoping that this is corrected in the final FW.  I shot over 1,000 images today and went through two batteries.</p>
<p>Also, found that the electronic switch for the eye-control on the EVF prevents the camera from going to sleep.  You see when the camera is hanging on your neck, the switch is constantly activated, thus the camera never goes to sleep.  Another simple FW change to only use a button push to wake the camera, would solve this problem.</p>
<p>However, all in all, a good day.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Boxing Feet<br />

<p><strong>Day Six –</strong></p>
<p>Today was spent in Casablanca, Cuba.  Just to be fair, I took the Canon and its complement of lenses with me this morning.  What can I say, heavy and cumbersome.  I got some great shots, but I also think there are shots I didn’t get because of the size of the system.  No “sneaky shooting” here.  I screamed “PHOTOGRAPHER” wherever I went.  I tried to get into the shipyards, but was waived off.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have gotten had I had my little Sony with me.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I put the Canon aside and once again set out into the city with the Sony.  It is the last day in Havana and I want to get the most out of it.  I need something light and fast in order to get what I am after.  I head into Chinatown (yes, Havana has a Chinatown) and start shooting.  I wetn into stealth mode and no one knew what I was up to.</p>
<p>In the end, I am very pleased with what I am able to capture, and I am already planning my return trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-9-0-iso-640-82mm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-93" title="Mark's Car" src="http://petersills.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/1-160-f-9-0-iso-640-82mm.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Mark&#8217;s Car<br />
</strong>1/160 sec., f/9.0, ISO 640, 55-210mm @ 82mm</em></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion –</strong></p>
<p>First, let me mention some items which I overlooked in my overview.</p>
<p>Once you use the EVF in the Sony you will miss it on every camera you own.  While it is not quite as clear as a true optical viewfinder, it is extremely close.  The ability to immediately see the changes to your images as you make them is invaluable, as is the ability to view the histogram in the bottom right of the display.  Shooting dark complexions against bright, colorful backgrounds was only possible with this feature.</p>
<p>The shutter responsiveness is truly lightning-quick.  This is not to say the autofocus is fast; it isn’t.  It is serviceable, though like most contrast detection autofocus systems, it hunts in low light.  However, when you press the shutter, the response is instant.  There are a few photos I could not have gotten without this feature.</p>
<p>The fact that the viewfinder is on the far-left edge of the camera is also a major plus and a definite advantage over those who add an EVF to the hot-shoe.  This way you can place the camera up to your right eye and leave you left eye open to see the scene and what is about to come into frame.  Photographing the old cars of Cuba was much easier when I left both eyes open.</p>
<p>The big Achilles heel of the NEX-7 is the availability of quality lenses at reasonable prices.  While the kit lens and the 55-210 are competent, they are nothing to write home about.  Given the capabilities of the system, it cries out for new and better lenses to go with it.  While the APS-C sensor in the NEX is clearly superior to the Micro 4/3rds sensors we have seen to date, Micro 4/3rds has the distinct advantage when it comes to lens quality and selection.  Hopefully, that will change with time.</p>
<p>I have briefly covered my experiences with the camera over a week in Cuba.  I should note that the FW version of the camera I had available to me was version .06, so I am certain a lot of the FW issues I mentioned will be fixed prior to, or just after the camera’s release.</p>
<p>In the end, I am now totally convinced that the future of digital photography will incorporate high-quality EVF in almost all cameras.  This is just the beginning of this technology.  Also, the need for the large SLR may also be starting to end.  Given the capabilities of the new mirror less cameras, I see no reason for overly large bodies (except that they can currently support much larger batteries).</p>
<p>I am already planning my return trip to Cuba.  The country is a photographer’s dream.</p>
<p>My Canon gear will be staying at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>UPDATE &#8211; December 9, 2011</strong></p>
<p>I have just heard from Sony that the NEX-7 (body only) will begin shipping the week of the 12th (next week).  These will be limited availability direct from Sony, with the Kit version and sales through third-parties following shortly thereafter.  This is great news for all who have been waiting.</p>
<p>At the same time, I should be able to post the PDF version of the manual so that anyone interested can begin to prepare for the arrival of their pre-orders.</p>
<p>Lastly, for those looking for a great, in-depth review of the NEX-7, how it works with third-party lenses, and just about anything else you would like to know, check out Luminous Landscape&#8217;s <a title="Luminous Landscape - Rolling Review of NEX-7" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/sony_nex_7_rolling_review.shtml" target="_blank">Rolling Review of the NEX-7</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?-->They&#8217;re my Crayons. I&#8217;ll show you exactly how to use them. But I won&#8217;t let you.</p>
<p>This is how my husband described my childhood issue with my Crayons. I think it&#8217;s pretty accurate. Let me explain.</p>
<p>As a kid, I loved to color. For the longest time, I got along with my little box of 16 measly colors (I was a spoiled kid), wishing I could color Cinderella&#8217;s gown Cornflower when all I had was Blue. Then one day my mom came home from a shopping trip with that magic box of 64 Crayola® crayons &#8211; the one with the built-in sharpener on the back. (I&#8217;m hearing a choir of angels right now just thinking about it.) I carefully opened the lid &#8211; how cool was that lid? &#8211; and beheld the majesty of the 64 different colors. Maize! I had a Maize crayon! They were packaged so carefully, with the crayons subdivided into four smaller boxes. It looked to me like the people at the Crayola® factory arranged the colors into four coordinated and happy groups. It was just beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_269" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 260px"><img class="size-full wp-image-269 " title="64crayons" src="http://deepbluenight.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/64crayons.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">gocksfrocks.blogspot.com</p></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s where my issues started.</p>
<p>Any time I used my Fantastic Box of 64 Crayola® Crayons, I would carefully select the color that was exactly appropriate to the item I was coloring, gently slide it out of its spot in the Smaller Box Inside the Big Box, color with it lightly (after first meticulously outlining the section to be colored), then slide it back into its appointed space. Thus I maintained the order and beauty of The Fantastic Box of 64 Crayola® Crayons the way the fine people of Binney &amp; Smith had worked so hard to provide.</p>
<p>Then the neighborhood kids came to my house to color.</p>
<p>We headed to the basement where my little kid-sized table &amp; chairs were. There was the Fantastic Box. As I spread out the selection of coloring books, I watched in utter horror as my friend Beth opened the Fantastic Box and dumped the contents out onto the tabletop. I was speechless. But not for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!&#8221; I shrieked.</p>
<p>Beth was just as dumbfounded. &#8220;Coloring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NO!! YOU CAN&#8217;T DO THAT!! THEY&#8217;RE IN ORDER!!&#8221; Panic was beginning to rise, along with the pitch of my voice. Binney &amp; Smith were never going to allow me to have another Fantastic Box of 64 Crayola® Crayons if I didn&#8217;t fix this <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;DON&#8217;T TOUCH THEM!&#8221; I hollered. I tried to envision that pristine box. Was Cerulean next to Brick Red, or Indian Red? Or was that Blue Green?</p>
<p>Beth just stared at me. &#8220;You&#8217;re weird,&#8221; she pronounced, and picked up a crayon &amp; started coloring. Roughly, too. I lost it.</p>
<p>I have very little memory of exactly what I said and did right then, but I think it involved some pushing and grabbing. Poor Beth got disgusted and left. I did my best to put the Box back together the way it was, hoping that Binney &amp; Smith would forgive me.</p>
<p>And thus it happened every time one of my playmates came over to color. I would hold tightly to the Fantastic Box of 64 Crayola® Crayons, and instruct my little friend in the acceptable usage of my crayons: take one at a time, do NOT peel the paper, and put it back in the exact spot that it came from. God help the child who broke one. They were banished from my basement indefinitely.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that I lost more than one friend over my fascism. But it didn&#8217;t faze me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the sad part: I see this quirk raising its horrid head to this day. I&#8217;m very picky about how my classroom equipment is used &amp; stored. (This can be quite a problem, as I&#8217;m in charge of several video cameras, tapes, microphones, and headphones for our broadcast program.) I have two pen/pencil holders at work: one that is for anyone to use as they wish, and one that is MINE. I get very uncomfortable when anyone mistakenly takes something from the MINE holder. I manage to not yank whatever it is out of the hand of the poor unsuspecting student or colleague, but my stomach is slightly queasy until it is back in its home in the MINE container. I even prohibit students from touching anything on my desk. I keep it light, and thankfully they always comply, asking before they come into the Magic Space (as they call it.) I&#8217;m also responsible for the maintenance of the school&#8217;s laptop carts. Just close your eyes and imagine what kind of stress that causes me. I keep a large supply of Tums in my desk.</p>
<p>The Crayon Fascist lives.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We<span style="color:#ffffff;">_</span>awoke<span style="color:#ffffff;">_</span>in<span style="color:#ffffff;">_</span>our tent to the gentle rocking of a cargo ferry with mainland Mexico and the port city of Mazatlan on the horizon.  Impossibly thick ropes soon flew from the ship to secure it to the numerous huge pylons anchored on shore.  Following dozens of big rigs and their sleepless drivers, many of whom had slept on the cold hallway floors of the ship the night before, we rode our bicycles off the ferry and into the gateway to mainland Mexico.  We stopped at an auto garage to ask for directions to the Malecon, the shorefront main street of many Mexican port cities where we were meeting a North Dakota connection.  After receiving directions and some words of caution, we were assured by the mechanic that Mazatlan was a “satanic jungle” and that he would pray for our safety as we traveled through.  Someone should put that on a billboard or something.</p>
<p><a href="http://boundsouth.org/2012/01/01/new-year-new-world/img_6107/" rel="attachment wp-att-1385"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1385" title="IMG_6107" src="http://boundsouth.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_6107.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="760" /></a></p>
<p>Mild confirmation bias is our saving grace.  It is certainly <em>possible</em> that Mazatlan was the most dangerous city we’ve seen yet in Mexico.  We’re not so sure.  Our hosts in the city did drive me by a restaurant that had been shot up by the local mob after it didn’t pay its protection money.  The traffic and people were far from menacing, though they may have been in more of a rush than those on the Baja.  We’ve received dire warnings from other Mexicans about Mazatlan, and when we got to Mazatlan we received dire warnings about the places we passed through to get there.  Were it not for a careful optimism on our parts, we would have never braved the border at Tijuana.  We continue to absorb as much information as we can, even if it does little to alter our route or our conscious optimism about the road ahead.  If Mom and Dad are reading this, don’t worry, we’ll totally consider hitch hiking or something if a Latin American civil war breaks out in 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://boundsouth.org/2012/01/01/new-year-new-world/img_5654/" rel="attachment wp-att-1379"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1379" title="IMG_5654" src="http://boundsouth.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_5654.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="606" /></a></p>
<p>I miss home and our family a great deal, accustomed as I was to spending this season with them.  The New Year has us all reflecting on the past year, especially the way that countless families have taken us in and made us feel like one of their own.  The Catholic Diocese of Whitehorse, the Coopers of Coeur d’Alene, the Pfeiffers of Portland, the Samuels of Santa Monica, the Taylors of San Diego, and the Salazars of Guadalajara are just a few of these.  Thank you all for what you’ve done for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://boundsouth.org/2012/01/01/new-year-new-world/img_5970/" rel="attachment wp-att-1383"><img class="size-full wp-image-1383 aligncenter" title="IMG_5970" src="http://boundsouth.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_5970.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="1000" /></a><br />
December has foreshadowed the rest of our journey in 2012.  We’ve climbed some tremendous mountains in Mexico’s western highlands, and we respect the toll that it takes on our bodies.  The Andes will only be bigger, more challenging, and more spectacular.  I’ve dealt with illness for the first time since leaving Anchorage.  A dreadful headache became a cold and ear infection; sadly, I’m still recovering and the illness has cost us some time and miles.  Rest and health can’t be compromised, and once I’m healthy we’ll be riding strong once again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://boundsouth.org/2012/01/01/new-year-new-world/img_5784/" rel="attachment wp-att-1380"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1380" title="IMG_5784" src="http://boundsouth.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_5784.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="485" /></a></p>
<p>The human and geographical diversity of the mainland is incredible.  Megacities and rural farming villages and beautiful lakes and mountains rise up at every turn.  Most of North America, even the Baja, has been defined by the vast, empty natural landscapes between places.  This New World brims with life and a constant human presence.  Riding a few mornings ago beside Lake Chapala, we struggled up an impossibly steep cobblestone climb for seven kilometers.  Every turn had us greeting another farmer or laughing child or family with a breathless “Buenos Dias” and a smile through gritted teeth.  It’s almost as if we’ve been practicing piano in the family room since leaving Alaska, and finally we’ve reached our recital and constant audience in the new world of mainland Mexico.  Sometimes we’re self-conscious, but most of the time we’re smiling, inspired, and excited for our next opportunity to inspire a stranger’s day with our story.</p>
<p><a href="http://boundsouth.org/2012/01/01/new-year-new-world/img_5972/" rel="attachment wp-att-1384"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1384" title="IMG_5972" src="http://boundsouth.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_5972.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="857" /></a></p>
<p>Hemingway once recounted in a conversation with a friend, A.E. Hotchner, that &#8220;If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.&#8221;  If there ever was a moveable feast, it is this bicycle expedition.  The sights and smells and sensations will linger and move with me long after we reach Ushuaia in Argentine winter.  In the meantime, I hope that you all find richness and love and a moveable feast of your own in 2012.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Christmas season is over and as I reflect back I see that for all it&#8217;s rushing and busyness, there is something to be said for a time of year that forces us to wait for something. Christmas Day is the one day of the year that still has the build of anticipation. That giddy feeling that something you really want is coming. That the promise of what&#8217;s ahead is so exciting you can barely sleep. It&#8217;s a special feeling, and one we are sorely lacking in today&#8217;s highly technological and immediate world.</p>
<p>Years ago I read an article in Cookie Magazine about the Death of Anticipation and it stuck with me. Our modern world leaves less and less room for expectation and excitement and in many ways I think that&#8217;s a shame. I&#8217;ll take you through the top points heralded in Cookie to better illustrate what I mean:</p>
<p>In 1969 Nathaniel Branden wrote <em>The Psychology of Self Esteem</em> which established a link between healthy self esteem and future success. Though I believe this to be true, that a healthy sense of self worth is essential to future success, I believe we might have gone a bit too far. Every child is important and every effort is worthy of praise but we&#8217;ve found ourselves in a world where every child gets a medal. Where simply showing up is considered success. A world where children aren&#8217;t to be singled out for bad OR good behavior. Loch got his first medal at his pre-school annual Thanksgiving fundraiser. It&#8217;s called the Turkey Trot. The kids run as many laps as they can around the school and then everyone gets a certificate printed with their name and number of laps and a medal. I thought this was terrific. He was proud. I was proud.  The kids are all included. Whether you did 50 laps or 5, no one is left out. But they&#8217;re in preschool. The oldest kid is 5. I think the problem stems from extending this mentality straight through high school. Why should anyone get excited about winning a race when the people who just put on their shoes get as much fanfare. In 1996 Dr. Jean M. Twenge published a fascinating book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0743276981" target="_blank">Generation Me</a></em>. <a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bookcover.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1126" title="generation me" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bookcover.jpg?w=194&#038;h=300" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>Generation Me is defined as anyone born in the 1970&#8242;s, 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s. Though being born in the mid 70&#8242;s myself, I&#8217;d say I see this phenomenon more in the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s babies, but for the purpose of the example you can lump us 1970&#8242;s kids in there. The Me Generation is the generation that take it for granted that self comes first. We&#8217;re also known as the Entitlement Generation. &#8220;Generation Me has never known a world that put duty before self, and believes that the needs of the individual should come first. This is not the same thing as being selfish – it is captured, instead, in the phrases we so often hear: &#8220;Be yourself,&#8221; &#8220;Believe in yourself,&#8221; &#8220;Love yourself before you can love someone else.&#8221;* These have become some of our most deeply entrenched beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in a time when high self-esteem is encouraged from childhood, when young people have more freedom and independence than ever, but also far more depression, anxiety, cynicism, and loneliness. Today&#8217;s young people have been raised to aim for the stars at a time when it is more difficult than ever to get into college, find a good job, and afford a house. Our expectations are very high just as the world is becoming more competitive, so there&#8217;s a huge clash between expectations and reality. More than any other generation in history, the children of Baby Boomers are disappointed by what they find when they arrive at adulthood.&#8221; ** The question becomes are we raising our children, and have we ourselves been raised with, unrealistic hopes, undisciplined self-assertion, and endless, baseless self-congratulation.*** You find examples of this in the school system every day. In Canada you can no longer fail a student. Grade inflation is a big gaff of the United States that runs right into college, and &#8220;independent spelling&#8221; and self grading has become way more accepted than it should. According to Twenge 30% of students polled believed they should pass a class simply because they showed up. If everything we do is fabulous and worthy then how do we adjust when everything doesn&#8217;t go our way?</p>
<p>If just being there earns us a medal, it creates a disconnect in our brain regarding what we are worth and what we deserve with very little effort on our parts. In a world where reality stars make more money than doctors what are we teaching our children? It&#8217;s the Teen Mom / Kardashian empire phenomenon. I was recently talking to a 17 year old who was graduating from High School and when I asked her what she wanted to do she said she wanted to be a reality star or, tongue and cheek, a trophy wife. It was depressing. She wasn&#8217;t really joking. But why shouldn&#8217;t she want that? Lack of talent and shame is now a calling card in our society. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;ve been told we&#8217;re so great for so long that we buy our own press. Why wouldn&#8217;t everyone want to know what I&#8217;m eating for dinner? Tweet. Why should I start at the bottom of this company? I&#8217;m really smart and special. Quit. Why should I work for a company in the first place? I&#8217;ll just start my own business. Fail. It&#8217;s tough. Upbringing and celebrity culture are at a real cross roads with reality. <a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/474334-l.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1127" title="Ready or not here comes life" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/474334-l.jpg?w=195&#038;h=300" alt="" width="195" height="300" /></a>Dr. Mel Levine, a pediatrics professor at the University of North Carolina Medical School and author of a book called <em>Ready or Not, Here Life Comes</em>, says  &#8221;We&#8217;re seeing an epidemic of people who are having a hard time making the transition to work — kids who had too much success early in life and who&#8217;ve become accustomed to instant gratification&#8221; .</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for going out on your own. For entrepreneurial endeavors. For thinking outside the box. Some say it&#8217;ll be the new generation of &#8220;Me thinkers&#8221; that get America on it&#8217;s feet again. They&#8217;re referred to as &#8220;productive narcissists&#8221;. Michael Maccoby, author of <em>Narcissitic Leaders: Who Succeeds and Who Fails</em>, argues &#8220;that businesses that rely on innovation, new technology, and globalization require far bolder leaders who can take risks, shrug off conventional wisdom, project confidence, formulate hyper-ambitious plans, and charm the pants off investors and underlings alike, so that they, too, will make a leap of faith and believe in the next cold-fusion-powered car or the iPod that pays your bills and runs your household.&#8221; <a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/103228501.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1132" title="Narcissitic Leaders" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/103228501.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>It is just my opinion that self esteem can be healthy without being over blown, and that once you get past preschool the best project, runner, swimmer, etc. should be the one who goes home with the ribbon. Why would anyone ever practice, strive or work to uncover their talents if they&#8217;re taught that everything they already do is amazing and worthy of praise? Who are these people auditioning for <em>American Idol</em> who can&#8217;t sing? Or <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> who can&#8217;t dance? Why are their families there with signs that say they&#8217;re the best. Why can&#8217;t we believe in our children without blowing smoke up their a*%es. Why can&#8217;t we love them and support them within the frame of reality? Egos become very fragile when they aren&#8217;t based in truth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to anticipate your future successes if you think by simply existing you will succeed. The only people that works for is trust fund babies and supermodels.</p>
<p>But, I digress. Other things we have ceased to anticipate&#8230;.</p>
<p>In the 1980&#8242;s strawberries became available all year round. This might seem simplistic and not worth mentioning but I think it&#8217;s indicative of a culture that has placed value more on quantity over quality. Have</p>
<div id="attachment_1143" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/dscf1099.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1143" title="huge strawberry" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/dscf1099.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">peneloperow.blogspot.com</p></div>
<p>you seen strawberries lately? They used to be my favorite fruit. Juicy, sweet, red all the way through and the size of a quarter. Now, you bite into one and it&#8217;s almost always white, flavorless and more often than not, the size of a plum. Strawberries were not meant to get that big. We were supposed to eat apples in the fall and strawberries in the spring and summer. To this day I think there is nothing more delicious than a Ontario grown summer peach. But I don&#8217;t want one in the middle of February. Just like I don&#8217;t want Turkey in May. I&#8217;ll wait for Thanksgiving or Christmas. In our efforts to give everyone what they want when they want it, we&#8217;ve sacrificed the very thing we desire. It&#8217;s the waiting that makes it special.</p>
<p>In 1987 the sonogram was perfected to let us know the sex of our baby with almost 100% certainty and without a great aunt twirling a spoon over our belly. Now, I would be a hypocrite to critize this technology as I found out what we were having before Loch was born.Though I was happy to know I&#8217;ll readily admit it does take the surprise out of it. Personally, it was a surprise I didn&#8217;t want. Not so much so we could do the baby room in the right color or get appropriate non-gender neutral baby gifts, but more because I was favoring a girl and I didn&#8217;t want to have even one moment of confusion or disappointment in the delivery room. I wanted to be happy and adjusted and feel nothing but joy. And that was the right choice for me. As I&#8217;ve said before, it took me about a month to get over pig tails and party dresses and the fact that most children&#8217;s stores are 3/4 girl stuff, till I was psyched to have a boy. When Loch came out, I was thrilled to see him. However, I think it&#8217;d be fair to say that the sonogram and it&#8217;s subsequent technology has also lead to scheduled C-sections (of which many of my friends are big proponents of), early inductions pre-delivery date to avoid those last pounds, and official birth plans that rarely go as expected and more often than not cause mothers endless extra hours of grief as they try and keep on point. Sometimes you just have to let things unfold as they will.</p>
<div id="attachment_1145" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/browser-war-market-share-internet-news-technology-chrome-ie9-firefox-safari-opera-free-online-thenextweb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1145" title="browsers" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/browser-war-market-share-internet-news-technology-chrome-ie9-firefox-safari-opera-free-online-thenextweb.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">mmncs.com</p></div>
<p>The 1990&#8242;s were probably the biggest blow to the concept of delayed gratification. We saw the birth of the internet, the creation of caller ID, answering machines or services in almost every home and the creation of digital cameras. No more waiting all day for your song to come on the radio. Or for your pictures to be developed. No more trying to time a call just right to make sure someone was home. You can avoid people you don&#8217;t want to speak to with caller ID but our kids will never know the joy of hoping that that ring is for you. &#8220;Please let it be Jeff. Pleeease let it be Jeff. &#8221; There is an entire generation of kids that don&#8217;t realize that you didn&#8217;t use to be able to look at a picture right after you took it and quite frankly, it&#8217;s just made us all more vain. &#8220;Ugh, I look terrible. Delete it. Take it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get telegrams. We don&#8217;t wait for letters. We have email and voice mail and text messaging. Everything is right away. Every new step is faster than the next.</p>
<p>You no longer have to wait for your show to come on TV as you can watch it at your leisure on whatever DVR device you happen to be using now. Personally I often miss the television season altogether and watch the episodes back to back on Netflix or On Demand later. You don&#8217;t have to hope that Blockbuster isn&#8217;t out of the movie you want, because they&#8217;re all available on streaming services in your mailbox, on line or on your TV.</p>
<p><a href="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tinkerbellwonderfulworlddisneysmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1153" title="TinkerbellWONDERFULworldDisneySMALL" src="http://incaseimgone.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tinkerbellwonderfulworlddisneysmall.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="172" /></a>I can remember as a child waiting all week for <em>The Wonderful World of Disney</em> to come on on Sunday nights. It was so exciting to hear those first few cords of <em>When You Wish Upon A Star</em> knowing I had one whole hour of television just for me. Loch has been watching kids shows on demand since he was a baby. He&#8217;ll never know the joy of that suspense. And, not that it matters like it used to with all of today&#8217;s viewing choices, but 1994 also saw the Olympics switched to an alternating schedule. Instead of waiting 4 years between Olympics we now wait 2 and really are only one trial away from the next one. The Olympics used to be an event. Capital E. It was the only time we ever brought a TV to the cottage. Now you watch the opening ceremonies and TiVo the rest. I&#8217;m still glued to it, but will the next generation be? The more available something is the less exciting. Or maybe, we have so much now, very little even registers as exciting at all&#8230;</p>
<p>Kids still await summer but with the talk of year round school really becoming a reality &#8211; LAUSD is starting mid August now &#8211; what summer will they really be awaiting? And, to be a real downer &#8211; if you look at the environmental shifts, the Greenhouse effect is making our earth warmer and warmer every year. Without a real change we could be looking at a future of summer all year round. Let&#8217;s try to avoid that shall we?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the little things as well as the big ones. It&#8217;s being grown up enough to wear high heels. Nope, Suri Cruise, age 3 has them, I want them too. Earning money to buy your first car. No way dude, I&#8217;m 16, where&#8217;s my ride?! Waiting till you&#8217;re in a serious relationship to sleep with someone? Who does that? Trading sex for favors in grade school or jr. high sex parties are becoming the NORM. I&#8217;m literally afraid for my kid.</p>
<p>The biggest things we anticipate nowadays is new technology (if you&#8217;re my husband) or sequels to films and books (if you&#8217;re me). Ah, <em>Deathly Hallows </em>how I loved you. I eagerly awaited you in print and celluloid and you didn&#8217;t disappoint. But please, can more people do this? It&#8217;s so fun to look forward to something.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing, kid&#8217;s need to look forward to things. Adults do too. It makes things special. Loch is blessed at Christmas time to have a Gigi that gives us a present for every day (!) of advent. It&#8217;s incredibly thoughtful and we love it, but when I watched Loch wake up every morning in December excited to open a present, I wondered how much it was distracting from the excitement of Christmas Day itself. When I was young I did an advent calendar with pictures for every day. Some years I even added a chocolate one. I loved it but I didn&#8217;t get any presents till the 25th. I&#8217;d certainly never tell my mother-in-law to stop. It&#8217;s a lovely tradition that comes from her heart &#8211; and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s different for Sean&#8217;s brother&#8217;s family who have 3 children, so that the majority of the gifts aren&#8217;t for just one child &#8211; I&#8217;m just not crazy about Loch seeing December as one big smorgasbord of gifts. Maybe I should stop letting him unwrap Sean and my gifts. It&#8217;s become more about the present itself than the meaning behind it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to instill some sense of suspense into Loch&#8217;s life but it&#8217;s hard. Everything in his world is so readily available. So instantaneous. He asked to do something the other day and I said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Yay!!!&#8221;. I realized in that moment that though I don&#8217;t give him everything he asks for, I do give him a lot, and a lot right away. If he wasn&#8217;t going to get it I would have just said, &#8220;No.&#8221; My saying &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221; to him meant &#8220;Yes&#8221;. It also leads to a &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221; mentality. When you get what you want right away, you&#8217;re often off to the next thing before you really enjoy the first. Without anticipation. Without waiting. Without having the time to truly want, it&#8217;s hard to appreciate and ever really, truly enjoy.</p>
<p>Anticipation in itself is a gift. One I&#8217;m going to have to work harder to give.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s January 10th and I am pleased to announce that I have already fulfilled a resolution!  Never mind that it was a resolution made back in 2010.  This weekend we inaugurated a volunteer-run, community-wide composting program in my apartment building.  It took about two seconds to dump the first batch of kitchen scraps into it and about two  years to get to that point.</p>
<p><a href="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2628" title="SONY DSC" src="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/32.jpg?w=465" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>Until yesterday, my family had been composting with worms in our apartment for several years and I can&#8217;t say enough <a title="It’s Earth Day.  Time to get your compost on." href="http://domaphile.com/2011/04/22/earth-day-time-to-get-your-compost-on/" target="_blank">good things about worm bins</a>! In my perfect world, every apartment kitchen would come with a built-in worm cabinet, just like they used to come with drop-down ironing boards.  However, as a family of four that cranks out three meals a day, the number of food scraps we produced was overwhelming our bin.  We would need three or four worm bins to manage our food scraps and &#8211; unless we built our coffee table out of worm bins (which isn&#8217;t such a bad idea, actually) &#8211; there would be nowhere to put them in our &#8220;cozy&#8221; abode.  Since a number of my neighbors had also expressed interest in composting (one was already going to the trouble of freezing her scraps and hauling them down to the Union Square Greenmarket, one of the cities compost collection sites), it seemed worth exploring a communal composting solution for our building.</p>
<p>Composting in New York City seems to be where <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/resources/history.shtml" target="_blank">recycling was in the early 1980&#8242;s</a>: something that is slowly gaining momentum, but is still viewed as outside the mainstream.  I imagine there were the same arguments against recycling then, as there are against composting now:  that it takes too much time to separate your garbage, that somehow the building&#8217;s facilities staff will be unduly burdened, and is it really worth it anyway? And, of course, there is an extra barrier for some people: &#8220;Ew! Worms!&#8221; or &#8220;won&#8217;t it smell gross?&#8221;.   While I&#8217;m an advocate of recycling and feel that everyone should take responsibility for the waste they produce, recycling by necessity relies on an infrastructure to actually transform your plastic bottle or newspaper into something new and useful.  Composting, by contrast, is a closed system.  You get a bin, add your scraps, stir it around, and a few months later you have a beautiful, rich compost that can be added to your plants or tree beds (you could probably even sell it on Etsy).  There is literally no downside and a huge upside in the palpable reduction of your own garbage (26% of the material that ends up in landfills is food scraps and yard waste that could be composted instead).  With the vast number of different types of <a href="http://www.gardeners.com/Composters/20706,default,sc.html" target="_blank">compost bins on the market these days</a>, there is a fit for just about any lifestyle.  For people outside urban areas with easy access to outdoor space, a compost bin should be a no-brainer.  And if you live in a city and don&#8217;t produce more than 3 lbs of food scraps per week, a worm bin would suit you just fine.  But for those of us in the middle: living in a city with a family and producing more waste than one worm bin can handle, the best thing to do is to band together with your neighbors.</p>
<p>We are lucky in New York City to have organizations like the <a href="http://www.lesecologycenter.org/" target="_blank">Lower East Side Ecology Center</a> that work to promote sustainability through community-based recycling and composting programs.  They offer workshops on all types of recycling, including a class I attended back in 2010 on how to go about initiating a building-wide composting initiative.  The presenter spoke about the ups and downs of convincing her co-op board to let a few residents install communal worm bins in the basement of her large building.  As you can imagine, not everyone was on board with this idea (see: &#8220;Ew! Worms! above).  She outlined a strategy to go about convincing her board and neighbors that, indeed, communal composting is a fabulous idea:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Start by garnering the support of your neighbors</strong>. This is a volunteer endeavor and doesn&#8217;t require the buy-in of the entire building.   You just need between 2-4 families to form a pilot project.  In fact, it is better to start small and add people as the project becomes a success.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Try to get the building management on your side</strong>.  After all, even if the program is completely resident run, it will have an impact on the building&#8217;s waste management workflow and it is helpful to have a good relationship with those who maintain the public spaces.  If you live in a rental building with high turnover, this will be a harder sell as it will really fall to building maintenance staff to keep it going. But who knows? They may just be waiting for this opportunity!</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Present it to the powers-that-be in the form of a well written proposal. </strong> Outline it as a pilot-project involving a core group of residents that will be reviewed by the board in three to six months. Knowing that they have a mechanism for terminating the project if it doesn&#8217;t work seems to go a long way toward assuaging the angst many building managers and their boards have about this kind of change.  Make sure the proposal highlights the benefits of composting while also addressing common concerns all in one page.  Here is a basic template to use: <a href="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/composting-proposal-template.pdf"><span style="color:#000000;">Composting Proposal Template</span></a></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Prepare to be rebuffed initially</strong>.  Perhaps outright or perhaps by evasion.  There will never be time to address it in the meeting.  Or it will be &#8220;too much for the building to take on right now&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t be discouraged &#8211; it took over a year and a half for my building to come around.  Gentle prodding and reminders about how many buildings in the city are already composting successfully will help.  Without being totally annoying, talk incessantly about how many fewer garbage bags will sit on the curb once we are composting.  Appeal to the &#8220;green&#8221; side of the folks in control.  No one wants to look like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Once-ler</span></a>.  </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If you live in NYC, call in the experts</strong>. For only $25, a member of the LESEC  will visit your building, give a composting demonstration and talk to building managers and residents about the specifics of composting in the city, which is what we did one Sunday in early December. There is nothing like hearing it from an outside authority and I can&#8217;t say enough about how important this was for us.  We spent two hours on a Sunday afternoon talking about &#8220;greens&#8221; and &#8220;browns&#8221; with Natalie from LESEC and at the end of it, even the initial critics were enthusiastic about the project. They even helped us select the most appropriate bin for our building.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you get the green light, you are almost there.  The next step is selecting and ordering the bin.  After much reflection, we decided to go with the <a href="http://eartheasy.com/jora-jk270-compost-tumbler" target="_blank">Jora JK270 Compost Tumbler</a>, which we ordered from EarthEasy.  It is on the more expensive end of the spectrum and you can certainly get a good bin for much less, but we chose it because it had enough capacity for our entire building, and it&#8217;s dual chamber set allows one to keep adding to the other side of the bin once the first side is full and needs to cure.  The fact that it sits high off the ground making it extra pest proof and easy to spin sealed the deal.</p>
<p><a href="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2626" title="SONY DSC" src="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/11.jpg?w=465" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>Once it arrived, the next step was to put it together.  Coming from Sweden, the directions were written in high IKEA and totally unfathomable.  Luckily, EarthEasy includes helpful assembly videos on their site.   We watched as a strapping young lad took about 11 minutes to assemble the bin all by himself.</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://domaphile.com/2012/01/10/urban-composting-how-to-convince-your-building-that-its-cool/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/f6ccQCVCNBU/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>If I showed you a video of my husband and me assembling the JoraJK270, it would have to be a feature length-film, as it took us nearly three hours to put the damn thing together and almost ended our marriage. The film would be considered a  &#8220;dramedy&#8221;, and I do admit that I questioned my commitment to the environment that evening.  But that is behind us now and we have a rockin&#8217; bin to show for it.</p>
<p>The next challenge was collecting enough &#8220;browns&#8221; &#8211; the carbon based plant material that forms one part of the composting quadrivium: Browns, Greens, Air and Water. In a healthy outdoor bin, you should have two parts brown material to one part green material.  Greens are what you have in your kitchen.  Browns are what you have in your yard.  Except when it&#8217;s December in NYC and you don&#8217;t exactly have a yard.  Thus, began a rather comical search for lawn waste that ended in my surreptitious foraging for mulch in Central Park.  It was exciting. I mean, I could have been <em>arrested</em>.</p>
<p>Once the bin, the browns and the appropriate signage had all been assembled, the bin was open for business:</p>
<p><a href="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2627" title="SONY DSC" src="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/21.jpg?w=465" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>First the &#8220;browns&#8221; were added.</p>
<p><a href="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2631" title="SONY DSC" src="http://domaphile.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/6.jpg?w=465" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>Then the kitchen scraps.</p>
<p>I covered them with some more browns, gave the bin a spin, and walked away.  It should be that easy in every building.  So far, we have five committed participants and another 5 or 6 residents who want to join in the fun.  As half of our building consists of graduate students, we will orient them to the bin next fall.  Who knows what lies ahead: fruit flies? Strange smells? Reduced garbage?  Hopefully gorgeous compost that is so badly needed in our garden and for our poor street trees.  Wish us luck and we will keep you posted.</p>
