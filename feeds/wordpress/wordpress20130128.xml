				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://currenteditorials.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/frozenpizzahero.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7521" alt="FrozenPizzaHero" src="http://currenteditorials.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/frozenpizzahero.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>That is a frozen piece of pizza, on the ground, covered in snow. I found it in the parking lot this morning as I was leaving school. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/U60VmXBlMw/">I posted an Instagram of it.</a></p>
<p>At the outset of the new year, I set some social media goals for myself. Things like learning to better leverage Twitter as a networking tool, expanding my presence and my brand online, and trying to take more Instagram photos. I hoped to achieve that last one by taking at least one Instagram photo each day for the entire year. For the first few weeks, I did quite well. I started taking photos of everything, some days posting more than one. On occasion, more than five.</p>
<p>Last night, I renounced my quest to post one Instagram a day.</p>
<p>The reason was something that became readily apparent to me just a few days in, but which I ignored until last night. I was taking pictures of stupid, useless stuff. Stuff that my followers probably didn&#8217;t care about. Stuff that I really didn&#8217;t care about. Stuff like a piece of frozen pizza. I was taking pictures for the sake of meeting a quota, and that made Instagram lose all meaning. It wasn&#8217;t fun anymore. It felt like work.</p>
<p>The easy answer would be that it was stupid of me to set an &#8220;Instagram quota&#8221; for myself, and that of course it starts to feel like work when you force yourself to continually do something even when you don&#8217;t want to. But what I realized during my experiment is that the quality of my photos really had nothing to do with the quota. Even everyday, casual use of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and the like, often results in stupid, meaningless, irrelevant posts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now become hyperaware of this fact. While composing a Tweet, I often stop and think, &#8220;Why am I saying this? Will someone find this funny? Does this Tweet have any meaning?&#8221; That often ends with a, &#8220;Screw it, I shouldn&#8217;t post this&#8221;, at which point I abandon the half-finished Tweet. The same can be said for Instagram. &#8220;Does everyone really need to see this? Is it artistic? Do I want to preserve this photo for later?&#8221; And Facebook. &#8220;Why did I post that? Am I just fishing for a reaction? Am I bragging?&#8221; Delete.</p>
<p>Perhaps what set me off yesterday was the introduction of Vine, Twitter&#8217;s new video sharing service that many are already calling &#8220;the Instagram for video&#8221;. Just like my Instagram photos were starting to feel meaningless, so too were most of the &#8220;first Vines&#8221; I saw posted yesterday. Vines of people Tweeting about Vine. Vines of people making coffee. Vines of people drinking coffee. Vines of dogs. Vines of cats. Vines of people dressed like cats. Vines of a dying Tweetie Bird. Vines of people eating food. I&#8217;ve yet to post a Vine, because I feel as if I have nothing Vine-worthy to record.</p>
<p>I get that part of the fun of these services &#8211; especially on launch day &#8211; is playing around with them, experimenting, posting stupid stuff, or funny stuff, or completely and wildly random stuff. But at some point we have to stop and think, &#8220;Why am I doing this? Does anyone care about this?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Services like Instagram and Vine are fuelling the frivolous. Many people, myself included, are fooled into this false belief that we always have something interesting to say or share. I think it&#8217;s important to be aware of this false sense of importance, to step back a little bit and ask ourselves if what we&#8217;re doing means something. Next time you post a Tweet, take an Instagram photo, update your Facebook status, or record a Vine, ask yourself &#8220;Why am I posting this? Does it really matter?&#8221;. Think critically about what you choose to post online. I know I will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the road atlas spread out in front of us, I put the finishing touches to the set of complex instructions that my friend and I would have to follow the next morning as we headed south, attempting to avoid a) getting ourselves lost, b) driving into another quarry, and c) Manchester. Despite having looked forward to Yorkshire so much it had not turned out quite as we&#8217;d expected. We&#8217;d been on the road about two weeks already, and the day&#8217;s events had had a somewhat dispiriting effect on us.</p>
<p>‘I hope the Peak District’s good. Derbyshire&#8217;d better be better than Yorkshire anyway or I think we might have to just drive straight home.’</p>
<blockquote><p><i>With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>‘Of course it’ll be good,’ I replied confidently, ‘Mr Darcy lives there!’</p>
<p><a href="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2012-06-10-kinder-scout-20.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1603" title="Noe Stool, Kinder Plateau, Derbyshire" alt="" src="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2012-06-10-kinder-scout-20.jpg?w=240&#038;h=180" width="240" height="180" /></a><a href="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/darcy-elizabeth-pemberley.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1604" title="Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley, picture credit: BBC (1995)" alt="" src="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/darcy-elizabeth-pemberley.jpg?w=300&#038;h=170" width="300" height="170" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-1601"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>‘Adieu to disappointment and spleen… Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!’</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately this proved all too true the next day, though not quite in the manner that Miss Austen intended in her beloved text. Having successfully circumnavigated Manchester we found ourselves stuck in traffic for two hours in Stockport on our way to the Peaks.</p>
<p>I reached for the map to see if there was anywhere to pull off.  A country park was marked in less than a mile, so I suggested we stretch our legs and have lunch to revive us for the next stage of our journey.</p>
<p>As we turned into the entrance we found it flanked by surprisingly formal looking pillars.  The drive lead through gently rolling parkland, a herd of deer spreading out through the landscape.</p>
<p>It clearly wasn’t a country park, but a country estate.  And not just any country estate.</p>
<blockquote><p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent&#8230;  <i>They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.</i></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/juliesummerfield1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1643" style="width:315px;" alt="juliesummerfield" src="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/juliesummerfield1-e1359304828554.jpg?w=310&#038;h=207" width="310" height="207" /></a><a href="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1068.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1610 alignnone" style="width:274px;" title="Lyme Hall/Pemberley courtyard" alt="" src="http://opencurtains.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_1068.jpg?w=274&#038;h=214" width="274" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>Lyme Park has become one of the most recognisable vistas of an English country house, thanks to the BBC – and of course, Colin Firth in a wet shirt.  For all the jokes, we’d accidentally arrived at the location used to film Mr Darcy’s fictional home in the famous 1995 adaptation. Clearly this required more than just a stroll. After all even Elizabeth Bennet couldn&#8217;t turn down the opportunity to go poking round Pemberley, even if she did think its owner somewhat repulsive at the time. Thanks to the National Trust and its cheap membership for those under 26 we were even able to do so for free.</p>
<p>Entering a familiar-looking courtyard we mounted a flight of steps and were admitted to the hall.  Almost immediately a custodian stepped in to prevent photography, flash or otherwise.  Stately homes seem defined by red tape, and in this case red ropes with hanging arrows that funnelled visitors along the preferred route.  Dim hallways were lined with long windows and tapestries, punctuated by finial-legged tables, strategic lamps, and ornaments.  Among the lavish furnishings was an extensive clock collection: tall grandfathers, ticking mantle clocks, chiming carriage clocks; the functional to the elaborate, mostly working, all showing different times.</p>
<p>Despite the house being representational of one that so many people would consider the ideal residence, it felt strangely inhospitable. It might have been grand, but it felt more like a museum than a house. Having been so carefully designed to conform to the idea of aesthetic perfection, and then frozen in time by the National Trust to provide an example of what exactly that would have been like to walk around in was somewhat disconcerting. Stately homes that are open for public viewing are always confusing to me: partly interesting for the artefacts and architecture, some of which is beautiful, some fun to mock because of its over-decorative ugliness, but always at the same time slightly hollow. How different an experience would it have been for Lizzy to walk round a similarly grand house full of expensive furniture, paintings and posh paraphernalia, but one that was of the contemporary idea of what was desirable and stylish, and one that was really lived in?</p>
<p>Lyme Hall was not a house I could live in. I would have liked the run of it, though, with no one to look over my shoulder whilst I peered into cupboards and boxes, opened doors sealed for years, blowing dust from objects of curiosity, pulling those unread volumes off the shelves in the library, finding out what all those rooms really are that we can never get to see. In reality visitors are only admitted to a minute portion of the internal workings. What is in the rest of it? Truly here is the province of fiction, but the potential secrets to be uncovered are, for me, a greater thrill than the romanticism of an Austenite fairytale.</p>
<p>We didn’t stay long, it being an unexpected diversion meant only to be a lunch break.</p>
<p>There was just enough time for a quick photo opportunity by That Lake before we got back in the car. As neither Mr Darcy nor Colin Firth looked likely to appear we left the formal grandeur for wilder riches awaiting in the Peaks.</p>

<p><strong>More on this?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;">2013 is the <a title="200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21078941" target="_blank">200th anniversary </a>of the publication of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, from which, for the less than obsessed of you my dear readers, the quotes in this piece were taken. On 27th January 1813 <a href="http://sarahemsley.com/2012/10/16/pride-and-prejudice-at-200/" target="_blank">the first published copy of the novel found its way to the author herself</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;">My friend and I were visiting <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="Lyme Park" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lyme-park/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">Lyme Park </span></a></span>(which is actually in Cheshire, but still in the Peak District), near Stockport, used for the exterior Pemberley scenes in the BBC adaptation. <a title="Sudbury Hall" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sudburyhall/" target="_blank">Sudbury Hall</a> at Ashbourne (actually in Derbyshire) was used for the interior. Both are National Trust properties and for book lovers 2013 will be a good time to visit Lyme Park as an exhibition will be hosted there celebrating 70 years of Puffin, the children&#8217;s division of Penguin books who brought us Stig, Spot, and The Very Hungry Caterpillar. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early September of last year, a beautiful, accomplished, bubbly and cheerful woman calmly jumped to her death from a roof top restaurant in London.</p>
<p>The tragic ending of the life of Rema Begum, who was 29 years old, raises, as suicides do, a number of complex questions and convoluted issues, both personal and societal.</p>
<p>Rema came from a traditional Muslim family, but the fact that she went to university, had a professional position and lived on her own, attests that Rema’s family supported her accomplishments and independence.</p>
<p>Most of the headlines focused on the fact that Rema had been the target of a malicious Facebook campaign, where an anonymous stalker had sent her and her family hate mail, and threatened to expose Rema’ s relationship with non- Muslim men.</p>
<p>This was true, and indeed the police had been informed and this campaign of terror had necessitated Rema changing her Facebook account.  Whilst the stress of being stalked and blackmailed was significant it was not the only factor that resulted in Rema taking her own life.</p>
<p>Rema, who had a professional position at the British Library recently lost her job after a confrontation with her manager. On the verge of buying her own flat, Rema then returned to her parent’s home to look after an ill relation. Her own health had gradually begun to deteriorate and despite the fact that she was on anti- depressants, Rema struggled to leave the house.</p>
<p>Rema had been seeing a psychiatrist for some two months for depression. At the inquest, Dr. Sara Dimic explained that Rema was guarded at her appointments and worried about confidentiality and told the City of London Coroner&#8217;s Court:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;She revealed to me that she had been feeling guilty for not leading her life according to her family&#8217;s values and her religion. </i><i>She thought that she had led a life that she was being punished for. </i><i>Her depression was the response to her being pushed from her current job and her moral dilemma in terms of the way she lived her life.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The day before her death Rema had tried to hang herself at the family home but was taken to hospital by her parents. She was discharged after refusing treatment and promising never to try harming herself again.</p>
<p>Several suicide notes were found at Rema’s home as well as one in her purse. Coroner Paul Matthews concluded that she was suffering from depression and her decision to end her life was deliberate. “<i>It appeared to be reactive to the stresses she was subject to in her life.”</i></p>
<p>Rema’s lifelong friend Avril Atkins, stayed in touch when Rema moved back to her parents and explained how Rema was wracked with guilt, believing she was living an impure lifestyle and would not be admitted into paradise. Although Rema followed some Muslim practices and had religious beliefs other aspects of her lifestyle  which included going out, drinking alcohol and having boyfriends could be deemed ‘Western’. <i>“I don&#8217;t think it was something she openly told her parents about, however I believe they found out she had been seeing someone who wasn&#8217;t Muslim,”</i> said Avril<i>, “She did say to me that she hadn&#8217;t been living a good Muslim life. She said she wanted to live a more Muslim-based life.”</i></p>
<p>Rema’s life is symptomatic not only of the purported cultural schism between Islam and the West, but also between celebrity, materialist values and inner values of spirituality and moral substance. In this, Rema’s personal struggle resonates with  people of from all religions and cultures, torn between the glittering, champagne and party aims foisted upon the public by a relentless media, or to live a life of modesty and integrity, of responsibility and value, that can be both the result of family and wider cultural pressures but also a personal yearning.  Rema’s struggle, like that of so many, can be seen as that of faith versus secularism, as well as a debate over what constitutes a meaningful, worthy life.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly however, Rema’s life and her heartbreaking end, were also the result of an ideological schism, one that centres on individual freedom. Some have championed Rema’s death as an honour killing, a sickness of patriarchal culture. And in fact Rema had been threatened for transgressing a group boundary and a moral boundary- for deciding to associate with non- Muslims, both men and women, and for claiming the freedom, inherent in each individual, to choose how she wanted to live her life. A freedom which indoctrinated men and women across cultures regard as threatening; those who try to emancipate themselves require ultimate subordination and control. Rema Begum represented that which patriarchal cultures hate and fear most: a woman with choices and the freedom to choose her own happiness.</p>
<p>From her suicide notes and disclosures to her friends and therapist, Rema was caught and torn between all these opposing cultural forces. But the deeper question that this tragedy reveals is: Why did Rema have to choose? Why did integration mean leaving behind her faith, and why did adhering to her faith mean eradicating her accomplishments and friendships? Her attacker and stalker decided this to a large extent, but his success was down to the fact that somewhere Rema knew, or believed, that those closest and dearest, to her would be ashamed of her choices, no matter what they were. A fact her blackmailer merely preyed upon and exploited. That terror of exposure and shame is common to many second and third generation immigrants as well as people from religious and cultural minorities.</p>
<p>Demographers inform us that we are living in an age of unparalleled human migration. Combined with the forces of globalisations and the internet, no culture can remain solipsist, and uninfluenced by others. Indeed, culture itself can only survive through processes of amalgamation, evolution, adoption and adaptation. In much the same way, no viable culture can be so rigid as to eschew its own internal processes of diversity and invigoration, of micro  cultures within and identities held simultaneously.  In a way Rema exemplified these processes of cultural contact and collision, and crucially of multiple cultural identities, waxing and waning, shifting , conflicting and evolving through a person’s life. Rema was embodying the natural courses of multiculturalism; her life a normal and expected blend of so-called Western lifestyles and so called Islamic values, and probably more besides. And someone found that threatening and judged Rema as immoral because of it, and she was persecuted.</p>
<p>The curtailment of Rema’s freedom and security that ultimately resulted in her death, were the same freedoms and security bequeathed to each and every person; to be able to choose the person she wanted to be, the values she wanted to express, because there was a rich range of choices, and cultures from which to choose. Autonomy and self- determination are only meaningful in a pluralistic context. That she was not allowed to navigate and amalgamate her cultural identities in a healthy, secure way, to choose and refine her choices about the most essential part of her Self,  is the true crime of her death, and explains why Rema’s suicide resonates with all of us living in a multicultural world.</p>
<p>The Samaritans ( 08457 90 90 90 or www. Samaritans.org) urge people in despair to pick up the phone and talk to one of their volunteers who will listen and offer human contact and support but GOLDENROOM has a number of questions to put before the person, or persons who subjected Rema to their campaign of judgement, blackmail, terror and control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you think you were the most appropriate person to tell Rema how to live her life?</li>
<li>From where did you derive this authority?</li>
<li>On what grounds  do you defend that Rema had no right to her freedoms of choice, of culture and identity?</li>
<li>Can you truly defend that threats and the destruction of a person is morally preferable to building confidence, security and communication?</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Rema lived in one of the most liberal societies in the world, she was openly persecuted and oppressed because she had choices and for that many have rightfully called Rema Begum a martyr for freedom.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still at home in Germany I came across the so called Mae Hong Song Loop &#8211; a round trip which is supposed to be the most scenic of Thailand. With its 670 kilometres, more than 1865 curves and a route exploring the more remote parts of Thailand&#8217;s North, it seemed like the perfect adventure. I have to say, that I am not the most experienced rider since I never ride scooters or motorcycles at home. Only during vacations. Hence it also should be a nice test of my driving abilities.<br />
<div class="googlemaps"><iframe width="690" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.de/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=208490876607530459314.0004d441c0c286def4d2d&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=18.845406,98.462466&amp;spn=1.366811,1.053173&amp;t=m&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small><a href="https://maps.google.de/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=208490876607530459314.0004d441c0c286def4d2d&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=18.845406,98.462466&amp;spn=1.366811,1.053173&amp;t=m&amp;source=embed" style="text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small></div></p>
<p><span id="more-535"></span></p>
<p><strong>Preparations</strong><br />
The first step was to get a good map of the area I wanted to explore. The guys from <a href="http://www.gt-rider.com/">GT Rider</a> are specialized in motorbike tours in South East Asia and have released a map just for the loop. In Chiang Mai it is sold in about every bookshop. It definitely was a great help in organizing the trip, looking for accommodation and planning day trips while on the loop.<br />
The next thing was to organize a bike. Several websites, including GT Rider, recommended Mr. Mechanic in Chiang Mai. They have a good support and are very reliable. You&#8217;d probably be able to rent cheaper, but I wanted to be on the safe side. I ended up renting a Honda Dream 125cc manual for 200 THB plus 50 THB insurance. It was the first time I rented a manual but it seemed right going up and down steep mountains. It proved to be the right decision.</p>

The onda Dream 125cc &#8211; The Asian Classic.</p></div>
<p><strong>Leg 1: Chiang Mai to Mae Chaem via Doi Inathon NP (130 km)</strong><br />
The ride out of Chiang Mai was nothing special. A big road, fairly busy and not much to see. After the exit to road 1009, things changed. It was the road straight to Doi Inthanon Nationalpark and Doin Inthanon itself, Thailands highest mountain. The road towards the mountain takes you to 4 waterfalls which, compared to the other ones I saw so far, were mighty and raging. I took a break at Vachiratharn Waterfall, which I thought was the best. It was nice to relax there for a bit and watching the Thais stroll around.<br />
But then it was time to chance the ascent to Doi Inthanon. The road was windy and already very scenic. I stopped at the two Chedis set right in the forest below the peak. The place seemed to popular with the Thais, but I didn&#8217;t bother to pay the 100 THB entrance fee. In my opinion the ride up to the peak was better than the peak itself. There wasn&#8217;t that much to see but a sign indicating that you just made it to Thailands highest spot. The best view of the surroundings were offered a little bit below the peak.<br />
I took my time during the first leg so starting the descent and the ride to Mae Chaem Village, the sun slowly started to set. The ride to my first overnight stop was the highlight of the day. The light was beautiful, the road narrow, winding but still fun and easy enough to ride. At that point I already knew, it was a good decision to do the trip. It was almost dark when I arrived in Mae Chaem. Mae Cham is a really small town with not much there. Yet, I liked it after busy Chiang Mai and I enjoyed my first sunset in the mountains. I found a nice bungalow, got some food from the market and called it a day.</p>

<p><strong>Leg 2: Mae Chaem to Mae Sariang (128 km)</strong><br />
I started early in the morning after I got gasoline and snacks at the local gas station. This was also the first time I realized how cold it is in the mornings and how hard riding can be at that time of the day. I really should have brought more warm clothes &#8211; a lesson that would accompany me for the entire trip.<br />
The ride to Mae Sariang was nice and relaxed. However, that day I just wanted to get there since I heard many good things about the town. I didn&#8217;t pay too much attention to the scenery and hit the gas. I arrived in Mae Sariang at about 2 o&#8217; clock and started looking for guesthouses. I asked at a local shop and the woman apparently had a friend who owns a guesthouse in town. She called him up and then lead me there with her motorbike. A little suspicious of the usual scams I followed her just to find out, that the place was nice, cosy and a good deal as well. Guess I should trust people more.<br />
I checked in and ordered a late lunch. There I met Dorothée from France who had also arrived that day. We got to talk and decided to explore the two main roads and the river. Mae Saeriang is set between the mountains and a river, it has a relaxed atmosphere and it&#8217;s not very touristy. Along the river you can kick back in one of the restaurants with a perfect view. We picked a place and enjoyed the sunset with a cold one. There we also found out, that the town actually offers some really good trekking which isn&#8217;t as commercialized as for example in Chiang Mai. Sounded like a good option, too bad I didn&#8217;t have the time. Reflecting on it, Mae Sariang is such a nice town in an area that has lots to offer. I am sure tourism will kick off there very very soon. The town might change a lot in the the next few years. I was glad having seen it at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Leg 3: Mae Sariang to Mae Hong song via Khun Yuam (164 km)</strong><br />
The night before, Doro and I decided to meet again in Mae Hong Song, the regions capital. She would take the bus and arrive at about the same time as I. This leg was the longest one but the route was the most scenic up to this point. The road winded like a huge snake up the mountains and down again just start all over again. The road lead through thick forests  beautiful gorges and tiny villages. Time just flew by and after a bit I already made it to my half way stop Khun Yuam. Khun Yuam is basically just one road and the gateway to Mae Hong Song. I had a surprisingly great lunch at a local road stop and afterwards had a nap at the local park. The second part of that days ride was just as scenic as the first. By that point it was clear, that the riding is actually the most fun part of the loop and that the journey is the actual reward.<br />
I arrived in Mae Hong Song at about three where I instantly ran into Doro who had just arrived as well. We found a nice guesthouse by the lake and decided to keep moving and go up the hilltop temple Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu. It is not only a temple but also a monastery where monks live year around. The view from the top was amazing &#8211; the city was located peacefully underneath and from the other side you could clearly see the Burmese Mountains. Having an iced coffee at the sunset cafe right at the spot we called it a day. Too bad I didn&#8217;t bring my camera that day.<br />
The next morning I got up at 6 o&#8217; clock to go up the hill again and watch the sunrise this time. It was by far the most amazing view of this trip until that point. The sun slowly rose above the mountains shining all kinds of red, orange and purple onto the blanket of fog that was still covering the city. It was well worth getting up early.</p>

<p><strong>Leg 4: Mae Hong Song &#8211; Soppong / Cave Lodge (71 km)</strong><br />
The ride again was so scenic. A lot of photo stops on the way. Before heading off to my next destination, I decided to do a little detour to one of the Longneck Karen Villages close by. It is a controversial issue and I was struggling with the decision to whether go or not. I decided that I wanted to see for myself and took the rough dirt road leading to the village. My stay at the village was dominated by mixed feelings. I was the only tourist there at that moment and walked around the village a little. My impression was, that the people there actually have a normal life for their standards. The only problem was, that I myself didn&#8217;t feel good about being there. Imagining, that there are tourists visiting every day, it in the end seems like a sort of a zoo. So with mixed feelings I left for Cave Lodge, close to Soppong, where I was supposed to stay for 2 nights.<br />
Cave Lodge is an amazing place. It is a guesthouse with a few bungalows and a huge common area, set in the middle of the forest, far away from everything and right next to a river. John Spies, the owner of the Cave Lodge, has been living in the area for 30 years and has a long history with the area&#8217;s hilltribes. Hence they offer a great variety of trips, hikes and activities. The area being famous for its caves, I decided do a one day caving excursion the next day. We explored three amazing caves with the second one being truly hardcore. We had to crawl through a narrow tunnel with water flowing through it. It was challenging and not for the faint hearted. Apart from the caving, the trip included a lot of hiking through the local hills and valleys. The area around cave lodge seemed so nice, that I regretted not being able to stay longer.</p>

<p><strong>Leg 5:Soppong / Cave Lodge to Pai (47 km)</strong><br />
Before heading off to Pai, I met Marie, a french photographer from Paris. She told me that she was about to visit a village 6 km from the lodge to take pictures for a possible exhibition back home. Marie has a strong focus on portrait photography and since I myself am not that good at it, I decided to tag along and learn from her. It was a good decision. The village was appealing and the people there greeted us friendly. We were invited by a group of women for some hot tea and hung around trying to communicate. I know a few Thai phrases which usually helps to break the ice and put a smile on peoples faces. In terms of photography skills, the trip helped me a lot. I think I am now more confident to take pictures of people and to take my time whenever I do so. Marie was a great teacher.<br />
I took off to Pai and arrived in the late afternoon. I can&#8217;t say too much about Pai because I basically spent only half a day there. The problem was, that my laptop quit working a day before, and I had an appointment to get it fixed back in chiang Mai the next day. Apart from that, coming to Pai was very different since all of the places before were really small, quiet and low key. Pai however is quiet busy and popular with the backpacker and hippie crowd. However, it seemed to have a very relaxed atmosphere and I think I would have liked it after a bit. Everyone I met actually like it a lot so it must be good. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have the time to fully explore it and really take it in.</p>

<p><strong>Leg 6: Pai to Chiang Mai (129 km)</strong><br />
I took off early after having a hearty breakfast at my bungalow place across the Pai River. It was very cold again and I once again wished for warmer clothes. I was told, that this part of the loop would be the most challenging and so it was. The roads were steeper and curvier than before and good attention was needed. It was good, that I did the loop clockwise so by this time I felt very comfortable on my bike and rushed through the first part. I stopped at a regular stop having a 10 THB coffee. It was the time to reminisce about the last days and the great experiences I have made. I felt a little bit sad with the trip about to end and not having the freedom a motorbike tour offers anymore. The outlook of entering busy Chiang Mai very soon also didn&#8217;t seem to appealing. The last part to Chiang Mai was rather shitty along a busy and big road with the traffic getting worse and worse. I safely made it into Chiang Mai and even got my laptop repaired the same day.</p>
<p><strong>Last Thoughts&#8230;</strong><br />
It is safe to say, that doing the Mae Hong Song Loop by motorbike was the best thing I did in Thailand. The beautiful vistas, the nature and the many encounters with the locals as well as with like minded travelers were just amazing. The driving was so much fun and I can say, that I can safely and confidently ride a manual bike now. The freedom of traveling like this is unmatched. You can just do whatever you want &#8211; you can eat where and when you want, you can stop as often you want, you can pee where you want and you are always flexible to explore the surroundings of the places you stay. I mean, I only had a scooter like bike but it was sort of an easy rider feeling. It was pure freedom and the fact, that it was a road less traveled just added to this great experience. I really got addicted to this type of travel and I will do it again whenever there is a chance for it. At the moment I am actually considering travelling Vietnam completely by motorbike.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I AM NOT A HAMMER! Not a hammer.</em> He screamed inwardly, directing his intentions at the tall, rough-brick buildings, the foreboding, overlooking passersby, the ominous, taunting sky. Screamed on the inside and what good did it do, but translate to another twisted face of his. The fear and anger welling up once again. If only he&#8217;d learned in time to pipe up, if only his voice could back him, if only the right person had asked the right things, if only. If only. If only.</p>
<p>Ah, but that is the curse of the foster kid shuffle. Is it not? The souls it claims tumbling out in ruins, vacillating between the unstoppable, menacing cacophony, playing incessantly between the ears of the touched, and coming out loud and disconcerting&#8230; Or the quiet ones; The ones still entangled in the monster-under-the-bed deluded illusion of the &#8220;if I can&#8217;t see them, they can&#8217;t see me&#8221; variety. Eyes averted. Lost beyond the depths. A despondency measured in dog years.</p>
<p>Herein is where our homeboy lay. He&#8217;d been pushed out into the sun under a bad star from the jump. Tunnels of NYC ain&#8217;t no place to hold a baby, especially when a woman didn&#8217;t know what the fuck was wrong with her until the day she uncontrollably pissed herself, and was stabbed by alien pains emanating from the depths of her belly when she was mostly used to being numb.</p>
<p>The cries and primal, animal sounds echoed through the dark maze beneath the streets that morning, about an eighth of a mile shy away from the nearest filtered shaft of dusted light. A baby was born onto a worn mattress full of unspeakable stains. Picked up reluctantly by filthy, unexpectant hands, and held, finally, to a tattered breast on a tired body with a rapid heartbeat, and the first. blossoming. of instant. surprise. love. A first love, that a person can only know once they&#8217;ve been left to bleed and all else had failed.</p>
<p>And speaking of blood, holy mother was it a mess. Messy from day one. This woman! She had no idea. She was just walking in the shoes that she&#8217;d been given a generation or two ago. She couldn&#8217;t be sure. Family history was never rich on the roster. But she&#8217;d stayed on the same path as her own mother. Tending her habits above all else. Passing them on to her skinny, cherubic child.</p>
<p>It was novelty at first. Because she&#8217;d never really known care. Never really known responsibility. Didn&#8217;t know the first thing about child rearing but hot-damn would she do her best. Her capabilities were few- let&#8217;s not glorify. I mean, an addict in deep is an addict in deep. But little can be done to stifle that innate knowledge that woman share. The one that is connected to ancestry. To source. The umbilical chord of the universe. She tended best she could, long as she could, until the mouth became too needy. Her own needs too greedy, to give proper attention to a babe.</p>
<p>So off with it on the kind of hot summer night where the nail-exposed overhangs drip with polluted condensation and people move molasses slow to keep the heat at bay. Off with it, this kid, this monkey, this needy thing she never wanted, couldn&#8217;t even remember how it happened in the first place. Off with this and onto some store&#8217;s front stoop where come morning a startled Asian grocer would find a itty-bitty-stinky-baby in a box and stare at in amazement for one shocked moment, wondering how people could be so cruel, before picking up the entire box that weighed all of 6 pounds and bringing it into NYPD&#8217;s 5th Precinct on Elizabeth and Canal, to be stared at suspiciously and questioned with intimidation, armed with about 30 specific, limited to shop-talk- English words. Oh poor secret Asian mang.</p>
<p>Fast forwarding our tale and on with it. Our poor guy. Our poor baby who would be sure to grow slight in height, and not far in the mental. Our poor guy who was to be pushed, dropped, dragged, and kicked through an unchecked system of house after house and on. Filled with predator and mouse. Loud television and louse. Lack of love, direction, or reliable constant. The irony of taxing the shit out of parents desperate to adopt, and adversely allowing the shittiest of the lot to be foster parents. And <em>paying</em> their asses. The horror. No criteria having mother-fuckers. Something to shake your head at.</p>
<p>Our boy never developed much of a taste for outward speak. Didn&#8217;t have much to say. Maybe he didn&#8217;t know how. Perhaps he lacked the overlooked tools of expressivity or composition. Teachers thought he a lost cause. Not much you can do with a lump that sits in the corner, refusing to engage. So in he went and out again. And at the glorious age of 18; the ripe age where we are fit and tied to greet the world; the age where we no longer need guidance or help at all, ever, and are ready- all of us- for complete and utter independence- our homeboy was let out.</p>
<p>He was like an instant street rat. Literally like a fucking rat. Where he learned from the rodents basic survival. Eat <em>what</em> you can find. Drink <em>where</em> you can find. Sleep in the little nooks where people are not apt to disturb you. He took to the streets with arguable natal instinct. The streets gave him selective shelter, opened up his fuzzy focus. Taught him the freedom to sit and stare. The freedom to bark or growl or yell at random- all of which he practiced, just to see. But it weren&#8217;t him. He were the silent type. But the city pulsed on and he felt off-shook by the beat. Our boy never had the luxury of feeling steady, really. His only purpose was today, I suppose. The ability to reflect on purpose is paired with those on the elevated levels of the comparably modern day caste system. Paired with those where the <em>concept</em> of hedonism can ring. Where people can afford sarcasm. His pockets bore holes and his currency nil.</p>
<p>Our boy. Left to eat the dust. Left an empty shell of nobody. He never got to be. Some people never do. They run through depleted soil from dia numero uno. No chance. Bleek grim. A sad ending from the beginning. A side bar. An untended weed.</p>
<p>In a world of hard focused happy endings I embrace the grime. Tip a 40 oz., a pinot with your pinky in the air, your G &amp; T, your whisky neat, rip the tip off your blunt if you gotta- for all the living ghosts out there. They&#8217;re out there right now, shuffling, rocking, hiding. Tip it and sip it and know you got it good, and if not good, better than a lot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have noticed that within many families, long hair on the girls is a given.  It&#8217;s a source of pride and a sign of beauty.  There are pictures of me, a young girl with a heavy dark hair hanging down her back, miserable with the weight of it.  I remember having to adjust how I sat down in school, so as to not sit on my own hair and give myself whiplash, a suffering which happened frequently.  </p>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade, we were struggling financially, my father was away for work and my mother said that I could choose one big but inexpensive gift for my birthday.  I told her that I wanted my hair cut.  She panicked, this would not go over well with my father when he returned home, but she agreed, cutting inch after inch off of my hip length mane, until I was left with a blunt haircut which fell to below my shoulders.  I loved it.  </p>
<p>My father did not.</p>
<p>I kept that length throughout school, finally cutting it to a short boy-like cut when I was in my last year of high school.  This short cut remained, small adaptations over the years, until I started to wear the more traditional Mexican clothing, consisting of primarily ankle length skirt and loose fitting, embroidered blouses.  Then I began to grow my hair out.  I became known for my intricate braids, unusual buns, even head wraps and scarves became accessories for my thick hair, but I kept it traditional and long. </p>
<p>As an adult, I didn&#8217;t have the problems with sitting on my hair or even brushing it as I had in my youth.  In fact, my hair never has grown past my waist again.  I have colored it, layered it, given myself bangs, twisted, teased and tortured it.  My hair has been through hell and back&#8230;all by my own hands.</p>
<p>However, now I am trying to decide whether I should cut it.  I miss the ease with which I can get ready when my hair is short.  I miss the weightlessness.  Then on certain occasions, when I have my hair up or under a hat, my father will say &#8220;DID YOU CUT YOUR HAIR?&#8221; and he sounds like an ogre about to attack an unsuspecting traveler, so I reassure him that I didn&#8217;t, and life goes on.  I am not looking forward to the day that I say &#8220;yes&#8221; and have to hear a lecture on women having long hair and that it&#8217;s a sign of beauty and femininity and that I looked better with it long.  I suppose that if I do decide to cut my hair, I could just avoid seeing my father in person for a little while.</p>
<p>But really, what&#8217;s the big deal?  It&#8217;s just hair.  It isn&#8217;t really a sign of anything other than how much you might spend on hair products or professional cuts and color.  In reality, it&#8217;s nothing more than insulation and a sign that I&#8217;m a mammal.  It shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal if it&#8217;s short, long, braided, wrapped up in a scarf, kinky, straight, blond or black.  I am not going to lose my strength if it&#8217;s cut and I&#8217;m certainly not going to lose my femininity.<br />
So why is there such an emphasis on it?  Why are we so vested in what happens with our hair?  </p>
<p>I remember going to a friend&#8217;s chemotherapy appointment with him many years ago and seeing a stunning woman sitting near us, a completely bald head and full makeup, along with the most gorgeous earrings I&#8217;ve ever seen.  I suppose it should have been a shocking sight, to see a woman with a completely bald head, yet all I could think of was how powerful she looked, sitting there, not hiding her hair loss, but wearing it like it belonged, wearing the side effects of her illness and the treatment, as if she had nothing to be ashamed of.  Without her hair, I could see her features on their own, without a frame of hair.  She certainly didn&#8217;t need to express herself with feathered bangs, layers upon layers of highlights.</p>
<p>So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll cut it, maybe I&#8217;ll wait.  Either way, I guess I&#8217;m going to have to explain to my father that hair does not make the woman&#8230;the woman makes the hair.</p>

<p><em>This post developed out of a conversation on Twitter about the difficulties of socialising at academic conferences, particularly at the dinner.  I was thrilled when Julio sent me this post which is a comprehensive set of advice which anyone, scientist or not, can benefit from. Take it away Julio!</em></p>
<p><a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/?attachment_id=4740" rel="attachment wp-att-4740"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4740" alt="conference dinner" src="http://thethesiswhisperer.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/conference-dinner1.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" width="225" height="300" /></a>You didn’t meet anybody new at the last scientific conference.</p>
<p>You paid high registration fees, travelled to the other side of the world, listened to boring talks, nobody came to your poster.</p>
<p>At least you met interesting people at the conference dinner, didn’t you?</p>
<p>Well, it’s kind of hard when you are hanging out all the time with the people of your own group.</p>
<p>Attending a scientific conference is a great opportunity to meet new people and do some networking.  A large network will come in handy to land new projects, collaborations or jobs to progress in your scientific career.</p>
<p>You cannot change anything from past conferences. Luckily, there’s a new one in a few months and you are going to get your stuff together and make the most of it.</p>
<p>But do you know how? Do you know how to network at a conference?</p>
<p>If you follow these tips you will be a master of socializing at scientific conference dinners.</p>
<h2><b>Socializing Before a Scientific Conference</b></h2>
<p>Yep, you need to do some homework. Your social success should not depend just on your personal skills. Planning ahead is key.</p>
<p>What we want to do is to know who will attend the conference and decide if we want to meet them. Additionally, we want to let others know that we will also be there.</p>
<h3><b>Create Or Join The LinkedIn Event Of The Conference</b></h3>
<p>One problem with registering to a conference is that you only know the speakers, but not the list of attendees.</p>
<p>LinkedIn allows you to join or create an Event. You will not only see relevant information of the event, but also those that like you are attending.</p>
<p>As an extra incentive for stalkers, you can check the LinkedIn profile of the attendees to decide beforehand if they are worth having a chat with.</p>
<h3><b>Find Or Create A Twitter Hashtag For The Conference</b></h3>
<p>Twitter is a not only a great way to <a title="7 habits of highly visible phd students" href="http://www.nextscientist.com/7-habits-highly-visible-phd-students/" target="_blank">get visibility as a PhD student</a>. It also helps to find people who tweet about conferences and even announce they will join them.</p>
<p>To recognize which tweets belong with which event, people include in their tweets an unique hashtag.</p>
<p>Somebody has to decide which one is the official hashtag of the event. So if the organizers haven’t done yet, be proactive and propose them with one. Encourage them to promote the hashtag in the event website and in their mailing list.</p>
<p>Once people start using the hashtag, you just need to do a Twitter search based on the hashtag and find who is interested in the event and what’s being said about it.</p>
<p>Extra tip: if you are not attending the conference, checking tagged tweets a hashtag is a good way to follow in real-time the discussion about the event via Twitter.</p>
<h3><b>Contact Some Of The Attendees</b></h3>
<p>At this stage you know who the speakers are as well as some of the attendees. Now you have an idea of some of the people you would like to talk to and socialize at the conference dinner.</p>
<p>It’s time for cold emailing.</p>
<p>Use for your email a self-explanatory title (don’t just say “Hello”). Use something like “Meeting at conference XXX dinner to discuss BLABLA?”.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of your email is your elevator pitch, short and to the point. After reading the first paragraph, the scientist you are hitting on should already know if he wants to meet or not. Leave the details for the rest of the email.</p>
<p>Elevator pitch: “I am a PhD student at Prof. John Doe’s group interested in parallel DNA sequence alignment. Would like to meet at the conference dinner to discuss a possible collaboration to implement your alignment algorithms in a massive parallel study?”</p>
<p>The rest of the email could contain some of your achievements. Describe also what’s in for the other person to meet with you.</p>
<h2><b>Socializing During A Scientific Conference Dinner</b></h2>
<p>The conference dinner arrived. It’s time to seduce everybody with your Pierce Brosnan’s charms.</p>
<p>You might have arranged some meetings already. Attend those first and say “<a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/impossible/self-improvements-guide/how-to-be-charming-to-women-0810" target="_blank">thanks for making time for me</a>”. But leave room for meeting strangers. You don’t know where a pleasant surprise might be waiting for you.</p>
<h3><b>What To Wear: Good Clothes And The Badge</b></h3>
<p>There is a lot of advice on what and <a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/04/16/what-not-to-wear-the-academic-edition/" target="_blank">what not to wear in academia</a>. This is of great importance when giving a talk, attending a conference or having a job interview.</p>
<p>The best dressing advice you can get: “dress a bit better than those around you”.</p>
<p>During the day you should check how the speakers and other attendees dress. You need to up-dress them, but just a bit.</p>
<p>Is it a conference for hardcore nerds that wear shorts and Metallica t-shirts? Then cool sneakers, jeans and a polo t-shirt will do.</p>
<p>Most people dress neat with quality trousers, shirt, blazer and no tie? You wear the same plus a tie.</p>
<p>You should also have your badge visible. It encourages people to read it, pronounce your name, your university and then ask what you do. And hey, they might even remember your name after two glasses of wine.</p>
<h3><b>Sit With People You Don’t Know</b></h3>
<p>Meeting new people is key to expanding your network. This time you are not going to sit with your boss and the rest of the colleagues from your group.</p>
<p>Always start with a “May I join you?”. Unless they are morons or the seats are taken they will always say yes.</p>
<h3><b>Sit With “Young” Scientists</b></h3>
<p>It’s easy to feel infatuated by the charisma of that big professor in your field. Approaching a hot-shot is and getting something out of him would pay off being at the conference.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, reputed scientists have a busy agenda and they tend to talk to peers of the same academic rank. If they talk to lower ranking people is with lack of interest or just to reinforce the impression that they know it all.</p>
<p>Then you have the young scientists. They are of your same age, more open-minded, with smaller egos and with fewer people to talk to.</p>
<p>If this is not enough I give you two more reasons: young scientists are the ones doing the most innovative research and the ones more interested in collaborating with you.</p>
<h3><b>Ask More, Listen More, Talk Less About Yourself</b></h3>
<p>The goal of networking is getting people to like you. And the key to get people to like you is to shut up and listen to what they have to say.</p>
<p>Don’t you find annoying that guy that can’t stop talking about himself and the things he does? Guess what? People won’t like you if you keep talking about yourself.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it feel good when people ask you things and want to know more about you? Doesn’t it make you feel a bit important? That you are worth listening? Guess what? People would like the same from you.</p>
<p>The key is to be genuinely interested in the other person. This means letting the other person do the talking and when he stops, you should keep him talking by asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your research about?</li>
<li>Do you have some exciting results so far?</li>
<li>How is it to do research in your group? Pros, cons?</li>
<li>How is it to live in your city?</li>
<li>What were the toughest moments in your PhD? How did you get out of <a title="The Valley of Shit" href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/" target="_blank">The Valley of Shit</a>?</li>
<li>What are your scientific plans?</li>
<li>Do you read Thesis Whisperer? Or are you more of a Next Scientist kind of person?</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Have 2 Elevator Pitches Ready</b></h3>
<p>Most people will reciprocate and ask things about you. One first thing they will ask is what you do, what your research is about.</p>
<p>Here it is convenient to have not one, but two elevator pitches of your research. Use each one depending on who’s asking. (An elevator pitch is a 30 to 60 second description of your research, it should include what you do, why and how you do it)</p>
<p><b>First elevator pitch:</b> your grandma should understand it easily. This one you will use for non-experts in your field.</p>
<p><b>Second elevator pitch:</b> include all sorts of complicated jargon and be so scientifically correct that your PI couldn’t find a single flaw in your speech. This is for experts in your field.</p>
<h3><b> Don’t Only Talk About Work</b></h3>
<p>After a long day of presentations, poster sessions and work chit-chat at the dinner, it might be time to skip work and have some fun.</p>
<p>Try to shift conversations towards non-work related topics like hobbies and anecdotes. You can use the previous tips on how to listen to others and start asking more personal things.</p>
<p>When the bar opens, offer yourself to get some drinks for your mates.This will keep the spirits high and fuel a long night of fun discussions.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to share some advice by a PhD student that attended too many conferences in UK.</p>
<p>Try to drink some glasses of water during your alcohol intake. This minimizes the chances of enjoying a hang over and maximizes the chances of being fresh like a rose for next day’s talks.</p>
<h3><b>Now back to you</b></h3>
<p>What do you think of all this advice?</p>
<p>Do you have other tips to get the most of a scientific conference dinner?</p>
<p>What are your success stories networking at a conference?</p>

<p>Hello!  I am so excited to introduce you to <a href="http://braveintuitiveyou.com" target="_blank">Flora Bowley</a>!  She is an amazing painter who paints with intuition and a beautiful outlook on life.  Her work can be seen in homes, galleries, hotels, businesses (like, say, Rachel Ray!), around the world.  Flora has recently published a book called <a href="http://braveintuitiveyou.com/shop/my-book/" target="_blank">Brave Intuitive Painting</a> and teaches workshops and online classes about painting and art.</p>
<p>I love getting inside the mind of artists I respect.   Flora was super generous with her time and has answered some questions for us!  Enjoy!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3727" alt="Flora Bowley Artist and Painter.   Interview on Beautiful Hello Blog" src="http://beautifulhello.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/flora1.jpg?w=720"   /></p>
<p><strong><em>When did you begin creating artwork?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think I was born holding a crayon. Ha! No really, I have always  been creating in some way or another.  As a kid, I was really into  making &#8220;sculptures&#8221; and jewelery out of mud, sticks and seaweed.  I  even used to try and sell them which I find really funny&#8230;always  the entrepreneur.  I was also very into watercolors, markers,  crayons as a kid&#8230;pretty much anything that made color.  In high  school, I was admittedly the art teacher&#8217;s pet.  I assisted her in  hanging all the shows and somehow convinced the principal to let me  hang out in the art room for large parts of my day.</p>
<p>Honestly though, I never grew up thinking I could make a living as  an artist. I thought that honor was reserved for about ten people  in the world and surely I was not one of them.  So, I entered  college thinking I would become a graphic designer.  I will always  be grateful to my drawing teacher who, after observing my use of  color during a figure drawing class, pulled me aside to tell me  very pointedly, &#8220;You are a painter!  You must paint!&#8221;  From that  point on, I took as many painting classes as possible.  I had my  first show at a coffee shop when I was 20 and sold a number of  pieces.  That is when some sort of light bulb went off for me and I  decided I could actually make a living as an artist.  That became  the goal and I never looked back.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you describe your creative process?</em></strong></p>
<p>My creative process is extremely intuitive, forgiving and  free-flowing. I allow my paintings to emerge naturally by building  up many layers or acrylic paint.  I never start with a plan,  because it&#8217;s simply more interesting to me to NOT know what is  going to happen before it&#8217;s actually happening.  This allows for so  much more freedom and the ability to improvise and be spontaneous.    At any given moment, anything is possible and there is really no  way of making a &#8220;mistake&#8221; which I love!  If I don&#8217;t like something  I&#8217;ve done, I simply cover it up or transform it in some way the  next time I add a layer.   I always work on more than one painting  at a time so the layers have time to dry while I&#8217;m working on the  other paintings.  I also rotate my canvas many times and radically  change the color scheme throughout the process just to keep things  fresh and unexpected.  The whole process becomes kind of a metaphor  for living where bravery, playfulness, curiosity, honoring  intuition and being open to change are greatly rewarded.</p>

<p><strong><em>What inspires you in your day-to-day life as an artist?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gosh, so many things inspire me! I&#8217;ve always been really inspired  by the natural world and the cycles of life found there.  Things  like seed pods, cocoons, sprouts, blooms, branches and birds have  been themes in my work for many years.  I&#8217;m also really inspired by  music and I have a really hard time painting without it.  I allow  the rhythms, beats and lyrics to literally move my body and brush  around the canvas.  Music helps me get out of my head and into the  rest of my body which is so helpful in my process.  Lately, I&#8217;ve  also been really inspired by geometric shapes, graffiti, feathers,  shamanic symbols and florescent colors.  I like finding inspiration  in unexpected places too, like reading between the lines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any tips for overcoming &#8220;creative blocks&#8221;?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes!  I teach painting workshops all around the world, so helping  people through creative blocks is one of my specialties.  I believe  most creative blocks happen when we forget to trust ourselves.   When we start to question what we are doing, why we are doing it  and what to do next, we remove ourselves from the creative  flow&#8212;the intuitive place where we KNOW what to do without  over-thinking.  For me, this &#8220;knowing&#8221; place is deeply connected to  our soul which is deeply connected to everything around us.  When  we open ourselves up to this connection and feeling of belonging,  trusting our inner voice and intuitive urges becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Some ways I help people find this connection is through intention,  affirmations, ceremony, breath, movement,</p>
<p>music and poetry.  I also  have my students paint with their eyes closed or with the  non-dominant hand to help them free up. I encourage my students to  &#8220;dance&#8221; the paint across the canvas as they follow along to an  awesome song. There are so many ways to access this place of  freedom, but it all comes down to TRUST&#8230;and momentum <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<strong><em>What advice do you have for marketing yourself as an artist?</em></strong></p>
<p>The first thing I would say is to focus on creating the work and  developing a style for a good while before you start to focus on  marketing.  I&#8217;ve noticed lately, that a lot of people are anxious  to create a business out of their art before they have really  developed themselves as an artist.  I think this is a major pitfall  and probably the source of a lot of frustration.  Although I did  start having shows early on, I also worked as a waitress, massage therapist and yoga teacher for many years as I was learning about  paint and finding my voice.  Slowly, I worked my other jobs less  and less as my art started to support me more and more.  It was a  VERY gradual process over the course of many years and I&#8217;m grateful  for that process.</p>
<p>When you feel authentically ready to show and promote your work, I  suggest putting together a really simple and beautiful website that  highlights your work in a non-distracting way.  Blogging is also a  great way to share your story and keep things fresh for people who  are interested in what you are doing.  There are so many ways to  connect online now through social media, etc.  It&#8217;s an amazing and  powerful time to be an artist as the world is literally at your  fingertips!  But again, doing the work in the studio should be  taking up more time than doing the promotional work on your  computer.  At least that&#8217;s my opinion.</p>
<p><strong><em>What advice would you give to young artists starting a career in art?</em></strong></p>
<p>I would say much of what I said in response to the marketing  question, but I would also add that passion, dedication and belief  in what you are doing are the key ingredients to success.  If you  are not extremely passionate about making art, it&#8217;s probably not  the best career option for you.  It&#8217;s certainly not an easy way to  make a living, but if you <em>have to</em> create art to feel like  yourself, that is a very good place to start!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mashable recently published an article called <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/50-things-replaced-technology/"><strong>50 Things Replaced By Modern Technology</strong></a>. As I looked through their list of things people don&#8217;t do anymore, I definitely felt feelings of nostalgia bubbling up. Some of the things, however, I was not sad to see phased out as modern technology evolves. One example is #22 on Mashable&#8217;s list: &#8220;Renew your car registration by visiting the DMV.&#8221; Thank goodness things like renewing your car registration are now made easier by filling out an online form instead of waiting five hours at the DMV. On the hottest day of summer. When the building has no AC and you&#8217;re sandwiched between the sweaty guy who doesn&#8217;t know what deodorant is and the poor woman juggling three screaming children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sentimental person, so I decided to make my own list of things [on Mashable's list] that I wish WEREN&#8217;T replaced by modern technology. Check it out below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-fed-2136290.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-809" alt="print photography" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-fed-2136290.jpg?w=240&#038;h=160" width="240" height="160" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#1: Print photographs.</span></strong> I love printing photos, and I still do. Though it&#8217;s faster to upload an album onto Facebook than wait a day to receive my printed copies, there&#8217;s nothing quite like holding the actual photos in your hand and flipping through them as you remember the good times they hold. Shopping for the right frame for each photo is fun as well. Also, you can&#8217;t stick your Facebook photos on your wall to decorate your home (at least not yet).</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#2: Handwritten letters.</span></strong> When I was little, I used to write letters to my best friend, who lived a whole hour away from me. Granted, we saw each other pretty often, about once a week. But it was still nice to go through the mail as a kid and get excited when something came addressed to me! Wall posts and direct messages on Twitter just aren&#8217;t the same. One thing I realized is that waiting for someone to respond with a hand-written letter really teaches a kid patience. It&#8217;s not like today, where you start to freak out when it&#8217;s been two hours and your friend still hasn&#8217;t responded to your email. Aren&#8217;t other people on email 24/7 like I am?</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#3: Make mix tapes. </span></strong>This was like the ultimate sign that a guy liked you&#8230;in middle school. He&#8217;d hand you a mix tape full of the good stuff, like K-Ci &amp; JoJo, Monica, Boyz II Men, maybe throw in some Savage Garden. Back then, that was practically the same as asking you out (lucky guy, he didn&#8217;t actually have to vocalize that he liked you, just make a mix tape). The thing I miss about this is that people would take time to think about what songs to put on the tape, and how to make it obvious enough that they cared for the person.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#4: Check a map before or during a road trip or vacation. </span></strong>I have mixed feelings about this one. If we&#8217;re talking about technology like a GPS that just tells you where to go, then I wish maps weren&#8217;t replaced by GPS systems. However, I&#8217;m fine with Google Maps. Mostly what I hope doesn&#8217;t happen to youth growing up in a technology-driven generation is that they don&#8217;t learn to read maps. I think knowing how to read maps is a crucial life skill and parents should teach their kids (or themselves) how to do so, even if it&#8217;s on an iPhone 5.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#5: Develop and send off film for photographs. </span></strong>This kind of ties into #1, but when I read this one, I remembered the days when I&#8217;d wind the film in my camera so it wasn&#8217;t exposed, then pop the back open and stick the roll of film in an envelope at Costco to be developed. A few days later, those rolls of film would magically turn into photographs that I could then put into awesome new frames!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-cordless-phone128302.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-808" alt="cordless phone" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-cordless-phone128302.jpg?w=154&#038;h=231" width="154" height="231" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#6: Remember phone numbers. </span></strong>In elementary school, I could remember a good 5-10 of my friends&#8217; phone numbers. Now, I can remember maybe two numbers. When I was little, I didn&#8217;t have a cell phone, so I&#8217;d pick up the kitchen landline after school, dial a number, and start chatting away. I realize I had just seen them at school, but sometimes you can&#8217;t explain why you do things as a kid.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#7: Make a photo album. </span></strong>Making a scrapbook also goes with this one. Uploading an album online takes minimal effort. But the effort that goes into making a photo album or a scrapbook pays off when you flip through them years later. Not only can you put photos, you can also add ticket stubs, letters, stickers, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#8: Send love letters. </span></strong>My elementary school boyfriend would write me letters, which he&#8217;d then give to his friend, who delivered them to me. I guess there&#8217;s a good and bad side to having physical letters which you can save. Obviously we&#8217;re not together anymore, but back then I&#8217;d read and re-read his letters until the paper was super wrinkled. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a nice keepsake, and physical love letters are something you can look at without having to turn on your computer first.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-epic-fail-grade140436.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-807" alt="stockvault handwriting" src="http://itsmichelleguo.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/stockvault-epic-fail-grade140436.jpg?w=169&#038;h=240" width="169" height="240" /></a><span style="font-size:18px;">#9: Hand-write essays and school work. </span></strong>I really, really hope hand-writing never gets fully phased out. Sometimes, when I haven&#8217;t written with a pen for a while and then I do, it&#8217;s super embarrassing. It&#8217;s like what I&#8217;d imagine a first-grader&#8217;s hand-writing looks like. Another reason why kids should still hand-write essays and school work is so that they can fully appreciate how good they have it with modern technology at their hands.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">#10: Keep a personal diary. </span></strong>I&#8217;ve got a collection of journals/diaries at home (no, I won&#8217;t tell you where) dating from sometime in middle school to college. I used to write in them before I went to sleep. Mostly about guys I liked and how emo I was. But it was incredibly therapeutic and a great way to get my thoughts out of my head so I wasn&#8217;t consumed by them. Also a good way to practice my hand-writing. The danger of keeping a personal online diary is the potential for it to be hacked and your secrets exposed to the world. Or even an accidental publishing as &#8220;Public&#8221; instead of &#8220;Private.&#8221; Of course, with off-line diaries, you also run the risk of your younger siblings finding them and reading them secretly (true story).</p>
<p><em>Check out Mashable&#8217;s list for yourself. What are some things that YOU wish weren&#8217;t replaced by modern technology?</em></p>
