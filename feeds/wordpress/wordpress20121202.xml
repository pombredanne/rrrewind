				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally managed to get down to <a href="http://www.sculpturebythesea.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Sculpture by the Sea</a> on the weekend. Ever since I moved to Sydney I have been meaning to check it out but I kept leaving it until the last minute and then for some reason I would never get there. I saw the sculpture park in Western Australia a couple of times, so I am happy I finally got to do the coastal walk on the opposite side of Australia! The walk between Bondi and Tamarama is pretty breathtaking already, the sculptures literally add another dimension. Sculpture by the Sea is on again in March 2013 at Cottesloe Beach in WA and also in June 2013 at Aarhus in Denmark.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As avid readers (because there are some, right??) know, Jack McAuliffe, the acknowledged founder of the craft brewing movement, is a friend. In January, Boston Beer Company &#8212; known to you as Sam Adams &#8212; <a href="http://allaboutbeer.com/daily-pint/whats-brewing/2012/07/the-return-of-new-albion-americas-first-craft-brewery-gets-a-revival/" target="_blank">will introduce New Albion Ale,</a> based on the recipe Jack used to make his first beer in the late 1970s.</p>
<div id="attachment_45" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 262px"><a href="http://maureenogle.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jack-scaled500.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-45" alt="" src="http://maureenogle.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jack-scaled500.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo courtesy of Michael E. Miller and Jack McAuliffe</p></div>
<p>That means that lately there’s been an unusual amount of attention paid to Jack and to his brewery, New Albion. Which means that I’ve been hearing more than the usual iterations of a question I’m often asked: “Is New Albion really important?”   <span id="more-6484"></span></p>
<p>By which the questioner means:</p>
<blockquote><p> “Hey, McAuliffe’s brewery only lasted a few years. Most people interested in craft beer had never even heard of the guy until your book came out. He can’t be that important.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I usually say something like</p>
<blockquote><p>“He deserved the credit. Would someone else have done what he did? Eventually. But at the time, he inspired others to do what he’d done, namely cobble together some raw materials, build a brewery, and make beer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>(And I mention <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/about/history.html" target="_blank">Ken Grossman and Sierra Nevada</a> as an example of the direct influence of Jack and New Albion.)</p>
<p>So that’s the background. (Yeah. You know me: The background takes more time than the main point. What can I say? I’m a historian. Context is everything.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this has been on my mind. Or, more accurately, my brain has been busy pondering the “Would someone else have done what he did?” I say “apparently” because I didn’t realize I was even thinking about this until yesterday, when the following crashed into my brain’s foreground and grabbed my attention:</p>
<p>When people have asked me the aforementioned question, I’ve usually skipped over the “would someone else have done what he did” part and spoke mainly to the “direct influence” part of why Jack matters. Because of course I had no idea if someone else <em>would</em> have done what Jack did.</p>
<p>Until now. Thanks to my busy brain, I now have a different take on the issue of “does Jack matter?” (*1) It goes like this.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that a craft brewing industry wouldn’t have shown up eventually, right? After all, at the same time that craft of beer pioneers were doing their thing, the “good coffee” movement started. Other entrepreneurs were experimenting with a return to good bread. Micro-distilleries began showing up in the early 1990s. Natural foods were going great guns in the 1980s.</p>
<p>So at some point someone would have come up with a “craft brewing industry.” (*2)</p>
<p>BUT: it’s not clear to me that, without Jack (or some one like Jack) it would have looked like the do-it-yourself, self-reliant industry that it was and to a certain extent still is.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>Jack’s brewery failed, but the <em>way</em> he built his company became the foundational model for the craft brewing industry that emerged in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Ken Grossman, for example, had already dreamed about opening a brewery, a dream inspired in part by his love of good beer but also by a visit to <a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com" target="_blank">Anchor Brewing</a> in San Francisco. But when Ken visited Anchor, he saw an insurmountable obstacle: a full-blown brewery with “real” brewing equipment. Grossman knew he couldn’t pull that off, or at least not until he’d devoted a few decades to saving the many thousands of dollars such a venture would require.</p>
<p>When he visited New Albion, however, he saw instantly that here was a model that he could emulate and do so with relatively little cash. (He and his then-partner Paul Camusi scrounged $50,000 in start-up funds, mostly from family.) If he could find spare parts, which was what Jack had done, he could use his engineering/carpentry/handyman skills to build a brewhouse.</p>
<p>So he did, and so did other early pioneers, and the rest, as the cliche goes, is history.</p>
<p>But let’s ponder an alternative history, one based on a combination of speculation and fact.</p>
<p>Here’s a fact, one based on my six years spent thinking and writing about meat in America:</p>
<p>Food and food fads are like anything else: if there’s a profit to be made, if there’s a fad to ride, someone will jump in and try to make some money on it.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, for example, a couple of marketing types in California noted the interest in “natural” foods and began selling “Rocky the Ranger” chickens, which they touted as free-range and natural. The chickens weren’t, but that didn’t matter. Plenty of people were willing to pay big bucks for natural poultry. (Among them was Wolfgang Puck, just then hitting his stride and his celebrity, who began serving Rocky at his restaurants. He was none too pleased to discover, during a blind taste test, that neither he nor other tasters could tell the difference between high-priced Rocky and plain ol’ chicken).</p>
<p>Here’s another, more relevant example:</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams_(beer)" target="_blank">Jim Koch, then working at Boston Consulting Group,</a> had a early-mid-life crisis and decided he needed a job with more soul than helping Fortune 500 types figure out how to make billions rather than millions. Brewing was in his family (as he’s fond of pointing out, he’s the fifth generation to work in beer), and when he pondered his future while perched on a barstool, he noticed that yuppies, as they were called then, were dropping serious money to pay for imported beer (think Heineken and St. Pauli).</p>
<p>That market niche intrigued him. After a bit of investigation, Jim learned that there were a handful of people scattered around the country making what amounted to nineteenth-century beers (real, pure, made from four ingredients, blah blah blah). There, Koch decided, lay his future. In this case, he skipped the do-it-yourself route and instead contracted to brew his lager using “real” brewmasters at “real” breweries.</p>
<p>Jim Koch happens to be a guy with a soul. (*3)  The company he built melds with and has been a key component of the craft beer industry.</p>
<p>But it’s clear that what Koch did, some other suit-and-tie could have done, too. (*4)</p>
<p>Which brings me, finally, to my point. (Thanks for sticking with me).</p>
<div id="attachment_6562" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://maureenogle.com/2012/11/28/my-brain-at-work-on-the-origins-of-craft-brewing/brewing-company/" rel="attachment wp-att-6562"><img class="size-large wp-image-6562" alt="" src="http://maureenogle.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/brewing-company.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=640" height="640" width="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New Albion Brewing, c. 1977.

<p>Had Jack McAuliffe not built his whacky, nineteenth-century-inspired, spare-parts brewery, a craft beer industry would have emerged anyway. But it likely would have been built by suits-and-ties; business types with more interest in profit than beer who’d wangled bank loans and built a brewery along the same lines as conventional brewing (read: Anheuser Busch) except in miniature. And then, I’m guessing, sold to the first big brewer who came along (and remember that both Miller and AB “came along” and started buying/acquiring shares in small fry in the late 1980s).</p>
<p>Instead of the “think local/think pure and real” craft brewing industry we’ve got now, with all its glory, creativity, and dynamism, we’d have ended up with a bastardized version in which the Big Boys made a few shitty “craft” beers, and instead of the few thousand breweries that now exist in the U. S., we’d probably still have, oh, 79 or 80. And I doubt we’d have locally owned and operated brewpubs. We might have chain restaurants with brewing equipment prominently displayed behind glass, but that’s not quite the same thing as the truly fascinating, truly local brewpub culture that has flourished in the U. S. in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>So. Jack matters not because he succeeded &#8212; he didn’t &#8212; but because of the way he built his company: from scraps, with next to no cash, and with a truckload of heart, soul, and hard work.</p>
<p>End of great idea.</p>
<p>For now.Part of my busy brain has been thinking hard about a new book and what it wants to write (and why would I get in its way!?) is a book about, well, I’m not quite sure yet but something about the craft beer industry, the nature of contemporary capitalism, the shift to the local, and the way all things digital have transformed all of it. I have the feeling I’m going to be thinking this book out loud, if you will, here at the blog. So it’s possible that this is a tentative first step toward this vague, amorphous, and possibly bad idea that’s churning around in my brain. We’ll see.</p>
<p>And comments and feedback are most welcome. Have at it.</p>
<p>Oh: And no, not quite finished with meat book. But I have  written a major chunk of that<a href="http://maureenogle.com/2012/11/08/still-peddling/" target="_blank"> pesky new chapter my editor wanted. </a></p>
<p>UPDATE AFTER THE FACT: I should have included this link first time around. Two years ago, Jay Brooks and Natalie and Vinnie Cilurzo went to the New Albion site with Jack. Ja<a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/the-new-albion-brewery-site-30-years-later/" target="_blank">y made sure to document the visit.</a></p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>*1: I’m continually impressed by how much work my brain does without me even asking it to. Brains are important, you know? If we have a Mother’s Day and a National Pizza Day, and a “Talk Like A Pirate” day, why in hell don’t we have a “Thank Your Brain” day?</p>
<p>*2: Hmmm. That raises a fascinating question that I only thought of while writing this blog entry: How long would it have taken Charlie Papazian to go the next step; to travel from homebrewing-as-national-movement, which was what he was primarily interested in in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, to “let’s take homebrewing to the next step”?</p>
<p>*3: Some would disagree with that view. But I would argue that one need only look at the way he’s operated his company to know that when he said he intended to build a corporation with a heart and soul, he meant it.</p>
<p>*4: Indeed, the essence of the messy craft beer boom of the 1990s was precisely that: suit-and-tie types bringing in big money to cash in on what was then seen as a profitable market niche.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1088" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shnakepup/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1088" alt="" src="http://thisiswhyimdrunk.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/3756320937_0d5e9fdc2d_b.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via jayRez on Flickr</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;The Wright Brothers would kick us all right in the $#%@ right now if they knew.&#8221; &#8211; Louis C.K.</p>
<p>Flying sucks.</p>
<p>But, as <a href="http://www.nps.gov/wrbr/index.htm">The Ones Who Invented Flight</a>, it is our inalienable right to alter and forcefully evolve what that experience means and what relationship we have with it, imparting true American virtues of impatience, greed and contempt for anyone outside friends or family we&#8217;re traveling with.</p>
<p>As The Ones Who Invented Flight it is our unfortunate reality to have willingly bastardized this marvel of modern transportation into something we need, we love and then decry its virtues in order to make ourselves feel better about unforeseen circumstances that &#8220;ruin&#8221; our days. <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/1myllo/stand-up-louis-ck--uncensored---the-miracle-of-flight">This guy gets it</a>.</p>
<p>It is fitting then, that one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub">best things about flying didn&#8217;t originate with us</a>, The Ones Who Invented Flight. <strong>Thank god for the airport bar</strong>.<br />
<span id="more-1076"></span></p>
<p>As a means of travel, flying is incredibly efficient and amazing. We can traverse the globe as we please. As a means of travel, flying has also been able to showcase the worst parts of us as The Ones Who Invented Flight. We complain, we push and we complain and push and passive-aggressively sigh heavy breaths until the purpose of flying comes forth &#8211; we&#8217;re just in it just to get ours.</p>
<p>What &#8220;ours&#8221; is could be many things, but what it is most certainly is an effort to obtain what we want at the expense of others. This is why we want the best parking at the airport, why we feel the need to form lines before we actually form a line to board the airplane and why we curse under our breath at airline employees who haven&#8217;t called our boarding group number. We lament the fact we haven&#8217;t gotten from A to B in the fastest way possible for <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>But most important, among all this insanity, we find a timeless oasis to put all of these things aside. Because for as much as the airport shows us how rampant American impatience and greed can be, it also shows us how simple it is to find common ground and swap a story or two over beer.</p>
<p>The airport bar is an oasis because (percentage-wise) only a select few choose to indulge. Prices are high, but the men and women who saunter up to the bar take part in the true American act of &#8220;taking a load off.&#8221; Springsteen would be proud, wouldn&#8217;t he? Blue collar raising a glass with each other, and even sometimes, executives. We drink American beers &#8211; sometimes locally made &#8211; and we share stories of where we&#8217;re from, where we&#8217;re going and why we can&#8217;t wait to get there.</p>
<p>At the airport bar, solo travelers find companions who may share some common ground in the need to get away from it all for a moment or two. Because at the airport bar, what makes us lousy, selfish savages Out There, whittles away to general decency In Here.</p>
<p>The airport bar is an oasis because it gives us strength through imbibing (responsibly) to put up with the crap. The airport bar is an oasis because when we are without friends, it reminds us of the kindness of strangers among a sea of callousness.</p>
<p>The airport bar is an oasis because in the midst of coming and going all over the world, what it is, in the end, <em>is a little piece of home</em>.</p>
<p><em>*Note: This <del>rant</del> love letter was inspired by lots of travel in recent months.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/daily-prompt-15/" target="_blank">The Daily Post</a> told me to &#8220;Picture the one person in the world you really wish were reading your blog. Write her or him a letter.&#8221; I chose you, Santa. I know it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve written. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>When I was a little girl, you were a powerful motivator. I had to behave myself all year (well, mostly November and December &#8211; your threats didn&#8217;t work too well in July) so that you would visit. You stopped bringing me presents when I was still in single digits. I hope you can understand that I kind of lost faith in you for a little while.</p>
<p>I was a skeptic from early on. It began with the fact that we didn&#8217;t even have a chimney. How would you get inside without a chimney? My mom assured me that you didn&#8217;t need one even though a chimney was integral to all the stories about you. The seed of doubt had been planted. Then, I realized that you had the same handwriting and even used the same wrapping paper as my mom. My doubt strengthened. She told me that you were so busy that you had enlisted her into your Christmas army. If it wasn&#8217;t for her help and help from parents like her, there was no way that you could finish all that work in time for Christmas. I believed her for a little while, but eventually, I thought you were a sham.</p>
<p>Can you ever forgive me? You see, I had a lot going on in my life then. I didn&#8217;t trust the people closest to me. My mom&#8217;s insistence that she was part of your elf army just struck me as another lie in a long list of them. I wish I had believed her. I wish I could have hung on to you for a little while longer. I miss your visits. I miss the anticipation of Christmas eve where I could hardly sleep because I was excited. I miss opening my eyes on Christmas morning and running downstairs to find that you had eaten the cookies we left out.</p>
<p>I took you for granted, Santa. I threw you away. I cast aside the kindest, most magical person in the whole world, because I couldn&#8217;t or just didn&#8217;t want to believe. Well, I&#8217;d like to believe in you now, if that&#8217;s alright. I know I&#8217;m a little old, but I&#8217;d like to believe in you. Please, don&#8217;t feel like you need to leave something at my house (even though I do have a chimney now). Could you use one of my Christmases to visit the house of a kid like me instead? Visit a kid who has already had too much adulthood forced upon them and doesn&#8217;t want to believe in you. Tell that kid that it&#8217;s alright to let his or her guard down, if only for one day a year. Tell them that there will be plenty of time for being an adult later on, but now, it&#8217;s time to be a kid. It&#8217;s okay to believe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave some cookies and milk on the counter for you this year if you&#8217;d like to take a rest at my house.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Santa.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Goldfish</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tara and I hadn&#8217;t spoken for 16 years but when she friended me on Facebook in 2009, clicking &#8220;accept&#8221; was a no brainer. I messaged her immediately.</p>
<h4><em>Ms. Mitchell!</em></h4>
<h4><em>Do you ever age? Bitch.</em></h4>
<h4><em>p.s. Hi Tara!</em><br />
<em>p.p.s. You look lovely!</em></h4>
<p>She responded&#8230;</p>
<h4><em>I am timeless.</em></h4>
<h4><em>p.s. Hello Nicole!<br />
p.p.s. Wish you were next door&#8230;</em></h4>
<p>Tara was my next door neighbor in the dorms my freshman year of college. She liked Cat Stevens and the Violent Femmes. She smoked clove cigarettes out of her window and played the flute. She was 6 feet tall (or 5&#8217;12&#8243; as she liked to put it) and was asked so frequently about her height that she posted it on her nametag at a waitressing job because she got tired of people asking.</p>
<p>Tara had taken me to my first &#8220;Rocky Horror Picture Show&#8221; and taught me when to throw the bread. She introduced me to my first pot dealer, though Tara never smoked weed. She once had driven me to hunt for Benadryl during an ice storm because I was allergic to her family&#8217;s cat. I had only good memories associated with Tara.</p>
<p>After accepting her friend request, I lost track of her, seeing pictures here and there on Facebook, noticing one of Tara in a hospital bed and assuming a torn ligament or minor surgery because of our age. Then one day I clicked on a photo and learned she wasn&#8217;t in for minor surgery. Tara was in for a brain tumor. From there I found a blog she&#8217;d been writing since her diagnosis in 2009 shortly after my mom passed away. She&#8217;d been fighting a life-threatening tumor for three years, and I hadn&#8217;t even noticed. I don&#8217;t even think Tara was in my News Feed.</p>
<p>If this had happened in another decade, Tara would have remained out of my social circle. And maybe years later I would have heard about her condition while reconnecting with an old college friend. But now I was personally connected through a few mouse clicks, watching this woman, now 34, go through chemotherapy, brain surgery, and physical therapy, wearing the brave smile that people facing their own mortalities sport so you won&#8217;t worry about them or their positive &#8220;gonna beat this&#8221; attitude.</p>
<p>I wrote Tara a snail mail letter (it seemed more personal) apologizing for not realizing what she was going through for so long, blaming Facebook but at the same time knowing it was the only thing that had enabled me to learn of her condition. Pictures of her with a cane digressed into photos of her strapped in a wheelchair, her left side paralyzed, a smile on her face, puffy from steroids.</p>
<p>As I watched her body deteriorate, I witnessed the misguided bright-sided Facebook wall posts from Tara&#8217;s friends who had never experienced cancer. Comments like, &#8220;Boy, I wish I could get out of going to work like you&#8221; and &#8220;Wow, rehab looks fun. Is it like the dorms?&#8221; I wrote Tara asking her how she handled all this asinine commentary. She understood the intent but admitted, yeah, she&#8217;d love to be well enough to go to work — and no, struggling to learn how to walk again was nothing like college.</p>
<p>I mailed her a &#8220;Fuck Cancer&#8221; hat similar to the one I&#8217;d purchased for my mother. She posted an Instagram photo of it with a &#8220;This gave me a laugh, thanks Nicole!&#8221; to her Facebook wall. During a late night Facebook IM session, Tara admitted that as an only child,  she was aching for alone time but couldn&#8217;t get it — her parents were her caregivers 24/7. She couldn&#8217;t go to the bathroom by herself because of her mobility issues and the only time her folks left her with a friend she had a life-threatening seizure that &#8220;really freaked everyone out.&#8221; Tara joked that she was now on lockdown and as an &#8220;HSP&#8221; (highly sensitive person) this change in lifestyle had been even more unnerving.</p>
<p>Her HSP reference reminded me that in college, Tara and I had bonded over the &#8220;Highly Sensitive Person,&#8221; a book by a therapist named Elaine Aron who knew my mother. I wrote Aron for advice about what Tara could do to achieve alone time. Elaine advised Tara to use silence to achieve solitude. Tara said she&#8217;d try it.</p>
<p>I sent Tara a mix of folk music that made me think of college. My music choices reflected what I thought her music taste would be now. I learned on Facebook that she had a fondness for Justin Timberlake. I lamented making her CD so unhip and Grateful Dead laden. She sent me a postcard with familiar handwriting that I remembered from notes she left on my door in the dorms. She asked me to visit.</p>
<p>I was afraid that seeing Tara in person would bring up all of my memories of watching my mother die, memories that after three years I had finally been able to relegate to the background of my thoughts. I learned that a short film I wrote and produced would be screening in Seattle four months into the future. I told Tara I would visit her for a weekend then but told her to warn me if her health rapidly declined I&#8217;d find a way to visit earlier, knowing full well that I couldn&#8217;t get days off my television production job. Though Tara must have known she probably wouldn&#8217;t be healthy enough to see me by then (she was on Hospice) she emailed me that she was excited about the visit and said we could have a dorm reunion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d had drama with almost all of the girls from my freshman dorm and the thought of seeing them made me feel nauseous. One had sent me an email that started, &#8220;Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you&#8230;&#8221; when I didn&#8217;t make time to visit her in L.A. 10 years ago. Another had been my roommate who went back and forth between our apartment and her boyfriend&#8217;s leaving messes in both locations then trading them out before cleaning either up. Another was a straight girl I had slept with Spring Trimester who broke my heart.</p>
<p>Worrying about myself in awkward social situations while Tara was dying made me feel selfish and petty. I went for a hike with my friend Cheryl and told her about the situation, that Tara wanted me to visit, that I had reservations about seeing her so ill, from seeing people from my past and revisiting the Pacific Northwest for the first time since college — a place I&#8217;d intentionally never returned to because college was such a hard time for me. But I had to somehow overlook these bad associations, I told her. Who was I to deny a dying friend&#8217;s wish? Cheryl asked, &#8220;Would you even have reconnected with this person if it hadn&#8217;t been for Facebook?&#8221; I admitted I probably wouldn&#8217;t have. Tara hadn&#8217;t been a close friend through most of college. We lost touch after our softmore year and before that we&#8217;d been mostly acquaintances. I had completely lost track of Tara after graduation and only lamented that fact after I realized she was sick.</p>
<p>Part of why we&#8217;d never been closer was that Tara was an extrovert who loved hanging out in groups, while I was more of a one-on-one person. Small talk with people tossing cigarette butts in rain-filled glasses was the only way I ever was around Tara, and even then I always felt like I never saw enough of her. &#8220;Not to discount your relationship to this person,&#8221; Cheryl said, &#8220;but there are probably a lot more people who are much closer to Tara vying for her attention right now.&#8221; Cheryl was right. I was seeing myself as the center of Tara&#8217;s universe, overrating my importance in her life like people are bound to do when someone they know is dying. I had watched this happen with my mother as acquaintance after acquaintance showed up at our door, preventing her from getting much needed rest. I knew the visits were more about their guilt, their feelings of helplessness than about them giving my mother what she needed.</p>
<p>I was going to visit Tara and yet in all of this time we hadn&#8217;t even talked on the phone. I emailed her to see if I could get her phone number but she didn&#8217;t respond. In our last correspondence, I suggested we Skype so we could see each other. In an email laden with spelling and typos so severe I could barely decipher it, Tara said it was a great idea but had no idea how to set it up. It was clear from her writing that she had gotten much sicker. Then she grew silent. I sent a few emails saying I hoped she was getting the alone time she needed and that she was in my thoughts, but received no response. Her Facebook account had gone silent as well. People posted photo after photo of Tara when she was healthy at parties, dinners, outdoor fairs. I didn&#8217;t have any photos of Tara to share.</p>
<p>I felt helpless and guilty, like I should have done more, like I should have gotten over my differences with those girls from the dorm and reconnected with them. If I had, I would have been able to stay connected to Tara in some human way off-line.</p>
<p>Then out of the blue I got an email from one of them — the girl who had broken my heart. She said she realized that Tara and I had reconnected in recent months and wanted to let me know Tara was now bed-ridden and losing her vision from the tumor. She could no longer swallow. It wouldn&#8217;t be long now. She said she was going to visit her that weekend and said she&#8217;d give Tara my love.</p>
<p>I was so grateful. A few days later, I heard back from my friend that she&#8217;d given Tara my sentiments and that Tara had said, &#8220;Tell Nicole I love her. She&#8217;s coming to Seattle soon, you know.&#8221; She had never received my email saying I had canceled my trip because I couldn&#8217;t get the days off work. I was relieved that disappointment wouldn&#8217;t be my last gift to Tara. The panic that had overtaken me while waiting for news had abated. I had gotten some form of a goodbye, some form of closure.</p>
<p>The girl who broke my heart promised to email me when Tara died, but she didn&#8217;t. I learned about Tara&#8217;s death on Facebook from a Community Page that had been created to keep people in the loop about Tara&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>For weeks after her death, Tara was still listed as online on Facebook, the symbol of her mobile phone next to her photo and name in my IM contacts. I visited her page frequently to see her friends&#8217; comments about how much they missed her, about the little things that made them think of her. I had nothing to contribute, no memories to recount, because Tara hadn&#8217;t existed in real-time for me since 1995 when we both were 18 and considered our foreign language requirements and the Japanese exchange student&#8217;s cardboard box of hard liquor going dry &#8220;real problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the icon of Tara&#8217;s cell phone disappeared from my online contacts. The relief of no longer seeing her name evaporates each time she shows up in my list of Facebook friends or when Facebook recommends pages she liked before she died. Whether she wants to or not, Tara no longer has a say as to whether she will exist on Facebook. Those disturbing photos of her when she was sick could be online for the next 30 years. Whether her continued online presence haunts us or comforts us, Facebook is indifferent. The social network has always functioned as a double-edged sword, bringing us closer together while accenting how far apart we really are. To the Facebook logorithm, Tara and I are just as close as she is to her other friends and she&#8217;s just as alive as when I accepted her friend request four years ago. The only difference now is she&#8217;s in my News Feed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-align:left;">Three days after stepping off the plane in Paris, I jumped out of one in rural Normandy.  Normal, quoi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">My uncle (of sorts), who had furnished me a place to stay in Paris my <a title="Je reprends le collier" href="http://lanomademoderne.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/je-reprends-le-collier/">first night</a> vite fait, and with whom I was staying a week before heading south to where I&#8217;d be living for the year, e-mailed me a few days before my departure, asking me a no-frills question: My son and I are going to do our first skydive on Sunday, would you care to join us?  And me, well, I said yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So we drove out to the aérodrome in Saint-André-de-l&#8217;Eure for a &#8220;baptême de l&#8217;air&#8221; (France is a Catholic country, remember) and found a large group of people waiting equally for their chance to attain salvation.  We joined the line and my nervousness grew for the next three hours (worried to panicked and all the stages of denial in-between).</p>
<p>Once our names were called, there was a quick five-minute briefing about how to get in the airplane, how to jump, how to take over and release the emergency parachute in case your instructor became unconscious.  Or dead.  Ce du gâteau, hein?  Fastoche.</p>
<p>Visibly trembling, I suited up (snazzy), met my instructor (chatty &#8211; a shame since I had lost the ability to speak French about an hour before we left my uncle&#8217;s house) and was escorted out to the tarmac, waddling clumsily along in my straps.  Good thing this was all captured on video!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yopethop/8195185755"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://lanomademoderne.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/saut01.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=427" height="427" width="640" /></a></p>

<p>The pilot (a Belgian who flies like a madman, so said my instructor) hardly took a moment to stop before taking off again.  I was sat on the lap of my instructor, on the immediate right of the pilot, facing into the cabin.  Then up, up, to where the fields below were just blocks of color, and further still to where all traces of land were hidden behind a thick layer of clouds.  I can describe the ascent in quite a nice and flowery way now, though at the time, not much more than a string of profanities (both English and French) was going through my head.  Why, why, why.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Ah, the half-hearted grin of a girl convinced of her imminent death, interrupted by my instructor, who strapped us so closely together that it hurt, an annoying pain that I appreciated, as I was sure it would be the physical sensation I would experience before an eternity of lifelessness.  Spoiler alert: I live.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When the door slid open, we scooted to the edge and my legs hung out, clicking against the underside of the plane.  Contrary to what every fiber of my being was telling me to do, my instructor made me lay my head back on his shoulder, rocked a couple of times, and we tumbled forward.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In case it needs repeating or you stepped away for a moment, I jumped out of an airplane.  An airplane.  Eurgh, it&#8217;s scarier to think about even now.  Why did I do that?!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The free-fall was for a distance of about 3000 meters, and lasted around a minute.  Once the parachute was released &#8211; the best thing to ever happen in my life &#8211; we floated the remaining 1000 meters for six or seven minutes.  The scenery was as plain as it had been pre-jump, but it felt wonderful to slowly spiral down over it, knowing that I&#8217;d be living and breathing on it again soon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Phew!  Glad I&#8217;ve done it, but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s all over, too!  Jamais plus&#8230;At least I have the pictures to prove it!  Mes grands remerciements à l&#8217;équipe de <a href="http://www.flytandem.fr/">FlyTandem</a> for their in-flight photography and expertise as I flung myself out of a plane 4000 meters in the air.  I wouldn&#8217;t trust just anyone to catch me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1144" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px"><a href="http://mikeallegra.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/squirrel.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1144" title="My pal" alt="" src="http://mikeallegra.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/squirrel.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I saw what you did to that cat and, well, I just wanted to thank you. I also want a peanut.</p></div>
<p>I love the idea of sitting in an Adirondack chair on a sunny day with a pad and a pen. There’s something so romantic, so wonderful about writing in nature.  So, once in a while, I give it a try.</p>
<p>And then the pollen goes up my nose. And the bugs bite. And the sun get too hot and my hands get sweaty, and, since I’m a lefty, I smear the ink with my sweaty hand – which is not such a big deal because I’m not writing anything worth keeping anyway, because every time a leaf crinkles, I look up in eager anticipation of finding that feral cat that I oh, so wanna hit with a rock because NO ONE menaces my squirrels without hearing from me, buddy!</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>So I guess what I’m saying is that, when I try to write in it, nature distracts and annoys me.</p>
<p>Otherwise nature and I have no real problems. It often delights me. When the weather is right, I could stand around in nature all day interacting with it in the most genial and stupid ways. For example, the other day I caught myself waving at a squirrel. He didn’t wave back – that would be asking too much, I suppose – but he did seem to take the gesture in the spirit in which it was given and that pleased me no end.</p>
<p>Better still, I have discoverd that actions such as these improve my writing.</p>
<p>I have the bad habit of chaining myself to my desk. Even when my brain refuses to work, I stay put. In general this could be defined as good self-discipline. You can’t just sit around and wait for the muse, after all. It never shows up when you want it to. Since the words aren’t going to write themselves, I muscle through.</p>
<p>But every writer reaches a point when good self-discipline evolves into something that looks a whole lot more like masochism. Nothing’s gonna come no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p>So I pry myself away and tell myself it’s not procrastination if I deliver myself back to the desk eventually. Then I take a walk and wave at squirrels. Doing so restores my overall sense of well-being. It provides the second wind I need to get back to my awful, awful writing and make something that at least resembles progress.</p>
<p>Better yet, such a walk allows me to pursue my new hobby: feral cat chasing. In the grand scheme of things, saving a squirrel is always more important than a well-written paragraph.</p>
