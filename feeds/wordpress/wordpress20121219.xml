				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The medium known as Twitter used to be a piece of the puzzle I didn&#8217;t get. I am not interested in famous people doing things I cannot afford or the hygiene habits of anyone&#8211;celebrity or civilian. Then Twitter was at the heart of of the Arab Spring, political debate, and of course, food culture.</p>
<p>Now I’m on Twitter all the time.  Twitter has been the form of social media where my following has grown the fastest.  It is a virtual cocktail party where people say pithy things and make and break friends on the daily.  It’s so important that Tweets are archived.  The billions of words uttered on Twitter are not just part of an endless digital feed, they are records of our civilization as we currently live, experience and digest it.</p>
<p>So why throw an enslaved cook in the mix?  Meet @antebellumchef</p>
<p>There are other anachronistic Twitter accounts to be sure, but very few like mine which deal with the day to day existence of a person from the past.  @antebellumchef on Twitter is my way of bringing to life another side of myself that has a lot to say about food, cooking, the past.  On Twitter unfortunately, people expect @Koshersoul to be a clearing house for all things kosher and Black/soul food, etc…..For me, I don’t really feel that…@Koshersoul is a nickname, kinda like when I say “Chocolate Chosen,” that embraces two sides of my current self that are spiritual, historical, ethnic, cultural, “racial,” etc.  It’s supposed to be the whole me, but I find myself limited and a bit fenced in by people’s perceptions of that branding and name.  People don’t want me to talk about certain things&#8212;namely anything “trayf,” or non-kosher food..and that’s hard when you’re trying to be in the flow of all things food related.</p>
<div id="attachment_1776" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 692px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_2588/" rel="attachment wp-att-1776"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776" alt="The Punkah at Melrose" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_2588.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" width="682" height="1024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Punkah at Melrose</p></div>
<p>@antebellumchef doesn’t have these dilemmas.  He is an unmarried (and there are reasons for that), 30 something Black male living in about 1858-1859 leading up through the Civil War.  He covertly reads under cover of darkness and on Sundays, he notes the intrigues of the Big House and talks (tweets) about the world around him with its mundane colors and infrequent crises.  His dream is to run away and become a wealthy caterer in the North.  For now he has no name but that may reveal itself in time.</p>
<p>@antebellumchef is a way for me to express how I view food.  It’s easy as a person who does living history to become wrapped up in replication of traditional or historic foods and recipes.  I think of myself as an untrained but educated chef whose education is right out of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  That’s not really a job that markets itself in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  My mind is fixed on 18<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century foodways of Africa, the West Indies, South America, and South and early America with the eye of at 21<sup>st</sup> century food person.  I am limited to the ingredients and methods of the time, but with a contemporary eye and with contemporary advantages. I want be so anchored in the wisdom and experience of the historic and global kitchen to the point where I can channel the recipes we&#8217;ve forgotten.</p>
<p><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/11/02/the-cotton-kingdom-a-photographic-essay/dent/" rel="attachment wp-att-1713"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" alt="dent" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dent.jpg?w=590"   /></a></p>
<p>@antebellumchef allows me to bring some of that energy out.  It’s a very lonely place to be otherwise.  Food and culinary historians, contemporary chefs and food writers, academics, food producers, and the like do not have all of those identities in one person.  I don’t fancy myself a culinary savior.  I suppose I am a culinary preservationist, but at the end of the day I guess one of my dreams is to not just create recipes in the image of the past but to bring to those ingredients a contemporary life they have not yet known.  I get great pleasure out of the minutiae that you need to know to do what I do, and an even greater pleasure teaching those facts to others.</p>
<p>This is where I think as a cook and not just as a food person absorbing other people’s energies.  Because I don’t have a restaurant or cookbook where I demonstrate that product for you as of yet, this account allows me to let you into my mental gymnastics as I try to figure out “What’s for dinner?”  But I also have to think about power, ethics, control, food injustice, discomfort food and culinary plagiarism…both with an contemporary and an antique mind.  It’s the nature of ingredients, their story, their relationship to each other, to the land, to me, to the eater.  Outside of my kosher/soul and antebellumchef identities I’m more of an culinary voyeur, but with them I have agency, choice, discretion and an opinion.  How ironic that they are on two opposite poles of ways to enjoy and understand food.</p>
<div id="attachment_1779" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_3037/" rel="attachment wp-att-1779"><img class="size-large wp-image-1779" alt="A Cowhorn Cayenne" src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_3037.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" width="1024" height="682" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Cowhorn Cayenne</p></div>
<p>@antebellumchef is also a place where I can vent my spiritual energies.  I’ve been to a lot of plantations and sites where enslaved people live.  From a spiritual place, it’s a very lonely place to be.  Many people are afraid of this part of our history—apologists hate it because it is part of our American original sin.  Many people of color shy away because it brings up inarticulate anger, shame, disbelief and conflicted feelings.  Others disassociate, don’t know what to ask, don’t know what to say.  I was extremely insulted when an Internet troll said they felt sad for me because I was so fixed on the pain and anguish of slavery.  The reality is I know that the plantation was the proving ground for the culture I am heir to.</p>
<div id="attachment_1778" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://afroculinaria.com/2012/12/18/why-antebellumchef/img_3035/" rel="attachment wp-att-1778"><img class="size-large wp-image-1778" alt="Cowpeas in Louisiana " src="http://afroculinaria.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img_3035.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" width="1024" height="682" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cowpeas in Louisiana</p></div>
<p>I am the most attached to these Ancestors—from Africa to America to the Civil War because they are most easily forgotten.  I dream of them, and the mere thought of them brings me to tears. I often feel as though we have not loved them enough.  As moderns we have tended to pity them, while I put my pride in them.  I want to teach their songs, their folk beliefs, their medicines, their foods, their aesthetics, their cosmology, their infinite wisdom and @antebellumchef is my way of ensuring that as many 21<sup>st</sup> century people as possible will know that heritage and pass it on.  It is my great fear that those who want to forget, those who want to ignore and those who don’t know how to ask or don’t care to will condemn these Ancestors to the ultimate death—national amnesia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear America,</p>
<p>It feels strange to hear your voice praising teachers for their selflessness, dedication, and love for their students. We’re listening to what you’re saying, but we must admit that we are listening with tilted head and quizzical eye. Why? Because we’ve become accustomed to hearing a very different voice from you.</p>
<p>For the past few years, you’ve been certain that most of society’s problems stem from our schools, more specifically the teachers in those schools. <i>We are lazy and useless, we are only in it for the money, we only teach for the vacation time, we don’t possess the intelligence to teach anyone much of anything, our demands for a respectable wage are selfish, we don’t teach students respect, we are leaches sucking the blood from State coffers, we don’t even work a full day like everyone else, </i>and the most hurtful one of all -<i> we don’t care about our students. </i>Concerned citizens have even documented these ills in grossly successful movies that take the worst of us and use it to convince the public that teachers are deserving of nothing but disdain.</p>
<p>Yet, in one weekend, with one horrific tragedy, your voice has changed. The general indictment that has been assigned to us has seemingly been lifted. All of the sudden, America is looking to us with respect, admiration, trust, and something that looks a bit like… awe. It’s puzzling, really. We are the same people we were last Friday morning, doing the same job we’ve diligently done since choosing our career.</p>
<p>Of course, we do realize what has happened. Something horrific occurred last Friday, and as a result, America saw the uncensored soul that resides in the vast majority of teachers. There were no special interest groups telling you what teachers are really like, no businessmen or women proffering data-driven solutions that will fix every instructional problem, no politicians pontificating about the grading of teachers based on the value they add to students. No, what you saw was the real thing, teachers who love America’s children so much that they dedicate their <i>all</i> to their welfare.</p>
<p>No, for most of us, our <em>all</em> does not include a sacrificial death, but it does include a sacrificial life. It means working a full day at school then continuing that work at home well into the evening as we grade papers and prepare materials that will lead to authentic learning in the classroom. That’s our surface work. At a deeper level, however, we also do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>notice our students’ hurts as well as joys so we can be sure to validate them with our comments and actions</li>
<li>communicate with our students in a manner that conveys regard for them, even if regard isn’t shared for us</li>
<li>advocate for services that will improve the likelihood of students’ success</li>
<li>volunteer for extra-curricular activities so children will know we care about their whole life, not just what they do in the classroom</li>
<li>coordinate numerous fund-raisers in order to attain the resources needed to teach students</li>
<li>spend our own money where fundraisers fall short</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, our souls are just about as self-sacrificial as souls come, and it is this part of us that you witnessed last Friday in Rachel Davino, Dawn Hochsprung, Anne Marie Murphy, Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, and Victoria Soto. Yes, they paid the ultimate price, but we want you to understand that what they did on Friday was a natural outpouring of what they were already practicing: a dedication of their <i>lives</i> to your children. It is generally true that if one is going to die for another, he or she is first willing to live for that person. These women did just that.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that days will grow between last Friday and the present, and thoughts will turn to memory. However, we pray that you will not forget this glimpse into the souls of teachers this tragedy afforded us. Please do not return to lumping us together into a rejection bin after seeing a few examples of teachers who do not belong in our ranks. Realize that you will find no greater advocate for America’s students than in us. Appreciate our efforts, and in so doing, create an atmosphere of respect for what we do. In short, simply treat us with the dignity that you’re displaying today. We might find that many answers lie in that action alone.</p>

<p>Time is such a strange entity. It doesn&#8217;t take Einstein and his Theory of Relativity to explain how time is relative, although even he&#8217;s reputed to compare how time with a &#8220;pretty girl&#8221; passes much faster than the same amount of time sitting on a hot stove.</p>
<p>We speak of having a good time, or experiencing bad times. We measure ourselves by the amount of time we&#8217;ve been converting oxygen to carbon dioxide. To us, time is pretty significant.</p>
<p>It may not be important, though.</p>
<p>I always figured that time was one of those things that God made for our convenience like mass or gravity. Without mass we&#8217;d just pass other matter; without gravity, we&#8217;d just float. Absence of mass or gravity would make life far more complicated – the same with the absence of time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we tend to think of being non-physical and untethered by gravity as things we&#8217;ll find in Heaven. We&#8217;ll float around as happy-go-lucky spirits until the end of time when we and our bodies will be reunited. Then, we&#8217;ll have the best of both worlds – enjoying our corporeal existence but able to simultaneously move about freely as spirits do.</p>
<p>Time, on the other hand, is a little trickier. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before eternity as in always having a tomorrow is a kind of comforting thought. On the other hand, eternity as in infinity going backward is significantly disconcerting. An unlimited number of tomorrows is inspiring. An unlimited number of yesterdays is confusing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the many reasons that He is God and we are not.</p>
<p>God referred to Himself as &#8220;I am.&#8221; Not &#8220;I was and I will be.&#8221; Just simply, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I figure that God is unfettered by time. I&#8217;ve never seen a drawing of God wearing a wristwatch, so I guess we all sort of imagine the same thing. He is – in all places at all times all at once all the time.</p>
<p>When I am having a good time, I try to tell Him, &#8220;Thanks.&#8221; When I&#8217;m having a bad time, I take comfort in the fact that while time may have a hold on me, it&#8217;s meaningless to Him.</p>
<p>It helps keep things in perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After much procrastination, I am finally posting the results of my research into how the frequent use of computer programming languages affect the brain.</p>
<p>As followers of the blog will remember, after reading theories about how learning languages affect the brain, I wanted to know whether computer programming languages also affected the brain. With a few notable exceptions (e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0732118X9390035C">Murnane, 1993</a>) most research about the cognitive effects of computer programming seemed to have focused on programming as a problem solving rather than a linguistic activity. If computer languages were indeed languages, I thought that it would make sense for them to affect the brain in a similar way to other languages.</p>
<p>This is quite a big subject, so I honed in on bilingualism. If computer programming languages are languages, then people who spoke one language and could programme to a high standard should be bilingual. Research has suggested that bilingual people perform faster than monolingual people at tasks requiring executive control &#8211; that is, tasks involving the ability to pay attention to important information and ignore irrelevant information (for a review of the &#8220;robust&#8221; evidence for this, see <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-011-0116-7?LI=true">Hilchey &amp; Klein, 2011</a>). So, I set out to find out whether computer programmers were better at these tasks too. It is thought that the bilingual advantage is the result of the effort involved in keeping two languages separate in the brain and deciding which one to use. I noticed that novice computer programmers have difficulty in controlling &#8220;transfer&#8221; from English to programming languages (e.g. expecting the command &#8220;while&#8221; to imply continuous checking; see Soloway and Spohrer, 1989), so it seemed plausible that something similar might occur through the learning of programming languages.</p>
<p>Obviously, lots of bilingual people learn two languages from birth, and &#8211; young as some of them might be &#8211; this is clearly not the case for computer programmers. However, the effect has also been found in bilingual people who gained a second language in adolescence (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3114252/">Tao <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). Therefore, I compared 10 adolescent programmers (aged 14-17) and 10 professional programmers who had been programming since adolescence (aged 21-25) to age matched controls. All participants were monolingual English speakers.</p>
<p>I used two computer-based tests &#8211; Stroop and attention networks task &#8211; which required participants to pay attention to one thing and ignore others. Unfortunately, I made an error in setting up the Stroop test, so I can&#8217;t be sure that data is reliable. However, data from the attention networks task showed that computer programmers performed this task faster than controls and the difference between the two groups was significant (note that &#8220;significant&#8221; means that we are more than 95% sure that the results didn&#8217;t happen by chance &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t mean there was a <em>big</em> difference in reaction times). Error rates did not differ significantly.</p>
<p>This was only a very small study and I&#8217;d be reluctant to make any grand claims based on it; the results would need to be replicated by other studies. Even if other studies did support these findings, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that computer programming experience causes better executive control; it might be that people with better executive control are more likely to persist with computer programming. If the latter is true, one way to help people learn computer programming might be to teach them a foreign language first. I did notice that a lot of programmers seemed to be bilingual &#8211; I think it would be interesting to do a survey to see if that is supported by hard facts.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re interested in picking apart the detail, you can <a href="http://thecodingbrain.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/evidence-suggesting-that-young-computer-programmers-have-bilingual-brains/dissertationfinal/" rel="attachment wp-att-118">download the full report here</a>. If you do manage to struggle through, let me know what you think &#8211; random theories welcome! I&#8217;d love it if it gave people ideas for bigger studies. Huge thanks to everyone who took part and to all those who helped, especially the team at <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired State</a>. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without you all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the lyrics&#8230;</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s that time of year when the world falls in love. Every song you hear seems to say&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em>Eat pies. And cake. Now try this ham with maple glaze. Wash it down with some fudge. </em></p>
<p>This time of year is TERRIBLE for healthy eating. Cookies, pies, meat-heavy dishes, hot chocolate, copious amounts of red wine, and cheese plates are everywhere. Making good choices is difficult and overindulgence becomes a habit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve overindulged one too many times already (and we&#8217;re only half way through December!). The thought of another Snickerdoodle gives me hot and cold sweats and the sight of eggnog sends a wave of nausea through my entire body.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s times like these that I make a trip to a place I love but usually avoid&#8211;<a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/whole-foods-market" target="_blank">Whole Foods</a>. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with Whole Foods. I just try to shop at local farm stands and farmers markets instead of chain stores. But this time of year, my favorite places are shut down for the winter months.</p>
<p>Walking through the front doors of Whole Foods, I am overjoyed to see the amount of fresh, local, and organic produce they offer; I swear I can hear angels singing (or is that Taylor Swift?).  Kale, beets, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, carrots&#8211;I grab them all.</p>
<p>I am a little dumbfounded, almost starstruck, when I visit the beans and grains section. So many choices! Such pretty colors! I bag up some lentils in hopes of making a healthy soup to get me through the week.</p>
<p>The resulting soup was so rich and flavorful that I never missed the lack of meat or Snickerdoodles. Although I will admit one thing&#8211;this soup goes great with a bold red wine.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ve-Overindulged-One-Too-Many-Times Red Lentil Stew</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>1 teaspoon garlic chili sauce (you can find it in most grocery stores)</p>
<p>1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p>4 carrots, peeled and diced</p>
<p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</p>
<p>2 teaspoons ground coriander</p>
<p>1 teaspoon tumeric</p>
<p>1 teaspoon cumin</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
<p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
<p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>2 cups red lentils, picked through and rinsed</p>
<p>8 cups stock (any kind, I used turkey stock)</p>
<p>Juice of one lemon</p>
<div id="attachment_2337" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 501px"><a href="http://rachels-table.com/?attachment_id=2337" rel="attachment wp-att-2337"><img class=" wp-image-2337  " alt="Yummy red lentils cook up faster than other lentils" src="http://rachelstabledotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc00418.jpg?w=491&#038;h=369" width="491" height="369" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yummy red lentils cook up faster than other lentils</p></div>
<p>Heat oil in dutch oven or soup pot over medium high heat. Add the chili garlic sauce, stirring constantly for a few seconds. Add onion, carrots and garlic. Cook until soft, about 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the spices, salt, pepper, and tomatoes. Stir. Add the broth and lentils. Bring to a boil. Turn heat to medium low and simmer for 30 minutes or until lentils are tender.</p>
<p>Add the lemon juice and give it a good stir. Top with chopped parsley or cilantro.</p>
<div id="attachment_2336" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 501px"><a href="http://rachels-table.com/?attachment_id=2336" rel="attachment wp-att-2336"><img class=" wp-image-2336  " alt="You must make this. " src="http://rachelstabledotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc00424.jpg?w=491&#038;h=369" width="491" height="369" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You must make this.</p></div>
<p>This soup is my new favorite, because it came together so easily, but tasted complex. It thickens quite a bit and could easily pass for a side dish with fish or chicken.</p>
<h3>So what about you? What do you crave after an overindulgent weekend? Or better yet, what are your FAVORITE overindulgences this time of year?</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2294" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 529px"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/48-frames-per-second/10150222861171558"><img class="size-full wp-image-2294" alt="Hobbit director Peter Jackson's Facebook post about using 48 frames-per-second" src="http://nikoscream.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/thehobbit-48fps-peterjacksonfacebook.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hobbit director Peter Jackson&#8217;s Facebook post about using 48 frames-per-second</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em> is out! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has its issues, which are more severe for some than for others. For my full opinion about the film, check out <a href="http://cinegeek.com" target="_blank">CineGeek</a> where I will discuss it on our weekly webcast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This post&#8217;s purpose though is to discuss what has gotten filmmakers and filmgoers in such a tizzy &#8211; <strong>the high frame rate of the film&#8217;s video</strong>. High Frame Rate (HFR) versions of the film portray how it was originally filmed &#8211; at 48 frames per second instead of the traditional 24fps. This is the first major motion picture to be produced at the higher 48fps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for doubling the frame rate is that the higher frame rate leads to increased image clarity and depth. The perceived drawback is that the enhanced realism takes away the &#8220;cinematic look&#8221; of film, that the increased clarity removes a certain haze that lets the audience suspend disbelief in the fantasy of film.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So which side is right when it comes to this film? Both, actually.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The HFR really delivers on its stunning and crisp image quality, which is something director Peter Jackson already knows with the preceding <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. The scenery is beautiful, as the New Zealand landscapes Jackson loves to show off look even better with the added clarity and depth. Action scenes, of which there are plenty, come through with amazing detail and little-to-no motion blur. And the rain, as my good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/rokuthirteen" target="_blank">Jon Wright</a> remarked to me, actually looks like real rain as you can see the droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The CGI in the film is particularly well-done, with Gollum being the standout example of blending the computer-generated elements with the real ones when Gollum and Martin Freeman&#8217;s Bilbo have their battle of riddles. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the HFR that helps meld the elements, or if it&#8217;s simply just the decade of advancements since the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy hit the big screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In short, this film is pretty to look at.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, the HFR detractors do have their point about the cinematic look and lack of immersion. The added clarity and sharpness leaves the non-action scenes, notably in the early parts at Bilbo&#8217;s home of Bag End, somewhat jarring, as if they&#8217;re too quick and life-like. <strong>It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re watching a play instead of a film, from as close as on the stage itself.</strong> The added clarity also points out the fakeness in set design. When the film is on a set as opposed to on location, it shows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this initial difficulty with suspension of disbelief, watching the film&#8217;s higher frame rate reminded me of my first time watching high definition television, or even to a lesser extent Blu Ray. When video technology jumps in clarity, bringing us more life-like visuals, it seems we lose a bit of our suspension of disbelief with that sudden blast of reality.<strong> It takes some adjustment to get that fantasy haze back in our minds, but it happens because we still know it&#8217;s not real. Only each time when it happens, we have even better visuals than before to go with it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I don&#8217;t know if HFR is the future of film right now. Perhaps we movie goers will soon adjust to the vividness of the image quality, or perhaps we will be too attached to the &#8220;cinematic look&#8221; of the standard 24fps that we give up the enhanced clarity. <strong>At this point, I can&#8217;t call Peter Jackson&#8217;s experiment with this film a success just yet, but I won&#8217;t write off HFR for what may just be growing pains.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If film production follows Jackson into 48fps and beyond, it will lead to set/prop designers, make-up artists, and costumers reworking how they do things, just as those in television had to for high definition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However way the frame rate war goes, I&#8217;m still looking forward next year&#8217;s <em>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</em> &#8211; both to see how HFR affects filmmaking within the year, and because it&#8217;s more Hobbit!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Have YOU seen <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em>? Did you see the HFR version? What did you think of the higher frame rate or of the movie in general?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cartoon is not a frivolous thing. It can look like a silly drawing or a caricature of life. Upon first glance, it seems to only exist on either a screen or a piece of paper. Sometimes, it even says witty things or does something stupid or endearing that can make us laugh.</p>
<p>Cartoons have been around for so long&#8211;on television, in movies, in the newspaper funny-pages and even on T-shirts&#8211;that we take them for granted. We don&#8217;t always take them seriously.</p>
<p>But consider. A cartoon is an archetype. It is an idea given form. In fact, it wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a stretch to even state that it is a Platonic Form: living glyphs essentialized to the point of becoming as close to pure concepts as is humanly possible &#8230; which of course is a misnomer.</p>
<p>Because cartoons aren&#8217;t human at all.</p>
<p>Some of them are wise-talking humanoid animals. Others are parodies of human beings that somehow possess their own sense of agency. There are even some that are inanimate objects given life. Often, the really old cartoons exist in very self-contained two-dimensional pocket-dimensions: in a mythological cycle of trickery, mayhem, and fun-loving nose-thumbing at fate.</p>
<p>And the really old cartoons can&#8217;t be destroyed. They can&#8217;t be smashed by falling anvils or mallets. They can&#8217;t be burned by fire or exploded by dynamite: at least, not for very long. They are used to dealing&#8211;and receiving&#8211;massive amounts of physical damage, and then coming back for more. And we&#8217;re not even talking about the ones that have a supernatural way of avoiding the damages of their enemies altogether just to&#8211;through some twisted fluke of fate&#8211;make them fall into their own traps.</p>
<p>They are like living rubber or silly-putty that just keeps bouncing back. A human being isn&#8217;t like that. When human beings fall, they break.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not too much of a stretch to say that cartoons are beings that are psychopaths or sociopaths by human standards: in worlds and cyclic realities where neither human physical and psychological standards even apply. They come from the same heightened mythic state as faeries, and gods; as legends and archetypes: in a place where slap-stick is not only futility and invincibility, but where the ridiculousness is the superhuman and the sublime. Some people might call this state a perpetual hell, or a utopia. But mostly, it just <em>is </em>and they just<em> are</em>.</p>
<p>In the end, you can&#8217;t destroy a cartoon because you can&#8217;t destroy an idea. Because even if you break the projector, or the television, or snap the DVD, or rip up the papers they are still there&#8211;pure ideas&#8211;in your head, mocking you, holding an oversized mallet in one hand as they stand in the darkest corner of your mind, knowing more than they do, doing more than they know, just waiting for that punchline: where you finally have to laugh at yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, in the first winter of our relationship, I knit my lover a pair of mittens.</p>
<p>They were perfect.</p>
<p>I bought the wool, hand-spun, from a vendor at our Farmer’s Market on Broadway in New York City. It was a blustery October day, and I bought more of that grey yarn than I needed. And so began the meticulous process of crafting something for the one you love: Edging the gloves with a simple ribbing, two by two. Making them fingerless, with a top that flipped down. Fastening on antique leather buttons. Inside one of the flaps, I sewed a tag, upon which was neatly printed, “Handmade by Alison J. Killeen.”</p>
<p>He loved them, and even better, he <i>used</i> them. Over the years, predictably, they began to wear. The neat little slit in the thumbs, meant for texting and for pulling out his metro card, was the first to go. And so I unraveled the tops of the thumbs and re-knit them, reinforcing them with a stronger thread. But it was an impermanent solution. The palms wore thin, first from grasping at railings on the train, and later, the steering wheel of the car. Moths munched on their edges while they sat idle in summer. Last winter, they found their final days as the thumb slits tore again and unraveled before I took care to mend them, my lover’s triangle-tipped thumbs exposed to the cold.</p>
<p>This fall, five years later, using what was left of the hardy grey wool, I knit him a second pair of mittens, almost identical to the first. Perhaps it was sentimental, but before we discarded them, we held a little ritual for the first pair in our kitchen. I held the mittens in my hands, and my lover held my hands in his. Together, we spoke of the warmth they had provided to the wearer, of what objects they had held between their palms, of all the coffee spills they had endured. As we examined the wear and tear the years had brought to these woolen miracles, they began to whisper of all that has lapsed since we first found one another.</p>
<p>It seems to me that time passes so illegibly. Despite our best attempts to keep things just as they are, in the end, we are helpless to the powers of the universe: to gravity, to change, to chaos, to love.</p>
<p>Most years in November I settle in for the long winter, reveling in my double-pointed needles and indigo-blue dusks. I cut the nights with candlelight, quell the snow with stardust, calm the cold with steaming hot tea.</p>
<p>But this year has been different. This year not only have the nights been long, but my heart is long as well, stretched low as an anchor grazing the bottom of the sea. For whatever reason, though no one close to me has been in danger, I am feeling the losses around me more keenly. A friend’s husband dies, then another, and another. Yet another friend’s mother is slowly losing her battle with cancer. A loved one struggles with addiction. Relationships around me disintegrate and break. And the dark blue night thickens, exposing a bruised and ashen world.</p>
<div id="attachment_1102" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/12/15/nyregion/15shooting2.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1102" alt="15shooting" src="http://postsem.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/15shooting.jpg?w=590&#038;h=359" width="590" height="359" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">via New York Times</p></div>
<p>Then last Friday, in Newtown, Connecticut, a gunman overtook sweet Sandy Hook Elementary School, and like the rest of the country I am blindsided. I am struck dumb by the absence of mercy, by the presence of carnage, by the hot iron of an expired rifle, the tiny bodies riddled with bullets, the silence and the sobs, the blood, the innocence, the flesh, the grief.</p>
<p>Time trods on. The night expands. A star moves across the deep. Our hearts break, our worlds implode, and we are left to ask: what will come of this?</p>
<p>Part of the pain of tragedy is the need we humans have to seek out the meaning in suffering. As one who finds little existential comfort in “eternal life”, I look for a way to make meaning of what is happening in the here and the now. Even a father who believes his child will live on in paradise might not be comforted by his belief. The child is still gone, and he is still left to sift through what to make of a world in which 20-year-old men kill six-year-old girls, and nineteen other children, besides.</p>
<p>In the face of such tragedy, even hope at times is too much to ask. It is too much to petition grief to turn about so sharply, to reverse the path of mourning, to wait for hope, to hope for life.</p>
<p>No, I want mending of a more earthly kind. As a knitter darns a tear, as a physician sutures a wound, so must we go about the process of grief. Slowly and methodically we go, taking care to don the thimble and pin the fabric. Perhaps we set down our work for a time and come back another day. Perhaps we rip it out and start again. We work, knowing our piece will never be as whole as it was when it was new. We work, knowing that it will be prone to tearing again, even in the same spot in which we mend. But the thread and needle must keep working, ever tenderly, slowly onwards, if our hearts are ever to beat again.</p>
<p>The deepest, bluest night of the year is but days away. With the winter solstice will come the shifting of our planet’s tilt, a change so incremental we will hardly notice it, but it will be massive in its power. Such a tiny step lengthens the day by mere minutes, but it has the power to alter the seasons, to melt ice and ignite fire, turn branch to leaf, seed to sprout. Yes, we will hardly notice it. But its shift will lay the groundwork for our whole world to change.</p>
<p>I don’t know how the parents and children of Newtown will fare in the coming days and years, and what awaits our country in the coming months is yet to be seen. What I do know is that our first task must be to tend to our grief, for by threading the needle, by tilting a twirling planet, we act out our trust that hope will return to us one day. Perhaps hope is found just in putting down that very first stitch.</p>
