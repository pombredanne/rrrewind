				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tackling a DIY home remodeling project is both rewarding and cost-effective. Unless of course, you need marriage counseling or an artificial limb upon completion. </strong>But hey, if I can do it, so can you.</p>
<p><strong>Let me give you some back story. The year I graduated college my husband and I purchased a historic Federal-style, two-story, two bath, three bedroom home that was built in 1880.</strong> The home came with several amenities such as: at least four mice, a part-time alley boarder who was fond of glue sniffing, a raccoon family, the occasional squirrel, and insects that I would come to know as camel crickets. What you should know about camel crickets is that they don&#8217;t see well in light. So, when you enter a room and turn on the lights, they jump <em>at</em> you. Once airborne, I am certain they can reach heights of at least five feet. More importantly, if you can catch them, they ooze and crunch when squished.</p>
<p><strong>Over the course of ten years we made several adjustments to that home. </strong>We put in a new kitchen and a new master bath, among other things. We were young and didn&#8217;t have much dough or possibly much sense. (I should mention we did those projects simultaneously, with the indispensable help of our family.)</p>
<p><strong>What I learned from my DIMWH (doing it myself with help) historic home experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are nine months pregnant and are awakened at midnight by the warm glow of a dumpster fire next door, it&#8217;s time to move.</li>
<li>If your after-dinner entertainment includes chasing prostitutes off your corner, it&#8217;s time to move.</li>
<li>If a &#8220;little person&#8221; off his meds is found burrowed under your neighbor&#8217;s porch, it is time to move.</li>
<li>You will never meet a nicer, more fun bunch of folks with a proper sense of community, and humor, than those willing to live under those circumstances.</li>
<li>I have an immense appreciation for the architecture and craftsmanship of days gone by.</li>
<li>I can neither confirm, nor deny, that I have had first-hand experiences with an apparition or two.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://miamivalleymama.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/miamivalleymama_diy.jpg"><img title="miamivalleymama_DIY" src="http://miamivalleymama.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/miamivalleymama_diy.jpg?w=580&#038;h=581" alt="" width="580" height="581" /></a></strong></strong>Obviously, we moved. We have lived in our current home for almost seven years. Two weeks ago we began remodeling our master bath.</strong> But, only because we intend to sell our house. We have happily endured the original Formica counter top, peeling linoleum floor and sliding shower door that never fails to fall off the track upon entering and exiting the shower. We know others will not appreciate those original details of our home.</p>
<p><strong>During this particular episode of DIY, I have come to realize that remodeling antagonizes my emotional roller coaster. These are the <strong>seven stages of remodeling grief as I have experienced them. </strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Shock &amp; Disbelief </strong></em>- Living with sub-standard decor and/or facilities. This includes but is not limited to lighting fixtures from the 1980s, abhorrent paint colors chosen by color-blind previous owners, and indoor/outdoor carpeting, indoors. This is the pre-modeling stage. This is the &#8220;before&#8221; picture.</li>
<li><em><strong>Denial</strong></em> &#8211; Not just a river in Egypt. (Apologies, I had to). You are not the least bit fazed by the hole in the wall you joyfully sledgehammered, or the gaping hole in your wallet. You are brave, steadfast.</li>
<li><em><strong>Anger </strong></em>- You encounter a smashed finger or thumb, step on a nail, or continually argue with your spouse. Even worse, you may be forced to listen to Hüsker Dü all day. This is the point of no return, though. You&#8217;ve started, you must finish. But, do yourself a favor. Cease all HGTV viewing now. It creates unrealistic, time-lapsed expectations.</li>
<li><em><strong>Bargaining </strong></em>- You  feel as if you will never escape the dreadful mess you&#8217;ve created. You may stare at the destruction with confusion, with regret. You may play the lottery in hopes of hiring a hunky contractor with loose morals. It&#8217;s okay to shred your Home Depot and Lowe&#8217;s credit cards at this time.</li>
<li><em><strong>Guilt </strong></em>- At this stage you wish you had chosen granite over synthetic solid surface, blue paint instead of beige. Don&#8217;t beat yourself up, though. Chances are the next person that lives in your house won&#8217;t like it either.</li>
<li><em><strong>Depression</strong></em> &#8211; You cling to memories of the old room. You laugh reminiscently at the fact that you could see the cellar simply by peering down through the gaps in the dining room floor. You play &#8220;Our House&#8221; (either by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, or Madness) on a loop and sob openly in your room with the lights off.</li>
<li><em><strong>Acceptance &amp; Hope</strong></em> &#8211; This is the point at which you have begun to put some of the pieces back together. You see a glimmer of hope of having a functioning toilet, running water, a stove, etc. Your spirits should begin to lift. Order a replacement &#8220;big box construction store&#8221; credit card now. Begin planning your next DIY. You may resume your regular viewing of HGTV again now and keep the dream alive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy remodeling!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s my weekly confession. I didn&#8217;t watch the debate. Clearly because I am typing as the two candidates duke it out on the international stage. I know what you&#8217;re thinking. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to know where the parties stand on the issues?&#8221; I know where they stand. On opposite sides of a strip of duct tape that goes smack down the middle of the living room.</p>
<p>Democrats? Republicans? They&#8217;re just two parents in the middle of a nasty divorce, and you have to decide who you&#8217;re going to live with for the next four years. They&#8217;re so busy hating each other and trying to take the biggest piece of pie that they have forgotten that they love you at all. And you&#8217;re not sure you like them, either.</p>
<p>They scream at each other at the dinner table every night for spending too much money and hide their own receipts under the bed. Each blames the other for the drop in their property value, missing the truth, that the entire neighborhood hates them both because they scream at each other in the middle of the street and embarrass everyone. They play nice when it&#8217;s time for vacation then forget they ever agreed on anything the moment the minivan pulls back in the driveway. And they never take you anywhere fun.</p>
<p>And you secretly wish upon every star, wishbone, and eyelash that you don&#8217;t actually have to live with either of them. That maybe there&#8217;s an auntie you never heard of who will swoop in and offer you sanctuary. Or a fun uncle that will set firm but loving limits because they really do have your best interests at heart. Someone who will tuck you in at night and wish you sweet dreams. And you do dream, and sometimes those dreams even come true.</p>
<p>And all the while, your parents are calling you every night and begging you to please, please do the reasonable and grown up thing and choose them. That your life won&#8217;t be worth living if you don&#8217;t pick them. And you know then there&#8217;s no cool relative to save you, so you pick the one that seems least likely to drop their pants at the grocery store at the moment and hope they don&#8217;t quit taking their meds.</p>
<p>Nah. There&#8217;s no need to watch the debate. You&#8217;ll see them around the table at Thanksgiving. I&#8217;ll bring the mashed potatoes. You bring a new roll of duct tape. This mess is going to go on awhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Thanksgiving. The perfect time to reflect and say thank-you for all of the things you have been blessed with in your life. A time to hug your loved ones and let them know how much they mean to you. It&#8217;s a time to step out of yourself and recognize what&#8217;s truly important.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve said your thanks this year, I challenge you to do something more. I challenge you to forgive.</p>
<p>Thankfulness is easy &#8230; forgiveness isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Think of that person that has wronged you or hurt you deeply. Have you forgiven them for their mistakes or are you letting that situation stop you from moving forward? Are there people that you do your best to avoid just so you don&#8217;t have to deal with past crap?  Are there places that you refuse to go to for fear of running into someone you don&#8217;t want to see?</p>
<p>Are these same people that you&#8217;re running from, people that you once loved with all your heart?  When you&#8217;re wronged by someone that you love, it seems to hurt twice as much. But for some reason, these special and important relationships are quite often never repaired.  These hurts run rampant in our own families and it is such a shame.</p>
<p>My question to you is this, is it really worth it? Why are you willing to let someone else control your happiness and experiences? Stop letting the past dictate your future and move forward. Are you really okay with never having a relationship with these people ever again and are you truly content with living a life full of avoidance? We tell other people to forgive and forget all the time but yet it&#8217;s so hard to do ourselves. I say that we start taking our own advice and choose better.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not equal weakness. Never, ever confuse the two. Forgiveness is about moving on and letting go. It doesn&#8217;t mean you have to forget or that you have to fall back into old patterns or acceptance of abuse. It means that you are giving yourself the freedom to breathe and move forward. It means that you are taking the power back for yourself and living your life to the fullest.</p>
<p>Be thankful for the people in your life, the good times, the bad times and the times yet to come. Be thankful for the joys you have experienced and the lessons that you have learned. Be thankful that you have the ability to forgive and move on. That is something to be truly thankful for.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 1998, Aaron Kreifels was riding his bike through a field in Wyoming. He wasn’t expecting that day to be different from any other beautiful sunny afternoon in the vast plains surrounding Laramie, but that day would change many lives.</p>
<p>Aaron spotted what he initially thought was a scarecrow next to a fence. Then he noticed a glisten of blood. The sun sparkled on what he barely recognized as a face. What Aaron had discovered was the 22 year-old Matthew Shepard, clinging to life.</p>
<p>Most of you know what happened next. Matthew held on for five more days and as his parents held his hand and prayed, Matthew slipped away quietly on October 12th, leaving in his wake a new movement for equality.</p>
<p>The outcries for justice and for greater protections were immediate and resonating.</p>
<p>Since then, Matthew’s mother Judy has made it her personal mission to protect all young LGBT people from Matthew’s horrific fate. In founding the <a href="http://www.matthewshepard.org/">Matthew Shepard Foundation</a>, she has created safe spaces in and outside of schools for kids, and worked with parents to ensure their children learn to erase hate from their lives.</p>
<p>But overwhelmingly what you saw in 1998 was a community ready to act, ready to change something. And Matthew’s story was the catalyst for that. Many of you have seen or read the Moises Kaufman play, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Laramie-Project-Christina-Ricci/dp/B000067D0Y">The Laramie Project</a> – Matthew’s story as told through interviews of those who were living in Laramie at the time – some of his friends and some who just happened to be riding a bike through the plains of Wyoming that day. If you think of nothing else today, please consider the importance of telling your story – how your story can change the world around you.</p>
<p>This young boy, unbeknownst to him, has changed the world with his.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By popular request&#8230; that&#8217;s not true. Although actually it is the most requested thing on this site. But also the only requested thing on this site. In all honesty I&#8217;m writing this for the unfortunately named, <a title="Coop Poop" href="http://cooppoop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Coop Poop</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305" title="18. Easy" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-19.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>The hardest thing may be finding the pallets. Every time I see a shop or restaurant being overhauled with a skip outside (US: Dumpster!) then I pull over and ask if they wouldn&#8217;t mind if I had a look. Often they&#8217;ll be full of pallets and old bits of timber and so far the owners are more than happy for me to empty their skip for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/making-benches-out-of-old-wooden-pallets-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-272" title="Pallets found in a dumpster outside Lowes" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/making-benches-out-of-old-wooden-pallets-1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we have pallets. Second hardest (most tedious) thing is deconstructing them. Get your claw hammer, a mallet may help and something for a lever &#8211; crowbar, chisel, flat-headed screwdriver. Start hitting, prying and pulling. Drink plenty of Gin and Tonic to stay motivated.</p>
<p>So, from all the scrap wood your aim is to have this (pallets unfortunately do not come in pretty colours &#8211; but I&#8217;ll leave the painting to you):</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-291" title="4. Make sure you have all the right bits." src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-05.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Two horizontal beams, preferably 2&#8243;x4&#8243; or there abouts &#8211; these are 76&#8243; in length but this can be varied based on what wood you have.</li>
<li>Four legs, preferably 4&#8243;x4&#8243; because they need to be sturdy to prevent wobble &#8211; these are 16&#8243; in length but this can vary depending on how high you want your bench.</li>
<li>Two inside rims, preferably 2&#8243;x1&#8243; &#8211; these need to be cut 8&#8243; less that the horizontal beams, mine are 68&#8243;.</li>
<li>Two end plates, any planks from the pallets &#8211; these need to be the width of your slats plus the width of your two beams (mine are 15&#8243; + 2&#8243; + 2&#8243; = 19&#8243;)</li>
<li>Slats, any planks from the pallets but enough to fill the length of your horizontal beams &#8211; you can just lay them out until you have enough &#8211; mine are cut at 15&#8243;.</li>
<li>I stained the wood with store bought wood preserver intended for outside use (this and some wood screws were my only costs).</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color:#339966;">Construction</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color:#339966;">1. Mount the Inside Rims</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">T</span>he inside rims need to be screwed to the horizontal beams. They sit a slat depth down and a leg width in. Easy get this right with the leg and the slat:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-292" title="5. Mount the inside rail" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-06.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth checking the inside rail remains level as you screw along the length. Just slide the slat along to check. The inside rail will support the slats.</p>
<p>Should look like this when finished:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-293" title="6. Inside rail mounted and level" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-07.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="color:#339966;">2. Cut and Mount the Legs.</span></h3>
<p>This is the one vaguely complicated bit, but it&#8217;s worth doing right to get a secure leg. It may require some additional Gin and Tonic.</p>
<p>Measure from the base of the horizontal beam to the top of the inside rail:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-294" title="7. Measure base of beam to top of inside bar." src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-08.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Measure the width of the horizontal beam:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-295" title="8. Measure beam width." src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-09.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Transfer this information onto the top of end of one of the legs. You can use the saw edge to get a definite right angle:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-296" title="9. Draw up those measurements on the legs" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-10.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-297" title="10. Mark up for cutting" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-11.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Cut along the lines so your leg looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-298" title="11. Leg with chunk cut out" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-12.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Match leg to the horizontal beam. Make sure the leg is flush to the front and to the side and screw together. Preferably from the back to the front to hide the screws from view (depends on the length of your screws):<br />
<a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-299" title="12. Match leg to beam and screw together" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-13.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Repeat the process on all the legs and place the beams parallel to each other:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-300" title="13. Repeat process on all legs" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-14.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="color:#339966;">3. The End Plates.</span></h3>
<p>Ensure the horizontal beams are parallel and the correct distance apart using a couple of your slats:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301" title="14. Beams should be parallel and slat wideth" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-15.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pre-screwing the end plates unless you have a helper to hold them in place while you screw</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-302" title="15. Pre-screw end panel" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-16.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure legs are straight when you screw in the end slats:</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303" title="16. Attach end panel at both ends" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-17.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="color:#339966;">4. The Slats</span></h3>
<p>Your bench is now ready for slat fitting and fun colour rearranging (depending on the number of Gin and Tonics consumed).</p>
<p><a href="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304" title="17. Slide in the slats" src="http://blueandyellowmakes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/how-to-make-a-bench-18.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Alternatively I will make you one for $300 &#8211; have another Gin and Tonic and then place an order.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reading Steve Jobs’s biography.   Why does this yoga teacher want to read about an arrogant nasty person whose work centered on technology?  Really it was encountering the applications of iPhones and iPads in the disability world and the recommendation of a woman I met at the Colorado Center for the Blind.</p>
<p>A person could write about 15 different aspects of Jobs’s career, but I’m particularly drawn toward two of his work traits.  He knew how to focus, and he usually knew what to focus on.  “Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do,” he said.  “That’s true for companies, and it’s true for products.”   So he narrowed down the projects that Apple worked on and sought to perfect the products and services associated.   The other trait I admire in him is realizing what people need before they need it and creating it (and yes, it can obviously be argued that we don’t need iPhones).</p>
<p>The truth is that my current greatest career challenges are learning to focus and developing the confidence to press forward to create something I think many folks don’t know they need.   I have this problem of being distracted by some shiny existing job with a good salary when I am already on track in terms of creating my work.</p>
<p>Instead I need to hone in on my task, find others to work with, and follow Jobs’s example by going my own way, keeping my finger on the pulse of change, creating that which people do not yet know they need.</p>
<p>What did Jobs decide to turn away from as he moved toward his vision?  He turned away from developing some products, from working with other companies in sharing software, from employees who were not smart, creative, and tough.  Perhaps he decided not to focus on gentleness in his rush to produce.  He certainly didn’t waste time with people or things or designs he didn’t like.  What he did focus on was products he thought people would need, that would help them to be more creative, that would change the world.</p>
<p>What do I need to turn away from?  Fear, fancy mainstream jobs, the latest “lucrative career fields” posted on Yahoo.com.  I think that the need to belong and the fear of poverty are behind the process.  Like everyone, I want to feel needed, valued, productive, and like I can make a good living.  Such needs can supersede my creativity.  In addition, we are trained and conditioned from an early age to take our places in the system as it is rather than to question it and create new things.  Such conditioning has a strong hold on me and it slips in when I feel frustrated or isolated in what I’m doing.  Jobs’s cantankerous personality and his rebellions streak may have actually helped him stay on track, to be immune to the above mentioned needs and fears.  I do think his drive to create affected his behavior with others and was linked to his meanness.  Yet it seems his internal value system influenced his ability to inspire those who are creative, intelligent, and self-motivated.</p>
<p>And how do I stay focused?  I need to turn toward what excites and challenges me.  And toward tasks that align with my personal characteristics.  To calling attention to the failings in our health and mental healthcare system and proposing new models, to teaching yoga and writing.  I need to keep poking my nose out there.<a href="http://workitwell.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1452.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://workitwell.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1452.jpg?w=1014" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>I keep connecting with organizations and individuals involved in health care as a yoga teacher and writer.  My thought is to help individuals with health issues tune into their own inner wisdom, their own talents (re Jobs), their communities.  I take inspiration from the part of Jobs that was committed, took risks, connected with bright individuals in garages and corporations, dressed to suit himself, and kept his sights on the product.  Yes, many of his qualities were not as inspiring, but his focus and drive are.  And I do choose to take his advice to “think different.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lexicography, as I may have mentioned, is a very solitary job, and as such, it generally draws the type of person who is delighted to work in near isolation for years on end and in silence so deep it makes monks fidgety. The lexicographer requires only the corpora, the pinks, the project. The only triumphant score that accompanies their work is the mouth-breathing drone of the HVAC system punctuated occasionally by a borborygmus rumble from the water cooler. From this quiet, white egg of industriousness hatches a rara avis in pasteboard plumage: a dictionary.</p>
<p>This is a conveniently trumped-up mythology. True, there is an overwhelming amount of isolation and quiet on the second floor of our office. But look closely at the egg: it is riddled with hairline cracks, its sticky insides only held intact by the taut, thin membrane under the shell. It has been slowly, softly battered, beaten with a million question marks: your egg has been done in by answering editorial correspondence.</p>
<p>You sign up for a job in the Scriptorium, and you rejoice: no more dealing with people, praise Samuel Johnson! Then once you are lulled into a sense of security by the HVAC and given your own customized date-stamp, we spring it on you: people will write in with questions, and you, our expert, will spend a little time each day answering them. Upon hearing this, some new hires slump like deflating balloons; some widen their eyes in surprise until you can see nothing but animal-fear sclera; and some blink furiously, as if holding back tears and recriminations.</p>
<p>I was a fool and just nodded. I was doomed.</p>
<p>With correspondence, as in all other parts of dictionary life, we specialize: science queries are handled by our science editors, the pronunciation editor handles pron queries (and by &#8220;pron,&#8221; I really do just mean &#8220;pronunciation&#8221;),  and so on. But there is a whole class of correspondence that is not doled out by subject area yet still requires special handling, and very few editors have the training, skill, and experience to handle this type of correspondence. I speak, naturally, of the nutbars.</p>
<p>Every profession has its crazy fringe, but the crazy fringe of lexicography is a blazing corona that overwhelms its dull core of fusion. They shine bright and write often. And sometimes they even have questions about the English language that require response.</p>
<p>The first time I was asked to answer one of these emails, I was so taken aback that I actually got up from my cubicle and bothered my boss. &#8220;I just got the email you forwarded,&#8221; I murmured. He spun around in his chair and looked at me flatly. I continued, &#8220;Do&#8230;do you really want me to answer this?&#8221; It was a mess of rainbows, numerology, political conspiracies, and religion, all wound tightly around one question: why the alphabet is in the order it&#8217;s in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, answer the alphabet question.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to address the correspondent&#8217;s obvious issues with reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I did. I wrote a little lecture on the development of the Latin alphabet and sent it off. The reply was immediate. &#8220;I was 5 years old.  My family gave me the encyclopedia about Infinity to become immortal.  I call upon Infinity from the book.  I lost the books and seeking info or someone that help me locate information on infinity and call upon it again to become immortal.  Please call me at number below!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I rubbed my face and gave silent thanks that I don&#8217;t have a phone at my desk. While I was trying to set my brain to right with deep tissue massage, another email came in. It was from my boss, and all it said was, &#8220;That was handled very well, Kory.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know my doom when I see it.</p>
<p>My own nutbar flavor has turned out to be the angry conspiracy theorists, people who think that the word &#8220;left&#8221; comes from an Anglo-Saxon word with negative connotations and is therefore offensive to people who are left-handed, or who read the entry for &#8220;door&#8221; and feel that it is Communist. I am tasked with sending courteous replies:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Dear XXXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Thank you for your e-mail. We are sorry to hear you are offended by the travel ad on our page, but I can assure you that its appearance was truly coincidental. We do not keep track of your IP address, nor do we track your movements on the Internet and force our ad servers (and ad servers on other sites) to show you ads for international travel. We appreciate that you wish to stay without the boundaries of the continental United States for the rest of your &#8220;natural-born life,&#8221; as you say, but our ads should not be taken as part of a conspiracy to lure you away from our country. They are merely ads, nothing more.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Dear XXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Thanks for your e-mail. I must admit I am confused by your assertion that our definition of the noun &#8220;camp&#8221; is a lengthy denigration of Elvis Presley. His name does not appear in&#8211;or even near&#8211;the entry. If you&#8217;d be so kind as to give me the full title of the dictionary you are using, I would be grateful.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Dear XXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Thanks for your response. The title of your dictionary will appear on the front cover of the book, or along the spine. If you are not sure what words are part of the title and what words aren&#8217;t, it is safest to send me all the words on the front cover of the book or on the spine.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Dear XXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Thanks for your e-mail. The pronunciation we give at the word &#8220;croissant&#8221; is correct. Though the word is a borrowing from French, the English word &#8220;croissant&#8221; has its own meaning and pronunciation, as do all words borrowed into English from another language, and the anglicized pronunciation has been in use since the late 1800s. I am not sure where you got the idea that George W. Bush and the U.S. Congress ordered us to change the pronunciation of &#8220;croissant,&#8221; but it is false.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Dear XXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We do understand that you dislike the word &#8220;floor,&#8221; but we will not be removing it from our dictionaries as it has widespread, sustained use in current and historical English. I also regret to say that, even if the White House gets involved in the matter, we will still not be removing the word &#8220;floor&#8221; from our dictionaries.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Dear XXXX:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The dictionary search engine is a small computer program whose sole job is to analyze an input into a field (in this case, the word you are attempting to find an entry for) and search our database for an exact or near match to the inputted word. &#8220;Democratic&#8221; is given in the suggested entries list when you entered &#8220;democrasy&#8221; because it is orthographically similar to the word you entered. We can assure you that the dictionary search engine was not written by Bolsheviks, nor is it programmed only to return Socialist or &#8220;unAmerican&#8221; words, as you suggest.</p>
<p>My boss says I am unflappable&#8211;in fact, this adjective has appeared in every one of my annual reviews since I took up my citations and followed Webster. I have my own ways for maintaining the integrity of the mythic egg: I type out the responses that I dearly want to send and save them to a folder on my computer called &#8220;Nobody Knows The Trouble I Seen.&#8221; I craft marketing taglines out of some of the most offensive or ridiculous emails I receive (my favorite: &#8220;Merriam-Webster: ruining Steve Martin&#8217;s Christmas since 1843&#8243;). I also spend a lot of time silently mouthing &#8220;OMG&#8221; and &#8220;WTF&#8221; at my monitor.</p>
<p>If I am unflappable, it is because these emails are a reminder of my own idiocy: my memento morons, if you will. I am an expert on this hot mess of a language, a rara avis in my own right, but even I <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0010-reign.htm">make dumb mistakes</a>. And even further, I understand the impulse to rage against perceived authoritarianism and injustice. But it&#8217;s hard to picket the English language: it doesn&#8217;t have an office, it doesn&#8217;t have a phone number, and it will not respond to your petitions. Combine those factors, and it&#8217;s not that big a leap from &#8220;this word describes something I find horrible&#8221; to &#8220;the dictionary that enters this horrible word is horrible&#8221; to &#8220;this ivory-tower elitist is defending something horrible and NEEDS TO BE STOPPED.&#8221; Who doesn&#8217;t want to stick it to The Man, even if he&#8217;s made of straw?</p>
<p>We all tend towards our very own kind of crazy. Just a few days ago, my daughter was browsing the Internet and found a store that makes custom wedding-cake toppers. &#8220;Some of these are great,&#8221; she said, and I peered over her shoulder. One caught my eye: a horse in a tux standing side-by-side with a chimp in a wedding dress. &#8220;Oh, nice,&#8221; I harumphed. &#8220;Make the bride a chimp. Yes, just another fabulous portrayal of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>My daughter looked up at me with a face I recognized: the same &#8220;WTF?&#8221; face I make at my nutbar emails. &#8220;Mom,&#8221; she said carefully, &#8220;neither the bride nor groom is human. The artist is just having fun. She is not saying that men are horses or that women are monkeys. You just need to <em>calm. Down</em>. <em><strong>GEEZ</strong></em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lexicography is solitary, but humans are social creatures, and sometimes we need a good, hard &#8220;WTF is wrong with you&#8221; to bring us back to humanity. I blinked at my daughter and mentally tore up the angry letter I was composing. <em>Memento moron, Kory: remember you&#8217;re an ass, too.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I realized a bit ago that I have for too long taken the sky for granted.  When I started becoming more interested in shooting my world, I started to really take a look at what I saw.  What I saw, what I see often amazes me.  What a wonderful view the sky has to offer us.  From the clear blue day to the dark stormy nights, she dresses herself in breathtaking wardrobes.  Essentially, I started looking up and paying attention.  Try it sometime.</p>
