				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting up before dawn, and with hot cups of tea barely able to hold the fantastically cold morning at bay, we were treated to a ringside seat of the sunrise over the Siloli Desert. As the colours of the mountains sprang back to life and some of the sun&#8217;s warmth finally penetrated the four layers of clothing I was wearing, we clambered back into the car and headed towards the Reserva de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa and the border with Chile.</p>
<p>First stop in this bewildering landscape was the wind sculpted Arbol de Piedra, the Stone Tree, a huge lump of rock that over millennia has been carved by wind and sand into its current tree-like shape. That would be reason enough to stop and marvel at it, but it also stands in a vast desert plain surrounded by mountains streaked with colour making it one of the most surreal sights of our trip. Our early start was rewarded with having the whole desert to ourselves.</p>

<div id="attachment_1736" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4721.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1736" title="Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4721.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Arbol de Piedra, Reserva de Fauna Andina Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>
<p>Even with the sun rising in the sky, at this time of day and at this altitude the temperatures were freezing and it was impossible to stand still for long without the cold piercing through clothing and footwear. It truly is an inhospitable place, but one an estimated 50,000+ tourists travel through every year.</p>
<p>A short journey to the south of the Arbol de Piedra lies one of the wonders of the whole region, Laguna Colorada, whose striking red waters contrasted against the deep blue sky are an extraordinary sight to behold. Although it looks like the scene of a toxic spill, the red colour is the result of algae in the water &#8211; the main source of food for the flamingos that thrive in the region, including the rare James flamingo which breeds in Laguna Colorada.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little like &#8220;Ten Amazing Things to Do Before Breakfast&#8221;, but climbing in altitude to a whopping 5000m we drove on towards the hellish looking and smelling Sol de Manana geyser. As you approach these boiling pools of mud and steaming fumaroles the nauseating stench of sulphur is overwhelming, but even that can&#8217;t take away from the wonder of the volcanic activity that is all around.</p>
<p>The first thing you see when you arrive is a jet of highly pressurised steam shooting out of the brown earth and making a screaming noise not dissimilar to the sound of a steam train whistle. The jet is probably about 15 metres high and the steam is hot!</p>
<div id="attachment_1742" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4766.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1742" title="Steam jet at Sol de Manana geyser, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4766.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steam jet at Sol de Manana geyser, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>
<p>Walking around the site is a bit like doing a day-trip to Hell and you have to be careful, the cracked earth can give way and collapse into bubbling mud underneath &#8211; as the sign says it&#8217;s <em>Peligro</em>. And did I mention the smell? Awful.</p>

<p>Leaving the fire and brimstone behind we set off for the furthest reaches of Bolivia to where the Laguna Verde and Volcan Licancabur nestle on the border with Chile. The drive passes a stretch of barren landscape that suddenly takes on the look of a sculpture park combined with a Japanese garden. Known as the Rocas de Dali, it is a peculiar sight.</p>
<div id="attachment_1748" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4796.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1748" title="Rocas de dali, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia" alt="" src="http://notesfromcamelidcountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_4796.jpg?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rocas de dali, Reserva Eduardo Avaroa, Bolivia</p></div>

<p>I must confess that the one thing I&#8217;d really been looking forward to seeing was the last thing we&#8217;d see on the Bolivian side of the border &#8211; Laguna Verde. I&#8217;d seen photos of the stunning green water &#8211; created by chemical reaction &#8211; with the backdrop of the towering Volcan Licancabur and was excited to be finally able to see it in person.</p>
<p>As with much of life, it was something of a disappointment. There was little water and the green colour was, at best, subdued. Still you can&#8217;t hold that against the Bolivian Southwest, it is a privilege to spend time there. Next stop Chile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-511 alignright" style="border-style:initial;border-color:initial;cursor:default;border-width:0;" alt="Mom and Me" src="http://savagesearching.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1526239343_l.jpg?w=350&#038;h=278" height="278" width="350" /></p>
<p>Our earliest recollections from childhood often involve a vivid sensation that pains, excites or shocks us into self-awareness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, what occurs is brutal.<br />
This is the story of my first memory.</p>
<p>She was bleeding from both brows and pumping her legs against the slick vinyl floor when I entered. With her back pressed to the kitchen cabinets, this woman kicked like she was trying to save herself from dropping off a cliff. Elegant fingers, with bitten-down nails and knobby knuckles, clawed at the countertop above. Tangled at her breast was her hair, grown long since college with hanging, breezing bangs. They were plastered to her temples now, blood-soaked to the color black. Her eyes were mouths to the mascara rivers running down her cheeks. This woman&#8217;s small frame froze when the man standing near came closer.</p>
<p>He grabbed something from the oak table in the center of the kitchen. His cowboy boots clicked as he approached the woman on the ground. He squatted down and turned his head to inspect her, as he would to see if a shot animal was dead.</p>
<p>He scratched at the nape of his Texas neck, truck keys still in hand from the drive home. Forearms dangled densely from elbows planted on his knees. The keys tinked against the 22 oz. glass jar in his other hand, the Yankee-brand candle from the table that caused the afternoon&#8217;s argument. The man leaned in toward the proud head of the woman&#8217;s body. He did not speak loudly to her, but made sure she heard his words.</p>
<p>I did not hear what my father said to my mother before he swung. The mass just crashed into her jawline, crowding her teeth to the harsh left. The impact drew blood. He swung again. More dripped to her chest.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">My parents met in the stormy winter of &#8217;83 at Angel Fire Resort in New Mexico. Dad was working on ski patrol and recently had an encounter with one of my mother&#8217;s friends. The meeting between the men ended badly, with Dad breaking the other guy&#8217;s nose on one of the mountain&#8217;s runs. The day after the bloodshed, Mom charged through the patrol booth while eight months pregnant to bring my dad to justice. He was fiddling with the channels on his radio when she blew in with winter&#8217;s wind.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It&#8217;s important to mention here that she was not only visibly carrying my older brother Sepp at the time, but also married to her first husband Joe. My father knew this about her, but he wanted her anyway, even while she screamed, &#8220;I want this man arrested!&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">My mother didn&#8217;t know his charm before busting down the door that day. His smile is what quickly lured her in, as in the past when it attracted all the beauty queens that loved him then. Those never lasted, though, and marriage was not an option until he met my mother, causing him to pursue her from that day on, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Dried, dripping wax ran down the side of the glass in my father&#8217;s hand that day.  They were melted by the flame my mother set that morning to make the kitchen smell like Eucalyptus. My father was furious because she left it beneath a cabinet unattended. &#8220;You could&#8217;ve burned the house down,&#8221; his red face yelled after a swing.</p>
<p>My mother&#8217;s cry stirred me to action even at three years old. I leapt from my spectating stance and into her chest to save her, to keep my father from hitting her again. He repeatedly swore at me for interfering, but he did not make me his victim too. Instead he collapsed the kitchen around us, cracking the pantry door and tipping the spice and cookbook shelf. I hid close to my mother and listened to her heartbeat and its heavy strange heave. I felt her arms fall across my legs and back. Her breathing slowed as her bleeding teeth did. It eased even more as the door slammed and the shrinking growl of my father&#8217;s Harley told us he was gone.</p>

<p>So you posted <a href="http://www.snopes.com/computer/facebook/privacy.asp" target="_blank">the useless, pompous-sounding Facebook Privacy Policy Notice</a>, and now you feel silly? Okay. Let me tell you a story.</p>
<h2>How You Got to This Place</h2>
<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a man bought a printing press. But because he was busy running the printing press, or perhaps because he was more interested in the wonders of the rising mechanical age than the whimsy of making things up, he did not write books to print with his press.</p>
<p>He bought it because it was readily apparent that he could <em>sell</em> books, if he printed them. So he offered others money on a profit-sharing basis if they would send their writing to him.</p>
<p>He then talked to the general stores in many towns around him, and wrote letters to others, giving them lists of the books he had to offer their clientele. He became a publisher (packager) and distributor of other people&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="RCA Victrola phonograph" alt="" src="http://scitascienda.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/rca-victrola-phonograph.jpg?w=150&#038;h=107" height="107" width="150" /></p>
<p>A long time ago, in the next galaxy over, the phonograph was invented. Something similar happened between those who realized they could make and sell recordings, but couldn&#8217;t sing worth a bent penny, and those who could sing like larks, but couldn&#8217;t tell a phonograph needle from a bent penny.</p>
<p>The idea of &#8220;media&#8221; is that it&#8217;s something that mediates between the creator and the consumer. These are the key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creative expression</li>
<li>The physical package which carries the content, in single or multiple copies</li>
<li>The system which delivers the package from creator to consumer</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s the basic need-to-know for all media and the weird stuff that happens with them. Including the medium of the internet.</p>
<p class="mceWPmore" title="More..."><span id="more-9511"></span></p>
<h2 class="mceWPmore" title="More...">Copyright Versus Licensed Rights</h2>
<p class="mceWPmore" title="More...">Since neither publishers nor creators could do for themselves what the other could, or at least, very much not as effectively, laws and contracts developed to govern this situation.</p>
<p>1) <em>The content belongs to its creator automatically. There is nothing the creator needs to do to assert this right. It is inherent. The creator has the right to determine who may make copies of the content to sell to others. The duration of the copyright expires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" target="_blank">when Mickey Mouse dies, and not a moment before.</a></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s copyright.</p>
<p>2) <em>In order to use the works of a creator, the publisher will pay the creator for license to make copies and sell them. The publisher may also buy the right to sub-license the content: to have someone else use or reproduce it. Or the right to have someone make a story into those newfangled things called a moving picture.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the license of rights.</p>
<p>As people interacted over these matters, some chaos and the occasional lynching ensued from time to time over who could do what with whose contributions to the various partnerships.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the middle of it all, the contract lawyers quietly smoked a cigar.</p>
<h2>Creation, Packaging, Distribution</h2>
<p>There was no other way. Printing presses were too expensive for individual writers to own one, and record producers never did learn how to sing.</p>
<p>Besides, there was that sticky bottleneck called &#8220;distribution.&#8221; Writers and musicians could, of course, spend a lot of money to get someone to turn their creations into physical products using expensive machinery. But they would only ever sell a few copies to their own distribution network, which mostly consisted of Mom and Aunt Joan. Cousin Fred tried to hide whenever the topic of &#8220;the new book&#8221; came up. He was no help at all.</p>
<p>Distribution &#8212; the art of putting the desired content, pre-poured into the desired packaging, in the hands of multiple recipients who wanted it &#8212; was a power held by those who had spent the time building connections. A hundred years and more of letters sent to general stores, then bookstores, then big-box stores, letting them know what was available for their clientele to listen to and read today.</p>
<h2>The Imbalance of Experience and Knowledge Base</h2>
<p>The publishers also had a hundred years&#8217; practice designing and tweaking contracts to allow them to repackage the content in every way possible, for as little profit-sharing as possible. (That is business.)</p>
<p>It is fair to say that, as creators weren&#8217;t the ones dealing directly with sales and competition and cost risks, their community members didn&#8217;t necessarily make themselves as educated about the ins and outs of rights, licensing and contracts as the community of publishers.</p>
<h2>Intergalactic Revolution</h2>
<p>Eventually, intergalactic communications were invented. They called it &#8220;the internet,&#8221; and quite naturally it destroyed everything for the galaxy of printing press owners and the galaxy of phonograph recording.</p>
<p>Except, not really.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the internet is not like the telephone or the post-box. Those delivery systems involve transmission without reproduction of or monetary gain from the content itself.</p>
<p>On the internet, you&#8217;re not merely paying a fee to have someone else carry your message. (Well, you do, to your internet service provider. But.) You also communicate by signing over the right for another party to replicate and transmit the data you type on your computer screen. Replication is copying the content you create. And that requires a license of rights.</p>
<p>That license is called the Terms of Service, or TOS, and its adjunct is the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Change, Opportunity, and Intergalactic Space Trucks</h2>
<p>Non-sequitur time!</p>
<p>There is a third galaxy out there, and it&#8217;s called long-haul trucking. Imagine that a truck is full of books. It takes them one way only: from the publisher to the store. There, people who are not content creators consume the books.</p>
<p>But what if every person who bought a book also created something and loaded it onto the truck, and sent it on its way? What if the truck was made of electrons, and it could go anywhere, to as few or as many of their contacts as they wished? Wouldn&#8217;t people look eagerly for the truck? It would bring them something of value to them, and send something of theirs back.</p>
<p>All they would have to do is sign a contract licensing the shipping depot to reproduce and distribute their content.</p>
<p>That sounds like a postal service, but it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s acquiring the right to reproduce content and distribute it to <em>many </em>endpoints. The internet has intergalactic space trucks with onboard replicators and multi-port teleporters for your content.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. There are also the invisible gnomes.</p>
<h2>The Truck-and-Delivery-Depot Shell Game</h2>
<p>The intergalactic space truck is also a shell game. Remember, you can use the depot and the trucks as long as you sign the content rights deal. While you&#8217;re focused on the free content delivery truck &#8212; waiting for it, sending it, making happy driving noises &#8212; the content packaging and delivery gnomes (otherwise known as tech developers) are invisibly rearranging the shipping depot around you, terraforming your internet environment to their advantage.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re waiting at the depot (let&#8217;s call it, say, Facebook) and constantly checking for a delivery or sending one out, the invisible gnomes can measure your unselfconscious, peer-generated consumer behaviour. This is like a producer/consumer petri dish, giving unprecedented insight into how to sell us what we already want.</p>
<p>Because we trust our friends. We&#8217;ll tell them what we wouldn&#8217;t tell a company. We tell them using the free trucks.</p>
<p>But no matter how many vroom noises we make, the trucks belong to the depot. They are in league with the invisible gnomes.</p>
<p>Social media &#8212; Facebook, Twitter, et al &#8212; is publishing and distribution, on steroids, with intergalatic space trucks and gnomes, hooking you in with free postage that isn&#8217;t free and pulling a bait and switch on what the real goods are.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t feel stupid. It really is that confusing.</p>
<p>And yet, if you remember the three components of all media, and the difference between copyright and licensing, it gets simple. Because it&#8217;s always been the same.</p>
<h2>Some Things Don&#8217;t Change</h2>
<p>&#8211; There are still plenty of clauses in rights contracts today which are not favourable to content creators.</p>
<p>&#8211; Packaging (publishing) has become immensely simplified. What used to be canvas and paint, or paper and ink, or vinyl and grooves, or 35 mm film, is now all one thing: electrons.</p>
<p>&#8211; Distribution is still a power held by those who control the networks. In prehistoric times, it was the roads and city gates. Then it became the telephone lines and radio frequencies. Now it&#8217;s the servers, satellites, cables and cellular towers.</p>
<p>&#8211; And, most content creators still don&#8217;t have a clue about intellectual property laws.</p>
<h2>&#8230;And Some Things Do Change</h2>
<p>The content creator is no longer just artists, writers, filmmakers and musicians who make a living from being semi-educated about this stuff; it&#8217;s not the kind of people who may use agents and lawyers and have a team to help them navigate the question of rights and licensing.</p>
<p>The content creator is now you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now your thirteen-year-old child with a camera phone and no concept of what Terms of Service means.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now your grandma, who thinks the internet is a very fast post-box for free.</p>
<p>Online privacy isn&#8217;t about copyright. It&#8217;s about who holds the permission to exploit that copyright, and to what extent. The best kind of licensing contract, from the licensee&#8217;s point of view, is the one that gets signed by content creators who don&#8217;t read it and/or don&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p>Enter the convenient and tiny Terms of Service checkbox. Click here to play.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how the internet works. Now everyone&#8217;s both consumer and creator. Their creative product is little bits of their existence in words, photos and videos. In the intergalactic milieu, the private citizen is no more. The rights to the details of his life &#8212; your life, your child&#8217;s life &#8212; have been licensed out <em><strong>by the user</strong></em> for corporate reproduction and distribution.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what you really need to know about copyright and privacy. End of story.</p>

<p><strong>I am going to lose it completely.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you read Kristen Lamb, who writes a blog about writing. It&#8217;s extremely popular and usually very helpful. But her latest post was a digression &#8211;<a href="http://warriorwriters.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/vogue-can-go-to-hell-can-i-make-peace-with-my-thighs/"> an extended piece about being a size 10/12 and why she feels fat:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I am healthy, have beautiful skin and hair. I have enough energy to power a small city and am never sick, but I am still a size 10-12 and 170 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it no one looks like me?</strong></p>
<p>When we look on TV, we are confronted with extremes–super skinny or clinically obese. We are calling anorexics “beautiful” and calling dangerously obese women “curvy.” <strong>We are an a country that is dying because of euphemisms.</strong> I hear parents call morbidly obese children “husky,” “big-boned” or “muscular.” We have retailers calling anorexics “curvy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I get it. I&#8217;ve written about this as well.</p>
<p>But, seriously &#8212; it is time for women to <strong><em>move on.</em></strong></p>
<p>Every time a healthy woman feels compelled to discuss the size of her ass or thighs or hips I want to throw a piece of furniture. Yes, being fat is annoying and unhealthy and no one makes pretty clothes for fatties.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m overweight, and have been since 2003 when I packed on 23 pounds in one year &#8212; the year I wrote my first book, traveling alone around the U.S., interviewing victims of horrific gun violence and crime, and dealing, alone, with my mother&#8217;s 3-inch-wide brain tumor and surgery in Vancouver. I was too damn distracted to even notice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gained even more since then. Ugh. I&#8217;m not thrilled, believe me, to need to lose 40+ pounds. But we need to stop talking about this, and this is why I feel so strongly.</p>
<p><strong>The larger issue here &#8212; pun intended &#8212; is this:</strong></p>
<p>Whining about weight is the biggest fucking distraction that women indulge in! We have much bigger fish to fry!</p>
<p>Whining about weight is a huge time-suck.</p>
<p>Whining about weight teaches the girls in our lives, <em>who look to us their role models,</em> that this is just what women <em>do</em>, that focusing miserably and endlessly on our individual body size and shape is our most pressing issue as women &#8212; instead of political and economic issues that affect us all, size 00s to 24s,  like paid maternity leave or better domestic violence protection or access to birth control and abortion.</p>
<p>Whining about weight ignores and demeans the many incredible gifts we enjoy every single day. We are not living in Syria with government/rebel bombs exploding all around us, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Whining about weight is the ultimate shiny object that women continue to focus their attention on, instead of:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8211; fighting for social justice, at home and abroad</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; running for political office and kicking ass when we win</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; creating astonishing works of art</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; waking up every single day grateful for their health and strength, the not-so-simple ability to walk and stand and reach for things without pain<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; knowing that women all over the world are dying of starvation, malnutrition and in childbirth at 14 or 16 because their young bodies are too weakened to do so healthily</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; ditching the people in their lives who shame them by focusing on the size of their ass instead of what matters most, the size of our hearts and brains</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; exploring the world, no matter our size, with excitement and anticipation</em></p>
<p>&#8211; <em>thinking, long and hard, about our legacies in this world</em></p>
<p>There is something ironic to me that Kristen&#8217;s blog post includes a photo of herself holding &#8212; of all things! &#8212; a very large gun. Having written a book about American women and guns, I know this decision isn&#8217;t one she made lightly, and showing her readers that she owns a gun takes serious guts. Shooting well also requires tremendous mental and physical control.</p>
<p>So, frankly, I don&#8217;t get it. You&#8217;re powerful and self-determining, or you&#8217;re not. A woman who knows how to handle a gun safely and shoot well is someone I respect; I&#8217;ve done a lot of shooting and know the power it conveys.</p>
<p>Labels are also something we generally choose to ignore after leaving the schoolyard, <strong>so why are women of all ages so eager to keep self-flagellating about how fat we are (or are not?)</strong></p>
<p>At this point, I&#8217;m technically &#8220;plus size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t the curvy chicks start calling size 6&#8242;s and 00&#8242;s <em>minus-size?</em></p>
<p>Give it up, ladies! This obsession is wasting our talent, energy, excitement and drive.</p>
<p><strong>Give it up today.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">For more than a few months (and years, honestly), I&#8217;ve grown increasingly distraught at the shell games business and consumers play with each other in the name of &#8216;savings&#8217; and, now that &#8216;couponing&#8217; has entrenched itself firmly in the mainstream of public conscience and every store in the universe has seemingly adopted a rewards program of some sort, it&#8217;s to the point where someone has got to stand up and ask why we bother at this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">/stands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why do we bother?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">/sits down</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt we have seen them: those dedicated folks who truck the binders of coupons around the store and hold up checkout lines to make sure every cent is accounted for. I know a few of them myself, and I mean no disrespect to anyone who carries the couponing torch. But it warrants mentioning that the marketplace is not a static environment; at some point, like the casinos, the stores will respond to the hit to the bottom line. And most of them have. The house always wins, and card-counters are, politely or otherwise, when the tactics are recognized, asked not to return. In the same way, you don&#8217;t see manufacturer&#8217;s coupons without an expiration date anymore, do you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It didn&#8217;t take me long to discover the hollow nature of &#8216;savings&#8217;. Even when I was a small boy, the allure of savings never made sense: &#8216;savings&#8217; mean that something has to be invested first in order for the savings to take place, and thus the stores could set any price they cared to and discount from there, competing with no one but themselves. When a store engages in this kind of economic solipsism&#8211;and ultimately, they all do, collusion is how every store from groceries to gas operate these days; to wit, when was the last time you saw a full-on, community-wide gas war?&#8211;it can claim a sale price based off whatever mark-up they&#8217;ve pinned on an item.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone these days is looking for a way to save a buck; I get this, and try to be as fiscally-responsible as possible. Indeed, couponing was a way to keep merchants honest and social discounting sites like Groupon were great ways to try to get a business&#8217; name out into the public, while rewards programs encouraged customers to keep shopping to see greater rewards. Now, all of them are counter-productive exercises in screwing us all over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there are enough cutthroat couponers out there to dent the gross revenues of a business, that business has no choice but to control costs to support themselves, either by cutting hours of the workforce or raising prices. When the binder-brandishing set descends on a marketplace, they may be leaving with a cart full for a fraction, but the rest of us are forced to pay more, while the store has to engage in more gimmicks and tactics to avoid the law of diminishing returns, figuratively and literally. Target, for a time, honored expired coupons. That didn&#8217;t last long. Eventually, the coupons are worth less, and even the frugal end up spending more. The house wins. Especially in a market that is watered down by cheap money, stealth inflation, and a flagging economy [overly] reliant on consumer spending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking of the Bullseye&#8211;and, in the interest of full disclosure, I used to work for their credit card division, first for the original parent company, Dayton-Hudson, then rebranded to, as it is now, Target Corp&#8211;as soon as their Red and Red Debit Cards became eligible for a 5% discount across the store&#8211;SAVINGS!!!!!1!1!!&#8211;I mentioned to a manager of the local Target in passing how I needed to sign up in order to avoid the 5% mark-up that was coming. She didn&#8217;t disagree, and all but said how the prices had already gone up. When Panera Bread, the usual haunt where I have written for this site in the past (lackluster coffee and all), started their MyPanera program, I asked the cashier when the prices were going up. She looked at me blankly, then, within weeks, they unrolled new magnetic menus with&#8230;you guessed it, higher prices. In fairness, the freebies that come with Panera&#8217;s program are typically pretty generous, but the fact is that though the program doesn&#8217;t cost the consumer any, the consumer pays via higher prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JCPenney, the fading American retail behemoth, with former Target and Apple exec Ron Johnson at the helm, tried stopping this tide of bait-and-switch sales gimmicks by promoting everyday values and minimizing said gimmickry. The public, so drunk with the thrill of couponing and anything to save a buck, didn&#8217;t bite. Steve and Barry&#8217;s, the flash-in-the-pan retailer who fell victim to their overexpansion, thrived by offering quality clothes at deep discounts, and then imploded by overextending its supply chain in time for the first economic implosion in the late 00s. With the S&amp;B threat gone, the rest of retail America went about the business of protecting themselves against the recession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what happens when this kind of downward spiral goes unchecked? After while, emboldened merchants begin to skew the promotions to their advantage: using fine print, technicalities and ambiguous phrases, what appears to be a good deal ends up being not much of a deal. Grocery stores with gas promotions where the savings on gas come at a premium throughout the store (as regional grocer Hy-Vee just launched this week, that is, both a gas rewards program and massive storewide mark-up&#8230;what happens when oil goes up again? It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re not even trying!), advertised sale prices actually not discounted from the regular price (Hy-Vee again, in their pet section), &#8216;selected varieties&#8217; of products being valid for discounts, retailers working with suppliers to make sure model numbers differ to avoid price competition (Best Buy&#8217;s calling card for years now.) Target, for the longest time, even refused to compete with its own website&#8217;s prices!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The allure of the sale triumphs over any real savings actualized by customers. For each time a couponer makes out like a bandit, a hundred others now end up having to pay more, in the exact same way that shrink requires at least $500 of additional sales to recover. Couple that with loose&#8211;charitably put&#8211;fiscal policies from Washington, and we wonder why prices skyrocket and Black Friday deals haven&#8217;t actually been worth waiting up for in three years. (And the things that are the subject of BF doorbuster deals seem to be cheaper and crappier than ever before.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh, and by the way, firsthand experience in monitoring hotel revenue dictates that deals on hotel rooms via third-party deep discount websites are largely savings-neutral, and end up raising rack rates for everyone else, which then results in even less savings next time you log on. Different segment of the retail industry, same principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, the answer isn&#8217;t as simple as not patronizing retailers with rewards programs and gimmick keycard programs: it&#8217;s a ubiquitous part of commercial life. Unfortunately, the Ron Johnsons of the world have the right idea: cut through the smoke and break the mirrors and provide real value directly to consumers. We don&#8217;t bite because we don&#8217;t see flashy advertisements and sales signs. We&#8217;ve allowed the free market to be controlled, and refuse to vote with our pocketbooks. Something about the eternal price for liberty being vigilance. (Meh. ZOMG!!!1!!!1!! another weekend sale!) Couponing and Grouponing fail to solve the problem, rather they contribute to it by giving businesses license to raise prices without consequence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The same can be said for the whole health care debate and the ACA, but that&#8217;s another discussion for another day. Suffice it to say that we can&#8217;t complain about escalating prices while expecting discounted rates without consequence. Last I checked, effects have causes, which have effects, which have causes&#8230;you get the idea.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, when we clip coupons and refuse to demand wholesale changes in retail dynamics (truth in pricing, call retailers&#8217; bluffs, etc.), we&#8217;re only bleeding ourselves dry, and hurting other people&#8217;s pocketbooks in the process. Running with scissors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Plus, what does one do with 647 bottles of poppyseed vinaigrette salad dressing bought for 31 cents, anyway? OK, fine, that was a cheap shot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, we can never claim it&#8217;s a corporate greed problem when we are equally complicit in allowing stores to raise prices without the restraints built into a truly free (read: truly competitive) marketplace. Freedom requires both responsibility and accountability, and the current state of affairs demonstrates that neither buyer nor seller are particularly interested in either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saving a buck for the sake of saving a buck, be it a store&#8217;s rewards program, or a consumer&#8217;s thirst for savings at any cost, leaves us all all the poorer.</p>

<p><em><strong>Myself and Friend Nawab standing at the entrance to Chicken Street</strong></em></p>
<p>As I’ve stated in earlier posts, Afghanistan was once famous as a passage from East to West for trading empires.  And Kabul, while an ancient city, was not really historically the center of Afghanistan, until relatively recently.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-shuja_shah_durrani_of_afghanistan_in_1839.jpg"><img id="i-1212" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-shuja_shah_durrani_of_afghanistan_in_1839.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>Kabul used to be a place where livestock and other trading goods were exchanged and stored.  It is my theory that the city was founded where it is because the Kabul River came so close to the mountains in the part of Police District 1 known as “The Lion’s Gate”, that it made a handy place to pen up livestock.  Traders only really needed to put some barriers across the narrow corridor there and they had an instant pen.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-upper_bala_hissar_from_west_kabul_in_1879.jpg"><img id="i-1214" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/800px-upper_bala_hissar_from_west_kabul_in_1879.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Bala Hisar circa 1879 &#8211; Photo by John Burke</strong></em></p>
<p>From there, the city grew along natural patterns based on terrain and socio-cultural pressures.  The area just past “The Lion’s Gate” made up the Shar-e Bazaar of Kabul, which was dominated by the fortress Bala Hisar.  The other main fortress was across the Kabul River in farm country, and that fortress was called Sher Pur.</p>
<p>In 1879, the British invaded Afghanistan for the second time, (the first time was from 1838 – 1842, which ended in the complete destruction of the British Army there) and when the British consul was killed, they burned the original Shar-e Bazaar, which was located at the foot of the Bala Hisar, in what is now known as Police District 1.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/move-to-chicken-street.jpg"><img id="i-1193" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/move-to-chicken-street.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Map from the paper &#8220;Recent Developments in Kabul&#8217;s Shar-e-Naw and Central Bazaar Districts&#8221; by Andreas Dittmann</strong></em></p>
<p>The area still has an extensive market, but the city grew northwest, across the river, towards the Sher Pur fort after the destruction of the old Bazaar, in an area that is now known as Shar-e Naw, which means “New City”.  And when the Civil War came, Bala Hisar was fought over extensively, which resulted in even more destruction of Shar-e Bazaar.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/storefronts.jpg"><img id="i-1217" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/storefronts.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Chicken Street </strong></em></p>
<p>Shar-e Naw was largely untouched by the Civil War, which preserved two of its most noted features; Shar-e Naw park and the Central Bazaar, more popularly known as “Kuchi Murgha” or “Chicken Street.”</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/clothes.jpg"><img id="i-1219" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/clothes.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>Chicken Street is a wondrous place, where Westerners may come to see, smell, touch, and purchase nearly everything that is exotic about the East.  80 carat Emerald?  I’ve seen and fondled one there. Lapis lazuli, rubies, tourmaline, you name it.  Afghan carpets?  Tons of them.  Exotic foods, to include a French bistro, where one can hang out with supermodel-looking girls?  Check.  How about a one of a kind Model 1895 big game rifle, just like Teddy Roosevelt used?  I’ve played with one there.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/winchester-1895.jpg"><img id="i-1221" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/winchester-1895.jpg?w=467" /></a></p>
<p>There are artists painting and selling their paintings.  Fresh fruits, vegetables and exotic spices, including really high quality saffron at bargain basement prices.  Nuristani carved furniture.  I’ve even seen the cape from an endangered Snow Leopard.  Ancient coins and other antiquities abound.  And the beggars are plentiful and even entertaining, with my favorite being a young man who does a comedic imitation of a beggar, intentionally making ridiculous claims of his families’ hardships and then laughing about it after.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/old-man.jpg"><img id="i-1222" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/old-man.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>But starting about 2010, the people who own the property made a huge mistake.  In their excitement to maximize profits and to make the experience more modern, they started destroying the cozy run down little shops that made the experience so cool.  Some of the old shops are still there.  My friend Wahid, whose carpet shop appears to be an 8 x 10 foot room, but if you check out as being “ok” you are invited back to a rat’s warren of passageways until you arrive at the upper floor, which is large and luxuriant.  Some of my best memories are of sitting at his table, drinking chai and eating his Herati snacks while discussing the problems of Afghanistan, America and the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rubble.jpg"><img id="i-1224" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rubble.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Rubble from the shop tear down </strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/modern.jpg"><img id="i-1226" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="http://hotmilkforbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/modern.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Modern buildings replace the old</strong></em></p>
<p>But these little shops are gradually being torn down and are replaced by huge, chrome and glass multi-story mega-complexes.  Unfortunately, as this construction is going up, potential customers for the business they promise were not going to Chicken Street anymore because of Western risk aversion and withdrawal from Afghanistan. And for Westerners, the greatest attraction to Chicken Street was its cool and exotic feel.  Ironically, if you want the flavor of the “old” Chicken Street, you need to go back South East, over the river to Shar-e Bazaar.  Shar-e Bazaar has been somewhat restored to its mysterious, intriguing and inviting self.  But I have yet to see another Westerner there.  Really adventurous shoppers will stop and have a bowl of Shorwa, or soup, at one of the many mobile carts, there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="alignright zemanta-img" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22476926@N03/3640140647" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Formica rufa" alt="Formica rufa " src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2469/3640140647_87f2d98143_m.jpg" height="240" width="162" /></a>Several years ago, scientists published an excellent study about how desert ants find their way home after foraging.  The story got a lot of media attention; unfortunately,  much of the coverage described the ants &#8220;counting steps&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t what the researchers reported and feeds into existing myths rather than broadening our scope.  To explain what I think is wrong with that approach, I&#8217;m going to tell you a story about ants on stilts, body swapping and how we perceive space.<span id="more-2322"></span></p>
<p>The actual study was quite straightforward. Unlike many other ants, Saharan desert ants (<em>Cataglyphis fortis</em>) don&#8217;t use chemical trails to navigate between their nest and a food source.  Instead, they use a &#8220;path integrator&#8221; to calculate the direct route home after their meandering outward journey.  Scientists knew that the ants used a compass based on sunlight to judge direction, but not how they determined the distance. Researchers had already shot down several ideas, like using visual cues or estimates of energy usage, so the team decided to test a very old idea: that the ants might be using the number of steps taken to reckon distance. The crucial experiment was to change the length of the returning worker&#8217;s steps by gluing pig bristles to their legs to artificially lengthen them. When this was done, the ants took longer strides and ended up overshooting their return trip. The converse experiment also worked: ants with shortened legs had a shorter stride and so overestimated how far they&#8217;d gone, stopping before they had reached the nest entrance.  After spending a day in the nest, the ants had adjusted to their new legs and were able to make it out and back to the feeding site without any trouble.  It was a really neat experiment and did a great job of showing that these ants calculate distance based on how many steps they&#8217;ve taken.  The researchers called this a &#8220;step integrator&#8221; or &#8220;loosely speaking, a step counter, although the ants most probably do not literally count&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Unfortunately, a lot of the coverage of this story gives the impression the ants really are counting, which isn&#8217;t what the paper claimed. NPR wrote about it under the headline &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2011/06/01/120587095/ants-that-count">Ants That Count!</a>&#8221; while Livescience went with &#8220;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/871-ants-marching-count-steps.html">When Ants Go Marching, They Count Their Steps</a>&#8220;.  To their credit, I think New Scientist actually <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9436-ants-use-pedometers-to-find-home.html">covered the story</a> quite well.  A &#8220;step integrator&#8221; gives the ants a sense of distance based on how many steps they&#8217;ve taken, but that&#8217;s not the same as counting steps.  Science writers always face the challenging task of simplifying a complex subject which is often full of nuances.  There&#8217;s always the risk of oversimplifying, which not only does a disservice to readers but can also feed various social myths and constructs, including how special humans are and the onward march of progress.  In this case, I think the simplified version draws from and supports the pervasive and enduring myth of a chain of being, with humans at the top and &#8220;lower&#8221; animals, little more than automata, at the bottom.  In fact, at its core a step integrator might not be so different from the way we build our sense of time and space &#8212; which is where the body swapping comes in.</p>
<p>The neuroscientists at the Brain, Body and Self lab of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm regularly make volunteers swap bodies with different kinds of dolls and mannequins to investigate our sense of self.  In 2011, they decided to see what the world would look like from bodies that were much bigger or smaller than usual.  Participants wore a headset which gave them a first person view of a doll&#8217;s body lying in the same position as them.  They saw the leg of the doll being stroked at the same time as someone stroked their leg; the combination of touch and sight tricked their brain into thinking the doll&#8217;s body was their own.  When the doll was threatened with a knife, participants unconsciously responded &#8212; breaking into a sweat and showing a change in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=skin+conductance&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSkin_conductance&amp;ei=ANycUNS0PMrH0QXPoYH4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzwSGNYo-BY7etwfIO2XftcF6o1A">skin conductance</a>.  As though body swapping wasn&#8217;t enough, the team wanted to see how this would affect the perception of size and distance.  The participants consistently over- or under-estimated, depending on how big the doll was. People who had swapped bodies with a little Barbie doll thought they were in a world of giants, vastly overestimating how big or how far away everything was.  Meanwhile, those who had swapped into 400cm tall bodies felt like they <em>were </em>giants, thinking everything was tiny and close by.  This was true regardless of whether people estimated the distances verbally or tried to walk to an object while blind-folded.  It turns out that our brains use our body size to measure space; when we look through the eyes of giants or Lilliputians, everything gets scaled up or down accordingly.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, the ants most probably aren&#8217;t literally counting their steps.  Instead, the number of steps taken gives them a sense of how far they&#8217;ve travelled.  The body swapping experiments show that humans do something similar, estimating distance based on the size of their body, and make the same kinds of mistakes when their stride length doesn&#8217;t match their expectations.  Though the particulars of the mechanism might be very different, in both studies distance is estimated through some kind of sensation of a body &#8212; whether it&#8217;s based on stride length or body size.  Yet we persist in describing many organisms as simple automata, sensing and counting and responding, while reserving &#8220;awareness&#8221; for ourselves.  This viewpoint informs how we approach the world around us, as well as how we conduct and report science.  I <a title="Five common biology myths (or “Science in the service of the anthropocentric patriarchy”)" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/five-common-biology-myths/">disagree with it</a> and am glad to see <a title="Social wasps are specialists at recognizing faces" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/social-wasps-are-specialists-at-recognizing-faces/">mounting evidence</a> for <a title="Thinking bees and the concept of “sameness”" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/thinking-bees-and-the-concept-of-sameness/">unexpected faculties</a> in <a title="Pointing ravens and theory of mind" href="http://inspiringscience.wordpress.com/2012/02/04/pointing-ravens/">other organisms</a>.  I have no idea how self-aware an ant is, but the findings fit with the possibility that they are aware of their body size and stride length, which they use to estimate distance.  To me, that&#8217;s a far more exciting and interesting take on the story, broadening our conception of other organisms and their own unique perspective, rather than reinforcing our illusions of superiority and dominance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1033 alignleft" alt="NaBloPoMo_teaser" src="http://pinkbriefcase.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/nablopomo_teaser.jpg?w=590"   /></p>
<p>So, this thing happened. It was called <a class="zem_slink" title="NaBloPoMo" href="http://www.nablopomo.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">NaBloPoMo</a>, and it was a national blog posting month, where some bloggers committed to trying to post in their respective spaces every single day for the entire month. You know, I&#8217;m not sure why we pick November for this when it is already <a class="zem_slink" title="No-Shave November" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-Shave_November" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">No-Shave November</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">National Novel Writing Month</a> and contains Veterans&#8217; Day and Thanksgiving, but I&#8217;m pretty okay with it nonetheless. Here are a few thoughts I have about the experience and some ideas I&#8217;ve gathered for making my blog better in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson one: substance matters <del>as much as</del> more than frequency.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, more-frequent blogging keeps my page views up, but page views aren&#8217;t everything when the quality of your work starts to suffer. Lame, awkward, cliché posts are only going to keep even the most dedicated readers [Hi, Mom and Dad!] coming back for so long. After a few lame posts I started to feel embarrassed of my content and decided that I&#8217;d have to really write <em>something</em> or not post at all. This decision was made the day after a photo-only post that I thought would hold down the fort on the day I was too tired to write. A dear friend told me the next day, &#8220;So that fake blog you wrote? I clicked over and was disappointed.&#8221; And honestly, that&#8217;s how I felt too! So, here are my goals for the blog in the coming year:</p>
<ol>
<li><em></em><em><strong>A Content Calendar. </strong> So many blogger advice posts out there say that this is the way to go, and I think it is time for me to try it out too. Now, having a content calendar may reduce the spontaneity of my blogs, but I think it will help keep things consistent and help me to meet my readers&#8217; expectations. So, I&#8217;ve made plans for the rest of the month and will be trying out a few new things to see how it goes. I&#8217;m not committed to a full calendar &#8212; it may be better for my style to pre-select topics for one or two posts each week and let the remaining posts come as the inspiration does, but we&#8217;re going to try it out before making that decision.</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em></em><em><strong>Target content. </strong> The most successful blogs have a subject matter or two that attract a certain type of reader &#8212; a niche, in other words. To build up a readership that will actually leave comments and engage in dialogue about issues I care about, I&#8217;ll have to actually write about those issues and maintain relationships with the kind of readers who will leave those kinds of comments. Thus far, my content is a little all-over-the-place, and I kind of like that. So, I won&#8217;t be picking one topic, but I will be keeping this in mind and will try to tie each blog post back to the things that this blog is really about: maintaining a positive work-life balance, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and adventure-ly. I&#8217;ll still write about what I am passionate about: cooking, religion, politics, social justice, travel and history, but I will try to keep in mind the reason I&#8217;m writing at all &#8212; to remember that no matter how busy and crazy life gets, who I am inside really matters, and what I care about deserves to have a place in my schedule.</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em><strong>A network of bloggers.</strong> This year, I have fallen in love with some new bloggers. As I study and attempt to emulate their successful blogging patterns, it is clear that these bloggers are real-life friends with many other bloggers, and that they all work together to cross-promote, collaborate, encourage and support each other. When one blogger writes a book or joins an exciting initiative, their network supports the action, sends over blog traffic, and provides public and enthusiastic encouragement. It&#8217;s kind of beautiful. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to find my own network, but I know that really connecting with my subject matter and readers is the first step. So, I&#8217;m going to work harder at &#8220;Like&#8221;-ing and Commenting on other posts, at using my twitter accounts to encourage dialogue and at supporting my special friends who are also blogging about their life-encounters. Lately, my blog reading has been done by <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Google Reader</a>, so my favorites may not even know how dedicated I am to reading their content. That is about to change. </em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson two: words aren&#8217;t enough. </strong></p>
<p>When I decided to start this whole thing, one of my first tasks was to download a photo widget from <a class="zem_slink" title="BlogHer" href="http://www.blogher.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">BlogHer</a> to add to my sidebar. I discovered (1) that my sidebar had disappeared sometime since I last revised my blog theme, (2) that a full sidebar with a single photo widget is quite awkward-looking, and (3) that lazy plans for filling up a sidebar can only get you so far.</p>
<p>Basically, my blog needs a makeover, in the beauty department. Nothing screams AMATEUR like poorly photo-shopped headers, random formatting glitches, and blurry snapshots. Here are my plans for the new year:</p>
<ol>
<li><em></em><em><strong>Professional photography</strong>. And no, not by me, obviously. I&#8217;m thinking it would be cool to have some new photos related to the blog&#8211;I&#8217;m going to pick out a cool new briefcase and try to get really creative and fun. And honestly, it&#8217;s time for this. I need a professional headshot for my linked in account and with this I can kill two birds with one stone.</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em><strong>To learn all about widgets, sidebars, and other blogging gadgets and gizmos</strong>. I honestly have no idea what a lot of these things are about. What in the world is <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HTML</a>? And how do I change fonts, font sizes, etc.? I have no idea, but I want to find out.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson three: Blog challenges are fun!</strong></p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m going to post a blog every single day forever &#8212; but it was a pretty fun challenge! I did pretty well at it for about 60% of the month, and was almost perfect during pre-Thanksgiving November. There are blog challenges going on all the time, and trying something different with your writing shifts your perspective and deepens your sensitivity as a writer. It&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><em></em><em><strong>First up</strong>: <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">WordPress</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/tag/writing-challenge/" target="_blank">weekly writing challenge.</a> I may not do it every week, but I&#8217;m going to throw in the ones I find interesting from time-to-time and encourage you to do it with me. It could be really fun!</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em><strong>Community challenges</strong>. Once I find a blogging community or two that fits into my writing genre(s), I&#8217;d like to participate in link-ups as well. This connects back to the first and second lessons too, but I would really like to learn how people network together, how bloggers choose partners and get guest bloggers, and how to build a conversation in this space. All in due time, of course. </em></li>
</ol>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a wrap. NaBloPoMo, or post-almost-every-day-in-November-until-Thanksgiving-distracts-you-from-everything was a success. I&#8217;m so glad I did it and hope to carry these lessons into my blogging for the next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since it happened.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years, actually.</p>
<p><span id="more-3873"></span></p>
<p>I made clear in a previous post that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://meizac.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/i-blame-him/">I blame him</a></span> for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://meizac.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/here-it-is/">this</a></span>. As with any relationship, I know I have to take responsibility for my own shortcomings, and I do. They pale in comparison to what he did to me; what he did to us.</p>
<p>And why does it still have to hurt so much?</p>
<p>When will it stop hurting?</p>
<p>Without question, I am over him. I no longer love him. I haven&#8217;t for a long time. I do not hate him. It would not bother me in the least if I never spoke to or saw him again. (Of course, this can&#8217;t happen (and I won&#8217;t allow it to happen), because we have Z and M.)</p>
<p>What I am not over is how much he hurt me. He&#8217;s not only hurt me, he&#8217;s hurt me in such a way as to have a long-term impact on any and all relationships I may have. He&#8217;s hurt me in such a way as to have a long-term impact on any and all relationships I already have.</p>
<p>When I need to talk to or just be in the presence of someone the most, I can&#8217;t bear the thought of it. I can&#8217;t bear the thought of confiding in someone else.</p>
<p>The depth of the pain is too much to bear.</p>
<p>When will it stop hurting?</p>
<p>When will I be able to return to some version of the woman I was before this?</p>
<p>I thought I was getting better. I mean, I&#8217;ve told the story of what happened to so many people these past few months, and I&#8217;ve done it nearly every time without feeling anything. Like it was just something that happened. That, sure, it was a big deal at the time, but I&#8217;m good now. In fact, I told the story to someone today, and I was fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not fine.</p>
<p>I came home to relieve him from his childcare responsibilities, so he could go back to his place, and we, of course, got into an argument. He was angry with me about something. I can&#8217;t even remember what. Then, he made me feel like hell about all the time I&#8217;ve been away from the kids lately (even if I am still with them more than he is) because of work and school.</p>
<p>Then, I was sorting through some things looking for items to donate to the local women&#8217;s shelter, and I came across all the e-mails, letters and receipts from seven years ago. (I had them tucked away in case I need them when it comes time to get into all the legal stuff.)</p>
<p>I forgot they were there.</p>
<p>I immediately broke down.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even need to read them (and I didn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Sunk to the floor and started sobbing.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t stopped crying, actually.</p>
<p>I can barely see through the tears as I write this.</p>
<p>And, as much as I need to talk to someone, I don&#8217;t feel I can.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no one close by that I either trust enough or is in a position for me to bother with my stuff. And, for the couple of friends I do trust (but who aren&#8217;t in a position for me to bother them), when does it stop? Even if I did call them or ask them to come and just sit with me, when is enough enough?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply I feel the humiliation of him telling other people the most intimate details of our life, in explicit detail&#8230;so they could spit them back at me or so I could read about them in e-mail exchanges.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply I feel the betrayal&#8230;after he managed to break down the walls to get me to trust him; to get me to declare him &#8220;the best person I know,&#8221; when someone asked why I was marrying him.</p>
<p>I doesn&#8217;t matter how much I try, I still cannot put to words exactly how deeply it all hurts.</p>
<p>I often feel like I&#8217;ll never fully recover from this.</p>
<p>Why does it still have to hurt so much?</p>
<p>When does it stop hurting?</p>
<p>And why does it make everything else that hurts hurt so much more?</p>
