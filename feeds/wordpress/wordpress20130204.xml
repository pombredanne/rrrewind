				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I saw <a title="Can married women have straight male friends?" href="https://twitter.com/Fem2pt0/status/294471003755659266" target="_blank">this Tweet</a>.  <a title="Role/Reboot: Can married women have single male friends?" href="http://www.rolereboot.org/sex-and-relationships/details/2013-01-can-married-women-have-single-male-friends" target="_blank">The piece</a> linked there asks the question: &#8220;Can married women have straight male friends?&#8221; and suggests that friendships between straight men and straight women can be very difficult, partially based on a study about how some men and women might view their friendships differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently a study <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=men-and-women-cant-be-just-friends" target="_hplink">published in Scientific American</a> stated that women are much more likely to be able to keep male friends platonic, while men have a harder time. The article states that these friendships are masked by a cover-up of sexual impulses by one of the parties. It said that men were far more attracted to their female friends and assumed their female friends felt the same, when they didn&#8217;t. Females were far less attracted to their male friends, and they, too, assumed that the male friends felt the same as they did. So, when it comes to male/female relationships, there are a lot of mixed signals going on from both sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>First order of business: Studies like the one linked in the article are <strong>descriptive</strong>, not <strong>prescriptive</strong>. &#8220;<em>This happens sometimes</em>&#8221; does not mean &#8220;<em>This happens sometimes, and therefore you should ______,&#8221; </em>though they are nearly always presented that way by headline writers. &#8220;<em>This happens sometimes. Scientists studied it in a way that fits into my preconceptions and anxieties. Therefore you should ____</em>.&#8221;<em> </em>==&gt;A trend piece is born.</p>
<p>Sometimes, inevitably, we become attracted to our friends. They are awesome people, we are awesome people, and like attracts like. I do not see why this is a gendered issue. Attraction causes tensions in straight-lady/gay-lady friendships, too, right? And straight-man/gay-man friendships?</p>
<p>Should you become attracted to your friend of any gender, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this person in a committed relationship that does not include room for me?</li>
<li>Do I want to speak up about my feelings and see if they are returned?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your friend is single or might be interested in you, and you want to speak up and see what happens, say &#8220;<em>Friend, would you maybe like to try dating and see if we&#8217;d be good at it?</em>&#8221; and see what they say. <a title="The Year of Living Awkwardly" href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/26/the-year-of-living-awkwardly/" target="_blank">Real friendships are not irrevocably ruined by such honesty</a>. <a title="Open Thread: Crushes" href="http://captainawkward.com/2013/01/07/open-thread-crushes/" target="_blank">I swear</a>.</p>
<p>If your friend is happily committed elsewhere, and/or you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to act on an attraction for whatever reason, having the attraction does not have to doom your friendship. <a title="I don't have a friend zone" href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/11/23/guest-post-i-dont-have-a-friend-zone-question-140/" target="_blank">Having an attraction</a> does not mean you have to do anything or say anything about it. <a title="If my friend has feelings for me, it is only logical that I return them." href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/03/24/211-if-my-friend-has-feelings-for-me-it-is-only-logical-that-i-return-them/" target="_blank">Someone else&#8217;s attraction (or possible attraction)</a> to you does not obligate you to do or feel anything in return. Even if such attraction is rare for you, <a title="Geek Relationship Fallacies" href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/04/16/geek-relationship-fallacies/" target="_blank">you&#8217;re not the only two members of your species</a>. Go ahead and have your secret PANTSFEELINGS. Then, when you see your friend, do not mention these feelings, hint at them, Firth them, probe for or exacerbate cracks in their current relationship, send FEELINGSMAIL, or give weird extra-long hugs where you smell their necks.</p>
<p>We talk a lot here about boundary-setting; this is a case for boundary-having. Feel whatever you feel! Then set boundaries with yourself about how you behave towards your friends. You could even say &#8220;<em>I need to take a little break from hanging out to work out some weird feelings I&#8217;m having, sorry to make it weird, I&#8217;ll see you in a month or two</em>&#8221; if you had to, and your friends would understand. Survive the temporary awkwardness, and stop imagining &#8220;attraction&#8221; as this mystical force that exists outside of human decisionmaking.</p>
<p>I am also confused as to why the writer seems to equate male friendships with &#8220;male attention.&#8221; This is one of the saddest sentences I&#8217;ve read in a while:</p>
<blockquote><p>I find it easier to get my other needs met from my girlfriends and the male attention I get outside of that is restricted to the few men that still try to pick up on me in the grocery store.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you buy the frankly terrible assumption that &#8220;male attention&#8221; is some kind of abstract need that women have in the first place, all &#8220;male attention&#8221; is not created equal.</p>
<p>My best friend from film school is named Zach. Zach is the kind of talented that means that someday you will all line up to buy tickets to the opening nights of his movies and talk about them in breathless, excited tones the way you now discuss your fondest artistic heroes. He is also fiercely loyal, honest, sensitive and considerate, a great listener, a generous collaborator, and effing hilarious. He moved away about a year ago, and I miss him pretty much daily.</p>
<p>I do not think that my friendship with Zach has ever included the kind of &#8220;male attention&#8221; one finds in grocery stores or, say, <a title="One-Sided Conversations on a Train" href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/09/15/conversations-on-a-train/">riding the Chicago Transit Authority</a>. Full attraction disclosure: Once I walked into a show where his band was playing and thought &#8220;<em>Whoa, that bass player is really ho-&#8230;.I mean, my friend Zach is really good at playing bass!</em>&#8221; If he ever had a similar passing thought of &#8220;<em>Whoa, that disheveled teacher is really ho- I mean, my friend Jennifer is very good at explaining stuff</em>&#8221; I do not know. If he did <strong>he sensibly kept that shit to himself like a grownup</strong>.</p>
<p>For anyone to try to tell me that one of the best and most productive and rewarding relationships I have ever had with a human being could possibly live or die by some pseudo-science about misplaced pantsfeelings, or put it in the <strong>highly</strong> dubious &#8220;ego-feeding&#8221; category of grocery store flirtations is beyond insulting. What a sad and reductive view of what human beings are to each other.</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s anxieties and choices about who to be friends with are obviously her own to have. But I don&#8217;t respect this way of forming the question and am so tired of seeing it asked. Advice about how to be friends, find love, and have sex that relies on gender essentialism is so very, very bad for us.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, my mom fell into this trap, big time even though she is an amazing, driven, brilliant, career-minded feminist who brooks no crap from anyone. She was hyper-vigilant and worried about any time I spent with boys. Even though I played on a nearly all-male soccer team. Even though men made up more than half our family, not to mention being half of everyone on the planet so, not actually avoidable. I was not allowed to invite male friends over, or go to their houses, and the question was always &#8220;<em>Will there be boys there?</em>&#8221; She would say &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t trust you, I just don&#8217;t trust<strong> them</strong>,</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>You never know <strong>what might happen</strong></em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t want to get <strong>a reputation</strong></em>.&#8221; I wanted to know &#8211; WHAT? WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN? I know that she was very afraid that I would get pregnant and derail my plans for education and career stuff, but beyond that she would never be specific, there was just this generalized fear and I had to live with it. When I mentioned any boy comma friend, there was a lot of probing to see if he was a boynocommaorspacefriend and sudden restrictions on where I could go. The weirdest thing is, it was also coupled with a lot of advice on how I could make myself prettier &#8211; gift subscriptions to <em>Seventeen</em> and <em>Vogue</em>, admonishments to wear more makeup and stop stealing my dad&#8217;s flannel shirts and wearing unfeminine stompy shoes. Message: Be pretty, or at least, pretti<strong>er</strong>! So boys will like you and ask you to proms! But be very afraid of them and don&#8217;t spend time with them unless a parent is in-the-room supervising you!</p>

<p><span id="more-5074"></span></p>
<p>My freshman year in college, my mom&#8217;s worst fears about &#8220;what might happen&#8221; manifested, and a man raped me.</p>
<p>But you know who came to find me that night that I was drunk and had gotten separated from our group by someone sketchy? My guy friends.</p>
<p>You know who took me to the hospital and held my hand after a rape exam where the doctor invited a bunch of medical students into observe what collecting a rape kit is like without asking me if that was okay? Guy friends.</p>
<p>You know who always walked me home and made sure I got home okay after that night? Guy friends.</p>
<p>You know who lent me their class notes and studied with me and made sure I didn&#8217;t fall behind in my classes? Guy friends.</p>
<p>You know who hugged me and made me laugh and feel normal and like I could trust people again? Guy friends. One gave me his favorite Yoda action figure so I would always have someone to consult for wisdom and comfort. I carried Yoda in my pocket for the next three years and if I hadn&#8217;t lost him in a tragic pocket-lining-hole incident on the Czech-Polish border in 1995, I&#8217;d carry him still.</p>
<p>My ladies had my back too, don&#8217;t get me wrong. Both men and women <a title="#190: The Sandwich Means “I Love You”: A Valentine." href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/02/13/190-the-sandwich-means-i-love-you-a-valentine/" target="_blank">made me a lot of sandwiches</a> that year. BOTH men AND women, i.e. HUMAN BEINGS, took care of me and no one had to be afraid of each other or secretly in love.</p>
<p>My mom has esteemed colleagues, but I don&#8217;t know that she has any men besides my dad and her brother who she is emotionally close to. I think she came by her fears and views honestly as a reasonable byproduct of the upbringing she had in the 1950s and 1960s where it really was more usual for girls to be friends with girls and boys to be friends with boys (and LGBTQ people were totally invisible). I think next time we hang out I am going to ask her about friends, and friendship, and what she thinks about this stuff, but until then I will assume she&#8217;s happy with her choices.</p>
<p>As I am happy not living in the 1950s, or with 1950s expectations about who I am allowed to be friends with.</p>
<p>So my question, or I guess my frustration is: Who are these &#8220;<em>Men are like ___, Women are like ____, you should probably worry</em>&#8221; articles serving? Who are they targeted at? Who profits when we frame things like this, argue caution and worry, and cut ourselves off from each other? What possible end could be met or good created? Why are people invested in acting as if men and women are so radically different from each other, or so fragile, or that there is no benefit beyond sexual interest or &#8220;attention&#8221; (ugh) underlying our interactions? Why do people assume that attraction (and in this case, once again it&#8217;s <strong>male</strong> attraction that&#8217;s presented as being the important, insurmountable kind) is some powerful, mysterious force that automatically trumps everything about two people and their feelings and choices?</p>
<p>My life would be so much poorer if I bought into those anxieties. Wouldn&#8217;t yours? As one of my fellow &#8220;WTF?&#8221; Twitter brigade said yesterday,&#8221;<a title="I have male friends this isn't an anomaly" href="http://bikegroggery.blogspot.com/2013/01/i-have-male-friends-this-isnt-anomaly.html?m=1" target="_blank">To throw away the love and friendship of people based solely on their gender seems like a lonely way to go through life</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the hopes of fighting this particular strain of ignorance, I have created a new website, called <a title="Can men and women be friends?" href="http://www.canmenandwomenbefriends.com" target="_blank">CanMenandWomenBeFriends.com</a>, dedicated to answering this question so that future generations can have a lasting, permanent answer to this question. Thank you for reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://comingupshorthanded.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/liam-with-new-hand.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-490" alt="Liam with new hand" src="http://comingupshorthanded.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/liam-with-new-hand.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>Liam is now the owner of a functional, comfortable device that increases what his right hand can accomplish. The evening before his birthday, Liam and his parents (Rory and Yolandi) stopped by Richard&#8217;s workshop to pick up the completed hand.</p>
<p>Not only did this device cost $0 for Liam&#8217;s family, but the design itself is now public-domain. There is no patent, the details of this design can be used freely by anyone. The specific CAD files used to print the components are available for free-download <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44150">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a long day, but Liam was kind enough to demonstrate using his new hand on video:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4i4RpKYoeEw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><br />
And here he is just 3 days later, practicing and playing with his new hand:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kB53-D_N8Uc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Liam took his new hand with him to his doctor&#8217;s appointment today and also to school! His mother Yolandi says,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Finish with Hand Clinic yay Dr&#8217;s are VERY impressed with Liam&#8217;s Robohand. No operations to be done as yet which is awesome. Amazing stuff to happen very soon. Liam has had so far an fantastic day not shy at all to show all his Robohand. His little school he goes to was a huge hit all the teacher&#8217;s &amp; kiddies were in awe <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  its been a super duper day. Thank you all for the birthday wishes to Liam much appreciated xxx&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Richard and Ivan are deeply grateful for the support of their families (Beth Rademeyer Van As &amp; Jen Owen, you ladies are both indescribably awesome!), thankful for Rory &amp; Yolandi for taking a chance on two crazy guys with an idea and for all the people who have helped with this project.</p>
<p>A special thank you as well to <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot </a>for providing the machines that made it possible to produce light-weight, inexpensive components for Liam&#8217;s hand!</p>
<p>With what we have learned by working with Liam, we see this as just the <strong>beginning</strong>. From here we want to carry this forward, to find other &#8220;Liams&#8221; out there who could benefit from the designs and techniques we are exploring.</p>
<p>If you believe, as we do, that as many people should freely benefit from this as possible &amp; you would like to help make it happen, please visit our <a href="http://fundly.com/just-a-guy-with-an-idea-restoring-fingers">fundraising page</a>. Thank you!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At age 25 with plenty of planned years of awesome boobage ahead of me, I never really considered not having reconstruction after my mastectomy. Although the reconstruction procedure added 4 hours to my surgery and meant considerably more pain and discomfort, there was and is something important to me about maintaining these bastions of my femininity &#8211; and I think it goes deeper than just wanting to look good in a tank top, although that&#8217;s certainly a consideration.</p>
<p>I found this beautiful quote in the book Reconstructing Aphrodite, a series of essays from women who decided to rebuild their bodies after the devastation of a mastectomy. It really spoke to me, and I hope it will speak to you too.</p>
<blockquote><p>From the moment I was diagnosed with breast cancer and faced a possible mastectomy, I knew I wanted reconstruction. This response was out of my own sense of art, symmetry, and aesthetic. It was the same response I would have to a tooth extraction or the loss of any body part. It speaks of how I approach an environment that to me is visually out-of-balance.</p>
<p>How could I be concerned about something so superficial while facing cancer? Perhaps because I did not believe that I had the worst disease in the world. Princess Diana said, &#8220;The worst disease in the world is the lack of love.&#8221; Mother Teresa said, &#8220;The worst disease in the world is to be nothing to nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in the abundant love of God amid friends and family who express God&#8217;s loving kindness. We are surrounded by survivors of all life&#8217;s troubles and grief, surrounded by hope, peace, and joy. I saw the choice for reconstruction as only one of the endless ways to create beauty in my world. It was my surgeon&#8217;s sense of art and beauty and her respect for the female form that gave me the confidence to pursue this path.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I had my second expander fill. I popped another Ativan beforehand, so that I could remain calm in the face of the MegaNeedle. Alas, I do not possess quite the same level of mental zen as the author of the above quote, although I have been doing a variety of yoga poses to ease my tense back. Child pose is THE BEST.</p>
<p>I was too calm about the fill, perhaps, because the MegaNeedle got the best of me this time. I felt everything as my right breast was punctured. I shouted out in alarm more than pain, because I was so surprised to have any sensation. The plastic surgeon apologized, but said it was good news, because it could herald the return of feeling in my breasts. Sweet! Maybe I won&#8217;t have to go the rest of my life unsure whether or not I&#8217;m having a nip-slip.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite weird to be numb across such a wide swath of my body. For example, I noticed that the DermaBond skin glue the surgeons used to close up my wounds &#8211; which, as I previously mentioned, looked like the Joker&#8217;s face &#8211; had started to crack, peel and fall off. I&#8217;m sure that if I had sensation, that would be unbearably itchy, but I can&#8217;t feel a thing. Side note: Can you believe that after surgery they still patch you up using things that can be found at OfficeMax? Staples, thread, glue? What year is this?</p>
<p>Anyway, the plastic surgeon noticed it, and accelerated the process by peeling off the remainder of the DermaBond with sterile tweezers. Again, I&#8217;m willing to bet this would be uncomfortable if I could feel it. When she was done, I was absolutely stunned. The dark, bumpy, scarlike appearance of my wound was approximately 95% due to the DermaBond itself. The actual scar is probably less than an 1/8 of an inch thick and is currently sort of a medium-pink, likely to fade to skin color within a couple of years. Although scar tissue is basically the least of my worries, considering that my life is literally on the line here, I can&#8217;t lie: I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ll be able to bare sideboob with abandon by 2015.</p>
<p>Every time I leave USC, I pass a promise on the wall:</p>
<p><a href="http://killerboobies.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/diseaseofthepast-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1006" alt="USC's Promise" src="http://killerboobies.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/diseaseofthepast-copy.jpg?w=580&#038;h=580" width="580" height="580" /></a></p>
<p>I never fail to marvel at the hundreds of thousands of scientists who work every day to heal people like me. After my diagnosis, I read the book <em>The Emperor of All Maladies,</em> a biological history of cancer written by an oncologist. It was like picking at a scab &#8211; painful at times, but equally addicting &#8211; and it gave me an enormous appreciation for all that we&#8217;ve been able to achieve in the long history of cancer. Gordie read it too, and is considering getting a tattoo of a crab in my honor. You guys, I SWOON.</p>

<p>For the past three years, uprisings and revolutions have dominated the headlines. The Arab Spring and its spirit of freedom touched many African and Middle-Eastern countries, including Egypt, Libya and now Syria. The clash of class, power and ideas still throbs throughout the region. Its people seek to take back not only their country, but to take back their own story.</p>
<p>As Americans, we take our story and history for granted. Simply stating the word &#8220;history&#8221; brings to mind droning, bespectacled professors bearing dusty tomes. We don&#8217;t realize how much bigger history is than the classroom; in fact, it appears everyone but us sees that.</p>
<p>Muammar Qaddafi, when he rose to power in 1969, definitely knew the power of a nation&#8217;s story. And that story did not align with his own agenda. So he buried it. He buried it in the sand and in the wilderness, cutting off Libya from the rest of the world in the process. As knowledge would crack his vice-grip, his lackeys patrolled the classrooms, making sure the next generation committed to memory <em>The Green Book</em>, his tangled philosophy which displayed Libyan history in two stages: the dark days of Western imperialism and the enlightened age of the Brother Leader.</p>
<p>By the order of the Brother Leader, Libya&#8217;s rich cultural past faded away. Remnants of Italian and Roman architecture fell to be replaced by parking garages. The statue of Septimius Severus, Roman emperor who claimed Libya as his birthplace, disappeared from the main square, Martyr&#8217;s Square, in Tripoli. The glorious past of Libya as a cultural and economic crossroads was wiped away with the pen of a chaotic dictator.</p>
<p>But the people remember. They remember who they are and are not willing to give up their birthright &#8211; their identity and their potential.</p>
<p>Identity, which history teaches us, allows us to know who we are and where we came from. Without knowing where we come from, we cannot begin to understand where we are going. We, as Americans, are in danger of losing our history and identity; not at all because of a dictator, but because of our own lethargy.</p>
<p>History as a subject is almost a sham. In no other profession is the scholar&#8217;s knowledge and research so dramatically different from classroom lessons. Multitudes of myths and charming vignettes choke our history textbooks until they are no more meaningful than a packet of fairytales. Why do we still teach Columbus as the daring explorer, when in reality he was a seeker of riches and made no lasting contributions in discovery? Why do we look away from the massacres our ethno-centric ancestors (and brethren!) committed and still do commit to this very day? Why do we fail to acknowledge the truth of our nation&#8217;s mistakes (Vietnam being just one of the most glaringly obvious)?</p>
<p>More importantly, glossing over our nation&#8217;s true history keeps &#8220;the beast&#8221; asleep. The beast of the Republic, who desires to carve out equality for his fellow man, woman and child. Who desires for equal treatment between all races. Who desires his birthright of identity&#8230; and thus, the means to attain his true potential.</p>
<p>Because of this, I urge and challenge you to reconsider who you are and where you came from. Don&#8217;t depend on your elementary history lessons to do the job &#8211; they are as elementary as they are useless. Be skeptical. Observe. Forget about your few years on this terrestrial ball and consider: who are we, truly? Where have we been, and what have we done? And what can we now do, so that my brother, my sister, that all of humanity, may move forward?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I love coffee. Over the past couple of years my relationship with coffee has gone to a whole new level. We used to be just friends who would meet every once in a while and only when I was really tired. Also, I never really let coffee be itself around me. I always forced it to take on different appearances and flavors. I never allowed it to be who it really was. It was a very selfish relationship.</p>
<p>Things have changed now. I&#8217;ve repented of my ways and really feel like coffee and I have gotten to a level of our relationship that we can both be proud of.</p>
<p>Coffee represents something much stronger to me than flavor.</p>
<p>Even now as I write this I&#8217;m staring a 5lb bag of coffee that the coffee club I helped start (<a href="http://raleighcoffeeclub.com/" target="_blank">Raleigh Coffee Club</a>) purchased for an organization that works with the homeless and at-risk population here in Raleigh (<a href="http://lovewins.info/" target="_blank">Love Wins</a>). That&#8217;s the sort of thing coffee represents for me. Something much greater than a hot cup of black liquid.</p>
<p>It represents community. It represents hard work. It represents friendships. It represents love.</p>
<p>Every time I brew coffee at home, which takes me longer than most people, I&#8217;m not just trying to get caffeine in me&#8230;I&#8217;m participating in an act that not only supports people I care about, but supports employees and farmers I&#8217;ve never met, but because they are human I care about them.</p>
<p>It represents to local roasters that I&#8217;ve created such good friendships with. It represents the passion they have for their product.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why bad coffee makes me sad.</p>
<p>Because I know how good it can be. And I don&#8217;t mean bad just on the basis of flavor and taste, which I&#8217;ve had my fair share of, but also bad in the sense of where it comes from and how the workers are treated where it&#8217;s roasted and farmed. When you drink &#8220;bad&#8221; coffee you are supporting that.</p>
<p>And I say without shame, what you buy, eat, drink and do shows what you support.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t say you care about people and serve bad coffee. And again, I don&#8217;t just mean by flavor, because that is incredibly subjective&#8230;but having coffee that tastes good isn&#8217;t a bad idea either.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take this as a guilt trip, because I, by no means, buy every single thing that supports the right things&#8230;but I am making an effort.</p>
<p>Drink good coffee. Good tasting. Good supporting. Good.</p>

<p>Jim Harbaugh is the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.  This Sunday Jim is leading his team into the Superbowl, and on the opposing sidelines will be his oldest rival, his big brother John.  Jim and John Harbaugh have justifiably received a lot of attention these last two weeks.  The Harbaugh brothers have reached the pinnacle of the football world.  On Sunday they will share the biggest stage in the world.  Not too long ago, they shared a bedroom.</p>
<p>Jim and John Harbaugh were born 15 months apart.  They were fierce competitors growing up.  Gifted with more natural talent, Jim went farther as an athlete.  He was one game away from playing in the Superbowl as the quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts.  Yet here they are, meeting as head coaches at the top of their career.</p>
<p>There are other famous pairs of siblings in the sports world.  Peyton and Eli Manning, and Serena and Venus Williams are two pairs that have made some headlines.  In most of these matchups, I tend to root for the younger sibling.  I root for the little brother because I know how that feels.</p>
<div id="attachment_3091" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 266px"><a href="http://fatpastor.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/figure-four.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3091 " alt="My brother got pretty good at the Figure Four Leg Lock. " src="http://fatpastor.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/figure-four.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This not my brother and me, but anyone that thinks wresting is fake has never been trapped in a figure four leg lock. This happens to be Ric Flair on the right, playing my brother, and I believe Steve Austin on the left, playing me.</p></div>
<p><strong>My brother and I were born almost six years apart, so we weren’t exactly rivals.</strong>  My younger years were spent in perpetual servitude and resentment.  Yet at the same time, my older brother was always there.  He was someone for me to look up to and emulate.  He showed me how to swing a bat and a golf club.  He taught me how to put together a hot wheels racing tournament with my cars.  He taught me how to build lego cars, card houses, and do card tricks. He was even willing to demonstrate on me how to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT_(professional_wrestling)" target="_blank">D.D.T</a>, a Figure-four Leg Lock (pictured), and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBL89_n4lCc" target="_blank">Camel Clutch</a>.  In time, he became my best friend, and we stood next to each other at each of our weddings.  There was no thought to asking anyone else to be there for me in that moment.</p>
<p>My big brother was always there.  Sometimes he made me angry enough to cry or scream or attack with a ferocity I didn’t know I had.  One time he tickled me until I puked.   Most of the time he was teaching me something.  And he taught me so much, the important stuff and trivial stuff.  He taught me about girls and sarcasm and sports, and life.  He taught me to like chocolate and peanut butter ice cream, and the Macho Man, and Seinfeld.  My big brother is the smartest person I know, and there are few people with whom I laugh more.  He still teaches me stuff.  I still look up to him, even though he stopped being my “big brother” by the time I was about 15 years old.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why I usually cheer for Eli and Serena, and why I’ll probably be cheering for Jim</strong> (although he is kind of a lunatic, and I think I’d rather play for John).  I know a little of what Jim will feel when he looks across the field and sees John: pure love, admiration, and respect; and a desire to beat him that is pure and burns white-hot.</p>
<p>I didn’t beat my brother much growing up.  He was bigger than me, stronger than me, faster than me, and smarter than me.  It wasn’t until I was about 15 or 16 when some of those things started to change.  My brother and I had some epic basketball games over the years.  Some were Nerf games, where he had to play on his knees and there were no holds barred.  Some were on our back patio, where the flowers were out of bounds, the crack was the three-point line, and you had to take the ball back to the grill.</p>
<p><strong>The summer after I graduated high school was our last summer together</strong>.  That fall, he started his second year of medical school,  and I went off to college.  We played a lot of basketball games that summer.  One-on-one, to 30, winner’s outs, win by two.  There were a series of intense games.  I discovered I had a distinct advantage inside.  He was still quicker than me and a better all-around athlete.  All were close, but he won them all.  He had a winning streak that dated back to the early 1980s.  It was the kind of streak that the Harlem Globetrotters could envy.  Finally, The Streak ended.  It was an intense game.  We were well into the 30s, going back and forth.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan’s last shot with the Bulls is one of those plays that is ingrained into the collective memory of thousands of basketball fans.  I can still see it as vividly today as I did when he hit it to beat the Jazz for his sixth World Championship.  Jordan’s shot, and that memory, have the distinct advantage of having been shown over and over for years.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PRCTp57LQro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>The Shot was not recorded.  The only spectator was my Mom watching from the kitchen window.  Yet it was ingrained into my mind as clearly as any of my sports memories.  I have watched my teams win World Championships.  I jumped out of my skin as the Illini came back against Arizona.  I wept openly when the Paul Konerko clutched the last out of the 2005 World Series, and I still get goosebumps when I recall the Phillies beating the Devil Rays.</p>
<p>None of these moments are as important to me as the time I drove to my left toward the baseline, backed in a little, then pivoted to face the hoop, and took a little jumper leaning away from the basket from about five feet, just in front of the rock garden in the corner, and I beat my big brother.  <strong>It was, at the time, the greatest moment of my life</strong>.</p>
<p>Covered in sweat, drained, and tired, I simply pumped my fist.  We went inside.  Mom asked us, “Who won?”  I don’t think either of us answered with words.  We didn’t have to.</p>

<p>The other night our double bedroom doors burst wide open at 1:03 a.m., startling both hubby and I awake. From the light in the hallway, I could make out that the perpetrator of our early morning wake up call was our youngest son, Luke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Luke?&#8221; I asked, although I already knew the answer to this question.</p>
<p>Luke is our &#8220;good&#8221; sleeper. While his brother tosses and turns in the top bunk, Luke slumbers peacefully. He sleeps in cars, on planes, and in restaurants. When he&#8217;s down for the count, you usually don&#8217;t have to worry about him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a nightmare,&#8221; he replied as he quietly closed the door behind him with sudden politeness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? What about?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>As he began to climb onto our bed, he started recalling a dream wherein he was being chased in Roblox, which is some new video game he and his brother have been playing. He sat on the end of our already cramped, queen-size bed telling us about snakes (like Indiana Jones, he hates snakes) and death. He was visibly unsettled. Often he will just tell us about his nightmares, and then head back to his room. Sometimes, though, he needs real comfort. I could tell this was one of those times. Finished with his story, he finally crawled toward the top of the bed, pulled back the covers between me and hubby, and began to insinuate himself between us.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8230;sorry about this, guys,&#8221; he told us as he nestled in and began to settle down to get some more sleep.</p>
<p>When Luke was small, we experienced periods during which the only way he would fall asleep was in our bed. He slept in a bassinet in our room until he was four months old. He slept with us again off and on from 9 months to roughly 14 months. Sometimes he would fall asleep in our bed and we would transfer him. Sometimes we were so tired he ended up staying with us all night. When we would tell other people about Luke&#8217;s sleeping habits, most would cluck their tongues and tell us what a mistake we were making. We brushed it off.</p>
<p>In the house I grew up in, we were not allowed to sleep in my parents&#8217; room. Ever. It simply was not done. My parents gave us our own rooms, and they expected us to be in them. End of story. When we had our children, I assumed that our kids would have the same experience that I did. But, our kids are not like my sisters and me. Our kids have vivid imaginations and stressful dreams. Joe sleepwalks. Luke, if aroused from sleep by an unexpected noise, is often unable to calm down enough to go back to sleep. We do what we can to get sleep when we can, and sometimes that only occurs when we let the boys sleep in our room. It is what it is. We have made our peace with it.</p>
<p>I flipped around as Luke was in our bed the other night, unable to go back to sleep. I could not get comfortable because what was once 20 pounds is now 55 pounds and takes up a lot more room. I was about to resign myself to taking Luke&#8217;s place in his bed while letting him rest peacefully with his dad when, out of nowhere, the announcement came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go back to my own bed now,&#8221; he said, grabbing his stuffed animal and climbing carefully over his father and out of the bed.</p>
<p>I walked with him down the hall and tucked him back into his bunk bed underneath his sleeping brother to make sure he was truly ready to settle down. He pulled his stuffed Husky dog, Shasta, towards him, curled into a little ball on his side, and closed his eyes. He was calm, and I knew I would not be seeing him again until the morning.<br />
I&#8217;ve thought a lot about the way we &#8220;spoil&#8221; our kids by letting them do things like sleep in our room on occasion. Truth is that I don&#8217;t feel the slightest bit of remorse about it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s undermined their confidence or made them any less capable of handling their fears. Instead, I think it&#8217;s allowed them to believe that when things get scary, they can turn to us. When they feel confident and relaxed, they always move forward without us. Sure. We&#8217;ve definitely lost some sleep with restless boys in our bed or on an air mattress in our room, but I think the trade off of knowing that they know they can count on us is worth it. Besides, these days are numbered. Someday they will be out of the house, and I will miss hearing that door burst open in the middle of the night and knowing that they need me. I&#8217;ll catch up on my sleep then.</p>
