				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just did it moments ago. I do it every Friday morning. It’s generally before 7 am and I’m naked. I pee first, then close my eyes and mentally prepare. I tell myself, “It’s going to be good. It’s going to be okay.” Then, cringing with fear, I step on the scale.</p>
<p>No, I’m not going to tell you what it says. I may be confessional, but I have boundaries, people. But honestly, the number doesn’t really matter (except to me of course, where it HUGELY matters), what matters is how my entire mood changes by 7:01am. Depending on that flat glass surface with a digital screen, I’m either fabulous or frumpy. Happy or miserable.</p>
<p>Friday after Friday, I’d cringe, exhale as much breath out of my body and step. Often, the number is happy, smiling up at me. But lately, it’s been two to three pounds up – and when it’s up, I am most certainly down.</p>
<p>Three pounds may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me, or to anyone in my house who has to deal with my cranky, fat ass. Don’t judge me too harshly. I grew up surrounded by the body disorder disease &#8211; my mother has it, my aunt has it, my cousins have it. It seemed to affect every female member in my family.  Only my tall, skinny cousin seemed immune, living on a diet of Oreo cookies and chocolate bars, until well after her third child was born. Then, she too, succumbed.</p>
<p>I remember once, as a young girl, noting my mother’s strange skin color. “Carrots.” She explained. “It’s all the carrots.” I don’t want to know how many carrots you have to eat before you start to turn into one, but my mom was well on her way. I think she tried living on broccoli as well, but she always looked better in orange.</p>
<p>So after weeks of seeing a number that used to be reserved for “I had better be pregnant,” I did what anyone would do – I stopped going on the scale.  I know you thought I was going to say I went on a diet. Screw that. I eat basically vegetables and ice cream, and exercise a solid five days a week.  But something had to go, and it was the scale.</p>
<p>I had always been amazed by people who just ate without fear of the scale. Now I was one of them, and for the first few weeks, not having to see the number eased my mind somewhat. I felt a little more carefree, my clothes fit and for the first time in my memory, I wasn’t my scale’s bitch.  It was revelatory. It was enough to make you want to celebrate! With cake!</p>
<p>As you might guess, my celebratory liberation ended as soon I began to feel that subtle tightening around my waist, my favorite jeans no longer my favorite. I knew, but I didn’t want to believe. So I gathered my courage, got naked, exhaled and stepped. It was a big step, and even though I was no longer happy, at least I knew where I stood. 2lbs fatter than the fat that made me shun the scale. Damn.</p>
<p>As I contemplated my next steps – no more peanut butter, two cups of ice cream a day instead of three &#8211; a funny thing happened, I got used to the new number. My old fat became my new average. I hated it, but accepted it in the way I accepted another load of laundry, annoyed but resigned. I didn’t know what to make of this development. For a long while I became depressed, not at the number any longer, but that I had given up and accepted a newer version of myself – an older, fatter one.</p>
<p>Twenty odd years at the same weight (give or take those same up and down five pounds), and I will forever teeter on the edge of weight anxiety. I am always afraid Friday morning when I step on that scale, but I’ve learned my lesson. I will not cover my eyes like a two-year old. I will step. Knowing is better than living in denial. My coping skills, if not my body image, have strengthened over the years. I am more okay with who I am than I ever was. Even though my body is a little softer, I’ve got a tougher skin.</p>
<p>Besides, there’s always next Friday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love Christmas.  Love, love, love it.</p>
<p>I love that there is a radio station that starts playing Christmas music on December 1.</p>
<p>I love that the day after the Hallowe&#8217;en crap at the dollar store comes down &#8212; ho ho ho, the advantage of a properly timed Thanksgiving &#8212; the Christmas crap goes up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved Christmas, but throw in two little kids, even two kids who have pre-Santa levels of understanding of how the whole season works?  That&#8217;s gold, Jerry!  Gold!</p>
<p>Disclosure: I am also about as Christian as Seinfeld, at least in practice.  So my love is a total secular co-opting of a Christian celebration, which is in turn an overwriting of a pagan one, if we&#8217;re going to be intellectually honest about it.  P once wrote a fantastic song about this; I can&#8217;t remember all the lyrics but my favourite lines go something like:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Jesus the Nazarean</em><br />
<em>Was born on a bed of hay</em><br />
<em>The shepherds in the fields were feeding their flocks</em><br />
<em>So we know it was probably May</em></p>
<p>We appreciate narrative and parable but are largely an evidence-based family, you could say.</p>
<p>Still!  I love sweet-smelling trees and cookie exchanges and holiday cards and window displays and all that pepperminty B.S.</p>
<p>And so it was that I found myself making these on a relatively balmy late fall day in Toronto:</p>
<p><a href="http://joyandwoe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mirror_ornaments_for_christmas_tree.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1270" title="mirror_ornaments_for_christmas_tree" alt="" src="http://joyandwoe.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mirror_ornaments_for_christmas_tree.jpg" height="816" width="610" /></a></p>
<p>I should probably give them some swanky name like &#8220;Holiday Sparklers&#8221; or &#8220;Twinkle Bits&#8221; or &#8220;Disco Diamonds&#8221; but then I wouldn&#8217;t have any names left for my boobs.</p>
<p>What they are are small (1 cm square) mirrored pieces of glass, glued together with a ribbon betwixt (I&#8217;ll stop talking about my boobs ANY DAY NOW).</p>
<p>To make your own, you&#8217;ll need these mirrored bits, (very) thin ribbon and a strong adhesive.  I started off with <a href="http://www.weldbond.com/" target="_blank">Weldbond</a>, which <span style="text-decoration:underline;">did</span> work but the consistency was like white glue and required a lot of painting and waiting.  When I switched over to the <a href="http://www.eclecticproducts.com/household.htm" target="_blank">Goop</a> that P recommended, the process was more smearing and squishing, which I found infinitely more satisfying.  I suppose you could use a hot glue gun, too, if you&#8217;re special enough to own one that isn&#8217;t at this precise moment in time filled with once-lava-hot, now-rock-solid glue.</p>
<p>Then, when the time comes, fill your tree with lights, then these little puppies (ha ha, boobs!) and it&#8217;s like you filled your tree with about a billion more lights than you did, you cheap bastard.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m only five minutes into a treadmill run¹ and already the first bead of sweat is trickling its little rivulet down my forehead.  I swipe at it with the back of my hand, wipe my hand on a towel, then crank up my pace.²</p>
<div id="attachment_1427" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://profmomesq.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/treadmill.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1427" title="treadmill" src="http://profmomesq.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/treadmill.png?w=300&#038;h=237" alt="C &amp; C Music Factory - I heed your musical command" width="300" height="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s weird.  I&#8217;m so thin in pictures &#8230;</p></div>
<p>A ridiculously tall, frustratingly thin, and enviously athletic woman steps astride the treadmill next to me.  We will hence forth refer to her as &#8220;The Villain.&#8221;  The Villain unwittingly stepped into the battle zone.  We are about to battle to the death.  Or, at least until I pass out.</p>
<p>As she escalates her treadmill to a jog, I sneak a sidelong glance at her treadmill readings.  She&#8217;s set at 6.0.  Puh-lease.  She&#8217;s, like, seven feet tall.  By my mathematical calculations†, 5.3 is an equivalent pace for my five-foot-two-inch frame.  Now, we run.  The goal?  Stay on the treadmill longer than the Villain.  Preferably in an upright position.</p>
<p><em>Ten minutes later &#8230;</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sweating profusely.  My bottle of water is within arm&#8217;s reach and taunting me &#8212; seducing me with its siren song of cool refreshment.</p>
<p>I.  will.  not.  yield.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.  I could try to drink while running at this pace, but I&#8217;ve made this mistake before.  11:30-minute pace = water anywhere but in my mouth.  Treadmill neighbors are not generally appreciative of this.</p>
<p><em>Ten more minutes later &#8230;</em></p>
<p>The Villain drops her pace to a brisk walk.  HA! I elevate my treadmill to a 2.0 incline.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://profmomesq.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/hey-treadmill-neighbor-were-totally-racing-im-winning/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Hy8N1J82Q_Y/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
As the room starts to blur (either because I&#8217;m slipping into unconsciousness or because there are four gallons of sweat in my eyes), I start bargaining with myself.  <em>Just make it through this song on your iPod, then you can lower the treadmill back to flat.  One song.  4 minutes or less.  You can do it.  Don&#8217;t be a sissy!! What would Jay-Z say if he was here right now?  Huh?</em></p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://profmomesq.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/hey-treadmill-neighbor-were-totally-racing-im-winning/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/kBnJnXq4YQ8/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Before my song ends, the Villain starts running again.  6.5 now.  <em>She&#8217;s totally cheating.  She&#8217;s probably taking performance enhancing substances.  Someone urine test this bitch.</em></p>
<p>Song over.  (<em>Yeah.  Great idea, genius.  Put the <strong>extended </strong>version on your playlist.</em>) I lower my elevation and crank the speed up to 5.5.  I&#8217;m practically flying!³<em>  </em>My lungs feel like they&#8217;re in a vice, my calf muscles are complaining to my quads, and my quads are complaining to my hips.  My hips are bypassing my spine and sending an SOS directly to the part of my brain that supposedly allows for reason and common sense.  <em>We&#8217;re sorry.  All circuits are busy now.  Please try your call again later</em>.</p>
<p>I.  Will.  Not.  Yield.</p>
<p>The Villain isn&#8217;t even sweating; she&#8217;s <em>glistening </em>from the slight moisture emanating from her flawlessly tan skin.°  I am red as a Maine lobster immersed in a boiling kettle.  The sweat and oil oozing from my facial pores may as well be a side of butter.</p>
<p>I.  WILL.  NOT.  YIELD.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://profmomesq.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/hey-treadmill-neighbor-were-totally-racing-im-winning/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/H2KYzeT_lGY/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span><br />
I slow down to 4.3.  I feign iPod troubles.  I gulp down the sweet, clear nectar that is ice water.  I do a Tanya Harding shoelace check. Karma deals me a vicious blow by turning my eyes to the clock &#8211; an act I&#8217;ve assiduously tried to avoid. I learn I&#8217;m 30 minutes into the death-match.  The Villain is running again. I decide she&#8217;s not human.</p>
<p>I turn the treadmill back up to 5.3 and try to ignore the pain.  I focus on the shiny bald head of a man using a stationary bike in front of me.  I practice my Lamaze breathing (because this is the <em>only</em> time that shit EVER works).</p>
<p>Two minutes pass.</p>
<p><em>Dammit!  Why is she still running?  WHHHHHHHYYYYYYY?</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1431" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 694px"><a href="http://profmomesq.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gasp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1431" title="gasp" src="http://profmomesq.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gasp.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="397" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Why won&#8217;t she stop running?!  Can&#8217;t she see my fat is CRYING?  CRYING!</p></div>
<p>Then, just as I think I cannot go one step farther &#8230; as my muscles ache and cramp and scream profanities &#8230; as my head spins, and the guy on the spin bike in front of me turns into 12 guys on spin bikes on front of me &#8230; the Villain does the unthinkable.  She stops.</p>
<p>I AM VICTORIOUS!  I AM THE WINNER.  I AM A GOLDEN GOD!<br />
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://profmomesq.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/hey-treadmill-neighbor-were-totally-racing-im-winning/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/yYz3E4MckSw/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>I keep running just to be sure the Villain didn&#8217;t slink off for a drink of water only to return and mock me. When I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s gone, I touch the treadmill screen to stop it and look at my stats.  I am stunned.  I ran 4.67 miles in less than 60 minutes.</p>
<p>I step off the treadmill and feel the same weird sensation you get when you exit a roller coaster.  I am elated.  I am pumped full of adrenaline and endorphins.  I am exhausted in a way that feels infinitely good and stupidly painful.  I am so full of WIN, I would need to pee if I hadn&#8217;t already sweated out twice my body weight in water.</p>
<p>Never you mind that I went home and ate a Dove bar and four extra-strength Advil.  There will be another leggy treadmill victim tomorrow.  And, I will be ready.</p>
<p>As soon as someone helps me off this couch.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>¹By &#8220;run,&#8221; some people mean a fast-paced forward momentum that moves a person about a mile in eight or nine minutes.  Personally, I prefer a much looser definition for &#8220;run,&#8221; which includes forward momentum that&#8217;s slightly faster than &#8230; say &#8230; walking.</p>
<p>²Hey, there&#8217;s a serious difference between a 12-minute mile and an 11:50-minute mile.  Just ask my knees.</p>
<p>³Seriously, the breeze was flowing through my hair.  It <em>might </em>have been because the air condition vent was right above me, but I think not.</p>
<p>†I totally made this up.</p>
<p>ºFake &#8216;n bake.  I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;.</p>

Baited into empty white chapels<br />
Where someone speaks<br />
Who isn&#8217;t there<br />
And no one else responds<br />
Yet, in dropping pins<br />
And hurricane force winds<br />
Subliminal messages evacuate lungs<br />
Like ships<br />
Squeezed through a channel mouth<br />
Outbound</p>
<p>Someday, maybe, our dotted lines<br />
Undrawn on maps penned by time<br />
Will meet<br />
Where x marks<br />
An island of thought<br />
Everyone there is you<br />
Each driving small cars<br />
Wearing tan skirts, black shades<br />
And a fondness for smiles<br />
Something akin to babies<br />
Who have not learned<br />
To cringe<br />
To reason sensibly<br />
Or to bend beneath the backwash<br />
Of public opinions</p>
<p>There we are&#8211;found<br />
A stuttering ode<br />
To all things bright and beautiful<br />
Cadence like chocolate poured<br />
Softly over pursed lips<br />
And frost bitten fingertips<br />
A counterplot<br />
To rule a world once destroyed<br />
Tyrants abolished<br />
Forsaken deserts of thought<br />
Now holding cautiously in palm<br />
A sea of dreams beneath<br />
Where us<br />
And nothing<br />
Meet</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Gething:</strong>  </em>Thank you for agreeing to this interview.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>The pleasure&#8217;s all mine; thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:  </em></strong>My interest is in the controversy you have stirred in the literary world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon: </em> </strong>I&#8217;ve done no such thing; those who <i>don’t</i> use me seem to be causing all the fuss.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:</em></strong>  That’s my point. Many modern writers, in particular <a title="Oprah-McCarthy interview" href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/Cormac-McCarthy-on-James-Joyce-and-Punctuation-Video" target="_blank">Cormac McCarthy in his interview with Oprah</a>, have called for your extinction. What did you do to create such a virulent reaction?</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:</em></strong>  Ask Mr. McCarthy; to my knowledge I did nothing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:</em>  </strong>But you must have done something. He’s not calling for the elimination of the period or the question mark, or even the colon in certain instances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:</em>  </strong>No, he seems to have targeted me in particular…and the exclamation mark; I don’t know what we did to deserve such enmity. My purpose seems quite clear—to connect two or more independent clauses more closely than ones separated by a period. I believe there’s still a place for that in the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:</em></strong>  You do have some supporters, only—let’s be honest—not too many users today.</p>
<p><em><strong>Semicolon:  </strong></em>Not true! A very lucid writer <a title="NYT semi-colons" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/semicolons-a-love-story/" target="_blank">recently defended me</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gething:</strong>  </em>But he also quoted Vonnegut who said that semicolons are &#8220;transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>That&#8217;s a gross exaggeration. Henry James adored me; incidentally, many consider him the paradigm of subtlety; he was certainly more subtle than that Vonnegut fellow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:</em>  </strong>Yes, but there is a modern sentiment that long sentences connected by semicolons obscure rather than make thoughts clearer. I sometimes feel that way about Henry James. Modern writers—journalists, novelists, poets—they tend to shun you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>Well, what do you expect from poets?</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:  </em></strong>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:</em></strong>  They are barbarians; they hardly use any punctuation at all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething: </em></strong> Doesn&#8217;t that suggest that meaning can be received without punctuation? Its absence might even create interesting double meanings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>You mean vagueness and ambiguity. Perhaps that’s modern, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:  </em></strong>McCarthy says, if you write clearly you don’t need more than a few punctuation marks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>Then why use any at all? Why not write so clearly that periods and commas can be avoided as well? Isn’t punctuation simply a convention to help the reader comprehend the writer’s meaning? What if you presented these words without punctuation?</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:  </em></strong>I don’t know. Let’s see:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then why use any at all Why not write so clearly that periods and commas can be avoided as well Isnt punctuation simply a convention to help the reader comprehend the writers meaning What if you presented these words without punctuation</p></blockquote>
<p>A few awkward spots but I might get used to it with practice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>I suppose you’ll be calling for the elimination of capital letters next.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:</em>  </strong>You sound bitter.<a href="http://tomgething.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/6nmwc6.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-823" title="sad semi-colon" alt="" src="http://tomgething.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/6nmwc6.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=256" height="256" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>I <em>am</em> bitter. I feel angry; I feel hurt; I feel betrayed. In speech we use pauses and intonation to convey meaning. Why can’t we rely on perfectly acceptable conventions of punctuation, including the semicolon, for the printed word?</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething:  </em></strong>You make a good case, but it seems convention is dictated by usage not by argument. I fear for your longevity.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:  </em></strong>Hmm!</p>
<p><strong><em>Gething: </em></strong> You know, my sister quit dating a guy who used semicolons; she said he never knew when to stop.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semicolon:</em>  </strong>Ha-ha.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gething:</strong>  </em>Just trying to make you feel better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Semicolon: </strong></em> Then start by using me more; only please, don&#8217;t abuse me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If most folk were asked to name a list of the world’s most influential statesmen, Recep Erdogan’s would hardly trip off the tongue.</p>
<p>Yet, as boss of the religiously orthodox AK Justice &amp; Development Party and Turkish Prime Minister for nine years, he heads one of the world’s few, fully-fledged Islamic democracies (and a NATO member), so his is a siren voice worth listening to every once in a while.</p>
<p>Erdogan’s had his moments of controversy, notably refusing to fess up to Turkey’s genocide of a million Armenians in 1915. And his backing of the misnamed ‘Peace Flotillas’, crewed by the usual, useful idiots – which tried to breach Israel’s maritime blockade of Gaza, in situ to stop Iranian munitions reaching the Hamas terrorist-run enclave – went down like a manky kebab with most of his Western friends.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, following Turkey’s long experience of Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, Erdogan knows much about how and why the region has disintegrated into the powder keg it is today and he can read the ominous runes better than most.</p>
<p>Which is why he recently gave the imperiously inept United Nations – especially the blustering, disjointed Security Council – a piece of his mind, singling out Syria in particular and charging, ‘The UN is losing its credibility by turning a blind eye to what is happening [there]. It is a human tragedy.’</p>
<p>With countless refuges escaping the loathsome Assad regime to camps over the Turkish border and Syrian artillery firing into Turkey – five Turks died and 11 were injured in a recent fusillade – Erdogan is articulating what the West has thought of the discredited UN for decades, but has been too timid to say so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s ordered his army to retaliate, if further provoked, amid fears the Assads, prompted by the Armageddon-seekers of neighbouring Iran, could escalate the conflict into an all-out, Shiite-versus-Sunni clash – not dissimilar to how ‘a little local difficulty’ in the Balkans, in 1914, ignited the Great War.</p>
<p>Syria, though, is only the tip of an explosive sand-dune and there’s no doubt Erdogan has an agenda to reprise Ottoman-style hegemony over the Middle East.</p>
<p>But he’s right in fingering UN culpability – and the botched peace mission of ex-UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to Damascus – in allowing the inter-religious civil war, said to have cost tens of thousands of lives to date, to rage on.</p>
<div id="attachment_905" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 357px"><a href="http://hughash.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/erdogan.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-905" title="erdogan" alt="" src="http://hughash.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/erdogan.jpg?w=347&#038;h=206" height="206" width="347" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">UN KNOCKER: Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan says the organisation is &#8216;losing credibility&#8217;</p></div>
<p>In reality, the UN General Assembly has become a soapbox for fully paid-up members of the nutters’ club, like Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>
<p>And the Security Council couldn’t sort out a scrap in a kindergarten schoolyard, while Putin’s Russia supports the indefensible Assads and amoral China couldn’t care a toss, so long as it can continue selling arms to anyone who pays.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the odd moments the UN does secure a flimsy degree of unanimity, its ineffectual, ‘Blue Helmet’ peacekeepers too often turn a mess into a downright catastrophe.</p>
<p>Witness the cock-ups they contrived in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, not forgetting their abject failure to police the Second Congo War or intervene in the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre.</p>
<p>Failure, in fact, seems to be what the UN excels at when it sends in its bovver boys. Because, among other malfunctions, they failed to deliver food to the starving in strife-torn Somalia and prevent mass murder in Darfur.</p>
<p>And the peacekeepers haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory in other ways, having been accused of corruption, black-marketeering, drug-running and multiple sex crimes during missions to the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan, what’s now South Sudan, Burundi and Cote d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>Not that those at the very crest of the UN always set a shining example of probity.</p>
<div id="attachment_914" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 389px"><a href="http://hughash.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/annan3.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-914" title="Annan" alt="" src="http://hughash.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/annan3.jpg?w=379&#038;h=242" height="242" width="379" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">UN FAILURE? As Secretary General, Kofi Annan was rebuked in probe into the 2005 Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal that implicated his son, Kojo</p></div>
<p>Remember the 2005 probe into the Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal – said to have personally netted Saddam Hussein $1.7-billion in kickbacks – when holier-than-thou Secretary General Annan was rebuked over suspicions he steered lucrative contracts to a Swiss company that coincidentally employed his son, Kojo.</p>
<p>As counterpoints, the UN has sired some outstanding agencies under its umbrella, notably the World Health Organisation (WHO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), Educational Scientific &amp; Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the International Children’s Fund (UNICEF).</p>
<p>Shamefully, the same can’t be said of the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Hijacked by West-bashers and harboring a vicious obsession against democratic Israel, it was once chaired by Gaddafi-ruled Libya and even founded a ‘human rights prize’ named in honour of the late, unlamented, homicidal maniac (how daft can the UN get, I hear you ask).</p>
<p>So Erdogan’s accusation that the organisation charged with bolstering world piece ‘is losing its credibility’ is somewhat passé. Because it already has.</p>
<p>Now comprising an unwieldy 193 nations, many with historic animus toward one another, maybe it’s high time the UN reminded itself of its original charter commitments – especially the wee bit which states, ‘<i>Human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear</i>.’</p>
<p>Because if members refuse to adhere to those noble principles, they shouldn’t be in the club in the first place – or the United Nations is a misnomer and not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Take your pick, as 60s TV quizmaster Michael Miles would say.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://whiskeyintheam.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tiramisu-layer-cake-recipe.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-164 aligncenter" title="Tiramisu-Layer-Cake-Recipe" alt="" src="http://whiskeyintheam.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tiramisu-layer-cake-recipe.jpg?w=300&#038;h=266" height="266" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>In an effort to keep you in tip-top boyfriend/girlfriend shape, I have decided to share an extra special page out of my cookbook with all ya’ll. This one is <i>guaranteed </i>to please and its super-duper easy…and it’s made from a box cake mix (I hate myself), liquor and heavy cream.What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>The filling is actually more than enough to coat the cake in a nice healthy layer of saturated fat, but I like to make a little (lots) extra so I can eat it directly off the beaters and cry about my life choices.</p>
<p>Note:  This recipe calls for three 9” round/square/I don’t give two shits what shape baking pans. I understand that since you are reading this (and probably are domestically disabled) you most likely don’t have three baking pans lying around. You obviously can use the same pan over and over, but it’s going to take a hell of a lot longer to bake all three cakes and let them cool. However, you can utilize this time to cyber stalk your “future husband” and hate text that mean girl from work who makes fun of your love handles. I like to pretend that I’m going to do sit-ups until the timer goes off, but I really end up watching Toddlers &amp; Tiaras and reliving pageant days in the fetal position and crying into my Miss Beaumont County sashes.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span></b></p>
<p><b>Cake</b></p>
<p>1 (18.25 ounce) package moist white cake mix</p>
<p>1 teaspoon instant coffee powder</p>
<p>1/4 cup brewed coffee (I like to steal a cup from work)</p>
<p>1 tablespoon Kahlua</p>
<p><b>Filling</b></p>
<p>2 (8 ounce) container cream cheese (and none of this ‘reduced fat’ bullshit)</p>
<p>1 cup powdered sugar</p>
<p>4 tablespoons Kahlua</p>
<p><b>Frosting</b></p>
<p>2 cups heavy cream</p>
<p>1/4 cup powdered sugar</p>
<p>2 tablespoons Kahlua</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Directions</span></b></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</p>
<ol>
<li>In an effort to make this extremely easy, line your 9”round pans with tin foil (stay with me) and spray them down with a nice heavy coat of non-stick cooking spray. (The tinfoil lining is super awesome, because after the cakes have finished baking, you just pull them out by the foil edges, peel it off, let them cool and you don’t have to worry about the cake sticking to the pan. <i>Genius</i>.)</li>
<li>Prepare the cake mix according to package directions. Divide two thirds of batter between 2 tin foil lined pans pans.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, stir instant coffee into remaining batter; pour into remaining lined pan.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then lift out the cake by the tinfoil edges and transfer to a wire rack cool completely. Peel off the tin foil and burn yourself alive with the molten lava steam that rises from cake.</li>
<li>In a measuring cup, combine brewed coffee and 1 tablespoon Kahlua; set aside.</li>
<li>To make the filling: In a small bowl, using an electric mixer set on low speed, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons Kahlua; beat just until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</li>
<li>To make the frosting: In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat the cream, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons Kahlua until stiff (that’s what she said). Fold 1/2 cup of cream mixture into filling mixture.</li>
<li>To assemble the cake: Place one plain cake layer on a serving plate. Using a thin skewer (handle of a wooden spoon/finger/sharpie), poke holes in cake, about 1 inch apart. Pour one third of reserved coffee mixture over cake, and then spread with half of the filling mixture. Top with coffee-flavored cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour another third of the coffee mixture over the second layer and spread with the remaining filling. Top with remaining cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour remaining coffee mixture on top. Spread sides and top of cake with frosting.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are feeling extra fancy, you can crush up some semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkle it around the edges, or slice up a few strawberries and place them on top. Really, the world is your oyster. Go nuts.</p>
<p>Double high-fives if you completed this recipe without wanting to slit your wrists.</p>
<p>Love you, meant it.</p>
<p>Stephanie</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>this week&#8217;s wordpress challenge is to post about color (details can be found <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/weekly-writing-challenge-a-splash-of-color/">here</a>). so here is wee bee&#8217;s response:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://weebeebird.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/yourdogprobablydoesntappreciatemodernart.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-282" title="yourdogprobablydoesntappreciatemodernart" alt="" src="http://weebeebird.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/yourdogprobablydoesntappreciatemodernart.png?w=819&#038;h=461" height="461" width="819" /></a></p>
<p>color blindness comes in many forms. there is your total color blindness, where the world is painted in hues of grey, but that is fairly rare for humans. a human with this type of color blindness, likely, is a monochromat (possessing only one color-picking-up cone in their eyes), as opposed to the usual trichromats of the rest of us normal-color vision people. more common is partial color blindness, which in humans can come in either blue-yellow or red-green vision deficiency form (there are multiple different subtypes of malfunctioning cones which can result in either of these deficiencies but they take a lot more explaining and are more boring than wee bee cares to get into). There is also the odd result of a number of human females actually being tetrachromats (they have four cones, one more than usual) &#8211; but that is just an interesting aside.</p>
<p>most humans have three cones, and a few (mostly males) of us have a form of color confusion. wee bee has a very old friend with such a color confusion, red-green color blindness, something which he has in common with your dog.</p>
<p>dogs are not totally color blind. just like wee bee&#8217;s friend, they are simply a bit color retarded. this, by the way, is totally pc &#8211; a person with an intellectual deficiency is mentally retarded, and a person with partial color blindness is not &#8220;color blind&#8221; in the same way that a mentally retarded adult is not comatose. in fact, after knowing this color retarded person for a very long time, wee bee has learned that it would probably be a lot less confusing to just have total, monochromatic color blindness. but no, dogs are red-green color blind, and from her color retarded friend, wee bee would like to share with you what the world of your dog might be like in terms of color.</p>
<p>likely, your dog has a strong affinity for the color blue, and probably yellow, as these are really the only two colors your dog can see. wee bee&#8217;s old, color retarded friend loves blue. the only colors she has ever seen him wear other than blue are white and black. he wears blue shirts, blue pants, blue tennis shoes, blue shorts, even blue socks underneath sandals with light blue straps and dark blue soles. the red-green color blind do not really &#8220;see&#8221; red and green.</p>
<p>sorry christmas. bye santa.</p>
<p>with a lot of effort, the red-green blind can sometimes guess with a fair amount of accuracy what another specific color is, but more likely their guess is going to be wrong. wee bee&#8217;s old, color retarded friend sees wee bee&#8217;s hair as very definitely brown, though it is red. the brighter the red she dyes it, the more he thinks it is brown.</p>
<p>if you&#8217;re going to buy a ball to play some catch, do not go with the red ball. be nice to your dog and go with a blue or yellow ball.</p>
<p>to your dog, a turtle may as well be red. this is how wee bee&#8217;s color retarded friend was discovered to be color retarded. he was having coloring time in grade school and kept coloring the turtles red. if your dog is anything like wee bee&#8217;s friend, your dog might be obstinately opposed to the notion that a turtle is not red at all.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s why you go with a blue ball. when red and green are indistinguishable, your dog is not <em>mentally</em> retarded simply because it cannot find that red ball in a sea of green &#8211; it is color retarded and the ball and grass simply look the same.</p>
<p>your dog also likely has an under-appreciation for art in general, especially as you get farther away from realism. humans use color to convey meaning in art; think picasso&#8217;s blue period. we attach emotional meaning to specific colors. so as you travel down the historical line of art and things begin to shift into more color-focused, emotional representations rather than realist-style portraits and landscapes, the emotional undertones can be lost on the color retarded.</p>
<p>when taken once to a &#8220;modern&#8221; modern art exhibit, you know the kind where it is nothing but colors and lines and dots and that sort of thing, wee bee&#8217;s friend was convinced for many days that he was missing an actual physical <em>thing </em>in the artworks &#8211; he thought maybe there were red people painted in there somewhere on the giant, completely red canvas. he assumed that he was unable to see the artwork properly, which had happened before with other artwork, and when he was finally told that no, that&#8217;s all there is &#8211; these colors on giant canvases &#8211; it was very clear that he had no appreciation for this sort of thing whatsoever. like many people even able to see the colors &#8220;properly,&#8221; he said &#8220;i don&#8217;t get it&#8221; and felt that this type of artwork was not even artwork.</p>
<p>what he didn&#8217;t realize though, during that time when he thought he was missing something in the artwork itself, was that he was right &#8211; only it wasn&#8217;t physical. humans, throughout our lives, attach sometimes quite specific emotional meanings to colors. some of this is rooted in our neurobiology &#8211; red is the color of blood, the color of danger, it feels daring and revs up our heart. green, as wee bee was once told in a neuroscience course, is the &#8220;easiest&#8221; color for a typical human to see. it is easy on our eyes, as our cones are more sensitive to the green wavelength of light. but it is also the color of summer, of birth, of a perfect lawn and barren trees regaining their leaves.</p>
<p>throughout our lives, our autonomic nervous and emotional systems are cataloging these colors into our minds so that when we approach a piece of art, we feel what might not otherwise be painted expressly through color alone.</p>
<p>so to your color retarded dog, a dog painted in bright red does not feel demonic. does not scream &#8220;cujo.&#8221; modern art isn&#8217;t for everyone, but it definitely isn&#8217;t for the color retarded either. don&#8217;t expect your dog to appreciate an andy-warhol-esque rendition of its dog self. if it could, your dog would probably shrug its shoulders and say &#8220;what&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221;</p>
