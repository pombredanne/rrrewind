			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/mposky/listenbecky.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="800" /></p>
<p>When we were all young, everyone kept telling us that we could be whatever we wanted when we grew up. After all, we lived in America and that was the one place in the whole world where you could achieve your dreams. This was the land of milk and honey.  People flocked here for the multitude of opportunities and just being born here virtually guaranteed you a life other countries could only dream of.  The way people talked about it, you&#8217;d have thought the streets were paved with gold or something.</p>
<p>Now all I hear are reports about how Americans need to be trained for the jobs available in the market.  Nobody is, or ever should have been, telling children, &#8220;when you grow up, you can be whatever you want.&#8221;  What they should have said is, &#8220;When you grow up, you can get a job in mediocrity if you take out loans to go to school and, after fifty years, maybe you can have a fairly comfortable life if your expectations aren&#8217;t too high.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell my kids that if they want to achieve their dreams they&#8217;re going to have to lower the bar or take that bar and use it to fight off everything that wants to steal their dreams away from them.  I will teach them to make hard decisions and push them to the brink of insanity so they are hardened and ready for the world.  If I had twins, I would force one to kill the other in order to double its strength.  My children would be known to foam at mouth and bark at unfamiliar sounds.  I will have found them all their first jobs well before adolescence. It would be at a foundry and the low survival-rate would further distill my brood.</p>
<p>Spankings would be distributed completely at random.  They would understand the horrible arbitrary nature of existence early on.  One day I would show up with a puppy and a wheel with numbers on it.  I would make the youngest spin the wheel and whatever number it landed on would be the number of years the dog would be allowed to live.  Upon it&#8217;s &#8220;death date&#8221; I would take the dog to <a href="http://timhodgson.wordpress.com/">my friend Tim&#8217;s</a> house where it would continue to live out its life in secret.  The children would never be told the truth and each Christmas they would get a postcard from the dog&#8217;s ghost. Their hate for me would grow until, eventually, one of them would attempt to destroy me. This child would be forever my favorite and everything I possess would become theirs upon my death.  Until that time, they would be cast out into society and immediately become estranged from me.  Frankly, I can see no other way for a child to achieve their dreams in the new American job market.  I&#8217;ve been told that the recession is over but that the economy would never be the same.  After a long hard labor, our country has bared-down and pushed out a stillbirth, silent and useless.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/mposky/ghostdogpostcard-1.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="419" /></p>
<p>Despite the continuously high unemployment rate, some of us managed to acquire jobs in our respective fields.  A few of us are even prospering and enjoying ourselves, while many more are taking what they can get and working for the sole purpose of survival.  I know that, by definition, survival is living but I bet I could still argue a pretty good case against it.  We are all so ready to pat ourselves on the back as hard as we can and for what?  We weathered the storm and have nothing to show for it.  We idolize the past like it&#8217;s so mythically far away or long ago that it is completely out of reach.  We&#8217;ve ignored its lessons and have settled upon a lesser future than we deserve.  Our parents and grandparents lived the dream and rode rockets to the moon while we&#8217;re selling off the space program like a beat up old car.  There will be no missions beyond the sky for us.  It has been decided that it&#8217;s just not practical anymore.</p>
<p>It was never practical.  None of it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smalltownsmalltimes.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3704" title="011" src="http://smalltownsmalltimes.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/011.jpg?w=251&#038;h=300" alt="" width="251" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the final stretch of summer: August, the month in which boredom crescendos and humidity settles into the corners of my house, exposing odors that are decades old.</p>
<p>Last week we woke up to a bat in the corner of our bedroom. He&#8217;d been circling our sleeping heads until our cats woke us up chasing him. Now I wake up at night whenever the cats make a noise. My sleep is sweaty and fragmented. I crave coffee all day.</p>
<p>Also last week, I was officially hired to freelance on a marketing project. I&#8217;m pulsing with neediness to exceed expectations. The project outcome relies on research that has yet be conducted, which makes things dicey and unknown. I&#8217;m pacing, in my damp house, giving myself little pep talks and instruction.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been blogging because I&#8217;ve been directing my energy at my kids and working and the return of bat. But lately, occasional lessons have poked through. I feel like I should sit down and write about them, but I&#8217;m self-conscious. My fingers have lost their ability to translate. My brain is sluggish and critical.</p>
<p>*******************************</p>
<p>Several weeks ago we went blueberry picking. It was sunny and beautiful out, so I pulled my daughters off their summer drug of &#8220;Toddlers and Tiaras&#8221; and threw them into the Honda. With windows open, we drove to a berry farm near a lake. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Sandy Bottom Farm,&#8221; a name that conjures up gritty bathing suits and sunburned cheeks.</p>
<p>As we walked with buckets into the rows of blueberry bushes, I delighted in the summer scenery: blue skies, humming cicadas and every so often, a cool breeze calming our skin. We started the pulling at berries and dropping them into buckets, but despite the lazy day, I felt an urgent need to finish. I would grab one or two handfuls off one tree and then move on to find a better tree. Rather than stand quietly and pick, I kept wandering in search of a better bush.</p>
<p>Off in the distance I could hear other people yelling out things like, &#8220;Hey, guys, I found the <em>best</em> bush,&#8221; and I&#8217;d feel myself getting competitive and anxious &#8212; was there a better bush that I was missing? My youngest daughter ran off to investigate, unable to stick with one bush for more than three or four berries. I started to sweat. I swatted at bees, growing annoyed.<em> I</em> needed to find the best bush.</p>
<p>Then I came across my eldest daughter. She was still standing in the shade of her first bush, calmly picking it clean. She was practically humming. Her fingers were blue. Her bucket was full.</p>
<p>Okay, yes &#8212; the metaphor is obvious, but I give myself credit for noting it. I can&#8217;t keep flailing around, imagining better bushes. I need to relish this time, standing still and filling my bucket with what&#8217;s in front of me.</p>
<p>So with that: cheers to this last week of summer vacation &#8212; to lazy mornings, ice cream, good books, long naps, sunburned shoulders and sandy bottoms.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 6!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re almost to the end of my photos from the trip. Hope you enjoyed looking through the photos as much as I enjoyed taking them. :)</p>
<p>Jay and I drove to the <a href="http://www.hearstcastle.com/" target="_blank">Hearst Castle</a> in San Simeon, Calif., Wednesday morning for a tour. The castle, also known as &#8220;La Cuesta Encantada&#8221; (Enchanted hill) was built by William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951), newspaper magnate and publisher.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1238" title="Day6_1" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_1.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>The estate is more than 90,000 square feet. There are a total of 56 bedrooms, 41 fireplaces and 61 bathrooms including the three guest houses and the main house.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" title="Day6_2" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_2.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>Pictured above on the left is a sitting area in the assembly room in the main house, Casa Grande. Hearst and his architect Julia Morgan worked on the castle from 1919 to 1947. When Hearst died in 1951, the Hearst corporation donated the property to the state and it is now maintained as a California state park and art museum.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" title="Day6_3" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_3.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>The dining room was massive. Hearst was a &#8220;ceiling collector&#8221; and would buy centuries-old ceilings that dictated the size of the rooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" title="Day6_4" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_4.jpg?w=497&#038;h=273" alt="" width="497" height="273" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" title="Day6_5" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_5.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>The outdoor Neptune pool holds 345,000 gallons. Hearst actually tore down and rebuilt this pool three times during construction because he couldn&#8217;t make up his mind on a size.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" title="1106_Day6_001" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_001.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Casa Grande is 60,645 square feet. Hearst hosted many notable figures of his time like Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant and Winston Churchill.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" title="Day6_6" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_6.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>I have to give it to him &#8211; he picked a nice location with great views to build his cozy cabin.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" title="Day6_7" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_7.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" title="1106_Day6_002" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_002.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>The 10-feet-deep indoor Roman Pool is tiled from top to bottom and is 1,665 square feet. This was probably the most impressive room we got to see!</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" title="Day6_8" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_8.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>We really enjoyed our tour of the castle, and we were even allowed to explore the castle grounds afterward for as long as we liked. We heard that this had not been allowed in the last 30 years. (You had to buy a separate gardens tour if you wanted to have a look.)</p>
<p>After the castle, Jay and I jumped in our trusty car and continued south on CA-Hwy 1 toward Santa Barbara, a three-hour drive away.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_003.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" title="1106_Day6_003" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_003.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" title="1106_Day6_004" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_004.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>We got to see a little of &#8220;wine country&#8221; during the drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" title="Day6_9" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/day6_9.jpg?w=497&#038;h=380" alt="" width="497" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>We stopped at <a href="http://santabarbaramission.org/" target="_blank">Old Mission Santa Barbara</a>, also known as the &#8220;Queen of the Missions.&#8221; The mission was established in 1786 and was the 10th of 21 California Missions to be founded by the Spanish Franciscans.</p>
<p><a href="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" title="1106_Day6_005" src="http://photosbyshew.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1106_day6_005.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>Factoid: It&#8217;s the only California mission to have twin bell towers.</p>
<p>After the mission, we walked along Stearns Wharf, the west coast&#8217;s oldest continuously operating wooden pier.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;">Back in June, I wrote a post called <em><a href="http://jessicahlawrence.com/2011/06/16/regret-me-not-project-day-133-email-mercy/"><span style="color:#000000;">Email Mercy</span></a></em>. I talked about how giving over huge chunks of my day to email means that I have almost no time to think and create things that will last much longer than the short-term firedrills that email creates. And I lamented that I really don’t like living a life where the most meaningful interactions are the ones that happen the least frequently.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">At the end of the post I said I was going to do something to start tackling the issue, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was yet. Two months later, I&#8217;m still not sure, but after having many more freakouts about how email is causing slow death, I&#8217;m finally going to start experimenting to see if I can figure out any solutions that will bring a little peace to my inbox and help me get back to  the important stuff. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So here we go with Day 1. For the next few days I&#8217;m going to experiment with one of the most common suggestions I&#8217;ve read for dealing with you inbox: don&#8217;t check your email until noon. But I&#8217;m going to tweak it just a bit, because for those of us who work from home and may end up working until 3 or 4 in the morning sometimes, noon would be the equivalent of 9 am, which would basically mean we would still be getting out of bed and practically jumping right into email. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So instead, I&#8217;m going to call this the 3-Hour Head Start: no reading email until I have at least three hours of work on projects each day. If I have meetings during that period, those count as &#8220;work other than email.&#8221; Most of my meetings and conference calls have a specific purpose and allow me a chance to connect with someone, so I&#8217;m going to let them exist in that 3-Hour Head Start space for now. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Approaching my day this way makes a lot of sense for a couple of reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">From a neuroscience perspective, I&#8217;ll be taking care of the most important thinking tasks (projects that require my full attention) when my brain is fresh and energized, not when it is drained from staring at email.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">I&#8217;ll be able to concentrate on actually getting key projects done because I won&#8217;t be responding to the firedrills email creates, pulling me in a million different directions. </span></li>
</ul>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">This already feels like it might be a little bit difficult&#8230;my fingers are twitching to get into my inbox&#8230;I think because it turns out that I have a slightly strange relationship with email: I get incredibly frustrated trying to deal with it on one hand, but on the other hand I think I subconsciously know that I can use it as a a very helpful procrastination tool if I&#8217;m a little too tired to deal with real work. </span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">Well, here it goes&#8230;off to not check my inbox&#8230;</span></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicalrevolutionary.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-28-at-10-42-46-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-194" title="VMAs" src="http://musicalrevolutionary.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-28-at-10-42-46-pm.png?w=450&#038;h=293" alt="VMAs" width="450" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>I pretty much only watched the VMAs to see the sneak preview of The Hunger Games movie, but I also figured that since I write a blog about music and music videos, it would probably make a lot of sense for me to watch it. There wasn&#8217;t a host this year and I did not like it at all. Russell Brand would have been amazing. Jessie J acted as the house band  and it was STELLAR. Just a genius move on MTV&#8217;s part. But, I could have used a lot more of her.</p>
<p><strong>Performances</strong><br />
Lady Gaga as a dude. Surprisingly, I didn&#8217;t hate it. She has such epic talent but I don&#8217;t always love her theatricality. This time, however, I was very absorbed in it. Good on you Gaga. Good on you.</p>
<p>Kanye and Jay-Z- Hell yes. Always. And so patriotic. Also, they had to security pull someone off stage? What the hell was that? Only at the VMAs. Jay and Ye were amazingly professional- like they didn&#8217;t even let that shit phase them. Quality.</p>
<p>Pitbull and Neyo. I don&#8217;t know, I guess it was good, I&#8217;m just not a big fan of that song. I have lots of love for Pitbull but this isn&#8217;t my favorite song of his. Although, both he and Neyo looked quite dashing.</p>
<p>Adele. Perfection. Utter and complete perfection.</p>
<p>Chris Brown performed. I&#8217;m not a fan of his but he is quite the dancer.</p>
<p>Beyonce. BEYONCE. Her performance was MAGNIFICENT. Also, she&#8217;s preggers ya&#8217;ll! I loved how happy she and Jay looked. That baby is going to be so talented.</p>
<p>Young the Giant were go great and this was huge for them as a band. I love that they brought 250 fans from their hometown- it was such an incredible performance.</p>
<p>The Amy Winehouse tribute was lovely and sweet and I thought Bruno Mars did an amazing job with Valerie. It also broke my heart a bit because she was such an epic talent and music was the better for her creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Winners</strong></p>
<p>Britney- no shock- I just always feel like she is one step away from crazytown.</p>
<p>Foo Fighters. I love them but Foster the People or Mumford should have won for best rock video. I&#8217;m just sayin. But I liked that they said they said not to lose faith in real rock and roll music, especially because I was just having that conversation the other day.</p>
<p>Will Ferrel, Jack Black, and Seth Rogan introducing best hip-hop video was amazing and I LOVED that my girl Nicki Minaj took home the prize, and I really loved how happy Lil Wayne looked for her.</p>
<p>Best collaboration went to Katy Perry and Kanye West and that was fine with me, but mostly because they interacted so awkwardly and it made me laugh.</p>
<p>Best male went to Justin Bieber. Ummm, no. Eminem&#8217;s video for Love The Way You Like was bananas kind of good. It should have won. Also, do you think Justin Bieber is wearing glasses so people will take him more seriously?</p>
<p>Britney wins some type of lifetime achievement award. OK. The tribute was fun.</p>
<p>Best new artist went to Tyler the Creator. Personally, I think Foster the People should have won but Tyler seemed super appreciative and his Mom went bonkers when he won, so good for him.</p>
<p>Best Female went to Lady Gaga. I get it. I would have preferred Adele won but Lady Gaga is immensely talented and her video for Born The Way was uber popular.</p>
<p>All in all, the VMAs were pretty good this year. Except for the fact they ran long and I DVR&#8217;d it so I didn&#8217;t even get to see The Hunger Games preview. Suck.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I get a craving for sushi. Nothing but a thickly sliced, buttery, creamy piece of sashimi will do. Other times, I can&#8217;t countenance getting raw fish for dinner. How insubstantial! Give me something I can really dig my teeth into instead. Something large, something to puff out my stomach, something to transform my walk into a waddle after the meal. A generous serving of the ultra-spicy Kung Pao chicken will do every well!</p>
<p>Books, too, are like cravings for me.  Sometimes I absolutely enjoy an intimate, hug-the-readers-to-its-bosom memoir; other times, I&#8217;m repulsed by such mushy details of a stranger&#8217;s life. Don&#8217;t give me mush; give me death. I want blood and gore, people dying on crusades for silly reasons, excessive cruelty, and straightforward narratives of tumultuous events. Wars? Plagues? Pestilence? Famines? Count me in! Still other times, I prefer cool, objective neutrality &#8212; something from the physical sciences, the history of an idea, even a chunk from that most bloodless of subjects, mathematics.</p>
<p>I think such moods are natural, even if no one (certainly not I) knows nor cares whence they&#8217;re from. Like explanations for day-to-day stock market movements, the kind where pressed journalists write quick bites on why the markets crashed/soared/barely budged today but the explanations are noteworthy for their inconsistencies, their after-the-fact, drawing-a-target-where-the-arrow landed quality, those for why a book is a must-read now when it was neglected for months on the shelf only yesterday are neither to be trusted nor plumbed.</p>
<p>That said, I still find it very strange that I only made it through a couple of pages of Martin Dugard&#8217;s <a href="http://webcat.cityofpaloalto.org/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1VC422911C949.17147&amp;profile=pacl&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!567692~!0&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=into+africa+epic&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1"><em>Into Africa</em></a> the first time I picked it up, thus letting it languish disconsolately on the bottom shelf, stewing in the northern California heat for who knows how long, before with nary a change, devoured it in two sittings. What gives?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today I remembered something about myself when I was just a wee lad. </strong></p>
<p><em>I was freaking cute.</em></p>
<p>I was also keeping the future in mind&#8230;</p>
<p>Star Wars fandom took over my life at a relatively young age. I remember seeing my dad watch <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Empire Strikes Back</span> back when I was around 7 or 8. It was the battle of Hoth scene, and I remember thinking, &#8220;Woah, this is super cool.&#8221; After that my friend Bobby let me come over to his house and play with his &#8220;aliens&#8221; that were characters from the Star Wars films.</p>
<p>Then Bobby let me borrow one of his Star Wars toys to take over to my house. It was all over after that.</p>
<p>It was like a drug. I needed more. <strong>Much more.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bookforme.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/starwarstoytrooper.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-546" title="starwarstoytrooper" src="http://bookforme.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/starwarstoytrooper.jpg?w=260&#038;h=260" alt="" width="260" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>I would go to the store with my mom and always beg for an action figure. It didn&#8217;t always work, but when it did, I felt like I was assembling the worlds greatest collection of awesome toys ever. The scale of my collection really isn&#8217;t anything to sneeze at, it&#8217;s quite good and was meticulously taken care of, but it also served another purpose in my life.</p>
<p><strong>I honestly can&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;ve shared this on the blog or not. </strong>(So if I have, I apologize for repeating myself, but there are so many posts on here by now that I have no real idea what I have/haven&#8217;t said about my life)</p>
<p>But my brother was a high demand special needs child. He always needed attention to make sure he was doing good. If he ended up in a bad mood he could harm himself or others. He was also prone to having serious seizures, so we always needed to keep checking on him to make sure we knew if one occurred.</p>
<p>As a kid I understood full well what that meant. It meant that I would have to entertain myself as best as I could because my parents were quite busy taking care of Todd (we&#8217;ll just say that&#8217;s my brother&#8217;s name).</p>
<p>This explains why I watched T.V., movies, played video games, and fiddled with toys all the time. If I was home, I needed to be in my room. Todd couldn&#8217;t play with my toys because he would likely destroy them. (He would also drool all over them and they would get super icky.) He was also much larger and stronger than me, so if he decided that he didn&#8217;t want me to be around him, he could physically dominate me. So, me alone in my room was the safest and most fun place I could spend my time.</p>
<p><strong>So, back on topic. </strong></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in my room playing with Star Wars action figures. And when I moved to Florida from Georgia I made friends with many more kids that loved Star Wars. My collection expanded to not only action figures, but MicroMachines and assorted items as well. Then one day my enjoyment took a strange turn.</p>
<p>I thought about how these toys may one day be worth money. I think I saw one of my neighbors collection those 12&#8243; G.I. Joes. They were nicely displayed and kept in the boxes and I figured the same had to be true for Star Wars toys. If their toys were important&#8230;so were mine. Star Wars was <em>waaaay</em> cooler than G.I. Joe anyway.</p>
<p>And I began collecting and amassing toys that were still in their packaging. I proudly displayed them on my wall. I would routinely make sure they were dusted and unaffected by anything that would potentially affect their value. I used thumb tacks and pin them to my wall. The tack would then but used as a hanger to slip the packaging onto. (I never punctured the packaging at all.)</p>
<p>I even had toys in boxes that I really wanted to play with. Still, I held out. The whole packaging issue became so important to me that I eventually started keeping the packaging of toys that I decided to open. It just felt wrong to get rid of it. Even if the price was now nearly worthless because the package was open.</p>
<p>This continued until I was around 13.</p>
<p>I stopped collecting and didn&#8217;t feel as proud about my mint conditioned Star Wars action figures. I guess I was growing up. Or maybe I was told that I need to clean out my closet or something.</p>
<p>Then the day came when I decided that I needed to put them away. They needed to be put into the closet with my Jurassic Park, Power Rangers, and Batman toys. They were going to be officially retired.</p>
<p>As I was putting them into boxes I started to think about time. All the time that it took for me to collect these things. All the time that they spent on my wall. All the time that I missed out on playing with these guys. But then I realized that I didn&#8217;t even play with my opened packed toys anymore&#8230; so why should these be any different.</p>
<p><em>I might as well throw them away.</em></p>
<p>I found a whole mess of packaging with no toys inside. It was just garbage. It had no value at all. So I decided to throw it away. Then I found some of those silly little toys. Maybe it was from Taco Bell in a kids meal or something. And I threw those away. I even grabbed a few opened action figures and thought about throwing them away&#8230;</p>
<p>But then I said to myself something along these lines. &#8220;Maybe I will want to play with these later. When I grow up I might want to sell them when I get into college. Maybe I&#8217;ll still think they&#8217;re cool and will find a better way to show them off. Hey, I can even get a job one day and I can start buying more.&#8221;</p>
<p>But none of those reasons seemed to be really feasible. I didn&#8217;t&#8217; really think I would keep a hold of them for much longer.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<p><strong>What if I have kids and they want to have some cool toys?</strong></p>
<p>In that moment I decided that I needed to do it because of them. Just in case they had a brother like Todd that needed a lot of care they would have some cool toys to hang on their wall. They could even play with them if they wanted to.</p>
<p>I would let them open the package. If they wanted to. I would still tell them they should not open it, but if they really wanted to they could.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the really cool thing about my young self I remembered today. I was thinking about my future children having my Star Wars collection.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if that is more nerdy than cute but I&#8217;m still pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>I just hope I find a wife who&#8217;s okay with me moving my boxes Star Wars junk into our first home.</p>
<p>If she asks me why I still keep these toys, I&#8217;ll just smile and say, &#8220;<em>What if our kids want to have cool toys?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>Still making flying sound effects with my mouth,</p>
<p>D.A.</p>

<p>Everyone that comes to Berlin has to ask &#8220;<em>what&#8217;s with the purple pipes?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>In all honesty they&#8217;re pretty boring, just to do with the construction process in Berlin, owing to the marshy land Berlin&#8217;s built on.</p>
<p>However, it seems the pipes are left on the streets long after they&#8217;ve served their use. Some people hate them, most people are utterly indifferent and some oddballs like me love them. I&#8217;ve been trying to photograph them properly for almost a year now, but the truth is they&#8217;re simply not so photogenic. I&#8217;ve tried selective focus, leaving them as the only part of the photograph in colour&#8230; I&#8217;ve tried loads of things to no avail. Then, suddenly, last Friday on a bit of a mad journey through town from bar to club to bar again I saw this set of pipes, the symmetry, the oddity (just enough room to get your head under), I thought they were great so I managed to swing by yesterday (excellent drunk memory) and finally got my elusive photo.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to Khan Academy&#8217;s popularity, the idea of the flipped classroom has gained press and credibility within education circles. Briefly, the Flipped Classroom can be described as:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> Flip your instruction so that students watch and listen to your lectures… for homework, and then use your precious class-time for what previously, often, was done in homework: tackling difficult problems, working in groups, researching, collaborating, crafting and creating. Classrooms become laboratories or studios, and yet content delivery is preserved.</em> <em>Flip your instruction so that students watch and listen to your lectures… for homework, and then use your precious class-time for what previously, often, was done in homework: tackling difficult problems, working in groups, researching, collaborating, crafting and creating. Classrooms become laboratories or studios, and yet content delivery is preserved (<a href="http://www.connectedprincipals.com/archives/3367">http://www.connectedprincipals.com/archives/3367</a>).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A compiled resource page of the Flipped Classroom (with videos and links) can be found at <a href="http://teachingwithted.pbworks.com/w/page/37315118/Flipping-the-Classroom">http://teachingwithted.pbworks.com/w/page/37315118/Flipping-the-Classroom</a></p>
<p>The advantage of the flipped classroom is that the content, often the theoretical/lecture-based component of the lesson, becomes more easily accessed and controlled by the learner. Cisco in a recent white paper, <a href="www.cisco.com/web/strategy/docs/education/K12_Video_WP_final.pdf">Video: How Interactivity and Rich Media Change Teaching and Learning</a>, presents the benefits of video in the classroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Establishes dialogue and idea exchange between students, educators, and subject matter experts regardless of locations.</li>
<li>Lectures become homework and class time is used for collaborative student work, experiential exercises, debate, and lab work.</li>
<li>Extends access to scarce resources, such as specialized teachers and courses, to more students, allowing them to learn from the best sources and maintain access to challenging curriculum.</li>

<p>One of the major, evidenced-based advantages of the use of video is that learners have control over the media with the ability to review parts that are misunderstood, which need further reinforcement, and/or those parts that are of particular interest.  (<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/06/29/online">Using technology to give students &#8220;control of their interactions&#8221; has a positive effect on student learning</a>,)</p>
<p>It is important, though, not to be seduced by the messenger.  Sal Khan is very charismatic and has produced good videos to explain some complex mathematical concepts.  With the growth of open education resources via Youtube and Creative Commons, it is important to note that excellent video lectures have been and are freely/easily available.  The Flipped Classroom concept, though, was not developed and articulated by Khan but by teachers such as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/7996379/Daniel-Pinks-Think-Tank-Flip-thinking-the-new-buzz-word-sweeping-the-US.html">Karl Fisch</a> and <a href="http://mast.unco.edu/programs/vodcasting/">Jon Bergman/Aaron Sams</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that educators, as a group, know how to do and use the lecture.  When educators are asked to replace their in-class lectures with videotaped ones (either their own or others) that learners watch at home, educators may not know what to do with this now void in-class time.  Those who advocate for the flipped classroom state that class time can then be used for discourse and for providing hands-on, authentic learning experiences.   In a recent interview Khan stated. “If I was a teacher, this is exactly the type of class I’d want to teach, I don’t have to prepare in a traditional sense. But I do have to prepare for projects and all that, so I have to prepare for creative things&#8221; (<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/05/meet-sal-khan-the-jerry-seinfeld-of-the-education-revolution/" target="_blank">Meet Sal Khan</a>).  As <a href="http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/khan-academy-my-final-remarks/">Frank Noschese</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> Sal Khan is not showing any examples about what students and teachers are doing beyond Khan Academy. The news stories are not showing the open-ended problems the kids should be engaging with after mastering the basics — instead they show kids sitting in front of laptops working drills and watching videos. The focus is on the wrong things. Khan Academy is just one tool in a teacher’s arsenal. (If it’s the only tool, that is a HUGE problem.) <a href="http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/khan-academy-my-final-remarks/">http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/khan-academy-my-final-remarks/</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the message being given is that teachers can do what they want to during class time. Now educators have time for engagement and interaction with the learners (#EdCampChicago presentation).</p>
<p>A major roadblock or barrier to the implementation of this model is that many educators do not know what to do within the classroom, what to do with that &#8220;whatever they want to do&#8221; time.  For educators, who are used to and use the didactic model, a framework is needed to assist them with the implementation of the Flipped Classroom.  In other words, the message to teachers to do what they want during classroom is not enough to make this transition.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the flavor of the month syndrome (recall character education, phonics movements, multicultural education, Reading First, powerpoints in the classroom), the use of video lectures needs to fall within a larger framework of learning activities – within more establish models of learning, providing a larger context for educator implementation.</p>
<p>What follows is an explanation of the Flipped Classroom Model, a model where the video lectures and vodcasts fall within a larger framework of learning activities. (Note: I am titling it the Flipped Classroom Model to get folks&#8217; attention given the Flipped Classroom popularity right now.  It really is a cycle of learning model.)  It provides a sequence of learning activities based on the learning theories and instructional models of Experiential Learning Cycles &#8211; <a href="http://reviewing.co.uk/research/learning.cycles.htm">http://reviewing.co.uk/research/learning.cycles.htm </a>and Bernice McCarthy&#8217;s 4MAT Cycle of Instruction- <a href="http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat/what-is-4mat">http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat/what-is-4mat</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Experiential Engagement: The Activity<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_1545.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964" title="2011-06-14_1545" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_1545.png?w=490&#038;h=372" alt="" width="490" height="372" /></a>The cycle often begins with an experiential exercise.  This is an authentic, often hands-on learning activity that fully engages the student.   It is a concrete experience that calls for attention by most, if not all, the senses.  According to McCarthy, learning activities are designed that are immersive.  Learners &#8220;experience the now.&#8221;  They become hooked through personal connection to the experience and desire to create meaning for and about that experience (ala constructivist learning).</p>
<p>Students become interested in the topic because of the experience.  They have a desire to learn more.  This is in line with John Dewey&#8217;s thinking regarding experience and education. The <em>nature of experience</em>s is of fundamental importance and concern in education and training.  People learn experientially.  It is the teacher&#8217;s responsibility to <em>structure and organize a series of experiences</em> which positively influence each individual&#8217;s potential future experiences (<a href="http://wilderdom.com/experiential/elc/ExperientialLearningCycle.htm">http://wilderdom.com/experiential/elc/ExperientialLearningCycle.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Examples of<em> Experiential Engagement</em> include <a href="http://www.experiential-learning-games.com/">Experiential Learning Activities</a>, <a href="http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/experiments">Science Experiments</a>, Simulations, Games and use of the Arts.</p>
<p><em>Setting:</em>  These activities are designed for in-class time and often occur in a group setting.  In a blended course, these are synchronous activities conducted during face-to-face instructional time.  In online course, students could be asked to go to a community event, museum, . .  or the creative educator could provide some type of hands-on activity or simulation for students to complete during a real-time synchronous webinar session via Adobe Connect, Elluminate or through a 3D Learning experience such as <a href="http://atlantis.crlt.indiana.edu/">Quest Atlantis</a>.  <strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>Conceptual Connections: The What</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em></em><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-15_1017.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971" title="2011-06-15_1017" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-15_1017.png?w=490&#038;h=361" alt="" width="490" height="361" /></a></strong>Learners are exposed to and learn concepts touched upon during Experiential Engagement.  They explore what the experts have to say about the topic.  Information is presented via video lecture, content-rich websites and simulations like <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/">PHET</a> and/or online text/readings.  In the case of the flipped classroom as it is being currently discussed, this is the time in the learning cycle when the learners view content-rich videos.  This is where and when videos such as those archived by <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy,</a> <a href="http://www.neok12.com/">Neo K-12</a>, <a href="http://www1.teachertube.com/">Teacher Tube</a>, or other video services are used to help students learn the abstract concepts related to the topic being covered.</p>
<p>McCarthy reinforces that concepts should be presented in accessible form.  By providing learners with online resources and downloadable media, learners can control when and how the media is used.  This is the major value of flipping the classroom . . . content-based presentations are controlled by the learner as opposed to the lecturer as would be the case in a live, synchronous, didactic-driven environment.</p>
<p>In a user-generated learning environment, students could be asked to locate the videos, podcasts, and websites that support the content-focus of the lesson.  These media can then be shared with other students.</p>
<p>Part of this phase includes an online chat for asking and addressing questions about the content presented via the videos, podcasts, websites.  Through a &#8220;chat&#8221; area such as<a href="http://ietherpad.com/"> Etherpad </a>or Google Docs, learners can ask questions with responses provided by co-learners and educators.  Videos could even be embedded into a <a href="http://voicethread.com/">Voicethread</a> so students can post comments/reactions to the content.   Obviously, in a face-to-face setting, students can bring their questions into the real time environment.</p>
<p><em>Setting:</em>  These materials are used by the learners in their own setting on their own time.  In other words, students have the opportunity to access and interact with these materials in a personalized manner.  They can view them in a learning setting that works for them (music, lighting, furniture, time of day) and can view/review information that they find particularly interesting or do not understand.   It is asynchronous learning and as such permits the learner to differentiate learning for him/herself.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Meaning Making: The So What<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_15491.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966" title="2011-06-14_15491" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_15491.png?w=490&#038;h=354" alt="" width="490" height="354" /></a>Learners reflect on their understanding of what was discovered during the previous phases.  It is a phase of deep reflection on what was experienced during the first phase and what was learned via the experts during the second phase.</p>
<p>Learners can articulate and construct their understanding of the content or topic being covered through written blogs or verbal-based audio or video recordings.  Within the standard school system, this would be the phase when students are tested about their understanding of the content.  If this is the case, it is recommended that the tests target higher levels of <a href="http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy">Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy &#8211; evaluation, applying, synthesizing</a>.</p>
<p><em>Setting:</em>  If possible, learners should be given the opportunity to reflect upon and make meaning of the content-related concepts within their own time schedule . . . both at a time when they feel ready to do so and taking the time they personally need for producing self-satisfactory work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Demonstration and Application: The Now What<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_1544.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967" title="2011-06-14_1544" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2011-06-14_1544.png?w=490&#038;h=366" alt="" width="490" height="366" /></a>During this phase, learners get to demonstrate what they learned and apply the material in a way that makes sense to them. This goes beyond reflection and personal understanding in that learners have to create something that is individualized and extends beyond the lesson with applicability to the learners&#8217; everyday lives.  This is in line with the highest level of learning within Bloom&#8217;s Revised Taxonomy of Learning &#8211; <a href="http://www.odu.edu/educ/roverbau/Bloom/blooms_taxonomy.htm">Creating </a>- whereby the learner creates a new product or point of view. In essence, they become<em> the storytellers of their learning</em> (See <a href="http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2011/05/01/narratives-in-the-21st-century-narratives-in-search-of-contexts/">Narratives in the 21st Century: Narratives in Search of Contexts</a>).  A list of technology-enhanced ideas/options for the celebration of learning can be found at: <strong></strong><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/a-technology-enhanced-celebration-of-learning/"> http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/a-technology-enhanced-celebration-of-learning/</a></p>
<p><em>Setting: </em> This phase of the cycle is best when it occurs in a  a face-to-face, group setting within the classroom.  The reasons for recommending this type of synchronous learning are (1) the educator can guide the learner to the types of projects and tools best suited for him/her, and (2) an audience of peers and mentors increases motivation and provides opportunities for feedback.  Obviously, in an online course, students can work on their projects and present them to peers/educators during a synchronous, interactive online forum.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Flipped Classroom offers a great use of technology -<em> especially if it gets lecture out of the classrooms and into the hands and control of the learners.</em>  As it is being discussed, it is part of a larger picture of teaching and learning.  The Flipped Classroom videos have a place in the models and cycles of learning proposed by educational psychologists and  instructional designers.  Providing educators with a full framework of how the Flipped Classroom can be used in their educational settings will increase its validity for educators and their administrators.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Concept Exploration </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At home students reviewed related media and had associated text readings.  Here is an example of one of the videos students reviewed at home:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/the-flipped-classroom-model-a-full-picture/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/-r0XsnW8EfA/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Personalization and Meaning Making</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Students blogged about what they learned comparing the in-class experiential activity with their text readings and video viewings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">We broke into groups of three and were asked to create one side of a bridge within our group to connect to the others groups bridge.  We were in two separate rooms, with the same supplies and could only communicate with one member of the other group at a time, every five or so minutes.  I was the communicator for my group.   This was extremely hard trying to build the same thing as someone else in a totally different room.  As the project moved further along, people began to get frustrated and irritated for different reasons.  Even though it was successful as far as the construction, many of us left class upset and frustrated. In the readings I read &#8220;the process of constructing meaning is itself symbolic because we rely on words to think about what words and other things mean&#8221; (Wood, 2010, p. 100).  I think this is so true and it was evident in our project.  Each team was relying on the words of the other team to determine the explanations of the bridge construction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">. . . and from another student:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">To clarify, without our ability to SEE the other group’s project, we had to solely depend on words. Words are discussed as never being self-evident or absolute (Woods, p. 100). With each person’s individual perspectives, we assign individual and unique meanings to words.  In that process, we unintentionally open the doors to misinterpretation.  As Woods describes, language defines, evaluates, organizes, allows hypothetical thought, and also allows self-reflection (Woods, p. 103-107). The key roles witnessed during this activity were the organization of perception, hypothetical thought, and evaluation. Mainly these were present between each group&#8217;s communicator to the other group, but they also trickled down to the communication within the groups as information was passed along; much like a chain of events. The power of verbal language is almost jarring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Demonstration and Application</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This phase had several components:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1)  Students demonstrated what they learned through in-class listening exercises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2581.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-893" title="IMG_2581" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2581.jpg?w=193&#038;h=300" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2) Then learners selected listening skills they decided to practice in real life.  They reported on their results through blog entries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">When it comes to pseudo listening, it seems like for the most part there were just too many distractions or barriers going on. I found myself wanting to listen to people around me, but I couldn’t turn the internal dialog off. So throughout the week I tried to catch myself, and found that it wasn’t too hard. Most of this type of non-listening occurs when I’m on the phone (particularly with my parents) for a long period of time. I’m not very good at talking on the phone anyways because of the lack of eye-contact and my distractions caused by trying to multi-task. The best results in correction my pseudo listening were to go and sit in a quiet area (have a smoke) and literally sit on my free hand.  If my mind still wandered, I fought to catch myself and redirect my attention to who I was speaking with on the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">3)  Finally students integrated their course learning through a celebration of learning.  They created metaphors for the course content, and explained personal learning and future applications via these metaphors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A Board Game</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2695.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" title="IMG_2695" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2695.jpg?w=205&#038;h=271" alt="" width="205" height="271" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A Face Metaphor</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2721.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986" title="IMG_2721" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2721.jpg?w=226&#038;h=161" alt="" width="226" height="161" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">. . . and Celebrating</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2699.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" title="IMG_2699" src="http://usergeneratededucation.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2699.jpg?w=227&#038;h=185" alt="" width="227" height="185" /></a></p>
<div><strong>Postscript</strong>: Learner-Educator roles change. At the conclusion of this course (June, 2011) a student stated, “You were so much more than a teacher to us.”</div>

<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Final Note:  </em> <em>The title of my blog is User-Generated Education.  I have a goal of assisting with educational reform in that a learner-centric system of education evolves.  I believe that this cycle of learning is a natural way of learning and that educators can assist students in understanding this cycle so they can use it for their own personalized learning experiences.</em></p>
