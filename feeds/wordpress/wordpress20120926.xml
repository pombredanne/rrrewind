				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A microcosm of modern Cambodia. A mix of the old and the new. Locals treasure the traditional culture, and this pride can be seen on a daily basis. It&#8217;s different to other provincial capitals. Not as dusty, not as poor, not as boring, not as lost. Over the years, power of this old town has switched hands more times than one can count on one of them &#8211; the last being the French. The Sangker river threads through the middle, on it&#8217;s way from Pailin, and onward to the Tonle Sap lake. Crossing which, is the old railway, which can now only be ridden on small motorized bamboo beds. Battambang&#8217;s got it all. A strange place, but it&#8217;s unusual qualities hold elegance. I head back regularly&#8230;<a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6836.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-636" title="main road through town, battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6836.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6717.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-655" title="bamboo train in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6717.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6841.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-637" title="real life in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6841.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6861.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-638" title="evening market in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6861.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4434.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-659" title="fish at the market in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4434.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4368.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" title="monks on a mountain in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4368.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4337.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-649" title="phnom sampeu in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4337.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0457.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-647" title="pagoda on the sangker river in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0457.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4227.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-642" title="fishing on the sangker river in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4227.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><a href="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0475.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-644" title="river crossing in battambang cambodia" src="http://dominicstafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0475.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I grew up in Gangnam, the affluent Seoul neighborhood featured in South Korean rapper <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" target="_blank">Psy&#8217;s </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" target="_blank">video</a> (which has over 253 million hits as of this posting, more than the population of Indonesia. It has also entered the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/09/gangham-style-video-breaks-guinness-world-record/" target="_blank">Guinness Book of World Records</a> for most liked YouTube video). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I witnessed Seoul’s transformation from a grim, dangerously crowded place where all designer garments were counterfeit into a glamorous and rich global mega-city where–as Psy shows–people are fabulously well-dressed, but they still have to hang out in parking garages.</p>
<div id="attachment_6086" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img class="size-medium_10 wp-image-6086" title="gangnam yellow full width" src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gangnam-yellow-full-width.jpg?w=640&h=359" alt="" width="640" height="359" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Being rich doesn&#8217;t mean we have to stop hanging out in parking garages. (YouTube)</p></div>
<p>Irony is that special privilege of wealthy nations—Aristophanes, possibly the world’s first satirist, wrote his plays as Athens was becoming the dominant power in the region; Cervantes wrote at the height of Spain’s naval wealth; and Alexander Pope was born the year that England defeated the Spanish Armada. First, one scrambles for wealth; then one luxuriates in mocking the effeteness that comes with it.</p>
<p>Thus “Gangnam Style” signals the emergence of irony in South Korea, meaning that the country has reached the final stage in any state’s evolution. If you don’t think that irony is a measure of eliteness, think of how annoyed you were the last time you were <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">accused</span></a> of not having any. Americans have told me that Asians have no irony; in Europe, where I last lived, I was told that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/apr/22/comment.observercomment" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Americans have none</span></a>.</p>
<p>South Korea had no irony when I arrived there. I can say that as plainly as I can say that it had no McDonald’s (it arrived in 1988, in Gangnam, of course). The Korean language has no word for irony, nor for “parody,” which is why the Korean press has been using the English word “parody” to describe Gangnam Style.</p>
<p>After a 20-year stint in the US, where I was born, my parents returned to their native Korea and set up in Gangnam’s snobbiest neighborhood, Apgujeong, sometimes called the Beverly Hills of Seoul; the major shopping street is named Rodeo Drive. I attended Gu-jung elementary and middle school—the highest-rated, most entitled, most hated school in the entire country.</p>
<p>In 1987, every schoolchild in South Korea made a mandatory donation toward the building of the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/world/asia/28korea.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Peace Dam</span></a>,” a project of then-President Chun Doo-Hwan’s. The North Koreans were allegedly building a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imnam_Dam" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">dam of mass destruction</span></a> close to the North-South border. The dam would collect water flowing from the north and then one day, when we least expected it, the North would unleash the water and flatten Seoul. The retaliatory Peace Dam, to be built in the south, would send the water back north. I do not pretend to understand the engineering involved.</p>
<p>The teacher hit all of us, one at a time, with her wooden stick wrapped with black electrical tape. We had all brought the recommended donation of 200 won (at the time, the equivalent of 25 American cents).</p>
<p>“You are from Gangnam,” the teacher said, a phrase she used often, as in, This is Sparta. “If the nationwide minimum is 200 won, you have to bring at least 1,000 won. You shouldn’t have to be told.”</p>
<p>You can’t have irony when you’re being hit with sticks wrapped with black electrical tape. Or, when you&#8217;re being forced to prepare a speech every semester to enter in your school&#8217;s Anti-Communist Speech Contest.</p>
<p>South Korea wanted nothing more than for its GDP to skyrocket, but it didn’t want to deal with increasing individual wealth. The clashing goals made South Korea a stark raving mad place to live in the ‘80s and ‘90s.</p>
<div id="attachment_6091" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img class="size-medium_10 wp-image-6091" title="gangnam bus full width" src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gangnam-bus-full-width.jpg?w=640&h=360" alt="" width="640" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">These bus tours were horrible. They made you sing up front with a microphone. (YouTube)</p></div>
<p>My school enforced rules to make the increasing income disparities less visible. Students were not permitted to wear watches exceeding 20,000 won in value or shoes exceeding 9,000 won. We were not permitted to be picked up or dropped off at school by private car&#8211;which became a matter of controversy, since students were often required to stay at school very late into the night, giving rise to safety concerns.</p>
<p>Korean law prohibited private tutors for school subjects, for fear that this would give an advantage to the wealthy. Most students at my school had them anyway.</p>
<p>Periodically, the school would give the students a sort of denunciation pop quiz with questions such as “Who among your classmates is receiving private tutoring?”</p>
<p>My family was not Gangnam rich. Not as rich as one of my high school classmates who, in the summer of 1989, flew with her little brother to Hawaii for just one weekend, because her brother wanted to see the movie “Batman” (the Michael Keaton version) on opening night and he couldn’t wait for the film to come to Korea. Nor were we as rich as the girl who misplaced a $20,000 violin and did not even bother to look for it because her parents would buy a new one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my father had a chauffeur. It was a professional necessity. Any Korean executive showing up to a lunch meeting in a car he drove himself would be laughed out of the restaurant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6166" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-6166" title="euny family pic 600" src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/euny-family-pic-600.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="195" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Entitled? Moi? [author, on left, with sisters]</p></div>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a life ripe for irony, but irony came there none—not until long after I had left for the West. South Korea was historically so embarrassed by the notion of borrowing money, that when it received $57 billion in IMF bailout funds in Dec. 1997, former President Kim Young-Sam told his country via television that he was &#8220;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/38702.stm" target="_blank">whipping himself every day</a>&#8220; in shame at having brought his country to this situation. A national advertising campaign urged citizens to help pay off the debt; wealthy women supposedly donated their jewelry to be melted down and used to pay back the debt—which Korea repaid by August 2001, three years ahead of schedule. Now, however, South Koreans are drowning in personal debt surpassing that of the US pre-subprime crisis, as our sister publication the Atlantic pointed out in its widely-read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/gangnam-style-dissected-the-subversive-message-within-south-koreas-music-video-sensation/261462/" target="_blank">Gangnam Style: Dissected</a>  article.</p>
<p>The acquisition of wealth is not funny. It was especially unfunny for the titled aristocracy in South Korea who were watching the earth start to crack beneath them. People like—may I be frank?—my family. We did not sit around making dry, witty existential comments as these vulgarians rose up among us and started showing up at the fish market in mink coats. Psy’s invisible horse dance comes too little, too late for some of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the TV show <em>The Jetsons</em>. What was awesome about <em>The Jetsons</em> is that it showed us a marvelous 21st century future of flying cars, robot slaves, two-hour work weeks, semi-articulate dogs and push-button … everything.<br />&nbsp;<br />
It was all bullshit, of course; practically none of it came true. Sure, buttons are everywhere, and dogs are closer than ever to speaking in adorably dog-accented English, but domestic robot technology is still limited to minor vacuuming and assisted masturbation duties. Two-hour work weeks only exist for members of Congress. And don’t even bring up the flying car.</p>

<p>Damn right, Randal. TV<em> does</em> lie to us. But that’s not all. Books lie too. I’ve read entire books full of lies, and I’m not just talking about David Barton’s book on Thomas Jefferson here. I’m talking about books like <em>1975: And the Changes to Come</em> by Arnold B. Barach, which was published in 1962, the same year <em>The Jetsons</em> debuted. It was one of those vaguely edu-taining books about how incredibly awesome The Future was supposed to be – in this case, the far-off future world of 37 years ago – by making tantalizing prognostications about cool technological innovations that were certain to come. Only one thing about this book is really certain, however: 1962 was a huuuuuge year for bullshit.<br />&nbsp;<br />
Here are a few of my favorite failed dreams of awesome-itude from <em>1975: And the Changes to Come</em>:<br />&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2152049666_28ee5ec116_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33" title="2152049666_28ee5ec116_o" src="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2152049666_28ee5ec116_o.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="567" /></a><br />
<strong>Bacon in a Toaster.</strong> In a goddamn TOASTER! No more searing flesh burns from spattering pan grease or from flipping the strips over with your tongue. The bacon would come pre-fried, hermetically sealed in a futuristic aluminum space-pouch to keep away future bacteria and roving bacon-hunting Totoros. All you do is slide the pouch in your friendly 1975 toaster, set it to “Baconate,” and &#8211; a few minutes and searing flesh burns later &#8211; Instant Bacon Goodness. In a futuristic aluminum space-pouch, because, you know, the Future.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2152050362_615df7f684_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34" title="2152050362_615df7f684_o" src="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2152050362_615df7f684_o.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="518" /></a><br />
<strong>The Hi-Fi Sphere.</strong> In the same way that bacon tastes better when re-heated in an aluminum pouch, sound sounds better when it’s coming from a round aluminum thing. Long-playing Hi Fidelity records are round. Rolling Stones are round, Barry White is round. Your ears are round. Your head is round, and your face-talking hole is round. So should your high-fidelity, sound-barking, audio-making equipment set be: Round. EXTRA BONUS: Round(ish) speakers on an extendo-matic telescoping antenna-looking thingy, for maximum head-injury potential. When not in use, the giant round sound thing closes to form a perfectly symmetrical aluminum sphere, blending in naturally with all your other giant ball-shaped décor.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2151258519_a43a30744b_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35" title="2151258519_a43a30744b_o" src="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2151258519_a43a30744b_o.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="523" /></a><br />
<strong>Giant Television … Something.</strong> We all knew the future of big-screen TV was going to be dozens of cluttered dials and twisty control things all crammed in together at convenient standing eye-level for maximum getting-up-out-of-your-chairability, and here our technological miracle stands &#8211; about six feet from your chair. The ultimate in deluxe televisions comes over-the-air, wired-antenna ready, able to receive grainy state-of-the-art analog signals from dozens of miles away, or maybe from around the world if something something. Set-top dials can be set to different time zones just in case you have that urgent OCD need to tell time that way, or maybe they’re kitchen timers for the bacon toaster. Plus a world map so you can keep track of where orbiting astronauts are. In the Future.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2151259579_c459116f3d_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" title="2151259579_c459116f3d_o" src="http://philloz3000.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2151259579_c459116f3d_o.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="535" /></a><br />
<strong>The Turkey Gun.</strong> With all the astronauting we will have had been doing in 1975, naturally we’ll have had needed revolutionary new food-to-face-hole delivery devices to take advantage of the huge pain-in-the-ass convenience of Zero Gravity. Based on absolutely no evidence or experience, the top futurologists of 1962 determined that earthly utensils, dishes and even solid food itself would be absolutely useless, if not deadly &#8211; and possibly Communist &#8211; in 1975 outer space. The answer? Based on the same physics principles that modern, 21<sup>st</sup> century pastry bags employ, this marvelous “Expelling device screws onto punctured can and is operated by squeezing to force food through the nipple.” Say that again: “Force food through the nipple.” Science!<br />&nbsp;<br />
I could go on, of course; there’s plenty more. In 1962 people were both anxious and hopeful about the future in that special way that only a culture on the cusp of both conquering space <em>and</em> self-annihilation could appreciate, and I suppose predictions like these held a special fascination for them. By now, of course, we’ve long since figured out that ball-shaped sound is for chumps and that we could hire other people to toast our pre-fried bacon for us, so perhaps we don’t look at the future in quite the same way – or maybe we do. I don’t know, I’m not fucking Carl Sagan here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kimberlyhurshdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/school2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-182" title="school" src="http://kimberlyhurshdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/school2.png?w=545" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>Growing up, I never wanted to be a teacher. I thought it was out of the question for me, an impatient  introvert with questionable planning and time-management skills. Teachers are born, are they not? Some people are just naturals.</p>
<p>My senior year of college, I realized that, natural or not, I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted that environment of constant, intentional learning, and I wanted to share the ideas I loved with others.</p>
<p>Yet, I was also certain that were I to find that I was not a natural, I would look for another career. I&#8217;ve had enough teachers who shouldn&#8217;t have been in a classroom, and I have too much respect for education to be one of them.</p>
<p>My personal fears have been reinforced by the rhetoric surrounding education and the recent slew of teacher&#8217;s strikes, especially in <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/teachers-strike-chicago-explained">Chicago</a>. In an interesting ideological switch, liberal politicians and media have mostly villainized teacher&#8217;s unions, calling them reactionary and resistant to any critique that blames them for our educational woes.</p>
<p>Teachers, it seems, are the problem. For the sake of simplification, let&#8217;s say that this is so, that the blame lies only a little with overpopulated classrooms, lack of resources, and unstable family structures.* If that&#8217;s so, then teachers must also be the solution.</p>
<p>How, then, do you teach teachers how to teach? The message, from both liberals and conservatives, teachers and administrators, is decidedly mixed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/loss-of-masters-degree-pay-bump-has-impact-on-teachers-grad-schools-736gavm-168292566.html">Recent research</a> shows that teachers with MAs deliver no better results than those with a BA. This dovetails with what I&#8217;ve heard about education programs. Courses that teach teachers how to teach are, by and large, a complete waste of time. It&#8217;s about classroom experience more than anything else.</p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;ve had teachers who had been in classrooms for 20 years, teaching next to nothing for all 20 of them. And <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/why-kids-should-grade-teachers/309088/">unions are criticized</a> precisely for protecting tenured teachers.</p>
<p>And then there are programs like <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/06/11/154761301/in-defense-of-teach-for-america">Teach for America</a>, frequently hand-picking smart, motivated college graduates with absolutely no experience, providing very little instruction, and throwing them into a classroom to sink or swim. There, the swimmers tend to produce higher than average results.</p>
<p>So, experience means nothing, but neither can good teaching be taught, supporting the idea that teachers are born, not made. That&#8217;s the rhetoric. And it&#8217;s a rhetoric that, after only a month of teaching at Nativity, I no longer believe.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>*If anything, simplification is the problem. Even the best, most natural teacher cannot fill the place a parent fills, cannot give individual attention to 40 students, cannot teach students how to succeed in a technology-driven world without computers. It&#8217;s easier to place the blame on the &#8220;other&#8221; than imagine a total cultural and systemic restructuring that would affect us all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She didn&#8217;t know how to answer his question in a graceful way. She was taught to emit grace, speak nicely, mind her manners and not hurt people&#8217;s feelings. Do not ruffle feathers, do not be aggressive, do not speak in a way that will cause conflict or retaliation. This question&#8230;this honest, raw, pleading question was going to be hard to answer because she was out of energy to abide by the rules. She didn&#8217;t have the energy it would take to think of a graceful, kind, considerate answer. She was tired of overt-thinking responses. She was tired of not saying exactly what she felt.</p>
<p>They are in her car drinking tea and staring out at the frozen lake. He is waiting for an answer. Ten seconds; ten long deafening seconds have passed and she still hasn&#8217;t spoken. I suppose it is hard for people unlike her to understand how hard it can be to speak once you have already shut down; how hard it is to bother saying words that you know won&#8217;t be received how you intend them to be, no matter how hard you try to formulate them. Perhaps it is faulty communication, perhaps it is disinterest &#8211; perhaps she is just utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>The lake shifts and the deep crack of ice brings her back to the moment. He is still waiting. Shit.</p>
<p>She shifts in her seat and shoves the zipper of her puffy down jacket away from her cheek. The fucking zipper is always scratching at her face! Fuck!</p>
<p>She sighs and watches the cloud of her breath spread out in front of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t imagine this. Before I got to know you, before I loved you, I didn&#8217;t imagine this.</p>
<p>The freckles in your eyes&#8230;the golden flecks. They used to draw me in. I used to gaze into them while I felt the wisp of your breath against my cheek and imagine what it would be like to feel your hand on the back of my neck, pulling me in closer for the long, forbidden kiss that would change everything.</p>
<p>Your cheeks&#8230;your well defined, chiselled cheek bones. I used to imagine what it would be like to wake up beside you and run my fingers over those freckled cheek bones before I kissed you good morning and made you breakfast. Breakfast would be our favourite time of the day.</p>
<p>The silver threads in your hair&#8230;I used to imagine what stories were woven into your waves, before I actually ran my hands through them. What happened in your life during the years before we crossed paths? I imagined you were a little boy who loved to play in the woods and would come home at dusk with a filthy, smiling face. You would hold out your cupped hands to show your mother a slimy, muddy toad that you had jammed in your pocket earlier in the day and saved to show her. I imagined you always wanted to make her proud.</p>
<p>Your smile&#8230;your huge, joyous smile. I used to imagine it meant something about me. I used to imagine the feel of it growing against my cheek as we slow danced in my living room to the latest Norah Jones CD, or maybe even something ridiculously remarkable like James Moody&#8217;s, &#8220;Moody&#8217;s Mood For Love&#8221;. That song&#8230;.the things it does to me. It makes me weightless &#8211; like your smile once did.</p>
<p>You&#8230;the you I imagined, the you that I wanted you to be, the you that you were in fleeting moments, did things to my heart and to my soul that make right now, this moment, unbearably suffocating. If I had the energy I would be smashing on the windows trying to break out of here and run as fast as I could away from this moment. I would run until I only had one ounce of breath left, and was forced to suck some fresh life into my lungs. Some air that didn&#8217;t sting! Some godforsaken air that didn&#8217;t feel like cement! But I don&#8217;t have the energy. It is exhausting for me to say even these few words.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the matter? </em></p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>Us.</p>
<p>The things that I imagined are hurtful. The things that I remember are hurtful. The things you did and didn&#8217;t do, the things I did and didn&#8217;t do, the moments we shared and the ones we didn&#8217;t tear at my heart every day until I want to rip it out of my chest and throw it across the room.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the matter? </em></p>
<p>Everything. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is staring at me, blankly. What is he thinking? Does he think I&#8217;m crazy? I know I sound crazy. I feel crazy.</p>
<p>I look back at the lake.</p>
<p>The sun is going down and adding a glint to the crusted snow. It burns my eyes and they begin to tear.</p>
<p>There is a pink hue to the sky. <em>Watermelon skies, as </em>I like to call them. Pink skies are my favourite. They make my body  feel like it is springing back to life. They bring me childish joy. Like his smile used to.</p>
<p>I start the car and back away from the lake; the sound of the crusty snow beneath the tires deafening in relation to the silence in the front seat. He hasn&#8217;t said a word.</p>
<p>Wordless; the drive home is wordless.</p>
<p>I pull into the driveway and turn off the ignition. We sit.</p>
<p>He turns and looks at me, &#8220;Are you coming in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I watch him go inside, as I lean my head back against my headrest. A tear escapes my right eye and freezes as it rolls down my cheek.</p>
<p>I recline my seat, and pull my scratchy jacket up against my face.</p>

<p>You have three choices here. You can define your own reality (Redefine Truth), you can let politicians define your reality (Skip Inconsistencies), or you can update reality frequently (Update). Keep in mind that updating reality requires intensive effort, an open mind, and a lot of mouse clicking. This isn&#8217;t a button you can push once and forget about it.</p>
<p>If you choose to update, here are some tools to help you. Note that the staff at Sargastic Irrevalence does not vouch for these sites or their affiliations. These sites are intended to be non-bias, non-partisan, and hit all lies with facts, however, the determination of those facts and their veracity is still up to you, and will still be interpreted by those around you according to their own updates of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Reality Updating Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact.com</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker">The Fact Checker</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The use of reality may cause nausea, vomiting, intense rage, seizures, sweating, and antagonistic behavior toward others. Reality should be taken slowly, particularly when the subject has been conditioned toward strong belief in concepts that fall outside the boundaries of reality. In strong doses, reality may cause depression. Keep addictive substances, weapons, and power tools, away from all individuals during treatment. Do not update reality while operating a motor vehicle. Promote rest, avoid stool-softening products, and suspend reality as necessary to give the individual time to recover.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kateshrewsday.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_0240.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8222" title="DSC_0240" src="http://kateshrewsday.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_0240.jpg?w=640&h=425" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The heavens opened.</p>
<p>And duty called, even on a Sunday. For school, a display on the Victorians, ready for a public event on Monday evening, was necessary. And I needed Victorian artefacts.</p>
<p>I trawled the sources of Victorian wooden toys in my mind and decided wistfully that a trip into our local market town was going to be a must. I must make a wet, crowded, expensive drive, alone because everyone else in the house had colds.</p>
<p>I braced myself. I got in the car. And I turned the ignition key, backed out of the drive and got on the road.</p>
<p>I found a parking place in a great shopping cathedral and scuttled off through the fat drops of rain to the museum, a worthy red-brick building. I walked through the doors into a museum which, with the gloom outside, looked as if the caretaker had already turned half the lights out.</p>
<p>My heart sank. Even one of my favourite sanctuaries felt abandoned.</p>
<p>I located and bought what I had to. And then, I instinctively headed for the one exhibit with which I must commune, this rainy afternoon.</p>
<p>It is two floors up, in a glass lift. I stepped out expecting to see no-one. There were a few straggling sightseers, grandparents with toddlers looking for rainy-day activity.</p>
<p>I wandered into the Roman galleries: and there he stood. My battered Roman eagle.</p>
<p>He is called the Silchester Eagle, and the Romans are thought to have thrown my eagle away for scrap.</p>
<p>The cads.</p>
<p>Silchester is the site of an old Roman town, Calleva Atrebatum. We&#8217;ve been digging it for well over a century: <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/silchester/about-silchester/sil-about-silchester-calleva.aspx">Reading&#8217;s University oversees it </a>these days.</p>
<p>My eagle was discovered a very long time ago, on October 9, 1866, by a clergyman. The Reverend JG Joyce, who excavated the dig from 1864-1878, was certain it was a very important eagle indeed: probably part of a Roman standard.</p>
<p>And it was in this capacity that author Rosemary Sutcliffe used him to inspire her classic tale <em><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iEy1btLSKLAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Eagle Of The Ninth</a> , </em>published in 1954, a must-read for anyone who hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In actual fact, research has revealed that he was once sitting on a sphere as part of a Roman ornament. Than the original craftsman was extremely skilled but subsequent repairs after accidents were clumsier. And that, according to his location, he was probably awaiting being melted down for scrap.</p>
<p>Originally, my eagle had glorious great outspread wings, but no more. He is time-battered. But he has a circumspect air, as if really, it is all one could expect from life.</p>
<p>He has seen a rainy afternoon or two.</p>
<p>Here we stood, he and I, in a darkened room on a wet September afternoon. His attitude seemed to speak much louder than words. This is life, he said. You keep going, you tread each step, you serve your masters faithfully, spend years buried under ashes and lose a wing or two: and still, a kind of immortality can be yours.</p>
<p>With a wisdom borne of more than a millennium of experience, I would swear he was smiling.</p>
<p>Hello, Eagle, I said.</p>
<p>Hello, he replied companionably.</p>
<p>And then it was time to leave: to draw away from my eagle and trail reluctantly back to the gliding glass lift, leaving him amongst the coins and pots and tiles and remains of a city which died more than a thousand years ago. Time to come down from the mountain and rejoin life in the soggy streets of an English market town.</p>

It <a href="http://richarddaybell.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fax-machine1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1489" title="fax-machine1" src="http://richarddaybell.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fax-machine1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="233" /></a>costs $649. We have a phone that&#8217;s attached to the wall. It lets you talk on it, that&#8217;s about all. We have a cellphone, too. I&#8217;m not sure what all it does. It must not do much. It cost $14.99. Chances are I&#8217;ll never buy an Apple iPhone5. Technologically, I&#8217;m pretty far behind the curve. To give you an example, here&#8217;s a piece I wrote back in the 90&#8242;s about my first fax. I know, people usually write about first loves, first cars and first jobs, but when you&#8217;re hopelessly behind the curve . . .</span></span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Fax Me the Pillow That You Dream On</strong></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Officially, it&#8217;s known as a facsimile communications machine. Those on more familiar terms with it call it a fax machine.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">I prefer facsimile communications &#8212; it&#8217;s formal, cold and aloof &#8212; just the way I would like our relationship to remain.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Our relationship is new, and it&#8217;s more of a brief encounter. I recently, for the first time, sent a facsimile to someone. It&#8217;s worth noting that not only are a lot of people on a nickname basis with the thing, but they also have made a verb out of what was clearly intended to be a noun. It is important that every thinking person take a vow never, never to </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><em>fax</em></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> anything.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">I don&#8217;t know if that someone to whom I sent the facsimile ever received it, but I did send it. I did it; it&#8217;s over; I can get on with my life. It was this someone, of course, who instigated the whole thing, suggesting that this particular document needed</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> to be rushed enough not to trust it to the vagaries of the postal service. I myself happen to be a fan of postal delivery. You stick something in an envelope, slap a stamp on it, and a few days later, a real human being, beaming with pride, delivers it to its destination. It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s fun and it&#8217;s environmentally friendly.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">After determining the location of the nearest facsimile communication device and preparing the document in question, I sat down with paper and pencil to list pros and cons, possible dangers inherent in the action, and penalties for lack of action. I could</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> remain defiant &#8212; stick it in an envelope, slap a stamp on it, and let the chips fall where they may. That would have been a rational response, a consistent one, and the safe one. But as I prepared to lick the stamp, I noted that it portrayed tiny astronauts landing on a tiny moon. These brave explorers, these one-giant-leap-for-mankind heroes looked up at me as if to say &#8220;Wimp!&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">So even though I deeply distrust and avoid anything invented after 1967, I decided to go for it. It was a moment filled with emotional stress; breaking a technological barrier usually is. For those of you who have yet to screw up your courage and try it, I am happy to report that the anticipation is worse than the experience itself.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">I removed the document from its mailing envelope, unfolded it, and inserted it in the rather harmless looking machine (quicksand looks harmless, too). I picked up the receiver of a rather ordinary telephone, dialed my recipient&#8217;s number, and waited for my</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> cue. The cue is an ear-shattering screech (just like, for those of you who remember the movie </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><em>Fail Safe</em></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">, the screech that came to the President of the United States over the hot line, indicating that our inadvertently launched nuclear missiles had reached the USSR, and Moscow was no more).</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Once the screech ends, you crawl out from under the desk, press a button, and the paper disappears into the machine. A minute later, it magically reappears. Presumably, the original has been divvied into millions of little molecules, each of which reprod</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">uces itself. The clones are then fed through the phone lines to be reassembled at the other end and the original is reassembled here. I don&#8217;t know. I do know the machine ironed the creases out of my document; I can vouch for nothing beyond that.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"> <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;">I may never send a facsimile again (and I will not fax) but it was worth experiencing. It fills one with that same heady exhilaration that diving to the ocean floor or landing on the moon must. And even though I may never send a facsimile again, I&#8217;m seriously considering giving the electric can opener a try. Technology is running amok, and it&#8217;s sweeping me along with it.</span></span></p>
