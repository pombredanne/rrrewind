<p>The Mundane<br />
<em><strong>For</strong></em> <a href="http://sarahpotterwrites.wordpress.com/"><strong>sarahpotter</strong><em></em></a></p>
<p>Late at night, the roads<br />
in the Brave Little Knight&#8217;s room<br />
are far from safe.</p>
<p>Paved with the broken bones of old toys<br />
and potholes the size of mounds of clothes,<br />
the streets bespeak a ghost town<br />
where the townspeople<br />
don&#8217;t drink the water for fear of disease<br />
and would rather eat mousetrap bait<br />
than take a chance on the pavement.</p>
<p>The are some evenings when<br />
dust bunnies roll by<br />
on the empty sidewalks,<br />
but even they do not stay for long;<br />
for the room was claimed by the Gods of Dirt,<br />
and our sire&#8217;s bedchamber is decorated<br />
with the casualties of a battle<br />
waged since before the squire&#8217;s birth:</p>
<p>An unpaired sock breathed his last<br />
ages ago on the mantelpiece,<br />
yet his body remains as a haunting reminder<br />
of a more sanitary time.</p>
<p>There sits an unwanted Christmas gift-<br />
contortionist in the corner of the room-<br />
and a lonely page of a book-never-opened<br />
looms under a mirror.</p>
<p>Little do they know,<br />
the beasts below,<br />
the demons that feast on debris and grow,<br />
those evil imps of entropy unknown will be<br />
beaten clean by the hygienic hero.</p>
<p>Twice a year or so, the knight awakens in his<br />
sleeping quarters to find a room<br />
run by the untidy mafia<br />
and hardly a square inch of floor space<br />
to place his feet upon.</p>
<p>Like always, the errant-child is surprised<br />
to discover that a crime was committed<br />
right under his nose,<br />
and though he should have smelled<br />
that something was off,<br />
the brave boy didn&#8217;t even notice.</p>
<p>Without hesitation,<br />
he takes up his weapon of war:<br />
A trusty vacuum cleaner steed<br />
complete with swiffer attachment.</p>
<p>With the power of Mr. Clean,<br />
Scrubbing bubbles and Bounty combined,<br />
the brave vanquisher of mayhem<br />
sends messmakers running behind piles of laundry.</p>
<p>The disorder demons won&#8217;t<br />
accept defeat easily though,<br />
and even when the Quixote dispatches<br />
his four horsemen of sanitation<br />
into the trenches of clothes,<br />
he comes up empty handed.</p>
<p>This game of smoke and mirrors<br />
between chaos and order<br />
is hardly close to checkmate;<br />
although the fate of all life<br />
is eventual disarray,<br />
at least the brave knight<br />
has kept his bedlam at bay.<br />
At least until next spring.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to give you all a full length post for a change. I hadn&#8217;t planned on writing this but a Twitter event triggered the urge. While on Facebook, I noticed a screengrab of a tweet a person named <a href="http://twitter.com/_stopfreebeats">CaptainNoFreeBeats</a>Â sent to a fellow producer friend of mine (I&#8217;ve covered his name out of courtesy).</p>
<p><a href="http://sampleface.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1134" title="tweet1" src="http://sampleface.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png" alt="" width="253" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>You can find some more of his drivel <a href="http://storify.com/starchildluke/all-is-fair-in-love-and-free-beats">here</a>. Now, I&#8217;m a producer myself and for the most part, I give beats away for free, whether it be for fans or for rappers I trust. I also sample. Now, I haven&#8217;t got the kind of budget Kanye West has so I can&#8217;t just start putting my music anywhere and everywhere for large sums, hence the &#8220;freeness&#8221;. My main problem with this guy&#8217;s mantra is his ideology that music has always been business and by giving away free beats, this damages business and music. This is <strong>all wrong</strong>. MusicÂ <strong>industry</strong> is all about business because it&#8217;s the industry. Music has always been about the culture that creates it, the emotions conveyed through it and because of it. These two things should never be confused but unfortunately they are everyday.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an ongoing non-battle between making the most money out of your ideas and giving your ideas away for free. The former is thrown in our faces by the successful media-savvy entrepreneurs you see on TV and in the newspapers telling us how THEY weren&#8217;t affected by the recession because they were intelligent enough to know how to avoid it, to &#8220;ride the storm&#8221;. We&#8217;re told this is the way to go if we want to get out of the deep black hole those same money hungry people put us in. On the other side, we have the &#8220;crazy radical new thinkers&#8221; who do this crazy radical new thing where theyÂ <em>give their work away for free</em> (or a low cost, because there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch). People like Prince, for example, are seen by some as weird and social pariahs and free ideas just add to this media mystique they have created for him. He was once quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>If you give away an idea, you still own that idea. In fact, giving it away strengthens it. Why do people feel they have to take credit for everything they do? Ego, thatâs the only reason.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>I live by this. Sort of. I admire those who live by it and it works for them. Unfortunately, the industry won&#8217;t allow this unless you, paradoxically, have the money to fall back on should it fail. Most ideas you hear in hip hop tracks these days don&#8217;t come out of thin air; originality in sound is all but dead in places other than the originality in inspiration. How many times have you heard those 9th Wonder snares in a track? Or a full 808 kit used in a trap song? However, nobody is really making the kind of music someone like Flying Lotus puts together. When you give it some thought, a lot of these artists would probably work for free and give their music away if money didn&#8217;t have such a chokehold on their movements, and a lot of them do.</p>
<p>Instead of attacking those who give music away for free and tarring &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; producers with the same brush by doing so, we should question the quality of the poor generic music being giving away for money. Is a free beat really the disease sucking goodness out of music or does Nicki Minaj&#8217;s discography need to be scrutinised? There are plenty more issues within hip hop (and music) such as misogyny and violence before we can give this non-battle some brainpower. Look at the culture and the history and how sampling without the tight pressures of copyright shaped the golden age &#8211; it was all about the love and the message sent out. Now we&#8217;re stuck with illiterate, terrible hashtag rapping, tight zebra-printed legging wearing, money waving, fauxhemian pandering, constantly collaborating rappers asking for beats to &#8220;kill&#8221;. But perhaps that&#8217;s another debate for another day. I&#8217;ll let you know when I&#8217;m free&#8230; or should I add a cost to my time?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/040.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1038" title="Family Yoga Class" src="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/040.jpg" alt="New Experience 38 Family Yoga" width="640" height="699" /></a>Yoga is one of the ways I like to relax. Â Occasionally my kids will see me doing a few yoga poses in the living room and join me for a downward dog or two. Â Leah especially loves yoga Â and likes to show off her tree pose from time to time.</p>
<p>When I saw that one of my favorite yoga studios, <a title="Princeton Center for Yoga and Health" href="http://www.princetonyoga.com/">Princeton Center for Health and Yoga</a>, was offering a Family Yoga class as a special event, I knew it would be a great new experience for use to try.</p>
<p>I am so glad we went. Â The class far exceeded my expectations. Â I thought we&#8217;d do a few animal poses and call it a day, but the class was far more organized and incorporated more of yoga&#8217;s relaxation benefits than I thought it would.</p>
<p>When we entered the studio, the instructor, Loring Nagle, told us to get a mat and a Focus Friend. Â I had no idea what a Focus Friend was for, but my kids loved the selection of small stuffed animals. Â Luke chose an octopus, and Leah took a frog on a lily pad.</p>
<p><a href="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/036.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" title="Focus Friend" src="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/036.jpg" alt="holding a focus friend" width="640" height="699" /></a>We arranged our mats in a semicircle and started with an introductory song that celebrated each person in the group. Â We stretched a bit to warm up and then prepared to do Leah&#8217;s favorite, the tree pose. Â Loring told us to place our Focus Friends a few feet in front of us so we could stare at them as we balanced on one foot. Â It worked so well that I may need to bring a Focus Friend to the next yoga class I go to on my own!</p>
<p>As the class continued, I was very impressed with the way Loring brought the perfect mix of playfulness and concentration to the class. Â I suppose that all yoga classes should bring those two elements, but it is especially important when teaching children. Â Bring too much playfulness, and the kids will get silly and have a hard time settling down. Â Bring too much concentration, and the class might seem more like work than relaxation. Â  I need to remember to stay as calm and serene as a yoga instructor in my daily interactions with my children. Â They responded so well to Loring&#8217;s style.</p>
<p>Both Luke and Leah had fun during the class. Â Luke enjoyed doing Sun Salutations to music. Â Leah liked doing the cat/cow stretches and making a forest of trees during the Tree Pose.</p>
<p><a href="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/038.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" title="child in downward dog pose" src="http://52brandnew.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/038.jpg" alt="family yoga class" width="640" height="699" /></a>I love watching my children in their role as students. Â I also had an opportunity to do this when we took a <a title="cooking class" href="http://52brandnew.com/2012/08/30/new-experience-34-cooking-class/">cooking class</a>, and it is interesting to see a side of them I don&#8217;t often get to see. Â Luke is a very serious student. Â The concentration on his face was visible as he touched every finger to his thumb during a meditation exercise. Â Leah aims to please. Â She raised her hand every time the instructor asked a question, even if she had no answer.</p>
<p>The class ended the way a traditional yoga class ends, with savasana (also called corpse pose). Â We stretched out on our backs on the floor. Â Loring instructed us to place our Focus Friend on our bellies and watch it move up and down as we breathed in and out. Â She came around to each person and massaged a little lavender-scented lotion on our feet. Â Leah turned to me and said, &#8220;That felt SO good!&#8221; Luke also commented on how much he liked the foot massage.</p>
<p>We all left class feeling both relaxed and energized. Â I just wish we could take a Family Yoga class more often!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a term people use for dogs that stay constantly by their owners: Â velcro dogs. Â These canines are akin to the famous fabric hook-and-loop fastener in that they cling strongly to their person and it can be difficult to separate them. Some velcro dogs will also display separation anxiety and become destructive to property or themselves when unable to be with their favorite human. Â I should also point out that some people have separation anxiety from their dogs and actually seek out or encourage velcro behavior.</p>
<p>I, for one, like being able to go to the bathroom without being dogged or hounded byÂ four-legged critters. Â Â Even the terms &#8220;to dog&#8221; and &#8220;hounding&#8221; came about from the fact that canines can be hard to get away from. Â That being said, I do have a velcro dog. Â Yep, that&#8217;s right, Grimm is as sticky as glue&#8211;Gorilla glue, not the puny Elmer&#8217;s variety. Â And, alas, if I forget to close the bathroom door completely, private time becomes doggy social hour. Â Nothing is more annoying than having a live dog rug underfoot when you are trying to urinate or move your bowels. Â No amount of threats or shoving mean anything to a dog when your pants are down around your ankles. Â They know a compromising situation when they see it.</p>
<div id="attachment_374" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/grimm-on-his-new-bed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-374" title="Grimm on his new bed" src="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/grimm-on-his-new-bed.jpg?w=300&h=234" alt="" width="300" height="234" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wait&#8230;are you going to the bathroom? I&#8217;ll come with you. Oh, you&#8217;re just throwing away a piece of trash? I better follow you, just in case. I know it&#8217;s only twelve feet away from where we are now, but you may need my help. You just never know.</p></div>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8211;I like having a loyal dog. Â Loyal as in,Â &#8221;I will warn you of possible intruders&#8221;Â or &#8220;I won&#8217;t run away with the first person to offer me a tasty treat&#8221; orÂ &#8221;I will protect you from bodily harm.&#8221; Â Not loyal as in &#8220;I will help you flush the toilet&#8221; or &#8220;I will trip you when you are cooking hot things because I lay behind you when you are at the stove.&#8221; Â I like to think Grimm would perform well in all of the first scenarios and I know for a fact Â that he can do all of the second ones. Â This dog is never more than ten feet from me at all times unless we are outside. Â Even then, he will keep me in his sight.</p>
<p>Charley, in his old age, has developed some velcro dog tendencies, but only when indoors. Â  Really, he is only attached to me when I am sitting down, like when I&#8217;m writing or watching something on television. Â At times like those, he likes to lay at my feet. Â I can deal with that sort of attachment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_376" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/charley-watches-me.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-376" title="Charley Watches Me" src="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/charley-watches-me.jpg?w=300&h=267" alt="" width="300" height="267" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Are you fixin&#8217; [Charley is a Texas dog through and through] to sit down? If so, I&#8217;m gonna lay on your feet. Hope ya don&#8217;t mind, but if you do, too bad. I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway.</p></div>Zella, on the other hand, is more independent. Â She likes to sleep on the couch, away from me and the other dogs, when we are relaxing inside. Â She&#8217;ll watch me to see what&#8217;s up, but won&#8217;t follow me room to room like Grimm does. Â When outside, she doesn&#8217;t run away or try to escape and comes when called, but she doesn&#8217;t have to keep me in her sight.</p>
<div id="attachment_377" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-proper-lady.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-377 " title="A Proper Lady" src="http://grimmsfurrytail.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-proper-lady.jpg?w=220&h=356" alt="" width="220" height="356" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you need me, let me know. I&#8217;ll just be over here lounging on the couch.</p></div>
<p>George Eliot (who was actually Mary Anne Evans&#8211; but I digress) once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#2f7e7b;">WeÂ long for an affection altogether ignorant of our faults. Â Heaven has accorded this to us in the uncritical canine attachment.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I agree that we, as humans, seek affection from those who would love us despite our short-comings, attachment and affection are not the same things. Attachment can become co-dependence, co-dependence can become obsession and obsession can become neuroses. Â A neurotic dog is not something I want to encourage. Â I don&#8217;t want to find Grimm turning into the canine version of<em> Single White Female</em>.</p>
<p>For now, Grimm is working on his stays and learning some independence. Â To teach independence, I start by increasing his confidence. Â To do this, I work him in scenarios that he is not entirely sure of (like walking through ladders, climbing on unstable (but not dangerous) objects, jumping over obstacles, etc.) so that he learns he can do things by himself. Â When I leave rooms, I make him stay on his dog bed and reward him with low-key praise when I return (as long as he stays on his bed and doesn&#8217;t come to me&#8211;I go to him). Â So far, he&#8217;s doing well. Â He shows great aptitude in learning new behaviors.</p>
<div>I owe it to Grimm to help him foster some independence. Â I love the relationship we as humans can have with our dogs. Â I don&#8217;t, however, need an entourage wherever I go. Â We don&#8217;t have to be attached at the hip. Â As Alex Clare sings,Â <a title="Too Close by Alex Clare" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYXjLbMZFmo" target="_blank">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurt you, but I need to breathe. Â At the end of it all, you&#8217;re still my best friend.&#8221;</a></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#2f7e7b;">&#8220;He is your friend, your partner, your defender, your dog. You are his life, his love, his leader. He will be yours, faithful and true, to the last beat of his heart. You owe it to him</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#2f7e7b;"> to be worthy of such devotion.&#8221;</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;" align="left"><span style="color:#2f7e7b;">Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &#8211;<strong>Â Unknown</strong></span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color:#233021;">Comfort <em>Food</em>, That Is</span></h3>
<p>There are some things in life that we always go back to when nothing else seems to do. It&#8217;s called <em>comfort food</em>.</p>
<p>Comfort food is the stuff that you want to eat when you&#8217;re depressed, when you&#8217;ve lost a limb, or when you&#8217;re girlfriend informs you that all along she has been an alien from Jupiter, and now she wants your brain to take back to her daddy.</p>
<p>Comfort food brings back fond memories of childhood and the &#8220;good-old-days&#8221; (unless you were a starving refugee), when Mom could make you feel better with nothing more than a spoonful of lard and some corn meal.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#233021;">Comfort Central</span></h3>
<p>Here in the southern United States we have a custom: when somebody dies, we eat.</p>
<p>Whenever a loved one passes away, bites the dust, or essentially assumes room temperature for an indefinite period of time, we trot them off to a funeral home, and then bring in every kind of unhealthy food imaginable. We all know that when one is suffering a terrible loss, comfort food will help dull the pain. And if nothing else, it will help you get to where your loved one is a little quicker than a salad will.</p>
<p>A typical southern funeral home has a dining area. This is where the family and friends can go when they are tired of standing around in the viewing room. They instinctively know that in that room is food which will make them feel better.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#233021;">Serious Comfort</span></h3>
<p>Well, not long ago my only blood-related uncle went home to be with the Lord. His body was taken to a funeral home in a place called Whitwell (pronounced &#8220;<em>Wutwool</em>&#8220;), Tennessee. And it was there that the funeral home staff did something that it does for all their families &#8211; serve <em>homemade pinto beans</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://recleg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pinto-beans-with-cornbread1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3422" title="pinto beans with cornbread" src="http://recleg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pinto-beans-with-cornbread1.jpg?w=1024&h=764" alt="" width="1024" height="764" /></a></p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t be fooled, folks. These are not your ordinary beans. These are about the best pinto beans you will ever put in your ever-loving mouth! Served with some homemade cornbread, these beans made me tear up (no joke) as I remembered my granny, my dad, and a much, <em>MUCH</em> simpler life down on the river.</p>
<p>What makes these pintos so special is that they were soaked for 24 hours in water, then slow-cooked the next day in a crock pot with several slices of thick bacon. Of course, there&#8217;s more to it than that, but there <em>are</em> secrets to keep.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#233021;">A Holy Command</span></h3>
<p>Why do we prepare such food for funerals? Seriously? For one thing, sometimes it is hard to find the right words to say when someone is hurting. That&#8217;s when people do what they can, and many times the only thing they can do is prepare good food. Hurting people need to be cared for, and this is one way to show it.</p>
<p>Comforting one another is also something we are <em>commanded</em> to do.Â 1Thessalonians 5:11 tells us to &#8220;<em>comfort yourselves together, and edify one another</em>.&#8221; And speaking of the hope ofÂ resurrectionÂ we have in Christ, the Apostle Paul said in the same letter, &#8220;<em>comfort one another with these words</em>&#8221; (1 Thess. 4:8).</p>
<p>But what happens when words are hard to find? Make a pot of seriously savory pinto beans and cornbread. Tears of heartache may turn into tears of culinary joy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If my thinking is incorrect I offer an apology</p>
<p>I am told the study of bugs is known as entomology</p>
<p>So if that&#8217;s true I&#8217;m wondering where all those experts are</p>
<p>For the marmorated stink bug has returned from fields afar</p>
<p><a href="http://karmatruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thumbnail-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2537" title="thumbnail (5)" src="http://karmatruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thumbnail-5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="243" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re clinging to the screened porch and the doors that lead outside</p>
<p>The windows are no safer, for into their seams they hide</p>
<p>They&#8217;re propagating with ferocity, their will to live intense</p>
<p>The bugzooka has been broken with its suction rife with dents</p>
<p><a href="http://karmatruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thumbnail-31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2538" title="thumbnail (3)" src="http://karmatruck.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thumbnail-31.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="273" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m thoroughly disgusted, by their armor and their shell</p>
<p>By their asserted squatters&#8217; rights which are making my life hell</p>
<p>Please Â understand it&#8217;s viral, like an insect form of MRSA</p>
<p>These bugs are killing my morale instead of vice versa</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a teenager, my older brother brought his lovely, poised new girlfriend home to meet us. He introduced me by saying, âAnd this is Diane; she can cloud up and rain at a Hallmark commercial.â</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Dear God. It was â and still is â true. And it remains something about me I would change in a heartbeat if I could.</p>

<p>In Christian circles we are fond of saying, âtears are a gift from Godâ. The idea is that the ability to feel deeply and express ourselves openly is something God values and has given us out of His abundance. Someone will usually quote John 11:35: &#8220;Jesus wept&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>I appreciate gifts, I really do. But this is one I would love to exchange. </strong></p>
<p>No offense, God, but even at this late date maybe I could switch it out for something like a more robust and uninhibited sense of humor; perhaps a penchant for effortless hospitality; or maybe a slightly longer fuse when things don&#8217;t go my way? Heck, Iâd be happy if I could just multitask a little better.</p>
<p><strong>Understand, I chose a career in law enforcement. </strong></p>
<p>This is not a field where one can or should get all bound up in <em>feelings</em>, especially a woman in what has traditionally been thought a âmanâs jobâ. Â I spent 21 years exposed to cruelty and unfairness. There was a lot of sadness.</p>
<p>But the way I handled it without tearing up or breaking down was to redirect my emotional energy into a white-hot desire to see that justice was served. (A lot of the guys I worked with handled things the same way; it wasnât necessarily a gender thing.)</p>
<p>I memorized verses like Micah 6:8:</p>
<blockquote><p>â<em>And what does the </em><em>Lord</em><em> require of you? To act justly and to love mercy</em><em>Â </em><em>and to walk humbly with your God.â</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </em>and Amos 5:24:</p>
<blockquote><p>â<em>Let justice roll on like a river and righteousness like a never-ending stream</em>.â</p></blockquote>
<p>(I like it when things are spelled out clearly in Scripture, especially in list form. And those nature images work for me every time, too.)</p>
<p>As I drove the government car to and from work or around the community working cases, I kept the radio tuned to a Christian station, just to keep me grounded in the reality of Who was really in charge.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, I occasionally had to do multiplication tables in my head</strong> or bite the inside of my mouth till it bled, to keep from visibly succumbing to emotion. I mean, the last thing I wanted was to be seen as weak. But for the most part, re-framing my deep feelings as a source of energy for the job I did worked pretty well for me in my career.</p>
<p>On a personal level, itâs something I havenât mastered.</p>
<p>There are people in my life (and yours, too) who are not moved by tears; theyâd rather we extreme feelers would just get over it and <em>do</em> something. I get that. Â Me, too.</p>
<p>So I strive to âman upâ and redirect my emotions in a tangible direction in my personal life. Iâm all about the cause of social justice now and I passionately support organizations that pursue it. I get angry about modern day slavery and child abuse and gender inequality.</p>
<p>Pray. Give money. Sponsor a child. Write.</p>
<p><strong>And all these things I care about, that matter so much? Yep. They make me cry. Â Â </strong></p>
<p>Tears are like an underground spring. You might cap it in one place, but itâs going to bubble up somewhere else eventually. Trying to plug up all those fissures in the rock is exhausting. Iâm exhausted.</p>
<p><em>Stop trying to stuff it. Let the tears flow. Embrace the gift. Accept who you are. </em>Iâve heard all that. And Iâm working on it. I know Iâm supposed to ask God to break my heart for the things that break His. I do.</p>
<p>But I keep looking for the gift receipt on this package. I figure if God values tears so much, they should be worth something dandy in exchange. And then I could stop crying at those emotionally manipulative commercials, too.</p>
<p><strong>Any ideas?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And we&#8217;re back with a new edition &#8211; this time, it&#8217;s Victoria&#8217;s Secret that&#8217;s getting the fire for selling this:</h6>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Victoria's Secret 1" src="http://abcnews.go.com/images/News/ht_victoria_geisha_cc_120925_wblog.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="269" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So Geisha&#8221;, right? Easily the best way VS could have come up with to pay tribute to Japanese motifs and styles, right? Though I doubt that in their minds they actually made the difference between Japan and the rest of Asia &#8211; must have gone something like &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do something <em>exotic</em> for a change!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Well, what about something to do with Asia? That&#8217;s really exotic! They use chopsticks there!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Don&#8217;t they have geishas there too, like super hot fighting foxy ladies?&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Hey, yeah, let&#8217;s use that!&#8221; And of course the model is a white-skinned, blonde woman. <span id="more-181"></span></h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">It gets worse with the description on the right-hand side: &#8220;Your ticket to an exotic adventure: a sexy mesh teddy with flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals. Sexy little fantasies, thereâs one for every sexy you.&#8221; Once again, a very diverse set of cultures (Asian ones) is reduced to an exotic stereotype and appropriated for the benefit of white Anglo culture. Not to mention it reeks of sexual fetishizing, insofar as the &#8216;geisha&#8217; identity has been appropriated and reconstructed to match a white sexual fantasy &#8211; that of the mysterious, sexualized Oriental woman. You can&#8217;t understand her culture, so you rip that culture apart and assert your dominance by making the woman a fetishistic stereotype. (It also seems nowadays that <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2009/05/13/geishas-and-whores/">white people would know more about what it takes to make a geisha</a> than people with, you know, <em>actual Japanese roots and knowledge of Japanese culture</em>.)</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And of course there have been tons of people to say this is going too far, that there&#8217;s nothing wrong or racist with this, sometimes citing Japan&#8217;s own geisha culture. Must we be so blind to the reality of power relations that we fail to see how white bastardization of other cultures truly works &#8211; by innocently taking over these cultures and reducing them to trends and cute fashion for white ladies? VS isn&#8217;t promoting here the beauty of Japanese culture and floral patterns; it is instrumentalizing it in the realization of a sexy costume, therefore objectifying the women it attaches to this &#8216;geisha culture&#8217;. People comparing this to a French maid outfit need to get their heads readjusted: the French maid is of course an objectifying costume, but nowhere does it carry the racist overtones the &#8216;geisha&#8217; one does, simply because the white relationship to other white cultures can&#8217;t be put on the same level as its relationship to non-white cultures.We can go back to the movie <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em> to remember this: beyond the movie&#8217;s accuracy in its depiction of &#8216;geisha culture&#8217;, what we see at work there is the taking over by Americans of Japan after WW2, and the often brutal dismissal by Americans of Japanese traditions, replaced with American fantasies about Japan.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:justify;">And please don&#8217;t come up to me with the argument &#8220;<em>Hey my best Asian</em> (because as we all know, Asian is a nationality, right?) <em>friend has seen this and doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s racist at all</em>!&#8221;. It. Doesn&#8217;t. Work. Having an Asian/Black/any non-white friend gives you no legitimacy whatsoever to consider that something isn&#8217;t racist and to treat it as if it were not problematic for other people because, by doing so, you&#8217;re dismissing the legitimate perceptions of non-white people who feel offended by the act of racism. How difficult is it to get that?</h6>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nfl-logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-267" title="nfl-logo" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/nfl-logo.jpg?w=370&h=245" alt="" width="370" height="245" /></a>I&#8217;m as big a football fan as the next guy, but I&#8217;m having a very difficult time generating any real empathy for the position of the &#8220;regular&#8221; NFL officials who are still essentially out on strike.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all in favor of people being properly compensated for their work, but I also believe that the free market economy should have a significant role in establishing what <em>is</em> a fair and equitable rate of compensation for any job.</p>
<p>NOTE:Â I&#8217;m going to leave out post-season play for the purposes of the following comparisons.</p>
<p>Do you know what NFL officials earn now? Â Under the current agreement, NFL officials earn an average salary of $149,000 per year. Â This is for a season that runs from August until December; a 5 month work year. Â NFL officials are, and always have been, considered to be part-time employees. Â By the way, a brand new first-year NFL official earns $78,000 per year.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, Major League Baseball umpires earn an average of $200-300,000 per year. Â Now before you scream &#8220;foul&#8221; in favor of the downtrodden NFL referees, let&#8217;s remember that the MLB umpire work year stretches from March (spring training) through October, 8 months. Â The MLB umpires are also considered full-time, professional employees.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s compare. Â A part-time job which pays $149,000 per year versus a full-time job which pays $200-300,000 per year. Â That sounds like a fair balance, particularly considering that in the case of both positions, the league in question pays all of their travel and hotel expenses.</p>
<p>How many of you who are reading this would turn down a part-time job paying $149,000 per year?</p>
<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/goodell1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258" title="Goodell" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/goodell1.jpeg" alt="" width="252" height="200" /></a>Another sticking point in the current negotiations between the NFL and the officials is the league&#8217;s desire to eliminate the current NFL official&#8217;s pension and replace it with a 401k plan. Â I have to ask, what other part-time job comes complete with a pension plan in the first place? Â The NFL&#8217;s position is that most corporations are doing the exact same thing for their employees. Â In fact, Roger Goodell, the Commissioner of the NFL, is not covered by a pension plan.</p>
<p>The officials are apparently okay with this proposal in principle, but in practice they want the NFL to fund their individual 401k plans to the tune of Â approximately $38,000 per year.</p>
<p>$38,000 per year. Â Did you know that $38,000 per year is <em>more</em> than the current annual median income in the United States? Â I worked in the corporate world for over 30 years and I can assure you that I never received a 401k matching contribution anywhere close to $38,000 from my employer.</p>
<p>So where are we? Â $149,000 per year annual salary, a part-time job with a 5 month work year, all travel expenses covered, and the company wants to kick in a 401k plan.</p>
<p><a href="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ref.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-265" title="Ref" src="http://opinionatedmiscellany.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ref.jpg?w=197&h=220" alt="" width="197" height="220" /></a>I have to tell you; that&#8217;sÂ soundsÂ like a pretty sweet deal to me. Â And I&#8217;m sure it does to the hundreds of thousands of folks across this country who currently findÂ themselvesÂ under- and unemployed.</p>
<p>My advice to the NFL officials who continue to hold out for more: Â Either get back to work or tender your resignations so somebody else can take your place.</p>
<p>Time to get on with it, gentlemen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/katong-windows21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="windows" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/katong-windows21.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="338" /></a>Conservation of our heritage is very important in Singapore, perhaps this is one of the few ways to remember the past. Shophouses, both residential and commercial, are important building types in Singapore&#8217;s architectural heritage. Shophouses were designed traditionally a business and dwelling unit with a narrow frontage. My journey on foot took me to places I&#8217;ve never knew they existed in Singapore. Shophouses are pretty much located everywhere here. Emerald Hill, Tanjong Pagar Road, Chinatown, Beach Road, Joo Chiat Road, Club Street, Kitchener Road, Katong, etc. Do you know that shophouses from say, Katong are very much different from shophouses situated in Club Street? There are many architectural styles influencing the design of shophouses, to name a few; Early, First Transitional, Late, Art Deco, Rococo, Edwardian, Neoclassical and Modern. Here&#8217;s a quick guide to identify shophouses.</p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84" title="shophouse blueprint" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85" title="shophouse blueprint 2" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shophouse-blueprint-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Even windows belong to different types of style period. The Katong Shophouses clearly have a strong Peranakan influence while Club Street Shophouses have an electric mixture of Modern, Art Deco and Transitional styles. Each walkway (around 5-foot width), windows, tiles and colours have a story to tell. Below shows shophouses of the same area in different period of time. Pastel colours were used with little differentiation of individual houses (not to forget huge shop names were craved onto the pillars for easy identification). Now, shophouses are given a new lease of life with fresh coats of vibrant colours, the intensity that somehow reflects their importance, unwilling to let passers-by forget their existence.</p>
<p><a href="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tanjong-pagar-before-after.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89" title="tanjong pagar before after" src="http://smalltalesofsg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tanjong-pagar-before-after.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="186" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a few interesting dwellings that are hidden along the streets of Katong. The Rococo-styled shophouses along East Coast, built well into 1930s, are very much similar in style from those in Little India. From the facade, they are highly decorative and vibrant in colours. Of course, Rococo was a highly decorative style in the 18th century architecture where a lot of motifs like coral and foliage were used along window frames. Turning into a small road along East Coast Road lies a row of single-storey terraces known as &#8216;barrack houses&#8217;. A flight of stairs leads to the main living floor, a typical style seen in Anglo-Malay bungalows. If you peep under the stairs, you can see that there are spacious living spaces at the basement.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Colours in Chinese architecture are meaningful. While red, blue and green are considered auspicious, the Peranakan Chinese grew fond of green for their porcelain and architecture. Today&#8217;s shophouses have been transformed, serving many purposes such as clan associations, coffeeshops, living spaces, boutique hotels and temples. Took a lot of pictures while walking around. The architecture is simply breathtaking. There are a few good reads about Singapore&#8217;s shophouses in the library which I highly recommend to those who are interested in learning more about our heritage. If you have time, also check out the tours organised by The Original Singapore Walks. (http://www.journeys.com.sg/singaporewalks/index.asp). Personally, I have never been on their tours but their itinerary sounds interesting and Â I would love to go for one. The world of shophouses is limitless, be sure to look out for one when you walk around Singapore.Â <strong>STSG</strong></p>
