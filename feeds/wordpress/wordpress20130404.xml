				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>There is a hole that can&#8217;t be filled. One of the greats has left us. Roger Ebert has passed away at the age of 70. <a title="http://suntm.es/Z4EIOF" href="http://t.co/FY4Kb9BUdn">suntm.es/Z4EIOF</a></p>
<p>— Suntimes (@Suntimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/Suntimes/status/319896006147854336">April 4, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I can&#8217;t say that I ever spoke to Roger Ebert,</strong> but I can say I was once in the same room with him &#8212; specifically, the critics&#8217; screening room in Chicago, where as the entertainment editor for my college newspaper I watched a terrible movie called <em>Farewell to the King</em>, and he and Gene Siskel were there as well, sitting, if I remember correctly, in the back of the little theater. Other critics were snarking and catcalling the screen (I mentioned it wasn&#8217;t a very good film), and either Siskel or Ebert (it was dark and I was facing the screen) told them to shut it. They shut it. After the movie was done I rode down in the elevator with him. And that was my brush with greatness, film critic style.</p>
<p>For all that I consider Ebert to be one of my most important writing teachers. He was my teacher in a real and practical sense &#8212; I was hired at age 22 to be a newspaper film critic, with very little direct practical experience in film criticism (not withstanding <em>Farewell to the King</em>, I mostly reviewed music for my college paper). I was hired in May of 1991, but wouldn&#8217;t start until September, which left me the summer to get up to speed. I did it by watching three classic movies a night (to the delight of my then-roommates), and by buying every single review book Roger Ebert had out and reading every single review in them.</p>
<p>He was a great teacher. He was passionate about film &#8212; not just <em>knowledgeable </em>about films and directors and actors, but in love with the form, in a way that came through in every review. Even when a movie was bad, you could tell that at least part of the reason Ebert was annoyed was because the film failed its medium, which could achieve amazing things. But as passionate as he was about film, he wasn&#8217;t <em>precious</em> about it. Ebert loved film, but what I think he loved most of all was the fact that it entertained him so. He loved being entertained, and he loved telling people, in language which was direct and to the point (he worked for the <em>Sun-Times</em>, the blue collar paper in town) what about the films was so entertaining. What he taught me about film criticism is that film criticism isn&#8217;t about showing off what you know about film, it was about sharing what made you love film.</p>
<p>I saw how much Roger Ebert loved film that summer, through his reviews and his words. By the end of the summer, I loved film too. And I wanted to do what he did: Share that love and make people excited about going to the movies, sitting there with their popcorn, waiting to be entertained in the way only film can entertain you.</p>
<p>I left newspaper film criticism &#8212; not entirely voluntarily &#8212; but even after I left that grind I still loved writing about film and went back to it when I could. I wrote freelance reviews for newspapers, magazines and online sites; I&#8217;ve published two books about film. Every year I make predictions about the Oscars here on the site. And I can tell you (roughly) the domestic box office of just about every studio film since 1991. All of that flows back to sitting there with Roger Ebert&#8217;s words, catching the film bug from him. There are other great film critics, of course (I also have a soft spot for Pauline Kael, which is not entirely surprising), but Ebert was the one I related to the most, and learned the most from.</p>
<p>In these later years and after everything that he&#8217;d been through with cancer and with losing the ability to physically speak, I read and was contemplative about the essays and pieces he put up on his Web site. Much of that had nothing to do with film criticism, but was a matter of him writing&#8230; well, whatever. Which meant it was something I could identify with to a significant degree, since that is what I do here. It would be foolish to say that Ebert losing his physical voice freed him to find his voice elsewhere. What I think may be more accurate was that losing his physical voice reminded Ebert that he still had things he wanted to say before he ran out of time to say them.</p>
<p>His Web essays have a sharp, bright but autumnal quality to them; the leaves were still on the trees but the colors were changing and the snap was in the air. It seemed to me Ebert wrote them with the joy of living while there is still life left. I loved these essays but they also made me sad. I knew as a reader they couldn&#8217;t last. And of course they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I had always meant to send Ebert a copy of <em>Old Man&#8217;s War</em>, for no other reason than as a token of appreciation. I knew he was a science fiction geek through and through (he had a penchant for giving science fiction films an extra star if they were especially groovy in the departments of effects and atmosphere). I wanted to sign the book to him and let him know how much his work meant to me &#8212; and for him to have the experience of the book before the movie, whenever that might be. I tried getting in touch with one of his editors at the <em>Sun-Times</em>, who I used to freelance for in college, to get it to him, but never heard back from her. Later it would turn out he and I had the same film/tv agent, who offered to forward on the book for me. I kept meaning to send off the book. I never did. I regret it now.</p>
<p>Although he can&#8217;t know it now, I still think it&#8217;s worth saying: Thank you, Roger Ebert, for being my teacher and for being such a good writer, critic and observer of the world. You made a difference in my life, and it is richer for having your words in it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fitisafeministissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/orange-juice.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3132" alt="Orange-Juice" src="http://fitisafeministissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/orange-juice.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a>Recently, in response to a comment I made about the calories in fruit juice, a friend said to me that fruit juice is &#8220;evil.&#8221; I am a philosopher who does a lot of ethics. So &#8220;evil&#8221; means something quite severe to me. Hitler and Pol Pot were evil.  Fruit juice, not so much.</p>
<p>I checked back with my friend. No, he didn&#8217;t mean it was literally evil. Just that it&#8217;s as bad as a can of Coke.  Still pretty bad, if not downright evil. It&#8217;s a &#8220;sometimes&#8221; food, not an everyday food. Other anti-juice people jumped in to clarify further. Juice is really, really bad FOR you. Harley Pasternak demonized it the other day in his talk too.  He said that a cup and half of OJ has 240 calories. That&#8217;s not quite right, since a cup has 112 calories.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t want to quibble about orange juice in particular. It&#8217;s this whole notion of good foods and bad foods that really gets under my skin. Very few foods, eaten in moderate quantities, are actually bad for you. I ate a big and delicious piece of vegan chocolate cake yesterday.  I don&#8217;t believe it was in the least bad for me. Why? Because I don&#8217;t eat cake every day. I eat it about once or twice a month.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t trace the quote exactly, but a long time ago I read a great response by George Cohon of McDonald&#8217;s, to the claim that McDonald&#8217;s food was &#8220;bad for you.&#8221; He said something like that McDonald&#8217;s never said you should eat its food three meals a day, seven days a week.  I hesitate to agree with him (because McDonald&#8217;s is problematic in other ways, in my view), but I agree. McDonald&#8217;s and orange juice, chocolate cake and potato chips&#8230;all of these can be part of a healthy diet without doing damage to the person who ingests them.</p>
<p>Moralizing food by calling some of it &#8220;bad&#8221; and some of it &#8220;good&#8221; gives the false impression that foods in themselves have moral qualities. It isn&#8217;t a huge jump, and people make this jump all the time, to the claim that people who eat &#8220;good&#8221; foods in the &#8220;right&#8221; amounts are virtuous and people who do not are bad.</p>
<p>We frequently think of chocolate cake as &#8220;sinfully delicious&#8221; and &#8220;decadent.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve spoken to many a dieter who said, not that they had a good week, but that they were &#8220;good&#8221; that week.  If they wandered off the plan by eating something they weren&#8217;t supposed to, they were &#8220;bad&#8221; that week.  Some foods are considered &#8220;guilty pleasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of both the  <a title="Intuitive Eating: What It Is and Why I Love It!" href="http://fitisafeministissue.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/intuitive-eating-what-it-is-and-why-i-love-it/">intuitive eating approach</a> and the <a title="Overcoming Overeating: Overview, Review, and Update" href="http://fitisafeministissue.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/overcoming-overeating-not-for-everyone/">the demand feeding approach to food </a>is that they both tell us to &#8220;legalize&#8221; all foods.  Carrot sticks are as legal as carrot cake, neither better nor worse than the other. I can already hear the rumblings in the comments.  &#8220;But carrot sticks are better for you than carrot cake!&#8221;  I can even hear those who would jump in against carrot sticks because they have a higher sugar content than celery sticks.</p>
<p>The whole thing brings me back to the idea of moderation, which <a title="Experiments in moderation" href="http://fitisafeministissue.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/experiments-in-moderation/" target="_blank">Sam wrote about </a>in such a lovely way recently.  We can live life by strict rules and have all sorts of forbidden foods on a black list if we like.  But forbidden foods are, for many of us, more attractive for being forbidden.</p>
<p>I know that when I finally truly legalized all foods, french fries, which I&#8217;d considered my favorite food for all of my life, suddenly lost their appeal. They&#8217;re okay, and I do enjoy them from time to time. But are they my favorite foods? No. If I had a choice of giving up fries for the rest of my life or giving up mangoes for the rest of my life, I&#8217;d give up the fries. And not because they&#8217;re &#8220;bad&#8221; or even &#8220;bad for me,&#8221; but because I simply love a good fresh mango.</p>
<p>The food police are those people who like to jump in and tell you about the evil foods that are bad for you and that you should avoid. I&#8217;m not interested in what they have to say.  I am extremely well informed about nutrition and used to be able to rhyme off all sorts of fun facts about countless foods. I wrote them down every day and <a title="Tracking and the Panopticon" href="http://fitisafeministissue.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/tracking-and-the-panopticon/">kept meticulous count</a>. I avoided fruit juice and all caloric drinks so as not to waste the stingily parceled out grams of this or that.  Like so many people, I felt so incredibly virtuous when I stuck with it, often for months and even years at a time.</p>
<p>I convinced myself, as I have heard so many others do, that I just <em>loved</em> this way of eating. It was <em>so great! </em>And I was <em>so good!</em> Meanwhile, I felt deprived, especially around celebrations and special occasions, which are enhanced by taking a meal together.  I had my false sense of virtue, but it wasn&#8217;t much fun.</p>
<p>I have also witnessed the effect of &#8220;virtuous&#8221; eating on others who were not so virtuous but who thought they should be. People would apologize for themselves for eating. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be having this, but&#8230;&#8221;  That is always a preamble to the next day&#8217;s self-flagellation, &#8220;I was so <em>bad</em> at my daughter&#8217;s wedding yesterday.&#8221;   Or this one, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a sliver.&#8221;  When I was a young adult, my mother and I polished off close to whole banana loaf over the course of an evening by taking little slivers.  Even today I look back and think I should have just cut off a good sized slice, slathered it with butter, sat down with it, and enjoyed it. Instead, I sneaked into the kitchen a few times and shaved off inadequate pieces that left me wanting more.</p>
<p>When we moralize foods into good, bad, evil even, we deny ourselves permission and set ourselves up not just as failures, but as <em>moral failures.</em></p>
<p>If the foods that made people feel so bad weren&#8217;t forbidden or &#8220;sinful&#8221; in the first place, they&#8217;d be less attractive and people would be less likely to eat more of them than is comfortable.</p>
<p>Are there any foods that, for health reasons, we simply should not eat EVER, that even in tiny amounts are &#8220;evil&#8221;? For some people, there are &#8220;trigger&#8221; foods that they simply cannot moderate.  I will have more to say about that in <a title="Moderation Won’t Work If You’re Addicted, but Are You Sure You’re Addicted?" href="http://fitisafeministissue.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/moderation-wont-work-if-youre-addicted-but-are-you-sure-youre-addicted/" target="_blank">another post</a>. And of course, some people are allergic to things that will kill them if they eat them. And as a vegan I am keenly aware of social, moral and political reasons for avoiding certain foods.</p>
<p>But those foods aside, I&#8217;m not sure if there are any foods that should never, ever, under any circumstances, be eaten because of our health. And if there are, fruit juice is not among them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Chew Mail Pouch" href="http://flic.kr/p/6HDKoP" target="_blank"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://nofacilities.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image_thumb.png?w=244&#038;h=165" width="244" height="165" align="right" border="0" /></a>Of all the things that technology has all but removed from our lives, the giving and receiving of directions is the one I have the most trouble getting used to. I’m good with not needing to write letters, look numbers up in a phone book, or lug a bunch of 8-tracks, cassettes or CD’s around in my car. I love my GPS (her name is Greta), but I miss the distinctly human practice of giving directions. I knew that at some point, I would be writing a “back in my day” post, and I guess that point is now.</p>
<p>I am like my father, who would always give you directions by landmark instead of highway exits and route numbers. Instead of “<i>take I-79 to Rt-50,</i>” he would say “<i>go down </i><i>(Interstate) 79 and get off like you’re going to Bobby’s gas station</i>.” Making matters worse, he didn&#8217;t limit himself to existing landmarks; he once gave me directions that included the phrase <i>“…and keep going until you get to where old-man Bedner’s barn used to be, then turn left” (the barn had burned down years before)</i>.</p>
<p>If you have ever looked at the ‘<a href="http://nofacilities.com/about/">About</a>’ page, you know that this blog gets its name from a stretch of the as yet unimproved I-79 near Morgantown, West Virginia where I went to college. Of course, “unimproved” is relative; in 1973, the West Virginia Turnpike was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Turnpike">two-lane undivided highway</a> separated by a common passing lane in some sections. It wasn’t necessary to get on I-79 to get to my apartment; but on the day that I was moving in, the directions the landlord had given me began with “<i>you’ll come into town on 19, then get on the new highway</i>” and proceeded from there. “19” referred to US-19, a piece of torturous highway that wound its way through the Allegheny Mountains and remained the road of choice for my father long after I-79 made it unnecessary. My trip began without a map; stay on Rt-19 until you cross into WV, get on I-79 and then follow the directions. <a href="http://nofacilities.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image1.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://nofacilities.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image_thumb1.png?w=76&#038;h=171" width="76" height="171" align="right" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have been able to find a map in Pittsburgh that included street level detail of Morgantown, WV even if I had tried. Maps were generally available (for free with a few gallons of gas) for the area you were in, and the highways in between you and your next likely destination; once you got there, you would get another map. I drove across the US and back across Canada using that system, and it worked pretty well. One of my favorite “map moments” occurred when my wife and I were still dating. We had gotten lost and as we thought about heading home, she somewhat sarcastically said “<i>I don’t suppose you even have a map in this car</i>.” I seized the moment to surprise her with my Exxon Map of the Eastern United States. Of course, that map, showing the US from the Mississippi River east, included the dozen or so major highways in CT, none of which we knew how to get to.</p>
<p>Getting lost has never been panic inducing event for me, partly because I get lost a lot, and partly because the act of getting lost has so often resulted in a surprising new find. After my wife and I drove around a while, we followed a stream of traffic and ended up at the Haddam Neck Fair. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we have returned to that fair many times on Labor Day weekends. On another occasion, when returning to our house from a friend’s in central CT, we took the wrong turn near Riverton, CT and ended up circumnavigating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saville_Dam">Barkhamsted reservoir</a>. We were lost for sure, but we enjoyed the ride. With the advent of GPS, driving has become a transaction, not an adventure – although I am still capable of making it an adventure as my family and friends will attest to. I have the ability to misunderstand the GPS directions, especially on Rt-128 near Waltham, MA.</p>
<div class="calloutpoint-blueBox">
<h2></h2>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">&#8230;continue ¾ of a mile, then turn left where the barn used to be</span></p>
</div>
<p>My wife still prefers paper maps, and she has a small collection of detailed books of street maps. She is a route-number traveler, something I will never understand. She prefers having a sense of the entire journey before we start driving. She’s not fond of my GPS, and less fond of the fact that I listen to Greta but I don’t always listen to her. The fact that I manage to get lost while using the GPS isn’t helping the adoption process. I look forward to the day when my GPS will be so sophisticated and have so much memory that I will be able to choose <b><i>Landmark Style</i></b> instructions and hear the female British voice say: “<i>continue ¾ of a mile, then turn left where the barn used to be</i>.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sarabran.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/veggies.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1245" alt="veggies" src="http://sarabran.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/veggies.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a>Here are some things I don’t want to put in my mouth; Blue Peter pets, Bambi, trotters, Shergar. Which is why, after a seven year break, I decided to return to a predominantly vegetarian diet at the beginning of this year. My New Year&#8217;s Resolution was of the ‘lets pencil that in’ variety until the whole &#8216;there&#8217;s a pony in your pie&#8217; story exploded and I thought I was going to gag up an equine kidney. Literally.</p>
<p>I first became a veggie in my late teens on the grounds that  I didn&#8217;t approve (in the way that only a 15-year-old can &#8216;not approve&#8217;) of the Diet of Diminished Responsibility as I called it. I had the idea that I would only eat what I could kill. Having experienced gut-spewing hours on the water, both lake and and sea, with just my dad, a fishing rod and a thunderous sky for company, fish were totally on my menu. Dad taught me how to reel in the thrashing creatures, unhooking their bloodied mouths before stopping, in a moment of bizarre reverence, to admire the rainbow-beauty of their silvery scales. Dad would gaze at the gasping fish, his eyes moistening, reading the scales like tea leaves before administering a merciful clout to the fishes head. Queasily, I&#8217;d watch the perfect silver ring of the fishes eyes retract making way for the wide black pupils of stillness. It felt raw, but somehow natural and oddly ok to skin, gut and cook ‘em up with garlic later that night. But maybe I&#8217;d just  read too much Hemmingway.  But so it was that my diet was veggie/pescatarian for some twenty years until the traumatic birth of my second daughter, the Biscuit Thief.</p>
<p>Within hours of the emergency C-section I had undergone, I became desperately anaemic and needed a blood transfusion. I still remember the sensation of a stranger&#8217;s blood seeping into my architecture like tar through a straw. It crept into me like a burgundy, life-saving syrup, carrying with it so much heat that I could trace its path around my broken body. Over the next few days, as the anaemia ebbed away, a gnawing started in my belly. My husband came to visit me in hospital and I looked at him like a shark looks at tiddlers.</p>
<p>“I think I&#8230;I&#8230;I think I need&#8230;I need a fucking steak!” I said, horrified.</p>
<p>I was like Alex the Lion in the Madagascar films when he imagines the lemurs and zebras turning into little sirloins such is the intensity of his meat-lust. Since that moment seven years ago, there has been nothing I wouldn&#8217;t do for a sausage until recently, the smell of meat, let alone the taste of it, started to make me feel unbelievably squeamish.  Thank fuck I&#8217;m not French.</p>
<p>And so I am back;  back to the demanding cooking, back to the endless peeling of root vegetables, back to the exotic adventures with cheese, back to endless reconfigurements of falafels and humous. Unfortunately for a vegetarian/pescatarian, I am not on speaking terms with eggs after a salmonella incident on top of a mountain in Spain where I puked and also pooed in front of a pop star and my new born baby had to sleep in a suitcase ~ but that’s another story. So without eggs, I have to work hard to get my protein.</p>
<p>Having been out of the quinoa-loving lifestyle for some years, I asked Twitter and Facebook for some vegetarian cookbook suggestions and these ones came out top. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Did you know that when a cat rubs her face or body all over something or someone, she&#8217;s basically saying, &#8220;I own this now.&#8221; Obviously, this has some functionality issues in the human world, but I can&#8217;t help but admire it. &#8220;I want this. Consider it mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, okay, I know how this all sounds, but stay with me. This is nonspecific to cat ladies.</p>
<p>I have had an interesting relationship with ownership &#8211; ownership of my own body, of my personality, of my mind, of my voice, of my right to space. My negative voices can often be heard whispering indignantly, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have the <em>right</em>.&#8221; Listening to those whispers does not leave one in a place of power. That idea very firmly plants a person into the victim-place, in every way. Things are happening <em>to you</em>, and all you can do is react.</p>
<p>This is true, to an extent. You can&#8217;t control the world, and you can only plan ahead so much &#8211; but you also don&#8217;t have to just accept what you&#8217;re given and never believe you have the right to hope for anything more. You don&#8217;t have to give the ownership of your life away to anyone else &#8211; whether it be a boss, a spouse, a friend, a parent. You have the right to see something that you want and try to make it become yours.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean this in a material sense &#8211; whatever floats your boat, but I don&#8217;t believe in the &#8216;everything is here for the taking&#8217; mentality of life. There are others to contend with, and it&#8217;s not okay to take whatever you want, especially if you are leaving less for others in the name of your want. That becomes greed very quickly. No, I mean this more in an intangible way &#8211; if you want to be something or someone, if you want a new career or a new lease on life, if you want to be respected at work, then rub your damn face all over it and make it yours! Don&#8217;t let those voices tell you that you have no right to be the person you want to become.</p>
<p>Also, isn&#8217;t my cat absurdly cute? Don&#8217;t be fooled &#8211; she&#8217;s bloodthirsty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:right;"><em>“We often forget that <strong>we are nature.</strong> Nature is not something separate from us. So when we say that we have lost our connection to nature, we’ve lost our connection to ourselves.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em>― Andy Goldsworthy</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you have a bucket list? I jokingly refer to mine when I think of something that I’d like to recount as a wrinkly, old lady, and which hopefully will have the added bonus of impressing my hypothetical grandchildren. “Swim with wild dolphins” was the first thing I ever added to my bucket list.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 weeks ago, I got to cross it off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My friend K and I were on a road trip in the far north of New Zealand’s north island. We stopped in a small, scenic town, signed ourselves up for an ‘eco-tour’ on small boat, and set sail on a blue-sky day in the early afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The skippers were keen to stress that we might not see any dolphins; that the dolphins are wild; that we cannot swim with them if babies are present, or if the dolphins body language suggests they’d rather be left alone. They warned us too that even if we did get into the water, the dolphins could want nothing to do with us and swim away. And under no circumstances were we to try and touch them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These messages were heartening in that the dolphin-experience would be a wild one, the dolphin’s safety was considered paramount, and the dolphins were in control of the situation. But the crushing disappointment I knew I’d feel if my dream didn’t come true was almost too much to bear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So 20 minutes into our trip, when one of the passengers leapt out of their seats and shouted, “look! Straight ahead!” I thought my heart would burst there and then. 1, 2, 3, then too-many-to-count metallic grey fins broke the water. “They’re coming closer!!” gasped a little boy, and sure enough, the dolphins soared towards the boat. If I reached over the barrier, I could have touched their noses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ok guys, if you want to swim, get your snorkels on now!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We slid into the water, as gracefully as large, rubber flippers and the sexy goggle-masks would allow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But I didn’t see the dolphins in the water – just grey-green darkness and other swimmers, scanning the murky waters for a glimpse of silver. We were asked to swim back to the boat. “You can get in again a little later.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we were sitting in the boat once more, the waters burst open, and a dolphin jumped up, up &#8211; and I’m fairly sure I stopped breathing. Then two dolphins jumped simultaneously, and I gripped the seat so tightly my knuckles went white.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In you go again!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I practically threw myself over the side of the boat. Plunging myself underwater, I couldn’t see a thing. I swam as hard and as fast as I could, away from the boat. And then I heard the unmistakable sound of cheerful clicking – the kind you might have heard on an ‘Ocean Sounds’ CD <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  I stared into the murky green depths, willing a dolphin to appear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then one did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right below me: a huge, silky creature with a grin on its face. He stared up at me, and then turned on his side, as if to get a better look. I have no doubt he was amused at the gangly, beige animal armed with colourful plastic floating above him. He twisted and spun, showing off and clicking, and I tried my best to keep up, whilst also trying to remember to breathe, and hoping my heart wouldn’t leap out of my mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he was gone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clicking faded, and I looked up to see the skippers signalling to those of us still in the water to come back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the way to the shore, K and I sat on the bow of the boat, our legs dangling over the side and our toes skimming the surface of the water. I remember the feeling of the sea air in my lungs; the way it made me feel fresh and alive. And I thought about how fragile our relationship with nature is. But in those moments, with the dolphin’s smiling face still vivid in my mind’s eye, I felt how connected we <i>really</i> are. And what a wonderful, hopeful thing that is.</p>
