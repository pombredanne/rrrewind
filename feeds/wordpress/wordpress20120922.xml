				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedreading.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" title="speedreading" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedreading.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>So intoned the billboards on the NYC subways for years. The School of Speedwriting wanted to make sure people knew that Gregg shorthand was not the only way to go, and while I never had the opportunity to learn either, it seems to make perfect sense to me. My ex was a whiz at shorthand, and she could take dictation like a court reporter &#8211; but all those squiggles! Worse than Arabic, if you ask me.</p>
<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedwriting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1900" title="Speedwriting" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/speedwriting.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="1379" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s based on being able to recognize words without the vowels. Since 2003,  this has been going around the internet in various forms, the latest one with the header &#8220;Only Smart People Can Read This&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/power.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1902" title="power" src="http://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/power.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>It is doubtful that any real research has been done on this phenomenon at Cambridge, but the underlying principle makes sense &#8211; experienced readers don&#8217;t decode, but rather they read words as entire units. This is useful to understand as I teach Japanese students the mysteries of English spelling. They get so wrapped up in &#8220;i before e&#8221; that they forget to learn new words in the same way that they learn their own <em>kanji -</em> as units.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye, each of these Japanese characters looks very much the same, 人, 大, 天, 火, 米, 犬, 水, 氷, 入, yet a Japanese person recognizes each without even thinking of it &#8211; a single jot can make the difference between <em>big</em> and <em>dog,</em> or between <em>person</em> and <em>enter</em>.</p>
<p>We do the same thing ourselves &#8211; and when presented with a block of text with mixed up letters (or missing vowels), our minds do what they do best &#8211; they look for things that look close to something recognizable, and usually come up with an accurate match almost instantly, unless of course you booted up a Unix system running &#8220;Fortune&#8221; and got &#8220;f u cn rd ths, itn tyg h myxbl cd&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; the Semitic peoples (Jews and Arabs) have been doing this for thousands of years &#8211; like anything, you just get used to it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, young people use this to their advantage when sending txt msgs (text messages): R u there? K. ttyl. (Are you there? OK. Talk to you later.) If things keep going the way they are, we may all be doing speedwriting whether we like it or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went out this afternoon to try to get a trumpet I have fixed up. The valves don&#8217;t compress, basically (I found this in the trash a while back). He told me it probably just needed a cleaning, but that it would cost 65 bucks plus tax, and that&#8217;s not really in my budget right now.</p>
<p>Maybe I can clean it myself. This guy online says all it really needs is valve oil and some grease, so maybe I&#8217;ll try that.</p>
<p>Regardless, on the way back I saw a few things, some of which bothered me.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1021.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1021.jpg" alt="" title="Old Dell laptop" width="580" height="773" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378" /></a></p>
<p>First off was this old laptop. Not old enough to not have XP, but old enough to have a floppy drive. I just tried it out and it still turns on, but it seems like the screen is busted. I may just give it to the computer place on St Laurent. As least they might know how to dispose or recycle the parts properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1031.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1031.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_1031" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1377" /></a></p>
<p>This rack for your bike seems to be in fine condition. I&#8217;ll probably put it on the craigslist free section.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1030.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1030.jpg" alt="" title="Acreage / Property Map, St Therese de Blainville Parish" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1385" /></a></p>
<p>This map is from the Ste-Therese area, which lies northwest of Laval. I&#8217;m not sure when it&#8217;s from or how exactly it works (or is meant to represent), but I do know some urban planning people so maybe they can help me out in that regard.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1022.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1022-e1348255881852.jpg" alt="" title="Marketing stuff - Sauzo tequila" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1379" /></a></p>
<p>I found a bunch of marketing stuff on the curb on Cartier by the railroad tracks. This box was full mostly of these plastic things. I don&#8217;t really know what they are for &#8211; maybe to put shot glasses in, but that seems kind of pointless.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1027.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1027.jpg" alt="" title="Plastic posters" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1384" /></a></p>
<p>Another box was mostly full of these plastic posters you see at bars. They look unused. I think these might actually be useful for sealing/insulation, as the stuff is pretty strong and thick. </p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1026.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1026.jpg" alt="" title="Drink trays - Sauzo, Hornitos" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1383" /></a></p>
<p>Also in a box were these drink trays, also unused. The cork ones are pretty nice. I took these with me, as I&#8217;m sure these can come in handy for someone.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1024.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1024.jpg" alt="" title="Metal shot glasses" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1381" /></a></p>
<p>A good load of metal shot glasses, with the company name on them. I took these as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1025.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1025.jpg" alt="" title="Cinnamon sugar - Sauzo" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1382" /></a></p>
<p>Some cinnamon sugar, to be used as part of some drink. They were open but perfectly fine (and mostly full) so I took them.</p>
<p><a href="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1023.jpg"><img src="http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1023.jpg" alt="" title="Molson M Posters" width="580" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, some Molson M posters, probably never used. </p>
<p>Seeing this kind of stuff on the curb bothers me because of how it&#8217;s a total waste of resources. We extracted the base resources (in this case, the various stuff needed to make plastic, and trees for paper), created the product (and used a bunch of oil), and shipped it over a great distance, only to be used once or never used and then put out on the street to be stored underground in landfills. Not to mention the land that goes to waste when you need to build a bigger landfill. All of this in the name of possibly making a few extra bucks.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be as bad if the companies involved made a concerted effort to ensure the final product wasn&#8217;t a complete waste. For example, if they just gave the trays / glasses to local bars or to second-hand stores, or maybe avoided creating mostly-useless and distinctly disposable plastic products in the first place, or made a concerted effort to recycle, repurpose, or create compostable products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all too symbolic of the times we live in, but there are things we can do. I recently read about a website called <a href="http://www.change.org/en-CA">Change.org</a> which has had some success getting different restaurants to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/changeorg-petitions-restaurants_n_1871256.html">adopt more environmentally friendly practices</a>. Perhaps some petitions are in order?</p>
<p>What other ways can we encourage less wasteful practices? Beyond me finding it before it gets trashed, of course <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Erika Batista</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thenewtechnologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-face-recognition.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-97" title="a-face-recognition" src="http://thenewtechnologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-face-recognition.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="434" /></a>So today the news broke out that Facebook <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/29340-facebook-turns-off-tag/">turned off</a> their ill-famed facial recognition feature, otherwise known as “tag suggest”, in Europe. Almost simultaneously, other news revealed the social networking giant is rolling out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-search-history/">new features</a> that allow users to view and delete their search history. My husband and I had a brief discussion on the topic of privacy and data protection, and unlike most times, we found ourselves surprised to have very opposite points of view. So I decided to write about it, mostly to illustrate my opinion and hopefully start an interesting discussion.</p>
<p>As a lawyer and a lover of liberty, my first reaction is to reject the idea of a facial recognition system altogether. Just imagine all the implications for the right to privacy of having a giant database out there with enough information to locate you, even in a crowd, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a promising tool for the prevention of terrorism and tracking down of criminals, results actually show otherwise. Indeed, it was reported that the Tampa Police Department stopped its use after the technology generated hundreds of false positives, but not a single arrest. That just means the technology isn’t good <em>enough </em>yet, though.</p>
<p>In my opinion, facial recognition can be downright creepy. The other day while uploading an album from a recent museum visit, I was asked to identify the “people” in a photo, which were actually deteriorated statues from the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Another time, Facebook suggested a tag of my brother on a picture of me. <em>Ew.</em></p>
<p>A bit more seriously, the relevant question here is what are the actual risks that users face? What exactly are we protecting here?</p>
<p>Before addressing this question, a little history:</p>
<p>In 1980, the OECD promoted guidelines for the protection of personal data. Accordingly, there are several principles that should be respected if handling personal data. They basically say that you should know when your data is being collected, what for, and that it should not be used for anything other than the stated purpose. Other principles cover security, disclosure, access and accountability.</p>
<p>That sounds like poetry to my lawyer ears, but they were merely suggestions. So, how many states did actually implement these guidelines? Yes, you guessed right. <em>Zero</em>.</p>
<p>Recently we’ve had more honest efforts, and as of 1998 every European country has its own data protection legislation in accordance with a European directive that was issued on the topic. As for the United States, it’s been more of a trial and error process. Despite the existence of some regulation there is an overall tendency to promote self-regulation among the incumbent entities, leaving behind a lot of loopholes. But how well does this self-regulation work?</p>
<p>So far, in the case of social media, not bad. Besides the protection that the law grants, you can count on the services themselves for fine-tuning. Google’s social networking service G+ had its momentum when it announced that it would feature new privacy and sharing controls, which Facebook lacked and swiftly adopted in order to keep users from fleeing. Despite allegations of social network <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherbarger/2011/12/20/the-top-ten-social-media-lessons-of-2011-part-i/">fatigue</a>, the market has proven itself capable of adapting to (some) user needs.</p>
<p>So, going back to our question, what exactly are we protecting?</p>
<p>Without going completely “conspiracy theorist” on you, one of the arguments most often used against facial recognition is the fear that it could lead to a “mass surveillance society”. Yoann argued at this point, validly, that it is not the government we are dealing with. It’s just Facebook. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The thought of a mass surveillance state might seem like a far-fetched idea to you, but it’s actually <em><a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Listening_to_you_at_last:_EU_plans_to_tap_cell_phones">not</a>. </em>Indeed, we hear everywhere about scandals regarding different types of privacy-invasive acts such as tapped conversations, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/americans-may-have-to-wait-for-europe-for-better-data-protection-a-849372.html">misrepresentations</a> about the use of tracking cookies (even when users expressly disabled them, Google still kept using them and gladly paid the fine that followed), the government officials using twitter to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/31/destroy-america-on-twitter-get-deported/">track down supposed threats</a>, the police being allowed access to social media accounts <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/no-warrant-required-judge-rules-police-can-subpoena-tweets-even-deleted-ones/">without a warrant</a>, and access being granted to these accounts without even <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/zuckers-facebook-has-secretly-been-giving-user-info-to-cops/">notifying the user</a>, just to mention a few.</p>
<p>Again, my husband (acceptably) argues: if you don’t want something to be known, just don’t share it. But asking myself each and every time before hitting that “post” button “Could this content seem in any way incriminating?” is borderline psychopathic behavior.</p>
<p>The ramifications don’t limit themselves to police activity, of course. Information obtained through social media can and has been used during the processing of insurance claims, the assessment of a candidate for a job (there are companies created exclusively for this purpose), not to mention the intrusive commercial applications of facial recognition systems, among many others.</p>
<p>With recent Facebook updates it is easier to control how your data is shared with the public. However, there is still certain information that is <em>always</em> public (name, profile and cover pictures, network, gender, username and ID). The alternative Facebook offers you? To delete your account.</p>
<p>Then another question arises: Who are Facebook’s <em>real </em>customers? Sure, they want to create a good product so that we can keep using it, the same way a farmer keeps feeding his cows so that they will stay alive and produce milk. This has been discussed before, many, many, times. Facebook wants you to keep providing information so that they can keep monetizing it and getting better at it. For the moment, most of their profit comes from advertisers, but who is to say it will be that way forever? Users certainly don’t have a say in whom Facebook can or can’t do business with.</p>
<p>Yet the use of social media remains safe “enough” that most of us don’t even consider these issues. After all, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner concluded their report on Facebook with a positive note. However, that still means that your information could be revealed (according to Facebook&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/">guidelines</a>) to public authorities in accordance with the law, which in certain cases does not grant much protection.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be a brighter side to the story. There are some software that include this feature such as Google’s Picasa and Apple’s iPhoto, for example, which allow users to organize their photo library by tagging recognized people on photos. This represents a practical advantage for the consumer, and in the future there will probably be many exciting and non-intrusive developments to this technology. Facebook themselves expressed that they would revisit facial recognition when they figure out how to keep the legislators happy (after all, they did invest millions acquiring a face recognition tech company this year).</p>
<p>So, ultimately, by providing Facebook with a vast amount of information we are trusting that they will not use it for any purpose other than those annoying and increasingly accurate ads. Until a breach of that trust occurs, this matter and the minor incidents will continue to be overlooked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_729" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pedestrian-man1.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-729" title="pedestrian man" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pedestrian-man1.jpeg?w=295&h=295" alt="" width="295" height="295" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Go. Go. Go.</p></div>
<p>Tick, tick, tick.</p>
<p>The bright little green man started buzzing, permitting pedestrians to cross the street legally.</p>
<p>Like a flock of faceless chickens, a procession of suits, glassy eyes, school kids, brief cases, cake faces and iPhones came shooting at me, beside me and away from me, in a flurry of manic haste.</p>
<p>Tick … tick … tick.</p>
<p>The little red man shoved the little green man to the side as he beeped at less frequent intervals than his Christmassy counterpart; permitting only for people to finish crossing, but not for newcomers to start.  I wouldn’t count on it though, little red man.  These people have places to be.  People to see.  Things to be.</p>
<p>As I sat there with Sylvia Plath’s Bell Jar in my right hand, leaning on a thick, grey pole observing this tempestuous flux of strangers passing by, I felt like I had been dropped into the middle of a set of a zombie movie.  It’s a big intersection and it was 6pm on a Friday, so you can only imagine how many bodies passed me by.  And within that dense mass of strangers, life was nowhere to be seen.  Vacant, expressionless stares made up the barrage of bodies hustling and bustling, zigzagging in every direction down the streets of Elizabeth and Collins.</p>
<p>Zombies!</p>
<p>Trying to make eye contact with just one person, you know, to shoot them a smile and make their day, was nearly impossible.  Approximately, out of the 400-500 pairs of eyes dancing by me, I only managed to engage 6 of them.  And they were mere side glimpses that would quickly hone back in on their one set path upon noticing that someone was paying their self attention.</p>
<div id="attachment_730" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zombie.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-730" title="zombie" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zombie.jpeg?w=300&h=180" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Must. Check. Email. Gahh-bajahhh</p></div>
<p>All I saw was people yapping away at mobile phones.  Or, rigid gazes fixated on the path directly ahead of them.  Or, faces trying hard to avoid anyone and everyone at all costs, beading drops of sweat across their foreheads because of the peripheral awareness detecting the presence of judgemental strangers.</p>
<p>Not one person did I see – and I’m not at all exaggerating – rolling their heads around the milieu, soaking in the beautiful art sprayed on the surrounding Melbourne walls, or the long, arching trees whose green feathers were fluttering in the caressing breeze, or the birds singing timeless hymns up in those trees, or the ones meandering the footpath in pursuit of spare breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Not a single person.</p>
<p>People always talk about how you’ve got to pay attention to the little things.  To the moment-to-moment happenings that will strike you in awe if you just open your eyes.  But often, people talk about this like it’s something you need to factor into your busy schedule; like going to the gym, or having sex with a partner you’ve been married to for five years.  Like it’s necessary to allocate ten minutes of your day for opening the door to your senses and allowing the light of life to gush into your personal abode.</p>
<p>What.  The.  Shit?</p>
<p>It’s not like that.  It’s not like that at all.</p>
<p>Life is happening.  Always.  And most of us trudge through our hapless existence without paying it any attention.  We live our days within the abstracted realities that are defined by either the cyber-sphere or purely our imagination, and we forget about life as it is out there and all around.  It is the future that societies masses occupy and identify with, and often, the future, our future, only.</p>
<p>It’s scary.</p>
<p>It is nice to see bloggers and general awareness screaming out from the rooftops that the little things matter.  It’s real nice.  But here’s the thing.  The little things are all things.  All our individual paths require tiny steps.  And it is the minutia in life that constantly demands our immediate attention, not mere sporadic intervals where we assign small parts of the day for appreciating the birds or the trees or the leaves.  Or being present with our loved ones.</p>
<div id="attachment_731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pyramids.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-731" title="pyramids" src="http://humansareweird.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pyramids.jpeg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not built in a day, folks</p></div>
<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day, after all.</p>
<p>As cliché as this may sound, which it does, I know: Life is about the journey, not the destination.  It’s not about the journey only sometimes.  Every single step is a destination within itself.  And it’s best to live in that way always.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it, the only destination we’re all eventually arriving at is death.  Where the grim reapers bony hand taps our shoulder and sends us to eternal rest.</p>
<p>I, for one, want to ensure that, when my time does come and I feel Mr Reaper&#8217;s cold breath tickling the hairs on my neck, he’s not tapping at an already corpse.</p>
<p>Humans-are-overly-concerned-with-the-future.  And not enough with now.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot.  Here&#8217;s a link to a video about Joshua Bell &#8211; a famous violinist &#8211; who was part of an experiment conducted by the Washington Post to test who would &#8216;stop and hear the music,&#8217; as he busked for 45 minutes at a subway in Washington DC during peak hour.  He sold out an entire concert the night before and only a handful of people bothered to pay him any attention.</p>
<p>It is truly eye opening and kind of devastating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A story about Facebook went around twitter last night that provoked quite a reaction in privacy advocates like me: Facebook, it seems, is experimenting with getting people to &#8216;snitch&#8217; on any of their friends who don&#8217;t use their real names. Take a look at this:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/snitching1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-409" title="Snitching" src="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/snitching1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>Facebook has had a &#8216;real names&#8217; policy for a while: this is what their &#8216;Help Center&#8217; says on the subject:</p>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-21-at-10-36-27.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-411" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-21 at 10.36.27" src="http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-21-at-10-36-27.png" alt="" width="499" height="308" /></a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=167904716602259#Why-doesn%E2%80%99t-Facebook-allow-fake-names?"><br />
</a></div>
<div></div>
<p>People in my field have known about this for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s been the cause of a few &#8216;high profile&#8217; events such as when Salman Rushdie had his account suspended because they didn&#8217;t believe that he was who he said he was &#8211; but few people had taken it very seriously for anyone other than the famous. Everyone knows &#8216;fake&#8217; names and &#8216;fake&#8217; accounts &#8211; my sister&#8217;s dog has a Facebook account &#8211; so few believed that Facebook was going to bother enforcing it, except for obvious trolls and so forth. Now, however, that appears to be changing.</p>
<p>Initially, I wondered if this was just a fake &#8211; the screenshot could easily have been faked &#8211; but there seems now to have been confirmation. It has been covered in the TMP Idea Lab (<a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/facebook-confirms-its-surveying-users-about-their-friends-fake-usernames.php?" target="_blank">here</a>), where they say that Facebook has confirmed that they are doing it, and the German online magazine Heise Online (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Facebook-macht-Jagd-auf-Pseudonyme-1633979.html" target="_blank">here</a>, in German) where they report that it is a &#8216;limited test&#8217;. Given that this kind of a test fits in with the official strategy, it seems likely that it is indeed true.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s wrong?</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of argument against the whole &#8216;real names&#8217; policy to start with &#8211; it was a trigger for the &#8216;nymwars&#8217;. Many people can only really function online with the ability to remain pseudonymous, from bloggers like Nightjack to whistleblowers, from victims of abuse to people living in oppressive regimes. When their pseudonymity is &#8216;broken&#8217;, the result can be catastrophic &#8211; when Nightjack&#8217;s cover was blown, his blog ceased to exist and a valuable and entertaining source of information was lost. Mexican bloggers have suffered much worse &#8211; a number have lost their lives in the most gruesome way when the drugs cartels have been able to find them. The link between the &#8216;online&#8217; and the &#8216;offline&#8217; personality is one that can often need to be protected. When the &#8216;real names&#8217; policy is enforced, protecting that link becomes much, much harder.</p>
<p>This, of course, is Facebook, which is just one service, rather than the net as a whole &#8211; but it&#8217;s a crucial service, with close to a billion users around the world, pretty close to ubiquitous. And, just as importantly, where Facebook leads, other services can and do follow. If the &#8216;real names&#8217; policy becomes accepted on Facebook, it may become the norm. For some people, that sounds like a good thing &#8211; catching paedophiles and terrorists, making sure children don&#8217;t get access to &#8216;inappropriate material&#8217; and so forth &#8211; but the reality is very different. The real &#8216;bad guys&#8217; will find a way around the system &#8211; as so often, it will almost certainly be the innocent that get caught up in the messes.</p>
<p><strong>Snitching</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, the whole idea of snitching is highly dodgy. There&#8217;s a good reason that &#8216;telling tales&#8217; is looked down on &#8211; and a good reason why it&#8217;s generally only been oppressive regimes (both real and fictional) that have encouraged people to report on their neighbours &#8211; from the worst of the Roman Emperors such as Tiberius and Caligula to the KGB, the Stasi and so forth. It&#8217;s creepy &#8211; and it helps build at atmosphere of distrust, breaking down the very things that make social networks good. The social relationships that are the heart of Facebook are meant to do &#8216;good&#8217; things &#8211; not be a route by which bad things are spread.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, look at the nature of the questionnaire. You&#8217;re being asked to report on a &#8216;friend&#8217;. If you say &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to answer&#8217; that will be recorded &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole nature of Facebook &#8211; and it&#8217;s not hard to see that there could be a list of &#8216;people who don&#8217;t want to answer about their friends&#8217;. Indeed, under the terms of the Snoopers Charter, it wouldn&#8217;t just be Facebook who could access this kind of information: the authorities could potentially set up a filter to gather data on people who don&#8217;t confirm the names of their friends. It could be viewed as suspicious if you don&#8217;t answer &#8211; or even suspicious if you are friends with people who don&#8217;t answer. Again, this is the nature of Facebook&#8217;s social data &#8211; and how it could be misused.</p>
<p>And, as anyone who reads what I write about the Snoopers Charter etc will understand, though this may just be set up to catch paedophiles and terrorists, it can equally be used for all kinds of things. Potential employers who want to see whether their applicants are &#8216;open and honest&#8217;. Insurance companies for the same &#8216;reason&#8217;. Facebook is now in a situation where it needs to generate income &#8211; the failure of its IPO has made this even more crucial than before &#8211; and will be looking for ways to squeeze out as much revenue from their data as possible.</p>
<p>That, ultimately, is what lies behind this kind of thing: Facebook wants to make money. If it knows exactly who you are, it thinks it can make more money from you &#8211; by selling things to you, or by selling your details to others, or by targeting you more accurately in some other way. That&#8217;s perfectly understandable &#8211; indeed, from a business sense pretty much inevitable &#8211; but it does have consequences, particularly when the other uses that their data can be put are understood.</p>
<p>Oppressive regimes understand some of those uses &#8211; which is one of the reasons that the erstwhile Tunisian government, prior to the revolution, hacked into the Facebook login page in order to be able to access possible revolutionaries&#8217; accounts. They knew how that information could be used&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the first thing to do is make it clear that you don&#8217;t like this kind of a system. The whole idea of snitching should not be something that&#8217;s encouraged &#8211; indeed, the whole &#8216;real names&#8217; system should be discouraged, but it seems hard to put that genie back into Facebook&#8217;s bottle. Ultimately, I suspect there&#8217;s only one answer: many people should simply leave Facebook. Find other ways to do the things you want to do, other ways that don&#8217;t require &#8216;real names&#8217; and don&#8217;t use such sneaky and creepy tactics as snitching. Communicate by email, by twitter. Share your photos on other photo sites. Play games directly, not over Facebook. There&#8217;s always another way.</p>

<a href="http://stripgenerator.com/strip/681238/ode-to-an-email-junkie/">Ode To An Email Junkie</a> by <a title="ElizOF's profile" href="http://elizof.stripgenerator.com/">ElizOF</a></div>
<p><em>A tongue-firmly-planted-in-cheek ode&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The love affair began with that dinosaur &#8211; <strong>A</strong><br />
An aging mail maid with suspect kin<br />
She danced before EJ’s novice eyes and signed her up without a sigh<br />
Soon that chime-y voice announced &#8220;you&#8217;ve got mail&#8221; a hundred times.<br />
EJ loved <strong>A</strong> back with vim and vigor, she was her first email provider, you know, go figure!<br />
Over time, EJ felt the itch, to spread her wings for some new trick<br />
She ventured off to meet other email folk; Opt on, Opt out, even MSNot now&#8230;<br />
But soon found them all wanting and not quite her style</p>
<p>One day, EJ met that (lovely) <a class="zem_slink" title="Hotmail" href="http://www.hotmail.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Hotmail</a> chick &#8211; A provider so hot it&#8217;s the <a class="zem_slink" title="United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">UK&#8217;s</a> biggest hit<br />
And she soon signed up for her daily fix<br />
Twas a slow day on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Internet</a> and <strong>A</strong> was acting like she needed a probe<br />
For a cheap date, Hotmail sure did deliver, easy mail across the globe<br />
They kissed and hugged and became hot new friends<br />
Connecting, uploading, loving and surfing<br />
But soon, they tanked from too much schmoozing<br />
Or was it the glitch from too much &#8230; downloading?</p>
<p>Fishing around for some tasty Wahoo<br />
EJ scored a date with a dude on Yahoo<br />
Soon she’d joined the throngs on <strong>Y</strong>et <strong>A</strong>nother <strong>H</strong>ierarchical <strong>O</strong>fficious <strong>O</strong>racle<br />
And hung in there after her dude high-tailed it for some new miracle<br />
When the going was good they’d listened to the sounds of <a class="zem_slink" title="The Who" href="http://www.thewho.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">The Who</a><br />
And sent lovey dovey e-mails up the wazoo<br />
She shoulda known that dude was just another yahoo<br />
He had a nasty temper and a lousy tattoo<br />
But soon she was back with that stinkin&#8217; dude<br />
Who made the lady act like a dog in a zoo</p>
<p>More below on this nonsensical, tongue-in-cheek email post inspired by the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/weekly-writing-challenge-mail-it-in">Weekly Writing Challenge</a> from WP <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif' alt=':lol:' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><code><span id="more-25502"></span></code></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m a longtime <a class="zem_slink" title="AOL" href="http://www.aol.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">AOL</a> subscriber and I love the whole thing. I&#8217;m an email junkie and I love the internet, though <a class="zem_slink" title="7th Heaven" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Heaven" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">7th Heaven</a> doesn&#8217;t give me much free time to surf these days.&#8221; <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen Collins" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Collins" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Stephen Collins</a></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_25512" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://eof737.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spammed-mail-folder.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-25512" title="Spammed-mail-folder" src="http://eof737.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spammed-mail-folder.png" alt="" width="500" height="276" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Musings: Ode to an Email Junkie&#8230; I can&#8217;t stand Spam email</p></div>
<p>Not one to be discouraged, EJ tuned out the fool<br />
She’d found a new love on good ol’ Google<br />
He courted her first with tunes on Youtube<br />
Then uploaded vlogs to woo and impress her<br />
She was quite touched that he vlogged on <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">WordPress</a><br />
For she thought he’d write her a Blogger post first<br />
EJ hooked up a <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" href="http://google.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Gmail</a> account and found all the features quite overwhelming<br />
She wasn’t sure she wanted a Gmail profile&#8230;<br />
Let alone make friends with strangers with + signs</p>
<p>One day EJ turned to a friend at the mall and said<br />
“I miss the days when we only made phone calls!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I can’t stand the Viagra hawkers, the scammers with dead rich relatives.<br />
I can’t stand the thieves, the lying penile extenders.<br />
I can&#8217;t stand the work-at-home liars and the virus spreaders!”<br />
“Don’t despair,” said the friend, to her dejected buddy,<br />
“One day they’ll invent a chip to plant in your head<br />
And zap out the s**t that comes through email. Be grateful your Gmail captures the scum.”</p>
<p>EJ considered her <a class="zem_slink" title="Friendship" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">good friend</a>’s sage advice<br />
As up popped an instant message from her Gmail lover&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Hey babe, tonight is the night&#8230; so please be nice!&#8221;<br />
EJ sent a wink to her lover <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  and then to her good friend she replied,<br />
“I guess it’s not bad to keep this account, and my Y, H and A email accounts.<br />
<strong>You</strong> never know who might try to reach you… I’d rather talk now than wait for a chip …&#8221;</p>
<p>So EJ has kept all her email accounts<br />
And checks them quite often to chat and to frown<br />
Maybe one day she’ll choose only one, delete the others, and toss the junkie crown&#8230;<br />
Forever. We hope. And I&#8217;m tempted to say &#8211; whatever. Oy vey! <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Have an awesome weekend! <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Thank you for stopping by! What are your thoughts? What approach did you use for the challenge? Was it easy/hard to email your post? Did you attach photos for the prompt? Do share? Thank you!</p>
<p>*Please bear with me as I continue to catch up on your blogs and commenting… Thank you all for your patience! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This post was inspired by a prompt from WP Daily Post: <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/weekly-writing-challenge-mail-it-in">Weekly Writing Challenge: Mail It In</a> For this week’s challenge, use the Post by Email tool to create a new post touching on email, communication, and online correspondence. Go beyond how email may have changed how you communicate and dive into a specific example of a funny interaction, specific trends, or a detailed, comedic account of your email obsession.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Motivation Tip:</strong> Email is a helpful tool for quick communication&#8230; but nothing beats reaching out and making physical contact with friends and family&#8230; Reach out and touch someone!  Didn&#8217;t AT&amp;T say that? <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif' alt=':lol:' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

Each one of them will be given a mark, by way of weighting. Total marks awarded to myself: 100.<br />
I think it is a nice round number, percentage-wise.</p>
<ol>
<li>I still have far more e-mail friends and contacts than I do Facebook friends. <strong>23</strong></li>
<li>I have 50 folders with subfolders for clients, friends, memberships and so on. I could make some improvements. <strong>-3</strong></li>
<li>I have sorted the Sent Items into their respective folders too. It is easy to follow correspondence this way. <strong>20</strong></li>
<li>I last wrote a letter (via e-mail) to my parents in Australia 8 days ago. That is longer than one week. <strong>-10</strong></li>
<li>I have flagged one minor task to attend to (revision of the second verse of a translation of a poem I did for fun, following the kind parsing in the source language by a friend). My integrity is at stake (&#8220;Don&#8217;t start something you have no intention of finishing&#8221;). This attracts a modified negative grading, since only two people care. <strong>-8</strong></li>
<li>All administrative tasks associated with my freelance business are up-to-date. <strong>25</strong></li>
<li>I have replied to all e-mails received (except of course, junk mail). <strong>18</strong></li>
<li>I have removed flags from items I have dealt with. <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have deleted outright things I know I will not read, even though they may be of some benefit, knowledge-wise. Too much information is too much information. <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have one e-mail I ought to write (as the initiator of private correspondence). Slap on the wrist for procrastination weighed against its relative importance: <strong>-5</strong></li>
<li>I have not been able to figure out how to mute the volume on annoying adverts with sounds (or get rid of the adverts altogether) on the Internet, while still turning up the volume on my laptop so that I can hear when new mail arrives. This is annoying. I use a number of online dictionaries and other resources. I have trained my eyes not to look at the adverts, but cannot stand the Grim Reaper laughing at me with a written message in Portuguese asking me, &#8220;Do you know when you are going to die?&#8221;. Even thinking about that tiny question would provoke a huge rant from me. I shall be kind to myself in this case. Firstly, I am suffering and secondly, I do not know if it is possible to achieve the desired removal of adverts. Total penalty: <strong>-2</strong></li>
<li>With my volume on zero, I lost out on a job from a translation agency today because I did not check my inbox for over 30 minutes. I give myself 12 points for working for 30 minutes without being distracted at all, and have deducted 5 for losing out on potential income. Net result: <strong>7</strong></li>
<li>While clearing out my mail box, and sorting into folders, I discovered three e-mails which I had received and replied to, but had no recollection of the names of the people who had sent them to me. <strong>-5</strong></li>
<li>At this rate, I shall never get to 100 points. Points for stamina, then: <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>I have had the same e-mail name since I got my first e-mail account in 2000. Note: I did not really need an e-mail at home until then. Besides which, you needed a telephone line to have an e-mail account, and I did not have one of those at home either. Times have changed, service providers have changed, but the name before the @ is the same. Points to stability, I would say: <strong>15</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It will be interesting to see how WordPress copes with the numbered list, and the font colours for the points (blue for positive; red for negative).</p>
<p>One curious little note on a slang term (which I seldom used myself, not being very slangy by nature): In Zimbabwe years ago, if someone was really entertained with what you had just said, or pleased with the news you had just given them, they would say, &#8220;Ah, 10 points!&#8221;. This awarding of points may have come from the fact that the only really interesting thing on television in the 1970s or so was the &#8220;inter-schools quiz&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know; I am guessing.</p>
<p>A related expression was &#8220;100%&#8221;, which signified agreement, and again, pleasure at the receipt of good news. This came into fairly widespread use around 2000. The expression soon changed to &#8220;Ah, hundred&#8221;, or &#8220;Ah, hundreds&#8221;, or simply, &#8220;Hundreds&#8221;. One other theory I have on the shift from &#8220;10 points&#8221; to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; is that it was a reflection of the all-pervasive hyperinflation, and perhaps people thought that 10 was no longer a significantly grand number.</p>
<p>In any case, I have scored 100 points. Hundreds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong><a title="Interesting Times" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">May you live in interesting times</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As I sat in my 6th grade classroom, making every appearance of listening to the Social Studies lesson of the day, my peripheral vision caught a folded piece of notebook paper making a dangerous journey forward from the rear right corner of the room. As the teacher looked down at her book, or turned to use the blackboard, a student might tap the person ahead and hand the paper up, or slide it carefully onto the desk at the left. At last the paper reached its intended recipient, whose name was block printed on one of the exposed sides. Her task was to open it, near the front of the classroom, without attracting the notice of the teacher. The message had to reach her during class, or she would pass into the halls and on to her next class without the urgent information in the note.</p>
<p>By ninth grade, I regularly carried messages (usually just verbal) from a friend in my gym class, to her boyfriend in my English class. When we went on high school or scouting field trips, we were given regular hourly intervals at which each meandering group would &#8220;meet back&#8221; with the rest at a common point to allow the group leaders to count heads. If we went out from home and were late returning, our parents worried and called around to our friends&#8217; homes to find out where we were last spotted. (We were always scolded for not calling in on these occasions, as well.)</p>
<p>Now, all of these things are handled using cell phones which can text, tweet, or email, in addition to just outright calling another person, to make sure no important communication is missed. We indeed live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Now, in fact, electronic communication is so pervasive that we are seeking ways to limit it. Folks barely look up from their handheld devices as they cross a street, email boxes are full of &#8220;spam&#8221;/electronic junk mail, and we are rudely interrupted by phones ringing (and subsequent personal conversations) in restaurants, elevators, and other public places. Phones light up at the movies, distracting other theater goers, as an impatient recipient reads a text message that just can&#8217;t wait. Television commercials warn against the serious dangers of texting while driving.</p>
<p>Today, I read that Apple has received a patent to <a title="ipod limits" href="http://myscienceacademy.org/2012/09/17/apple-granted-patent-to-disable-iphone-recordings-near-government-buildings-or-political-events/">restrict iPhone recordings near government buildings and political events</a>. There is an outcry over this limitation of a freedom that, fifty years ago, was pure science fiction. So many benefits, so many issues.</p>
<p>When I first had email, I rushed home to check my &#8220;mailbox&#8221; every night. Ten years later, I was so battered by the constant barrage of emails at work, and demands for immediate responses, that some nights I didn&#8217;t even turn my personal computer on. Now I have a phone with texting and IM-ing, a laptop with email (three addresses for different purposes, neatly sorted by Outlook), Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn on both these devices and my Kindle Fire, and the ability to create and email a blog post from anywhere any time.</p>
<p>These are all wonderful conveniences, but sometimes I just need to unplug. For the last five or six days I&#8217;ve been travelling. I popped into my email and Facebook twice to &#8220;keep up,&#8221; and if a family member had needed to reach me, I had a cell phone. I didn&#8217;t feel the immediate need to use another device or program. Of course, during that time I neglected my blog, but it was sort of restful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t Tweet, Facebook, or text my every move (I don&#8217;t care for it when other people do this, so I won&#8217;t burden them either.) I don&#8217;t post my opinions on Facebook (after all this is meant as <em>social media -</em>and weren&#8217;t we taught not to discuss religion or politics socially?) I have my blog for my random thoughts and opinions (which I post to a separate Facebook page for those who care.) I truly appreciate my friends and followers, and will try to get caught up this week &#8211; but I unapologetically enjoyed my e-vacation.</p>
<p>So, in the event that I&#8217;m somewhere away from home, perhaps on a prolonged trip, and I have an urgent need to communicate something on my blog, it will be wonderful that I have that ability from all of my electronic devices through email. I&#8217;m giving that a try for the first time with this post, including using some “shortcodes” – for example to tag it. However, just because I <em>can</em> do something with one of these marvelous devices doesn&#8217;t mean that I necessarily should, or will.</p>
<p>Time will tell how useful some of these new tech advances will be for me, but who knows? These are, after all, very interesting times.</p>
