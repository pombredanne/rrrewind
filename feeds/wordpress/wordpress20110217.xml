			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/lizardnegotiator.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-131" title="lizardnegotiator" src="http://topiclessbar.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/lizardnegotiator.jpg?w=300&#038;h=195" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>Scoliodentosaurophobia.</p>
<p>The large and strange word dangling above simply means “the fear of lizards.”  As someone who believes language should adjust itself to the culture that uses it, I would personally prefer to see this word replaced by the much easier “lizardophobia.”  It’s embarrassing enough to be afraid of lizards; not being able to pronounce the condition is like adding another layer of cruelty to those who cower in horror at the sight of a salamander or a chameleon.</p>
<p>Lizards, like everything else in the world, scare me.  So it was not a pleasant moment when I returned to my cheap hotel room in Bangkok to find a small lizard scurrying across the floor.  I jumped while the lizard slipped under a pile of clothes and out of sight.  My initial thought was to go straight to management and demand that the lizard be removed.  But then I started to instruct myself to toughen up.  “You’re not in Manhattan,” I said to myself.  “You’re in Bangkok.  There are lizards.  Don’t be such a wussy Westerner.”</p>
<p>My will was strong and I didn’t go to management, but seeing that there was a lizard loose in the room, I left.  The presence of the lizard kept me away, and with nothing else to do I sat at a coffee shop and read.  After my second or third cappuccino, I couldn’t let my lizard paranoia get the best of me anymore.  Returning to the room, I threw the pile of the clothes into the air.  No lizard.  There was, I noticed, a long tail coming from under the mini-fridge.  I was paralyzed with terror.</p>
<p>“Just leave it alone,” I thought.  “Maybe it will go away.”  For the rest of the night, I kept an eye on the tail.  It wasn’t moving, but that didn’t mean that the lizard wasn’t a threat.  If only I could communicate with it, I pondered, then the lizard and I could work something out.  I wished that there was someone who could be a middle person – a lizard negotiator if you will – and help me understand just what the lizard wanted.</p>
<p>“What are the lizard’s intentions?” I’d ask.</p>
<p>“The lizard intends to crawl on your face,” the negotiator would likely answer.</p>
<p>“Will it bite me?”</p>
<p>“No.  The lizard doesn’t get pleasure from causing pain…just unease.”</p>
<p>I would ask the lizard negotiator more.</p>
<p>“Will the lizard crawl on me in my sleep?”</p>
<p>“Of course it will.”</p>
<p>“Please inform the lizard that if I wake, I&#8217;ll probably panic and try to kill it.”</p>
<p>“The lizard understands the risks.”</p>
<p>Even after going out for a few beers, I couldn’t sleep in the room.  Not with that tail there.  Finally I decided I had to move the refrigerator and deal with the lizard.  I put socks on my hands and pushed the mini-fridge, exposing more of the tail bit by bit.  Then, with one last shove, I moved the mini-fridge quite a ways, only to discover that there was no lizard.  There was only a tail.  There it was, right there.  All my fear, represented by a light green tail, sitting motionless on the floor, connected to nothing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my home, Wilmington, North Carolina. I was born here, but I haven&#8217;t always lived here. My family relocated to Florida when I was five years old. But Wilmington was always home.</p>
<p>Most families leave home to go on vacation. My family&#8217;s vacation was to go home.</p>
<p><a href="http://gingereebs.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_5534.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2720" title="IMG_5534" src="http://gingereebs.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_5534.jpg?w=500&#038;h=331" alt="" width="500" height="331" /></a></p>
<p><em>Home is a name, a word, it is a strong one; stronger than magician ever spoke, or spirit ever answered to, in the strongest conjuration.  ~Charles Dickens</em></p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s challenge on the <a title="Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Daily Word</a> was <strong>What is your favorite word? Why?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Home&#8221; is the best word to my ears. It conjures up comfort, warmth, familiarity, love.</p>
<p>My family moved a lot when I was a kid. I went to thirteen different schools in twelve years. Some years, I went to different schools in the same year. It was hard to feel like you had a &#8220;home&#8221; when your home kept changing from one rented house to another every few months.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s why &#8220;home&#8221; became so important to me. I needed, desperately, a place that I could feel connected to.</p>
<p>Every year, in the summer, my parents would pack my brother and myself into the back of whatever car we happened to have at the time, from whatever city in Florida we were living in, and they would say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going on vacation kids! We&#8217;re going<em> home</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a good twelve-hour ride in the back-seat of the car, cooped up with my younger brother, and books and toys that were supposed to keep us occupied. There was also no air conditioner in the cars in those days, so it was hot. My dad liked to get a good early start, which meant getting up at three am so we could be on the road by four.</p>
<p>After a long day on the road, enduring the heat and the constant bickering with my brother about who was taking up more room, the best part for me was driving over the Cape Fear River and my first view of <em>home.</em></p>
<p>My dad would say, &#8220;Look, kids! We&#8217;re home!&#8221;</p>
<p>I would get a lump in my throat. I would crane my neck to look out of the backseat window, so I could get a view of the familiar Wilmington waterfront &#8211; the church spires, the boats in the river including the majestic BATTLESHIP NORTH CAROLINA, the quaint historic buildings.</p>
<p>Going home meant visits with friends and relatives; aunts and uncles, cousins, both grandmothers. It meant playing on my grandmother&#8217;s front porch, eating from a huge pot of goulash that was prepared by her loving hands, going to sleep on the back porch with my cousins, listening to the crickets, giggling under the covers.</p>
<p>Going home meant spending the day under Johnny Mercer&#8217;s Pier at Wrightsville beach, slathering on Coppertone, eating hot dogs with chili and  coleslaw, riding the waves on rented canvas rafts, walking on the beach listening to the seagulls screams mingling with the joyous cries of children playing in the surf, smelling cotton candy and popcorn and salty air.</p>
<p>Going home meant listening to my parents laugh, watching them try to dance the shag and cut up with their friends from high school, getting up early to eat scrambled eggs and taste sweet coffee in my grandmother&#8217;s kitchen. It was listening to old stories about how things used to be. It was belonging somewhere.</p>
<p>Now I am 53 years old. I have lived my entire adult life back in, or near, my hometown. There is no one house that I can point to and say &#8211; that was my home. I have adopted the whole city as mine. Today, driving over the bridge and seeing my precious city still brings tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still happy to be home.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5. The Pogues (March 2006, Washington DC &#8211; 930 Club)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://leadingusabsurd.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/top-20-concerts-the-final-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Kwk8gRMZmdQ/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>Is there a better way to celebrate Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day then going to the see the originators of Irish-folk punk?  Last year was an exception, but since 2006 I&#8217;ve been going to see the Pogues every March when they tour the East Coast.  Some years I even went twice.  Shane MacGowan&#8217;s vovals might be more warbled than they are on record, but the musicianship of the band more than makes up for it.  The Pogues can easily tear through songs such as &#8220;Streams of Whiskey&#8221;, &#8220;The Sunnyside of the Street&#8221;, and &#8220;Bottle of Smoke&#8221; with reckless abandon that can cause even the squarest of concert-goers to let loose.</p>
<p>Even the slower songs as such as &#8220;The Old Main Drag&#8221; and &#8220;A Pair of Brown Eyes&#8221; truly come alive in concert.  &#8221;Thousands Are Sailing&#8221; a lament about the troubles of Irish immigration becomes a triumph, when the song&#8217;s writer Phil Chevron takes over on lead vocals (MacGowan uses this a break to take a piss &#8211; I&#8217;m not joking).  The fan-favorite &#8220;Body of An American&#8221; can become something of a bit of bro-mance &#8211; when was the last time you saw so many dudes with their arms around each other&#8217;s shoulder singing loudly?</p>
<p>4. U2 (June 2001 Washington DC &#8211; Verizon Center)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://leadingusabsurd.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/top-20-concerts-the-final-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/HdThBmRLFTo/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>I personally think that the 2005 Vertigo Tour had better performances (saw them twice that year) but on the 2001 Elevation Tour U2 showed not only were they back after the disaster that was Pop, but proved that concerts can be an uplifting and cathartic experience.  U2 perhaps more than any other group, excel at this.</p>
<p>This was the first U2 show I went to, after years of trying.  I had desperately tried to buy tickets several times, only to find Ticketmaster inform me that the show was sold-out.  Less than a week before the show, I read on a U2 fan-site that leftover tickets were being released.  Nervous that I would be locked out again, I quickly logged on.  I breathed a sigh of relief as I snatched up a pair of tickets for my older brother and I.</p>
<p>By June, even the newer songs off of <em>All That You Can&#8217;t Leave Behind</em> seemed like classics &#8211; particularly &#8220;Beautiful Day&#8221;, &#8220;Kite&#8221; and &#8220;In a Little While&#8221;.  Even the classic warhorses seemed to gain a new life.  Whatever you may think of him, Bono remains one of rock&#8217;s greatest frontmen &#8211; restless, until he reaches out to every single person in the arena.  It&#8217;s rare that a band seems to be so aware of every single person in a 20,000 person arena.  And The Edge&#8217;s ice-y guitar chords never sounded so glorious.</p>
<p>One of U2&#8242;s strengths has always been to make their old songs, relevant and contemporary.   The bridge of &#8220;I Will Follow&#8221; linked the past to the present as Bono recalled playing clubs in DC during the group&#8217;s early days.  &#8221;Bullet the Blue Sky&#8221; included an anti-gun rant, and &#8220;One&#8221; shed light on the troubles in Africa.</p>
<p>I just wish I had seen the post 9/11 shows when U2 songs seemed to be a soundtrack for a wounded nation.</p>
<p>3. Elvis Costello (May 2007, Washington DC &#8211; 930 Club)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://leadingusabsurd.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/top-20-concerts-the-final-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Nz8lIrHjUAE/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>I should probably pick the Costello show with Allen Touissant.  But, I only remember half of the show, so I don&#8217;t think that should count.  As I stated many times during this list, I&#8217;m in in love with small venues.  And seeing Elvis Costello, five feet from my face at the 930 Club is about an intimate as you can.  Being this close to one of your heroes is an experience that has evaded me until this show.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the closeness that made this show great.  Costello was touring behind a collection of his &#8220;rock&#8221; songs, and as such the show centered around material from his earlier days when he looked liked and act like a pissed off Buddy Holly.  While Costello has mellowed a bit in his songwriting, the performances retained every bite and sting he left on record.  &#8221;Lipstick Vogue&#8221; was particularly snarling with its length instrumental bridge.  &#8221;There&#8217;s No Action&#8221; was a little tighter than the version found on <em>This Year&#8217;s Model</em>, but still seemed on the verge of veering out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shabby Doll&#8221; was even darker than its studio counterpart, and the live favorite &#8220;Watching the Detectives&#8221; was given an extended reading, which suited the song&#8217;s reggae feeling.  Costello is often known for his love of The Beatles, and the group&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Hey Bulldog&#8221; was a highlight.</p>
<p>2. Leonard Cohen (May 2009, Columbia MD &#8211; Merriweather Post Pavilion)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://leadingusabsurd.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/top-20-concerts-the-final-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/CV-NGaK2xcU/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>For a man that doesn&#8217;t tour very often, Leonard Cohen put on one hell of a show.  And like Willie Nelson, Cohen also seemed to be enjoying himself through the over 3 hour set which included all of his best known songs, &#8220;Suzanne&#8221;, &#8220;So Long, Marianne&#8221; &#8220;Tower of Song&#8221; and of course &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;.  As for Cohen himself, he seemed a lot more animated than you would expect a 75 year old man to be.  He also seemed extremely humbled to be in the presence of &#8220;friends&#8221;.</p>
<p>The constant rain didn&#8217;t seem to do anything for the atmosphere.  Despite being soaked for most of the night, the show could have gone on for 3 more hours and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared.  Unlike Bob Dylan, your chances of seeing Leonard Cohen live are few and far between.</p>
<p>1. Van Morrison (February 2009, New York City &#8211; Wamu Theater)</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://leadingusabsurd.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/top-20-concerts-the-final-5/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/rCilaU3mmyo/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>(Note: I couldn&#8217;t find a video from the <em>Astral Weeks</em> tour)</p>
<p>A once in a life-time show.  I&#8217;m usually not lucky enough to go to &#8220;special performances&#8221;, but I did manage to get tickets for this sold out show (at a hefty, but extremely worthwhile price).  Like Cohen, Van Morrison doesn&#8217;t tour very often but in late 2008 he surprised everybody by not just playing a few shows, but by performing <em>Astral Weeks</em> in its entirety.</p>
<p>For me, Astral Weeks is a life-changing album, and I had no doubt that seeing Morrison perform Astral Weeks live would be a life-changing experience.  Usually, I&#8217;m not a fan of concerts where you have to sit down, but this was one concert where sitting back, taking in the music was a perfect suit.  In its original incarnation, Astral Weeks a reflective mood piece &#8211; one that commands you to sit down and listen.  And the same went for the show.</p>
<p>The first half of the set contained many standard Van Morrison songs. While he was every professional, Morrison seemed to plow right through the set (&#8220;Domino&#8221; was particularly short winded).  I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that he was actually bored with own material, but it was clear that he really wanted to do the <em>Astral Weeks</em> set.  In contrast to the first set, <em>Astral Weeks</em> was given a slow jazzy treatment that didn&#8217;t take on the songs original arrangements, but retained the spirit of the record.  &#8221;Slim Slow Slider&#8221; was given an expanded ending with Morrison repeatedly chanting, &#8220;I start breaking down&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a song that I never gave enough attention to on the record, but it became one of the highlights for me.</p>
<p>Astral Weeks has always existed in its own plane.  It&#8217;s not rock, it&#8217;s not folk, and it&#8217;s not jazz.  It can be a combination of these things &#8211; but it&#8217;s also about the passage of time &#8211; looking back and seeing the past.  Morrison made many great records since <em>Astral Weeks</em>, but he never made a better one.  And in 2008 and 2009, Morrison finally looked back into the past and finally admitted what everyone already knew &#8211; <em>Astral Weeks </em>isn&#8217;t just a record, but an experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I spent a good portion of my youth imagining galactic travel, robots on other planets, and space habitats. (And yes, I watched every episode of <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://www.startrek.com/">Star Trek</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>&#8211; a remarkable source of new inventions.)  So, when Marty Waszak, Strategic Relations Officer at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html">NASA Langley Research Center</a>, a kindred spirit and fellow crusader of innovation, invited me to speak to a group of senior scientists and engineers about the creative process, I was over the moon!</p>
<p>While thrilled with the invitation, I wondered what a lecture from me could possibly contribute to innovation at NASA &#8212; the pioneering leader in research, development and design… and an organization filled with rocket scientists.</p>
<p>Then, it occurred to me that PwC and NASA might have a few challenges and opportunities in common.  We are both heavily regulated organizations, obligated to deliver projects on budget and on time, staffed with highly technical people, and expected to continuously think creatively to provide clients with competitive advantage. This realization helped me focus on lessons I&#8217;ve learned as the Innovation Leader at PwC and what I could share with NASA.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #1: Innovation can come from anyone, anywhere</strong><br />
Innovation is the introduction of anything new or different.  <em>Anything</em> new or different implies innovation can happen <em>anywhere</em>, not just in labs or R&amp;D centers, and by anyone, not only scientists and researchers. At PwC, we have simplified our innovation mission into one question which is relevant to every member of our organization: &#8220;What can I do <em>differently</em> today to deliver more value to my client?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lesson # 2: People want to be engaged and empowered</strong><br />
At a time when user-generated content rules the web, everyone wants to be empowered to develop strategies previously limited to boardrooms in the executive suite. Employees want to be part of something meaningful and big, and they often surprise if given the opportunity.  NASA and PwC, hire some of the brightest people. Let&#8217;s give them a virtual seat in the boardroom and empower them to cultivate their own vision and contribute to the success of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #3: Collaboration helps!</strong><br />
I doubt many would challenge my claim that collaboration helps evolve ideas into more valuable assets.  How do you foster an environment where an idea is only the beginning… and collaboration from colleagues is an essential next step?  Online tools that enable brainstorming can be an effective way to transparently showcase the process and benefits of collaboration. At the core however, is a cultural issue that needs fostering from all levels.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #4: Leadership must be part of the innovation eco-system</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t recall ever hearing a CEO say we don&#8217;t need innovation, but few truly understand the commitment involved in supporting a culture of creativity. Our social contract with our people at PwC states that if you submit an idea into our idea management site, iPlace, a member of the leadership team will read it, evaluate for possible implementation, and provide comments directly on the site. This direct engagement provides genuine support and the transparency creates a safe environment for innovative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #5: Recognize and reward innovation<br />
</strong>Most organizations know how to recognize and reward accomplishments, but how do you recognize someone with an idea before it has been fully developed or implemented? If your organization has 3,000 ideas in its pipeline and resources only allow the implementation of 300, where do you the draw the line?  Recognition of <em>all </em>innovators creates trust, builds confidence, and helps accelerate the innovation mindset. Recognition is not a zero sum game. There&#8217;s an endless supply. Be generous!</p>
<p>These simple lessons resonated with the audience. Hopefully I influenced them to think slightly differently about each person&#8217;s role in the innovation life-cycle. I<em> </em>personally<em> </em>walked away with much more. Not only did I have an incredible day flying the lunar simulator, (successfully landing the first attempt and crashing the second!), sitting in the cockpit of a simulated 757 aircraft, and visiting a space robot who can build a station on the moon, I also met some of the smartest people on the planet, and was inspired by their long-standing commitment to improving the lives of others.</p>
<p>What I really learned at NASA has little to do with space exploration and everything to do with everyday life.  I was reminded that we all face similar issues &#8212; and innovation is really a people issue.  Maybe not everyone dreams of space travel, but everyone should be allowed to dream and have the opportunity to make a difference.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks, Alisa, for writing this inspiring piece for us!</p>
<p><a href="http://thegreenhorns.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc02464.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11162" title="DSC02464" src="http://thegreenhorns.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc02464.jpg?w=425&#038;h=318" alt="" width="425" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>“Where  is the midwife!?!” Erin, a young organic apprentice, jokes as the  rolling cackle of a hen sharpens and peaks signaling the arrival of a  new egg. I turn and smile at the rusty, little hen tucked in the corner  of the tool shed. “Just breath he-he whoooo he-he whoo,” I chime in, and  return, laughing, to filling seedling bags with soil.</p>
<p>Six  months ago, I was sitting in the office of a small environmental  non-profit in Boston, MA discontent with where my career was going, but  unsure of what the next step was.  Today I am sitting in Renwick, New  Zealand hands full of calluses, a bit sunburnt, covered in dirt, and  loving it. My muscles may still be growing, my endurance still building,  my knowledge just budding, but I know one thing: I want to be a  farmer.<span id="more-11161"></span></p>
<p>As I’m sure is true of many young farmers these days my path into farming was not a straight one. The short version is this.</p>
<p>I  was raised in Seattle, WA and while we were lucky enough to have a  local pea patch ten minutes from our house, walking past this little  community garden was the closest I got to &#8220;farming&#8221; in my youth. I went  to a very eco-friendly college, and grew up in a &#8220;green&#8221; part of  America, but I really couldn&#8217;t tell you where I first heard about  WWOOFing. Yet sitting in my little downtown Boston office thinking to  myself, &#8220;You&#8217;re not happy here anymore. Something has to change.&#8221;  WWOOFing was what popped into my head.  I debated, researched, and  struggled with what to do, but the idea of volunteering on an organic  farm grew and grew and grew until finally I decided a year of WWOOFing  around the world was just what I needed.</p>
<p>I  started off in Italy helping on a small dairy farm tucked at the foot  of the Swiss Alps. The farm consisted of five jersey cows, two meat  cows, 16 goats, a thriving herd of chickens, a couple of friendly barn  cats and a feisty pack of farm dogs. If I had to sum up this section of  my journey I would call it “Shoveling Shit is Good for the Soul.” My  first day mucking out stalls was freeing and thrilling in the oddest of  ways.  You see, I was happy, honestly and completely happy cleaning up  piles of steaming cow shit. It felt like I was doing the first real work  of my life and each time I learned a new trick of the trade or behavior  to watch out for I got excited.  “Here, see this hollow spot on her  back, this means she’s still hungry. Oh! Her tail is going up, better  get out of the way!” and plop another pile hit the floor. During my two  months WWOOFing in Italy, I learned what it was to control animals not  by force, but by will; what it felt like to be the low man on the totem  pole and accept each job as it came. Most importantly of all though, I  started to get an inkling of how hard and never ending a farmer’s work  can be and how little I understood about the blood, sweat, and time that  went into the food I ate.  Every bit of cheese became like gold, and  each egg a tiny gift.</p>
<p>When  winter finally arrived, the work ran low so I headed to New Zealand and  a biodynamic vineyard, complete with large veggie garden, three milking  cows, chickens, a pair of goats and two Clydesdales. It was here that I  really got to dig my toes in the dirt and reached the turning point  from &#8220;a bit of fun volunteering&#8221; to a serious passion. The turning point  was potatoes.</p>
<p>Sean,  one of my host and the designated &#8220;WWOOFer sitter,&#8221; cut into the earth  with the tip of his hoe pulling up clumps of dirt and sliding them  against the potato plants. He worked gloveless and smiling, while I  worked gloved and semi-silent fighting the hard, rocky ground with my  hoe. “You must be incredibly strong,” I remarked. “It’s all technique,”  he smirked, and went on chatting about politics, music and his lady,  while I hacked at the earth. After a bit, he stopped, &#8220;Turn the hoe at  an angle, so you can use the point like this. This is rocky ground, so  take brakes when you need to and switch directions often.&#8221; I struck the  earth again and the hoe when a bit farther, pulled a bit easier and I  felt a little less inept.</p>
<p>While  hand-mounding potatoes is not my favorite job, that night as I ate some  roasted potatoes harvested from another patch in the garden,  I  wondered why only the religious say thank you before a meal and if I had  ever been happier or felt more complete. It was these moments of hard  work, laughing at myself, getting dirty, and appreciation that finally  convinced me that I want to work the land.</p>
<p>My  muscles may still be growing, my endurance still building, my knowledge  just budding, but I know one thing: I want to be a farmer.</p>

Okay, there are still some of them left. But with <a href="http://technologizer.com/2011/02/16/borders-goes-bankrupt/">Monday&#8217;s news that bookselling behemoth Borders is filing for bankruptcy and shuttering at least 200 stores</a>, it&#8217;s worth taking a look at what&#8217;s happened to the retailing of physical media in this country in recent years. It&#8217;s been a remarkably bleak time.</p>
<p>The music retailing business has almost completely collapsed; the nation&#8217;s biggest video-rental outfit is bankrupt and its largest competitor folded last year; Borders is threatened with extinction and its larger and more successful rival, Barnes &amp; Noble, faces serious challenges. All this woe has befallen these industries at the same time that digital media&#8211;from music downloads to streaming movies&#8211;has boomed.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame digital content alone for media retailing&#8217;s hard times. Storekeeping has always been a tricky business, especially during economic slumps. (I don&#8217;t think that MP3s or iTunes had anything to do with the demise of big chains such as Linens n&#8217; Things. Long before Amazon and Netflix started distributing content digitally, they up-ended their respective industries by shipping physical goods through the mail&#8211;Borders has better prices every day than Borders has when it&#8217;s having a going-out-of-business sale.) And several of the giant retailers that have crashed seem to have been the victim of their own boneheaded business decisions more than anything else. (Borders opened three locations within two miles of each other in San Francisco, all of which are now toast; the management of Hollywood Video mocked Netflix-style mail-order DVD distribution as a blip they didn&#8217;t need to concern themselves with.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, here&#8217;s a timeline of what&#8217;s happened to the nation&#8217;s largest physical-media merchants over the past eight years. It starts in February of 2003&#8211;a little over four years after Diamond Media released the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30076153/ns/business-us_business/">Rio PMP300 MP3 player</a>, a moment that I, at least, consider the real beginning of the digital revolution.</p>

<p>Blockbuster says it&#8217;ll close 150 more stores in April, with further cuts later in the year for a total of 500 to 545 closures. &#8220;While we believe the future is bright, the next 12 to 18 months will  remain challenging as we balance the secular decline of a single channel  with the ascension of emerging channels, such as vending and  digital,&#8221; CEO Jim Keyes says in a canned statement.</p>

<p>Best Buy says it will slash store space devoted to DVDs and CDs.</p>

<h3>February 2011</h3>
<p>Borders files for bankruptcy and announces plans to close at least 200 more stores. President Mike Edwards says the move &#8220;affords Borders the opportunity to move forward in implementing the appropriate business strategy designed to reposition Borders to be a potentially vibrant, national retailer of books and other products&#8221;</p>
<p>Whew. I think that&#8217;s at least six thousand individual retail locations that have vanished, and it&#8217;s not a complete list. As you might guess, I&#8217;m not inclined to cling to shiny discs or dead trees out of pure nostalgia, and a fair number of the defunct businesses above were no great shakes&#8211;but putting together this list still left me feeling wistful.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a less melancholy note on which to end this exercise: The best locally-owned purveyors of physical media seem to be in better shape than the soulless megachains. San Francisco&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amoeba.com/">Amoeba Music</a>, <a href="http://www.levideo.com">Le Video</a>, and <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/">Green Apple Books</a>, for instance, are sprawling, wonderfully quirky independents that are still very much with us. Thank goodness for that. I feel like I might live long enough to see the city get down to its last music retailer, video-rental business, and bookstore&#8211;and I&#8217;d be awfully sad if they were a FYE, a Blockbuster, and a Barnes &amp; Noble&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in full &#8220;countdown mode&#8221; these days, and very aware of my dwindling days in Japan. In a way though, it&#8217;s become a good thing. Knowing that I only have a couple of months left in this fascinating country has really given my spirit of adventure a boost.</p>
<p><a href="http://haikugirl.wordpress.com/2010/07/04/unagi/" target="_blank">Last July</a> I went to a nearby area called Kanzanji with my friends. At that time, I spotted a tall Buddha statue peeping above some trees and vowed that I would try to go back there and find it. When I woke up on Sunday the sun was shining, and I decided it was as good a day as any for a Buddha hunt!</p>
<p>Armed with very little information, I hopped on the bus at Hamamatsu bus station (number 30 from bus stop 1) and watched the world go by for 45 minutes as the bus took me to Kanzanji. It only cost ￥550 (each way), which I thought was pretty good. I got off the bus at the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%9C%E5%90%8D%E6%B9%96%E3%83%91%E3%83%AB%E3%83%91%E3%83%AB" target="_blank">Pal Pal (パルパル)</a> stop (by number 7 on the map below). I remembered Pal Pal (an amusement park) from my previous trip.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="My route around Kanzanji by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443931434/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5251/5443931434_8cfe83debb.jpg" alt="My route around Kanzanji" width="450" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>On the map above, you can see the route I walked (if it&#8217;s too small, click on it and you can see a bigger one). Starting at the bus stop by the number 7 (roughly in the centre of the map), I walked left and up towards Kanzanji Temple to find the Buddha (black line). After visiting the temple and shrine (blue line), I made a brief detour to the beach area, then back past Pal Pal to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanzanji_Ropeway" target="_blank">Kanzanji Ropeway</a>. I took the ropeway up to where the Orgel Museum is (although I didn&#8217;t go in). There&#8217;s also an observation deck up there, which was very blowy! I briefly stopped for lunch &#8211; a rice ball and some green tea, with a beautiful view, then made my way down the mountain on foot. It was a longer route than I imagined, but I&#8217;m glad I tried it because I had the chance to see a lot of countryside on the way. As I walked round I realised how close I was to <a href="http://www.hamazoo.net/index.php" target="_blank">Hamamatsu Zoo</a>, and decided to pay it a visit (<a href="http://haikugirl.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/hamamatsu-zoo/" target="_blank">more about that here</a>). After the zoo, I walked back down to Bay Street, where I caught the bus home (near the number 8 on the map). It was very very windy and I got quite &#8220;wind-burnt&#8221; as I was walking, but it was worth it all for the gorgeous views &#8211; I was so lucky with the weather!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the day in pictures&#8230;</p>
<p>My goal was to get here to this Buddha. I love big Buddha statues! <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="I'm going to find this Buddha! by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443138813/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5443138813_741362ca28.jpg" alt="I'm going to find this Buddha!" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Even though Kanzanji is a temple, there&#8217;s a shrine right next to it, and the main entrance to the whole area is through a &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii" target="_blank">torii</a>&#8220;, a gate which indicates you are entering a shrine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Torii Gate by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443744982/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5443744982_9dc4361445.jpg" alt="Torii Gate" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>There was an unusual little building for &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ema_(Shint%C5%8D)" target="_blank">ema</a>&#8221; (message boards):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Ema by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443749548/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/5443749548_460408a6eb.jpg" alt="Ema" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>So many!</p>
<p>People had also left some &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omamori" target="_blank">omamori</a>&#8221; inside, but I don&#8217;t really know why.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Ema &amp; Omamori by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443149653/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5175/5443149653_e5cde94987.jpg" alt="Ema &amp; Omamori" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>I found many smaller Buddhas on my journey&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Buddha by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443754154/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5052/5443754154_e831694e27.jpg" alt="Buddha" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is Kanzanji:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Kanzanji Temple by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443155069/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5131/5443155069_d6131f2201.jpg" alt="Kanzanji Temple" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, I can find very little written about this temple online.</p>
<p>The ceiling was really interesting:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Temple ceiling by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443159325/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5443159325_c116623b46.jpg" alt="Temple ceiling" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>When I bought an &#8220;omamori&#8221; (good luck charm) in the shop, the monk happily chatted to me &#8211; in English! He told me he was studying English because someone in his family had married an Australian. He was such a nice man, and thanked me for giving him the chance to practice speaking English!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Kanzanji shop by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443161823/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5443161823_22fa13e88c.jpg" alt="Kanzanji shop" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>It was a day of many steps, as usual&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Steps by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443166635/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5443166635_bd20c2958f.jpg" alt="Steps" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As I walked the long way round to the Buddha, I felt like I was walking to the top of the world (even though it wasn&#8217;t really so high). And I was completely alone &#8211; just me and the gorgeous view!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lake Hamana by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443178675/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5134/5443178675_ca7a6d2303.jpg" alt="Lake Hamana" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Finally I came to the Buddha:</p>
<p><a title="Kanzanji Buddha by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443193899/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5294/5443193899_82aeb86397.jpg" alt="Kanzanji Buddha" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>It seems Buddha has hung up his shoes to rest&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Buddha's shoes by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443204691/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5014/5443204691_8fef5e367a.jpg" alt="Buddha's shoes" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>At the base of the buddha there were these two elephant vases. I wonder what the significance was?</p>
<p><a title="Elephant vases by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443206471/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5443206471_a1437ebfba.jpg" alt="Elephant vases" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>On the way back down I stumbled upon this curious little cave full of &#8220;ema&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Little &quot;ema&quot; cave by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443213831/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/5443213831_932648f613.jpg" alt="Little &quot;ema&quot; cave" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I did actually crawl right in&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Little &quot;ema&quot; cave by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443820294/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/5443820294_73f7dc439a.jpg" alt="Little &quot;ema&quot; cave" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, I did kind of feel like I was in a Ghibli movie!</p>
<p>Back down by the temple, I looked at the old shrine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Shrine by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443225901/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5443225901_0aff5ed188.jpg" alt="Shrine" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Chōzuya (or Temizuya) by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443236799/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5139/5443236799_225202c756.jpg" alt="Chōzuya (or Temizuya)" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Walking back, I paused by the beach area. The wind was getting up and there were even some windsurfers out on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Hamana" target="_blank">Lake Hamana</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Windsurfer  by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443241891/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5054/5443241891_45e2536136.jpg" alt="Windsurfer " width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>I was tempted to stop for &#8220;unagi&#8221; (eel) but resisted.</p>
<p><a title="Unagi restaurant by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443845112/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/5443845112_0fb674e18e.jpg" alt="Unagi restaurant" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was also tempted to stop at the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashiyu" target="_blank">ashiyu</a>&#8221; (hot spring bath for feet), but it was a bit chilly for taking my socks off and getting wet! (The water was lovely and warm though.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Ashiyu by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443845830/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5092/5443845830_416edb3031.jpg" alt="Ashiyu" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t go in Pal Pal, but I had a great view of it from the ropeway.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Pal Pal by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443253153/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5060/5443253153_909d452538.jpg" alt="Pal Pal" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>It was a bit bumpy on the ropeway, because it was so windy. I love this ropeway though&#8230; Just the same as last time I rode it, the &#8220;elevator music&#8221; that they play on the way up is &#8220;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#8221;. That has to be a conscious choice!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Kanzanji Ropeway by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443260619/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/5443260619_fb04144ff5.jpg" alt="Kanzanji Ropeway" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>It was far too cold and windy to stay on the observation deck for long!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Lake Hamana by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443867596/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5012/5443867596_b49683041c.jpg" alt="Lake Hamana" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>

<p>Soon it was time for lunch. I found a nice little spot out of the wind, with a beautiful view. I&#8217;ll tell you, my rice ball sure did taste good after all that walking!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="A nice spot for lunch by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443884078/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/5443884078_967cc3a5fb.jpg" alt="A nice spot for lunch" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>After lunch I began wandering down the mountain, attempting to follow my map (pictured above). I have to confess I did switch on the GPS on my phone at one point, just to make sure I was still heading in the right direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Kanzanji countryside by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443290715/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5060/5443290715_5efda3548e.jpg" alt="Kanzanji countryside" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>I seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, but soon spotted Pal Pal again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Pal Pal by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443308341/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/5443308341_20ab97fa42.jpg" alt="Pal Pal" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Along the way I found some cherry blossom. It&#8217;s far too early for cherry blossom though, so I&#8217;m not sure what it was. Perhaps a different kind of cherry tree??</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Early cherry blossom? by Haiku Girl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiku_girl/5443294547/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5443294547_d35f634687.jpg" alt="Early cherry blossom?" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like the last several days I have gotten on CNN.com, there has been mention of Donald Trump and his conversation regarding a <a title="Trump CNN Article" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/15/trump-lays-down-his-stance-on-social-issues/" target="_blank">possible run for president</a>.  I&#8217;m quite curious if he&#8217;s going to &#8216;throw his hat in&#8217;.</p>
<p><a title="CNN Trump Article" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/15/trump-lays-down-his-stance-on-social-issues/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-439" title="CNN Trump Article" src="http://themommychapters.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/screen-shot-2011-02-15-at-10-53-27-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=167" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan of the Trumps on an entertainment, fashion, travel, and leisure level.  I watch Celebrity Apprentice (although, I admit, I usually don&#8217;t love the celebs competing to begin with, but I end up getting into the competition of it all after a few episodes).  I think Ivanka has some great pieces in her jewelry (and now shoe and handbag) line.  The family has top-notch business savvy, and their hotels and golf courses aren&#8217;t too shabby.</p>
<p>The whole political arena seems to be a completely different thing though.  (Perhaps they relate more than at first glimpse.)  I wonder how easy it would be to position himself as a national leader coming from the life of a business guru.  One of the things Trump was saying in the article was that he&#8217;s made a great deal of money for his companies and would do the same for the American people.  So, obviously he&#8217;s working on trying to bridge the two.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard much from the public regarding their opinion of this potential candidate.  Are they taking him seriously?  Does he have a great deal of supporters?  Are people apprehensive being he hasn&#8217;t had (to my knowledge) a significant prior roll in politics?</p>
