				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://litlove.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/give-me-everything.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3156" alt="give me everything" src="http://litlove.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/give-me-everything.jpg?w=182&#038;h=276" width="182" height="276" /></a>In the autumn of 2003, James Lasdun ran a fiction workshop at an American college where he met a talented Iranian-American student whom he calls ‘Nasreen’. He praised her work and encouraged her and they had an entirely ordinary and satisfactory working relationship. Two years later, she sent him the finished manuscript of her novel in the hope he would read and comment on it. Busy at the time, Lasdun did the next best thing and offered to put her in touch with his agent. He then embarked on an email correspondence with her, for the most part benign, but including some mild flirtatious remarks, which he took to be (hoped were) ironic. When James told her that he was planning a cross-country train journey, and she replied that she wanted to smuggle herself into his cabin, ‘I began to realise that something more explicitly discouraging than a mere tactful silence was going to be required of me.’</p>
<p>At first Nasreen seemed to take it quite well. But her emails continued to multiply in his inbox and the tone became inconsistent; there would be some apologetic emails, some normal, some angry and troubling. As the volume increased to dozens a day, and the sentiment turned to outright hostility and rage, Lasdun stopped replying. Whilst this would seem like the only way to proceed, the absence of his voice seemed to catapult Nasreen into a fantasy world of her own making in which she was a victim of all sorts of malpractice. She accused him of plagiarising her work, and of stealing it to pass on to other writers (who then published before her). She insisted he’d had an affair with one of the other students in her writing class, she went on to claim that he had ‘organised’ a rape that had happened to her before the two of them met at the fiction workshop, and there were of course, reams of vicious criticism about his writing all peppered with anti-Semitic attacks. And then she spread her net wide, sending written allegations about him to all the colleges he worked at, altering his wikipedia entry, forwarding unpleasant internet material to friends and colleagues in his name, leaving atrocious reviews of his books on amazon, etc and etc, until Lasdun was nearly half out of his mind with anxiety about what she would do next, and whether he would ever work again.</p>
<blockquote><p>My total failure, after all these months, to slow down or in any way inhibit the flow of hatred had had a demoralising effect (as I write, the BP oil catastrophe is unfolding and it is impossible not to picture Nasreen’s hostility as that blackness on the spillcams, billowing unstoppably from the ocean floor, my efforts to staunch it as ineffective as BP’s with their feeble funnels and top kills). I felt flayed, utterly defenceless. Every email sent lacerating spasms through me as it struck, each with an afterburn, a half-life that was nowhere near over before the next one came in, so that I could never regroup my own forces.’</p></blockquote>
<p>What, you may ask, did he do about it? Well, pretty much everything possible to block her, including trying to involve the FBI. But as a supposedly ‘privileged’ white male claiming wrong done to him by an Iranian woman, and a student at that, he was on the wrong side of the PC divide, and in the case of a relatively new internet, outside the boundaries of the law. And it was not easy trying to put what was happening into words: ‘the harder I tried to be neutral and objective, the crazier I sounded.’ There’s a painful moment when his boss at the college turns up with a ‘very weird email’ about him, a tirade of verbal abuse in fact, which looks pretty bonkers on the face of it, but which nevertheless unsettles an always-jumpy head of an American college. Lasdun is dismayed to find that his boss expresses some concerns about the accusation of ‘daytrading fiction’, which is Nasreen’s claim that he sent her work out to other writers to use, something Lasdun had thought would appear patently absurd. It’s the same old story – some of the flung mud always sticks.</p>
<p>What raises this book above the undeniably fascinating category of car crash literature, however, is the brilliance of the writing and the depth of thought that has clearly gone into Lasdun’s account. Retreating into his inner depths to try to ascertain the extent of his own guilt, and to understand the nature of their imploded relationship, he is drawn towards literary works and writers that echo or simply speak to his situation – Gawain and the Green Knight, D. H. Lawrence, Tintin. Some of these long digressions offer incredibly potent glimpses into the sorts of darkness and pain we are manufacturing in our modern technological age, due in part to our mindless reliance on the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>One would think that the ease of performing such manipulations and the large scale on which they immediately began occurring would have long ago discredited the Web as a source of information about anything, but…our first instinct, being creatures of the Word, is to trust it, and even on deeper consideration we tend to feel that it is basically more right than wrong, and that we can accept its approximations as the truth.’</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right, of course. The lack of policing on the web and the opportunities it offers to upset, harm and smear others is something that hasn’t had much thought given to it yet. You’ve got to hope that the example of James Lasdun does set some sort of process in motion (not even phone calls from the police deter Nasreen, as she realises on some level that no one will really take the trouble to stop her). And yet, what ultimately intrigued me about this book was the refusal on Lasdun’s part to see Nasreen as simply mentally troubled. The emails he reproduced came across to me as quite self-evidently nutty (and vicious and rageful), but he believed that labelling her behaviour as psychotic would free her from responsibility when he felt sure her attacks were calculated. But it also ‘becomes, for literary purposes, less interesting (at least to me).’ And here we come to the quiet crux of the matter; Lasdun becomes entangled in Nasreen’s web of hatred for ‘there was also something manifestly creative in her unstoppable productivity, a vitality I couldn’t help envying.’ There is a force, albeit one of negativity, that attracts him magnetically and which prevents him from dismissing her and walking away. For me this begs the question of why it should be so much easier to do the things that are wrong, for us and for others, than it is to make the enormous effort to do things that are right. But maybe the saving grace of the whole situation, and the reason it damages him so, is that Nasreen offered him a convoluted way of suffering for art. This is an extraordinary book, but one that came at a very high price.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was out grocery shopping, and I saw a sweet deal on my favorite soda. I go through the stuff like most people go through water, so I jumped on it. When I got to the counter it didn&#8217;t ring up correctly, and I brought it to the clerk&#8217;s attention. He said it would ring properly after the sale finished, but it didn&#8217;t so I brought it to his attention again. Long story short, the soda was mislabeled. I had to go through a bit of a song and dance, but I got my money back (and the soda too!), which was pretty nice.</p>
<p>The experience reminded me that <a href="http://mnsho.com/2012/08/06/customer-service-its-not-just-for-sissies-anymore/">I&#8217;ve had plenty to say in the past about bad customer service</a>, but having been on both sides of the retail counter plenty of times, I&#8217;ve also seen plenty of bad customers. While the retail experience has been perfected from art to science (<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/78992">quite literally</a>), the retail customer doesn&#8217;t seem to have changed much from the dark days when I plied the trade. For those of you who might find yourselves in a customer service crisis, here&#8217;s some tips on how to get the most out of the situation.</p>
<p><b>Be Polite</b> &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of a single situation in my life (other than a fistfight) that hasn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t have been improved by being polite. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people try to intimidate store clerks and managers, either physically or socially, and I have to tell you it almost always backfires. Being polite at the least keeps the situation in the realm of negotiation, which means you might get something, rather than demand, in which case you&#8217;re far more likely to get nothing.</p>
<p>One of my favorite misconceptions in retail is &#8220;the customer is always right&#8221;. I don&#8217;t just mean this as a factual misconception, I mean this as a misconception in the sense that anyone in retail does or should believe this. Maybe if I only had a handful of customers come in on a regular basis and my livelihood depended on them, then <i>maybe</i> I would consider this phrase, but still unlikely. In this day and age, when most retail is as anonymous as an online chat room and I have no reason to believe I will ever see you again, why should I go out of my way to put up with your crap? Because you&#8217;ll badmouth me to all your cheap friends, who are as likely to pull the same stunt as you are? Yeah, that&#8217;s a threat.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another way to look at it: suppose I came to your office one day and told you that you were doing everything wrong. I (very loudly and obnoxiously) explain how you should be doing your job, running your business, and handling every situation, even though I clearly have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, and chances are better than even you saw be stealing some rubber bands from the supply closet fifteen minutes ago. Then, to top it all off, I insist that I know how to run your business because I worked in a similar business for a summer in high school, thus implying that any idiot can do it.</p>
<p>Would you at all be inclined to give me anything I want under those conditions? If so, you&#8217;d be the first.</p>
<p><b>Be Patient</b> &#8211; The next biggest sin I see people committing (and I do this too, but I try not to) is that they assume there should be someone ready to help them as soon as they need it, especially if they feel like they&#8217;ve been wronged somehow. I get this, I do. You paid good money for a specific product or service, and that product or service was not produced. You want satisfaction, and the longer you have to wait, the more you feel you are being cheated, because your time is also valuable.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: They&#8217;re (usually) not making you wait on purpose. Most stores understand that having an unhappy customer standing around fuming does not make them look good to the other customers. But there are other customers to consider, and that&#8217;s assuming someone is even aware of your needs. Then there are certain procedures they need to follow, which if they don&#8217;t could mean they lose their job, which means a lot more to them than your displeasure (and trust me, they will never get fired just because you asked to speak to the manager and they were following the procedures).</p>
<p>Most of all, if there&#8217;s <i>any</i> flexibility to be had in this situation, you want it to work for you, not against you, and the fact of the matter is you are not in the position of power that you think you are. They might prefer not to lose you as a customer, but the more of an asshole you are the less they care, and there&#8217;s no law against not giving in to your unreasonable demands. Even on the (very off) chance they&#8217;re in the wrong, what are the chances you&#8217;re going to sue over a can of tomatoes or even something as big as a sweater? Slim to none, and they know that. So cool your jets.</p>
<p><b>Be Flexible</b> &#8211; This one&#8217;s a little tough to internalize, but it&#8217;s important. Most people go into a customer service situation expecting they are there to right a wrong. Not so. You are going into a negotiation, and the rules are a little fuzzy. There may be laws that apply, but do you know them? Do you really think the kid behind the counter does? And does anyone really care? There&#8217;s store policy, but that usually has some leeway to it. And then there&#8217;s custom and convention, which are pretty weak guidelines at best.</p>
<p>So understand that you are not there to right some moral wrong. You have a situation you want resolved, one were you feel you were not treated fairly, and you have a specific <i>preferred</i> resolution in mind. That&#8217;s nice. You might even get that. But be open to the possibility that there are in fact laws, policies, or even customs and conventions that are going to work against or even completely prevent you getting exactly what you want. And that&#8217;s even assuming you are completely right about the situation, which I&#8217;ve seen all too many times isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>So now what? Well, you can resort to screaming and demands and see how far that gets you (usually escorted out of the store), or you can be flexible. Oftentimes unless you are completely in the wrong store managers will prefer to find a negotiated middle ground where the customer walks away feeling satisfied, and you can use that fact to your advantage. If you were expecting a full refund, maybe a partial refund, or a discount on a future purchase or exchange. Be open to alternatives.</p>
<p><b>Be Firm</b> &#8211; This goes hand in hand with being flexible. Unless you are completely in the wrong (in which case you should make as quick of a retreat as you can), stand by your guns. Don&#8217;t let the manager or anyone else try to bully or snowball you. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of times where they will pull out a circular or ad and say something like &#8220;that was last week&#8217;s sale&#8221; when they forgot to change the signage in the store, even though we both know their own store policy is to honor their posted prices.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no need to be a dick about it, but make sure to stand your ground and be aware of your position. The best thing to do in these cases is to simply refuse to argue with them. If they pull out the circular, nod and say something like &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s the case, but the posted price on the shelf was different.&#8221; This way you aren&#8217;t engaging them, but you are refusing to be scared off as well. And notice: still polite. Eventually (if you are patient) they will likely offer some recompense. If you&#8217;re flexible, you should be able to get something satisfying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The amazing thing about a memoir retreat,” I said to my friend Claire yesterday.</p>
<p>“—is that they exist?” she finished.</p>
<p>“No.” I laughed, then paused. “Well…maybe. I was going to say the amazing thing about a memoir retreat is that, in the course of a few minutes you get to know someone in a way that otherwise takes months or years. You say, ‘What’s your writing project about?’ and they tell you their big story. The thing they haven’t figured out yet. They thing they can’t get over. The most difficult experience they’ve ever had. It’s instant intimacy. And everyone—I guess because they’ve already made the decision to write about themselves—is just incredibly open.”</p>
<p>Many people, I think, will be quick to dismiss the idea of a memoir retreat altogether. And while no one has said this to me yet, I can imagine what they might say: “Why on earth would it seem like a good idea to bring together a bunch of narcissists and say to them, ‘Write more about your own trivial experiences! Publish them!’ Why would we—in the era of blogs, and Facebook, and Twitter—encourage even more oversharing? And why would we dare imply that that oversharing could be literature?”</p>
<div id="attachment_953" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 536px"><a href="http://mandylen.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-953 " alt="photo (2)" src="http://mandylen.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-2.jpg?w=526&#038;h=394" width="526" height="394" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the view of Icicle Creek from Sleeping Lady Resort</p></div>
<p>The amazing thing about <a href="http://wildmountainmemoir.wordpress.com/">this particular memoir retreat</a>&#8211;Wild Mountain&#8211;was that everyone I met had already asked that essential question: “So what?” And even if some folks didn’t yet have an answer, everyone understood, implicitly, that they needed one. No one seemed interested in what Susan Shapiro <a href="http://mandylen.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/january-roundup-love-and-memoir/">termed</a> “upbeat anecdotal slices of life.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been struggling with a minor revelation regarding my own writing: I’ve got to be more honest—to bare more, to be more vulnerable—if I want people to read it. And being more honest requires more me in the book. It means, like it or not, that what I’m writing <em>is</em> a memoir. There’s just no way around it.<span id="more-941"></span></p>
<p>Steven Church, on his blog <a href="http://myatomicangst.blogspot.ca/">My Atomic Angst</a>, explains his discomfort with the “memoir” label in a way that echoes my own:</p>
<blockquote><p>I begged, in fact, during production, that [my book] not say &#8220;memoir&#8221; in the title or subtitle. I didn’t want it to be reduced to that one word label, perhaps because for the last few years, especially at conferences like the AWP conference, the “memoir” tag has been like the herpes of genre labels; but more importantly than labels, I wanted the book to behave differently than a traditional memoir. I wanted it to be something more like a book-length braided personal essay with fictional and journalistic elements. And I didn’t want readers to look at the cover and expect something different.</p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">I am embarrassed to admit this in front of my fellow retreat-goers (and new friends) but I drove down to Leavenworth preparing myself for the possibility that I might be spending the weekend among overconfident self-promoters or&#8211;worse yet&#8211;evangelists of the upbeat anecdote and the dogma of uniqueness. Which is why I was relieved to hear organizer Theo Pauline Nester declare on the first night: “Your story is not new.”</span></p>
<p>The amazing thing about this particular retreat is that, unlike several of the reviews of Associated Writers Program conference the weekend before, every response I’ve read to Wild Mountain has been insistently, unwaveringly positive. As my friend Amy Stolls <a href="http://artworks.arts.gov/?p=16421">said about AWP</a>: “Judging by the post-conference commentary, [attendees] were either quietly inspired to write more and write better, or were crushed by the sheer numbers of writers attending and vowed never to attend an AWP conference again.” (See also Steve Almond’s lukewarm “<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112633/awp-conference-2013-writing-boom-time-declining-readers">The Writing Industry is Booming, even if the Book Industry Isn’t</a>.”)</p>
<p>For me, universal positivity always inspires a particular brand of knee-jerk cynicism: <i>Students don’t complain about an assignment? It’s not challenging enough. A book is unanimously lauded? It must be shallow.</i> <i>A lot of people like my blog post? I’m being a crowd pleaser.</i><em> </em>I do not trust it—in the same way I don’t trust people who dress appropriately for every occasion, whose hair always stays in place. Universal positivity is just spackling over some darker truth, warns a voice in my head. <i>A memoir retreat is popular? It must be pandering</i><em>. </em>But damn is it hard to be cynical toward a group of people who have generously and willingly opened themselves up to you within the first few hours of your acquaintance. Some things, I struggle to admit, are just good. Some compliments are well-earned.</p>
<p>Yes, Wild Mountain might seem like a perfect illustration of the booming writing industry Steve Almond saw at AWP: a two-day stay at a rustic-but-luxurious resort with some writing classes thrown in. But that&#8217;s a pretty narrow view of what the retreat offered to so many people: an authentication of the personal story, a reiteration of the value of human-to-human connections.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Wild Mountain was probably inspired by keynote speaker Cheryl Strayed, who seemed to be admired at the retreat with, at times, fanatic devotion. Such admiration is easy to dismiss (see above), but I remember reading <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/archives/2192">&#8220;The Love of my Life&#8221; </a>my first year of graduate school and finally sensing that my decision to transfer from a fiction writing program to a creative nonfiction program was not the product of my own misery, but of some larger instinct about the kind of writer I could be. Her first sentence was a revelation to me: writing could be like that. It could be bare-bones honest without being sensational.</p>
<p>So I, too, am bound to my admiration. (And perhaps it is important to remember that, though it is rare, some people succeed out of sheer deservingness. And thank God the world we live in allows for that once in awhile.) In her talk, Cheryl urged us to “write with a sense of abundance. Be happy for others’ successes.” And to “surrender to mediocrity” rather than worrying about our own talents and abilities. As far as writing advice goes, this is solid stuff, advice more interested in enabling others&#8217; success than in celebrating her own.</p>
<p>Wild Mountain could’ve pandered to writers who had sacrificed their time and money by simply telling them what they wanted to hear: that their stories were marketable, that their experiences were interesting just by virtue of having happened. Instead everyone—faculty and attendees alike—railed against the idea that your story is about you, or that anecdote equals art. But the most valuable thing about the retreat was that it always brought our attention back to the thing that matters most for a writer: the work itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theopaulinenestor.com/">Theo</a> describes memoir as &#8220;a genre in its adolescence.&#8221; She thinks readers are increasingly interested in memoir because we&#8217;re out of touch with the stories and storytellers of the tight-knit communities of the past. She believes we&#8217;re reading memoir to learn how to live. And I love this idea. Intuitively, it sounds right to me.</p>
<p>Steven Church, in that same blog post, (and, I think, on a panel at AWP) agrees about memoir&#8217;s potential as a genre:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to believe that we can also think of the expectations of memoir more generously, more broadly than the confessional or traumatic. I want to believe we can think of memoir in terms of the author’s personal connection to the ideas in the book; that the form, at it’s best, can use personal experience to gather up the distinct threads of a book and bring them together into a narrative of thought that is more compelling and nuanced than a simple summary of the crazy shit that happened. Perhaps memoir can be about a place, a state, or about an entire generation and less about trafficking in humiliation or confessing some pain, loss, or sorrow. Perhaps like all literature it is aiming to capture the sublime confluence of these and other human experiences through the synchronicity of ideas and emotions.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I’ve been thinking about what this all means for me. As a memoir writer, I’ve got to stop being defensive, to stop worrying about the larger perception of what I’m doing and focus on the work. And as a writing teacher, I’ve got to start championing—both in my classes and in the world at large—the generous possibilities of memoir. Because our stories matter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_462" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 223px"><a href="http://anntaylorfashionstatement.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1976-contrast.jpeg"><img src="http://anntaylorfashionstatement.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/1976-contrast.jpeg?w=213&#038;h=300" alt="Ann Taylor " width="213" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-462" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ann Taylor is wearing a scoop-neck nylon T shirt.</p></div>I first met Marion Talmadge Etheridge at her annual New Year’s Day party in her tumbledown plantation house on St. Helena Island. She was in her late thirties, tall, blond curls, good figure, mother of two, married to a tire salesman. She was an artist who could draw like crazy, ambidextrous with a charcoal stick in each hand sketching a portrait, a party trick she later depended on to pay her bills. </p>
<p>I drove down the long drive, still lined with trees, to The Oaks to find a crowd of beer-drinking dads in madras pants and polo shirts, an occasional baseball hat with a John Deere logo, gathered around an oyster roast in the yard. Wine-sipping moms in designer jeans filled the front porch of the Greek-revival plantation house now clad in gray asbestos shingles. Someone said that Marion was in the kitchen. I wandered through the front door. White narcissus overflowed urns, vases, pitchers, buckets in every room. My first impression was their sweet, wintry, garlicky odor. </p>
<p>I was used to people like me living in places they could never have afforded outside Savannah and coastal South Carolina. My house had nine fireplaces. Friends lived in the house on Bull Street where Lafayette stayed when he came south after the end of the war. We rattled around in our big broken-down houses without appropriate furniture, rugs, and silver. The Oaks, when Marion and her husband lived there, had plenty of heavy mahogany furniture, a long dining table with a dozen matching chairs, and a tall clock with a moon face in the front hall. Rich, old rugs lay over wide heart-pine boards, and a silver service, no longer shiny, stood on the sideboard. But the house was not quite right, too topsy-turvy, too far down the rabbit hole. </p>
<p>Every window was bare, open to marshy light, to giant oaks in the front, Chowan Creek behind the house, an old barn looking dangerously close to collapse, a country collection of rusting cars and trucks. On the mantle in the front parlor, a bevy of wigless plastic dolls had gathered. A similar crew hung out in the dining room, where Marion also kept a collection of old shoes painted silver attached with pastel ribbons to cardboard clouds. Golf clubs and a hunting rifle poked out of an umbrella stand.</p>
<p>At the back of the house, a room empty except for a pool table belonged to the husband. Marion had the kitchen, black-and-white linoleum floor tiles set on an arbitrary diagonal, cabinets painted randomly bright colors, a broken kitchen chair in one corner to which she had tied a large, white plastic flip clock with a thick rope. Marion sat with her friends around a large round table in a bay facing the tidal creek, several men and a few wives, all stoned. I slipped into an empty chair.</p>
<p>I was immediately enchanted with Marion, saw her as often as I could. Up to her elbows in cold water, washing spinach in her kitchen sink, telling me how to look at the space between the branches if I wanted to draw a tree. Coming back into my studio moments after she had left to tell me there was an alligator blocking her truck. We pounded on garbage can lids to drive him back to the river, an old guy washed out of his den by floodwaters. The Arab oil embargo made us lovers. We were in Columbus to deliver a painting. The lines long, her gas tank nearly empty, we decided to stay the night. She called one of her husband’s cousins, a professor whose wife had recently left him for a woman. He gave us dinner and a spare bedroom. I noted the irony.</p>
<p>Because I kept my hair cropped very short, I was generally assumed to be a butch. Marion’s husband shared this general assumption, accepting in his grumpy way that his wife had a lesbian lover. He said little. We spoke only when it was unavoidable. He did not enter rooms where I was and left rooms when I entered. </p>
<p>After saying all summer that we were going to take the boat out, September was slipping away with the girls back in school and we still hadn’t sailed Chowan Creek. Then one morning, Marion decided we had to sail that day and had to get under way immediately. I sat at her kitchen table gulping coffee, expecting an imminent departure, forgetting that Marion was always late, sometimes even days late. I looked at the clock tied to the kitchen chair. Marion tied the clock to the chair because the chair was sitting in her kitchen broken and unused, because the clock was heavy and fell off the wall, because she was an artist making a statement, because the clock was her marriage and she thought she was holding it together. When her daughters checked the clock to see the time, to see how late Marion was or was about to be as she puttered around her kitchen, to annoy they read aloud precisely the exact moment: oh nine three two, two two four six. </p>
<p>We eventually got out of the kitchen, packed the boat’s storage compartment with a bottle of wine and a couple of cheese sandwiches, pulled long-sleeve shirts over our bikini tops, and pushed her Sunfish to the edge of the backyard. The tide was coming in; the water was high in the creek. We pushed the boat off the bank and towed it to the dock. Marion climbed down the ladder onto the boat. I handed her the sail, rudder, and centerboard. She pushed the boat parts in place. I thought she knew what she was doing. Then I came down, took a wobbly step, and sat down hard, first time on a Sunfish in ten years. Never a sailor, always a passenger, I had spent a few high-school summer afternoons on a boyfriend’s Sunfish in Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>With the tide coming in and wind filling the sail, we moved swiftly away from the house around a bend. Marion seemed in command of her vessel. We opened the wine, looked for an inviting place to stop for lunch. Our speed slowed. Marion tried to tack, to cut a zigzag course up the creek. Each time she turned the boat to tack, I flattened myself on the deck to avoid the boom. The Vs of the zigs and zags narrowed. We sailed from one bank back to the other in a straight line, making no headway. The last time she tried to tack, Marion aimed the boat at the opposite bank, and we headed downstream with the tide. She looked more puzzled than worried. I had no idea tacking was her only sailing maneuver.</p>
<p>The boat picked up speed. We passed The Oaks before I realized where we were. The sail filled. The creek widened. No lifejackets, of course, just a quick sail because Marion had to be home when her daughters got off the school bus. “If I am going to be drowned, if I am going to be drowned, why in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate land and trees?” Stephen Crane’s sailor was washing toward shore, toward breakers, and we were headed out to sea, but the end result would be the same and my last words a quote memorized for English class. </p>
<p>Our feet in the boat’s well, we sat side by side and let wind and tide chart the course. Marion missed her kids’ homecoming. The time when her husband would come home from work and find the girls alone passed. The boat headed toward a narrow opening between a sandbar and the riverbank. Marion steered for the sandbar, but we kept going and spilled out into a wider river. An on-shore wind grabbed the sail, and briefly we headed up river. Then the tide regained control of the boat. It pulled us down river but also toward the far bank, where suddenly we were stuck in soft gray mud on the northeast shore of Parris Island. </p>
<p>We jumped off the boat into mud studded with broken shells and push-pulled the boat out of the water. Marion’s plan: we would drag the boat across the mud, find a road, and call for help. The seven mad gods’ plan: send in the Marines. Shaved heads, shirtless, in fatigues and big boots, the boys came whooping across the mud, their eyes bright with a fantasy come true. Two women in bikinis washed up on their shore in a little boat. </p>
<p>I feigned invisibility. Marion shook her short blond curls, told our tale, and begged for help. When the guys heard “I need to call my husband,” Marine Corps discipline was restored. They folded the sail, picked up the boat, and off we marched across the mud to a nearby boardwalk. Marion called her husband from a pay phone, and he came to get us in his pickup.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Marion’s soon-to-be ex-husband read aloud his journal entry for that day: “Wife attempted to drown herself and girl lover. Rescued the Sunfish from Parris Island.” He had hundreds of records, dates I had been at The Oaks, samples of marijuana removed from her stash box in the freezer, chronicles of missed appointments. Her mother testified against her, also her daughters. I wasn’t called, his lawyer thought I would be overkill. Marion lost everything. Even the car, the judge had said she must have, which was rear-ended in Charleston just before she left for New York. There she began again, her three rich names that conjured lost elegance and Southern grit compressed into one: Savannah.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Goal: to create one piece of art each day for 365 consecutive days</span></p>
<p>I stood in front of a mirror, taking no more than two minutes to do a quick sketch of myself yesterday. The drawing had very little likeness to me &#8211; that was not really my aim. I just wanted to draw a face quickly.  I walked back into my studio wondering what I was going to do with the thing. I added a few circles above the head and stared. Hmm. I began drawing circles over the face, varying sizes to build form. It was a bit creepy, yet interesting. Strangely enough, I am a fan of the piece.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning: contains parenting and a degree of positivity or even optimism.</p>
<p>One of my more commented on posts (not that that this is saying much) is <a href="http://dadwhowrites.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/eight-is-a-difficult-age/">Eight is a difficult age</a>, an agonised <em>cri de couer</em> about the whining (him) and yelling (us) that dudelet, then eight, was putting us through. He&#8217;s now nine. Time to check in.</p>
<p>Back in last February, we were experiencing meltdowns and tantrums that could go on for an hour then flare up again if you looked at him funny. Literally anything could be a trigger. We ultimately put it down to a long list of age related circumstances with &#8216;tiredness&#8217; at the top of the list. A year later, Dudelet still gets up at 5:30 most days and reads then stomps downstairs to (clunk) unlock the downstairs rooms (and wake us all up) and get himself breakfast, watch television or otherwise amuse himself. By 7:30pm in the evening, only the matchsticks are keeping his eyes open.</p>
<p>His sleeping schedule dominates the whole household in that the rest of us stagger through the morning feeling grumpy, hard-done-by and liable to snap.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, he sees this as grotesquely unfair &#8211; he can&#8217;t help waking up early, he says, and once he&#8217;s awake, he can&#8217;t get back to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t even try? Look at you, you&#8217;ve got huge bags under your eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;STOP HAVING A GO AT ME!&#8221;</p>
<p>(Slams upstairs. Sound of sobs.)</p>
<p>And so on and on. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s also hyper-aware of any distinction in the treatment that his little sister gets. She&#8217;s five so, as you can imagine, that happens a <em>lot</em>. It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if he didn&#8217;t have a mother who, pre-children, regarded getting up before 8:30am on a workday as an act of barbarism and getting up before noon at the weekends as something you after a really exceptionally long lie-in. Supermum isn&#8217;t just grumpy in the mornings &#8211; she&#8217;s the original Mamma Grizzly.</p>
<p>So mornings are all too often a perfect storm of bad temper. If we could only get him to sleep in even half an hour&#8230;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a screaming fit is ten times more likely to be followed by a teary apology and cuddle than a year ago and it&#8217;s even possible to send him up to his room to calm down (&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a punishment &#8211; you just need to take some quiet time then you can come down when you&#8217;re ready&#8221;). He&#8217;ll generally be up there for five minutes then will rejoin the rest of us in a reasonably civilized state of mind. </p>
<p>My own shouting is more under control. I think this relates to dudelet and I at least trying to discuss issues reasonably, even when he&#8217;s utterly furious with me over some inadvertent slight. At nine, he&#8217;s much more capable of &#8211; eventually &#8211; taking on board the other person&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<p>And last week he made us all tea. By himself. He even let me help with the kettle without an outburst of &#8220;I can do it myself&#8221; moodiness. I suspect the last is a key milestone &#8211; he&#8217;s starting to learn to accept help and risk failure (that&#8217;s another post, I suspect &#8211; dealing with children who are afraid of failing).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve kept up <a href="http://dadwhowrites.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/three-things-i-tell-dudelet-each-night/">Three Things</a> (three things he&#8217;s done that day that I&#8217;ve appreciated, regardless of how small or trivial  night after night &#8211; no matter how difficult it is to remember at times. It still seems to matter to him. And it certainly matters to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sitting down, tucking into my gorgeous little pasta dish prepared by Pfoodman, I hear the familiar ding as my phone receives a message.  As I open it, my stomach begins to knot.It kindly informed me the car I was agreed to borrow for my interview was “no longer available” and said supplier was “extremely sorry for inconveniences caused.” This really was the last thing I needed at 9 p.m. the night before an 8:45 a.m. scheduled meeting with St. Louis’s top Investigative Reporter.</p>
<p>This adventure began whilst searching for ‘interesting’ characters to conduct my interview with. Initially I looked into a couple of the local indie music rags, thinking these fellow hipsters would fit the cause perfectly. My inbox remained stubbornly empty however, and so it was time to move on.</p>
<p>The next avenue of approach targeted the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Scrolling down the list of employees I see several Copy Editors, General Reporters, and Columnists, your everyday run of the mill Journalists. Then I come across a different title. A title clearly a step ahead of those around it. Jeremy Kohler : Investigative Reporter.</p>
<p>Investigative Reporter; I started to have visions of an ironclad Columbo chewing on a cigar or perhaps a Woodward and Bernstein.</p>
<p>My email sent with little hope of reply, so imagine how astonished I was when contact was made. The correspondence was brief and to the point; Tuesday 25<sup>th</sup> September, 8:45 a.m., be there. As Monday evening quickly swung around, and I had finally calmed down after receiving the bad news, I had to weigh up my options. Did I call off the interview at such late notice and miss an opportunity at meeting this mysterious figure? Or did I put all my resources together in a last ditch effort to try and find some wheels?<br />
I decided the interview had to go ahead, and spent Monday evening ringing every imaginable contact in my phone list. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, a breakthrough; a friend had pulled through around the midnight mark with his Beamer, nice.</p>
<p>Now all was left was a little prep work; quickly went over some of the info interview questions from the earlier assignment and picked the ones that seemed appropriate. I decided to stick with a white shirt, black trousers and a semi-decent pair of black shoes. Some of his work was available online, so note was taken, and added to the armoury.</p>
<p>The alarm went off at 7 a.m., giving myself plenty of time to get in the zone. Apprehension had really started to kick in. I ironed out the final creases in my shirt and scribbled down the directions in the back of my notepad. 900 North Tucker Boulevard, exit 249 C, I shall never forget it.</p>
<p>Sliding into the Beamer, I gave myself one final check over in the rear-view mirror, pleasantly surprised to see a somewhat professional looking young lad stare back at me. A crucial piece of confidence added to what was becoming an increasingly unsteady mess behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Cruising down I-70, I kept trying to imagine what Jeremy Kohler looked like. Was he going to be this ruthless, straight to the point, no nonsense character who had little time for a mere college student? A student with almost zero experience in reporting, only minoring in journalism. My inexperience was really beginning to bother me now, climaxing as I pulled into the car park behind the Dispatch office.</p>
<p>Arriving almost an hour before our scheduled appointment, my stomach reminded me that I had yet to eat anything, guiding me to the petrol station across the road. There’s nothing like a sausage bap to calm the nerves. Carefully examining my watch, I counted down the minutes to the interview. My shirt was beginning to act more like a towel as it soaked in the perspiration which was now beginning to fountain out of my body. Heading towards the building, I realised I was penless. Surely this didn’t just happen. Where on earth was I going to find a pen at 8:30 in the morning? Remembering the petrol station had saved me form hunger before; I rushed over there on the hunt for a pen. To my delight a box of twenty Bics were on hand to save the day.</p>
<p>Armed with my pens, I entered the St Louis Post-Dispatch. I walked over to what appeared to be a security guard who suggested I wait in the seating area while she called Kohler down from his office. Sitting there waiting, I felt like a naughty school boy waiting for a lashing. Kohler was coming down to “get me.”                                                                                                                                                                   I heard the elevator ping, and peered round the corner. As the door opened, I nervously awaited the arrival of Goliath, angered at being forced away from his work upstairs. Fortunately, I couldn’t have been further from the truth.</p>
<p>Out stepped a friendly looking man, maybe 5-foot-9, casually buttoned into a chequered shirt with no sign of the apprehension that could be spotted a mile away on my face. He introduced himself and invited me upstairs to the offices, offering a quick guided tour.  Expecting the hustle and bustle from a scene from All the Presidents Men, I was shocked at what I saw. The room was enormous; housing enough desk/office space for what seemed an eternity of employees, yet, apart from a couple of people here and there, was completely empty. Glancing at my watch, it read 9 a.m., clear as day. Noticing the confusion on my face, Jeremy explained the large number of cuts that had been made in personnel due to the economic crisis. Great, not exactly what you want to hear as an enthusiast looking to enter the industry.</p>
<p>As we began the interview, Jeremy explained to me how he had become interested in writing at a young age, writing for his school newspaper and following this through to college in Connecticut, where he again wrote for the student newspaper. After graduating, he moved around several smaller papers before finally settling at the Dispatch, where he’s been working for the last 14 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_42" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://dalehart8.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kohler3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-42 " alt="Kohler3" src="http://dalehart8.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kohler3.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jeremy Kohler &#8211; Post-Dispatch investigative reporter</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">His career in St. Louis started working on the police beat. After picking up many contacts through the St. Louis Police Department, he was offered the position of investigative reporter. The colloquial nature of our conversation was relaxing. He seemed happy to answer my questions, which were now coming off the cuff. I noticed that I hadn’t even bothered to take my notes out of my bag, let alone open that box of Bics that had seemed so vital not 15 minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Jeremy proceeded to explain to me some of the more intriguing stories he had been fortunate to cover. One of which was his investigation into the police’s handling of rape cases in 2005. His work uncovered a concerning truth. Many rape reports were not being filed as an official incident report, but as casual ‘memos’. This series titles ‘What Rape?’ led him to an honourable mention for the Dart Award in 2006.</p>
<p>As the conversation progressed and began to feel more at ease, I asked about the prospects for students entering the industry, and what would be required of us. The answer was bleak. He explained how due to the crisis even the most experienced reporters/editors were finding it difficult to stake a claim at the table. The advice he gave was to stay diverse. With the decreasing personnel, more and more is being asked of those left at work. Reporters can now find themselves shooting their own pictures and editing stories. Also I was told to write tight. There is no substitution for accurate, precise writing.</p>
<p>After hearing this news, I felt there was really little point in handing over my resume, so I decided not to bother.</p>
<p>The interview was finalised with Jeremy’s concern at the decline of the industry. He noted that, after working on the police beat and investigations, how important reporters are. They act as a check against organisations that would otherwise run un-checked. Politicians and police officials would be able to run free, so to speak, with little worry of the public ever finding out the truth behind closed doors.</p>
<p>After thanking Jeremy for the umpteenth time, I left the building with a sense of satisfaction. It was amazing to compare my emotions before and after the interview. A transformation from a nervous breakdown to that of a sense of achievement. So chill out, relax, and enjoy the experience, stay positive and remember to have a vehicle secured preferably more than 12 hours in advance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I grew up as a very adventurous person. My dad was a big time climber in our area and took me on many trips across California to some of the most well known climbing areas. Starting at a very young age my climbing shoes could fit in the palm of an adults hand. I was raised with a passion for granite and other form of rock and an even deeper passion for experiencing that rock from as high up as I could get! One of my dreams from childhood was to climb the face of El Capitan <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/el-capitan-57.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885 alignleft" alt="El-Capitan-57" src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/el-capitan-57.jpg?w=400&#038;h=266" width="400" height="266" /></a>in Yosemite Valley, CA. I was a seasoned Yosemite go-er as my family picked that location as our favorite vacation spot, spanning upward of 4 weeks a year in the valley. Each time I was there the daunting task of climbing the face, more particularly the nose, drew me closer and closer. My dad had climbed it multiple times before but he insisted on reminding me that he didn&#8217;t have an interest in doing it again, if I wanted to climb it then it was up to me to find a solid climbing partner who would take me up the approximated 3000 ft cliff.</p>
<p>Being head strong and already a BASE jumper at the age of 17 I agreed to the adventure and started to prepare for another dream come true with my boyfriend at the time Chris McNamara, who was a renowned big wall climber and had set the record for number of times up the face as well as the youngest team ascend at the age of 16 with his 14 year old brother.</p>
<p>With the ultimate amount of trust I jumped at the idea with no hesitation but with little idea as to what to expect. I had been a climber for about 13 years but about 10 of them I was just goofing off with my siblings and climbing whatever I could find with no regard to taking it seriously as a sport. The decision that was mutually made by Chris and I took way, starting me out practicing some techniques to help me through the climb which I had never tried before. With only a week and a half to prepare I decided to let go of most of my nervousness surrounding the climb and just trust that I knew what I was doing and that Chris, although our relationship was weak at the time, had both of our best interest in mind.</p>
<p>We arrived in the valley earlier than expected and decided to start the climb. My pack was almost heavier than I was and making my way up the short hike to the base of the climb was brutal. I just hoped the rest of the climb would be a little more fun filled. We started climbing and only made it about 400ft up before we had to set up our porta-ledge where we would be spending the night. Although starting early meant we added one additional night to the climb we were more than happy to embrace that.</p>
<p>The entire climbing experience was incredibly peaceful and some times too <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/10-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-881" alt="El Cap first stop " src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/10-1.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a>peaceful. Being a 2 person climbing group the majority of the trip was spent separated. Feeling a bit like isolation at times it really forced me to either quiet the voices in my head or let them take over and convince me to be scared. In the lower parts of the climb I was really petrified, shockingly so, that the thought of falling was constantly playing through myt head. As an experienced climber I was really bothered that the height was getting to me. But as I climbed further from the valley floor the less concerned I became about the height and the more blissful the entire experience was becoming. I remember at one point the only thing holding me to the rock were 2 bolts and nothing below me but my feet smeared to the rock and sheer granite all the way to the ground probably around 2,500 feet below. I remember thinking in that moment that I wanted to be scared at how exposed I was but instead I had this peaceful calm that said, if you fell here you would die so who cares.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/29.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-882" alt="sunset elcap " src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/29.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a>We spent 2 nights sleeping in our portable ledge, in our harnesses and anchored to the cliff. Both nights were spectacularly beautiful. Sunsets from a cliff can not be described, only felt. Like a burning sphere of beauty and hope preparing to rest in preparation for the next day. Once we neared the top there was one section where letting go of the safety of the rock and hanging above 3,000 feet of nothing was the next step. As directed by Chris I pushed off the wall as hard as I could and I saw myself separate from the wall by what seemed to be 30ft and I was sitting there, in mid air, nothing to my right or my left and nothing below me for what looked like ever. It took everything in my body to just relax and not <a href="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-883" alt="20" src="http://thebasegirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a>tense up and hold my breath. It was terrifyingly awesome and I just sat there for a few minutes to admire the view, soak up the weird feeling of massive internal fulfillment but being surrounded by nothing. I made my way to the top and felt this massive form of respect for this life I had, for Chris helping me experience this and for my ability to just let go and fully experience it.</p>
<p>The hike down was less than exciting, it was incredibly painful having such a heavy pack and I heard my knees creek and grind with each downward step. On one small section rappelling down was one of the only ways and having a pack that weight almost as much as I did it took all of my core strength to not fall backwards and end up upside-down and as helpless as a turtle on its back. I remember the entire way down I couldn&#8217;t help but think, man it would be so much easier to just jump off now.</p>
<p>When we reached the bottom we were greeted by my mom whom had been watching us make the climb through binoculars at the bottom of the cliff along with one of her friends. We sat in the field directly below the cliff and I was just in awe that my dream had finally come true, and I was exhausted from the whole experience.</p>
<p>The entire adventure really helped me realize that each and every day there are a million small things that can stress me out or prevent me from staying true to my path and really going for it. But if I just let go of the control, trust myself and the people I surround myself with and focus 100% on enjoying the process but visualizing the end result, then not only will it all work out but it will exceed my expectations. It really opened my eyes to the possibilities of how we can have the choice, to decide what dictates our outcome. Our fears, limitations and the small stresses in life, or our drive, desire and zest for life. Making the conscious choice to rappel the negative and small things and soak up the positive and good in this life was one of the most critical choices I have ever made and has by far been the most impactful on all of my future experiences. I have encountered thousands of limiting factors in my life and hundreds of people who have tried to keep me from my dreams but understanding the simple fact that I have the power over my emotional response to them is what has helped aid me to get where I am today.</p>

<hr />
<h2><em>Guest post by Robin Wasserman</em></h2>
<p>I’ve never been the kind of person who believes in ghosts, and by the time I hit seventeen, I’d conquered or outgrown (or, in the case of the junior-high-school bully who mercifully dropped out after ninth grade, outlasted) most of the things that used to keep me awake at night: fear of fire, fear of kidnapping, fear of food fights (don’t ask)—I’d even managed to put the fear of loneliness at bay, after finally making a few for-real, for-life friends.</p>
<p>So most of what haunted my nightmares (and frequent schooltime naps) that year was the fear—okay, call it abject terror—that I wouldn’t get into the college I wanted, or wouldn’t get into any college at all, or would be a failure at life and end up living out my days in my parents&#8217; basement…you get the idea. A lot of time was spent studying for the SATs and pouring through “How to get into college” books and scribbling “Brown” and “Yale” in my notebooks the way other people scribbled the names of their beloved. There may have been little pink hearts involved, and a lot of creative visualization involving fat envelopes and mailboxes. None of it’s that interesting and I’ve already written more about it than anyone could ever want to read (including a whole vaguely autobiographical novel, <a href="http://www.robinwasserman.com/hackingharvard.html" target="_blank">if you find yourself that curious</a>). So I’m not going to write about that today.</p>
<p>I’m going to write about the other thing that haunted me, if by haunted you mean occupied my ever waking thoughts and tormented me with thoughts of what-might-have-been and terrors of what-could-become.</p>
<p>That thing is: My hair.</p>
<p>Anyone who talks to me for more than, say, twenty minutes, will notice that I’m extremely, some might say exceedingly, vain about my hair. Which is embarrassing. Not to mention weird, since I’m the kind of person who’s usually too lazy to wear makeup and has been known to occasionally forget she’s wearing pajamas when she leaves the apartment.</p>
<p>What you wouldn’t know, if you’ve only known me for twenty minutes (although give me the slightest opening and another couple hours and you’ll soon learn more than you ever wanted to know on the subject), is that my obsession with my hair has spanned thirty years and most of those were spent in such cringe-worthy, camera-breaking, Cousin-It-resembling hair hell that I don’t think you could blame me if I spent all my time now gazing in the mirror thanking the universe that I finally conquered my demons.</p>
<p>(You think I’m exaggerating. But wait, there will be pictures. )</p>
<p>I was blissfully unaware of the problem until age five, when, blithely wandering through an apartment building with my traditional summer bowl cut, I got the well-meaning compliment no girl wants to hear: “What an adorable little boy!”</p>
<p>So much for the bowl cut.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13783" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 1" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-1.jpg?w=265&#038;h=351" width="265" height="351" /></p>
<p>I spent the fourteen years after that growing out my hair into an indescribably hideous nest of curls, desperately trying to turn my hair into the kind of hair I saw on TV and, as far as I could tell, on the head of every single popular girl in the history of popular girls: long, silky, and (with a few impossibly un-frizzy exceptions) straight. I brought in magazine clippings for a long series of beleaguered hairdressers; I tried every anti-frizz product on the shelf. I poured over <i>Sassy</i> and <i>Seventeen</i> and <i>YM</i>, desperate for hair-straightening techniques, none of which worked. I sat for innumerable bad pictures and cringed every time I saw myself on the home video screen.</p>
<p>Then there was the hat phase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13784" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 2" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-2.jpg?w=223&#038;h=360" width="223" height="360" /></p>
<p>The less said about that, the better.</p>
<p>I got the obligatory junior high nickname (“afro girl”); I got jealous at every sleepover party while the other girls combed and crimped and French braided and I sat against a wall reading a book. I got knots. Lots of knots, and occasionally, I got them cut out.</p>
<div id="attachment_13785" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13785" alt="(This poor girl is about to face her first ever game of Spin the Bottle. Pray for her.)" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=576" width="300" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(This poor girl is about to face her first-ever game of Spin the Bottle. Pray for her.)</p></div>
<p>I got increasingly convinced that my hair was at the root of all my problems.</p>
<p>That if I could just make my hair better, make it <i>right</i>, everything else would follow. I’d get popular. I’d get a boyfriend. I’d get everything I wanted in life, everything that seemed to come so easily to everyone else.</p>
<p>I now think that everyone had something like this, some scapegoat for all their problems—<i>If only I were skinnier, If only I were taller, If only I had bigger boobs or a smaller nose or clearer skin or straighter teeth</i>—and we all conveniently ignore the fact that there are plenty of people with smaller boobs or bigger noses or more zits who are also making out with their boyfriends at every party in town. The only other girl in my school with hair precisely as crappy as mine had about a million friends and was a varsity athlete, but this is something I chose to ignore. Because I needed to believe there was <i>something</i> that would be an easy fix, even if—maybe especially if—it was something I couldn’t have. I needed to believe that all of the things I was miserable about made some logical sense.</p>
<p>If I was lonely and sad and bored and scared because I had terrible hair, then at least there was a <i>reason</i>. And at least there was a possibility that someday things would get better. That if I tried hard enough, I would eventually come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Which is maybe why, one spring day junior year, a couple days after I turned seventeen and ONE DAY before taking my official senior yearbook photo (the photo that would also end up in my college freshman facebook and thus follow me for BASICALLY THE REST OF MY LIFE), I made a drastic decision.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13786" alt="Robin Wasserman photo 4" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/robin-wasserman-photo-4.jpg?w=400&#038;h=239" width="400" height="239" /></p>
<p>Yes, some girls would get a pixie cut.</p>
<p>I got a poodle cut.</p>
<p>This may be the only wild and crazy thing I did over the entire course of my teenage years. (And okay, I’m aware that it doesn’t even register on the wild and crazy scale, but it seemed pretty nuts at the time.)</p>
<p>It was a bad idea, and seventeen turned out to be a <i>really</i> bad hair year, but it was also the turning point. As if cutting it all off had managed to reboot the system, my hair grew back…different. Instead of the knotted, frizzy, dried-out mess that had been seventeen years in the making, I had a clean slate, untangled and for the most part, unbattered by the elements. (The elements being my incompetence and that of the fine folks at the Haircuttery.) Year by year, haircut by haircut (always, <i>always</i> a tiny, undramatic trim), it got better. Which I’m pretty sure would never have happened if I hadn’t made the stupidest, most reckless decision of my entire hair life.</p>
<p>There’s probably a metaphor in there somewhere, but I’m not groping at some kind of existential life lesson here. I’m talking hair, pure and simple. It’s probably true that a good hair day won’t change your life.</p>
<p>But trust me, when you’ve been waiting as long as I waited, that first one you ever have feels like it will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of &#8216;love refugees&#8217; in Norway.</p>
<p>When I meet other expat couples, particularly <a href="http://edgeofthearctic.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/unexpected-adventures-of-a-trailing-spouse/">trailing spouses like myself,</a> we usually ask eachother how we ended up in Norway. It always comes down to one thing: our partners. They are either Norwegian (who are great at falling in love overseas) or our partners aren’t natives but followed their careers here, bringing their families in tow.</p>
<p>There is an immediate camaraderie among expats. In leaving our comfort zones to see the world, we’ve all done something very brave.</p>
<p>Moving to Norway was a big decision for my husband and I. The opportunity popped up out of nowhere and it took a lot of research before we could make an informed decision to move to a place that we hadn’t even considered as a vacation spot.</p>
<blockquote class="pull alignright"><p>Once you’ve landed overseas, the strength of your relationship is put to the test and you find that you have to rely on eachother in ways that other couples don’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Autumn of 2011 was a tumultuous time for us. With each step that brought us closer to a life in Norway – putting our London flat on the rental market or giving notice at work – we wondered if we were making the right choice. If one of us became overwhelmed about what was ahead, the other would toughen up for the leap of faith that was taking us to Oslo.</p>
<p>One could say that it was faith in Norway that brought us here. Before we moved, we had a five-day reconnaissance trip during which we had to learn everything we could about the local lifestyle before the decision was official. We realized that there was no way to know whether it was going to work out unless we gave it a try, so that’s what we did.</p>
<p>That leap of faith was one that my husband and I also took in eachother. Although we factored quality of life and cost of living into our decision to leave a comfortable home in Britain, a big part of that decision was whether we, as a couple, could make this expat adventure a success.</p>
<p>When you move abroad with your partner, both of you are stripped of your network of family and friends and the safety of familiar surroundings. Once you’ve landed overseas, the strength of your relationship is put to the test and you find that you have to rely on eachother in ways that other couples don’t. Since moving to Norway, my husband is all I’ve got. When I had sinusitis last fall, we couldn’t count on my mom to come by with a big pot of food to help us get through the week. And when my husband was working 80-hour weeks last spring, I couldn’t pass the time by dropping by my brothers’ place to hang out with my nephews and gossip with my sister-in-law. All of those people are 4,109 miles away.</p>
<p>So while I’m in Oslo, my husband fills all of those roles for me. He plays Super Mario Brothers with me when I miss my nephews, and I in turn indulge him by watching the Batman movies for the third time around because he can’t watch them with his brother.</p>
<p>But if we’re all of the sudden getting on eachother’s nerves (like all healthy couples should, every so often), there’s really no escape. If one of us tried to get some space, the other would be left in the lurch, so we don’t do this often.</p>
<p><a href="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/norway_640.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1149" alt="Norway flag heart" src="http://edgeofthearctic.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/norway_640.png?w=150&#038;h=112" width="150" height="112" /></a>It’s this precise aspect of expathood that people who are still in their comfort zones, surrounded by their usual support network, can’t understand. It’s the reason my husband and I don’t answer the phone when we’re watching a movie or exploring the rest of Europe, or when one of us is just having a bad day.</p>
<p>Only our fellow expats truly understand what it’s like to live in Norway, far from everything familiar (and warm). From this camaraderie a wonderful little community of has emerged. Newcomers seek the wisdom of those who came before them. Those of us who have lived here awhile are finally able to ‘pay it forward’ and help those that are fresh off the boat. And then there are expats who have been here for 10, 15 or even 20 years. These are our north stars.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://edgeofthearctic.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/a-love-letter-celebrating-my-first-year-in-oslo/">been in Oslo 16 months</a> and I feel that I’m at a turning point. Without realizing it I’ve become a part of a communit<span style="color:#000000;">y and have even been able to offer guidance to a few new arrivals. The most important advice isn&#8217;t anything I tell them, it&#8217;s simply that I&#8217;m still here and enjoying every day of it.</span></p>
