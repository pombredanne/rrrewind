<p>My flight from New York to Lyon included a nine-hour layover at Charles de Gaulle Airport. That gave me plenty of time to spend the afternoon in Paris. At the suggestion of a friend, I went to make photographs in and around Jardin du Luxembourg. Not only was the weather perfect, but it was May 1, a national holiday equivalent to our Labor Day. The park was packed with people (and their dogs).</p>

<p>Oh. My. Gosh. My eyes nearly popped out of my head when I tasted the first bite of my succulent homemade Peking Duck.</p>
<p>Having tasted the best Peking Duck in the world (in my opinion) at <a href="http://www.thebeijinger.com/directory/Peking-Duck-Private-Kitchen">Peking Duck, Private Kitchen</a> in Beijing, I was on the search for perfection. And it was exactly how I remembered and imagined it to be. Epic!</p>
<p>The wafer-thin skin was so light and crisp it was more like eating light layers of duck cracking. No fatty bits whatsoever. The meat itself was beautifully moist and tender and flavorful. I just wished we&#8217;d made more pancakes!</p>
<p>The challenge was set for me by a friend (E) who was coming over for dinner. We&#8217;d decided to have Peking duck while watching Masterchef and without giving it much consideration I committed to making it myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3934" title="Homemade Peking duck with pancakes - the skin is crisp and fat free. Perfection. " src="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-12.jpg?w=594&#038;h=594" alt="" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p>I googled some recipes (<a href="http://chinesefood.about.com/od/poultryrecpz/r/pekingduck.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/duck-recipes/crispy-peking-duck-in-pancakes">here</a>, <a href="http://www.luvaduck.com.au/recipe/Whole+Duck/323/Peking-Duck">here</a> and <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/6457/peking+duck">here</a>) and was astounded to find that the process takes upto 10 hours, in some cases. I knew I needed to come up with shortcuts without compromising on the quality of the finished dish, so in my true food adventurer style I did.</p>
<p>To be honest, the hardest part was finding a fresh duck. I scoured most of Chinatown with no luck and then I remembered I had seen some <a href="http://www.luvaduck.com.au/">Luv-a-Duck</a> ducklings at Coles (Broadway). Bingo! I got myself a duck and went home cooking. The company also makes pre-cooked Peking Duck packs which I bought just in case and will be kitchen-testing against my perfection&#8230; more about that soon.</p>
<p>I made the mandarin pancakes as well, (E) helped roll them out too and as a result we ended up with a few weirdly shaped ones. Practice makes perfect (E) *grin*</p>
<p>If there is one thing I&#8217;d improve on in the future, and yes, I&#8217;ll be making this again, is the hoi sin sauce. We used a store-bought one and it tasted slightly odd. It was ok with the pancake, but could have been much better home made.</p>
<p>Serves 2-4, makes 12 pancakes</p>
<p><strong>Homemade Peking Duck incl mandarin pancakes</strong></p>
<p>The recipe is easy and prep is quick if you follow these five steps: clean, marinade, hang, refrigerate, roast. Having said that there is a few hours of &#8220;wait time&#8221; involved so its best to try this on the weekend. You won&#8217;t need meathooks or fans or bicycle pumps (!), called for in other recipes, just some kitchen string and a roasting tin with a rack.</p>
<p>Note: 3 of the ingredients repeat in the recipe, so just be aware that you will need 1 whole lemon, 10cm knob of ginger and 3 tablespoons of five spice in total &#8211; divisions are listed below.</p>
<p><a href="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3935" title="Homemade Peking duck with pancakes" src="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-10.jpg?w=594&#038;h=594" alt="" width="594" height="594" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Duck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 fresh duck (I used Luv-a-duck and mine was 1.88kg)</li>
<li>1 tbsp five spice</li>
<li>2 star anise</li>
<li>1/2 lemon</li>
<li>5cm knob of ginger</li>
<li>Sea salt flakes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marinade</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>750ml water</li>
<li>125ml Shao Xing cooking wine</li>
<li>4tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>2tbsp five spice</li>
<li>5cm knob of ginger, sliced</li>
<li>1/2 lemon, sliced</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pancakes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup plain flour plus extra</li>
<li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
<li>sesame oil</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To serve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hoi sin sauce</li>
<li>1 cucumber, deseeded and cut into thin 5cm long strips</li>
<li>3 sprigs spring onion, cut into 5cm long pieces and sliced finely longways</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marinade:</strong> combine water, cooking wine, sliced lemon and ginger, five spice powder and brown sugar in a pot or wok large enough to fit the duck lying down. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for about 15 minutes to infuse the flavours. In the meantime, prepare the duck.</p>
<p><strong>Duck:</strong> wash the duck under cold running water and pat dry all over with paper towel. Cut out any excess fat around its bottom cavity. To separate the skin &#8211; this will make it beautifully crisp and fatless, gently lift the skin with one hand and poke and slide your other hand in-between the breast meat and skin until you reach the neck, ensuring you don&#8217;t tear the skin through but it has detached from the flesh.</p>
<p><a href="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3936" title="Homemade Peking duck with pancakes" src="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes.jpg?w=594&#038;h=295" alt="" width="594" height="295" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Marinating:</strong> turn off the heat under the marinade. Place the the duck into the liquid for 3 minutes and spoon it over any parts that are not submerged. Turn the duck over and repeat the process for a further 3 minutes. Reserve the marinade for roasting.</p>
<p><strong>Drying:</strong> the other important step to getting a perfectly crispy skin is making sure it&#8217;s dried out before roasting. Pat dry the marinated duck with paper towels. Tie a long piece of string around the bottom of the duck&#8217;s neck and hang it up over a roasting tray in a well ventilated place to drip dry for about 1 hour. I did this over the stove attaching the string to a cupboard door. Pat dry with paper towel again. Transfer duck to a roasting rack positioned over a roasting tin and place <span style="text-decoration:underline;">uncovered</span> in the fridge for at least 3 hours. This will help dry the skin further.</p>
<p><a href="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3937" title="Homemade Peking duck with pancakes" src="http://wholesomecook.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/homemade-peking-duck-with-pancakes-3.jpg?w=594&#038;h=337" alt="" width="594" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Roasting:</strong> preheat oven to 170C fan forced (190C, 375F, gas mark 5). Place ginger, lemon and star anise inside the belly cavity, cover with excess skin and cross the legs, securing them up with kitchen string. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of five spice onto the duck and rub it into the skin. Place duck on a roasting rack inside a roasting tin. Add 2 cups of the marinade to the bottom of the tin to stop the fat from splattering.</p>
<p>Cook on the lower middle rack for 1.5 hours at 170C fan forced (190C, 375F, gas mark 5). I turned the tray around halfway through roasting for an even &#8220;tan&#8221;. Then turn the heat up to 190C and roast for a further 10 minutes to crisp up the skin. In the meantime make the pancakes.</p>
<p>Note: roasting times are 1 hour per 1 kilo of duck.</p>
<p><strong>Pancakes:</strong> using a spoon mix flour with boiling water in a bowl until it starts to form a dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and work for a couple of minutes until there are no lumps. Cover with a plastic freezer bag and refrigerate for 5 minutes. When ready, knead the dough for a couple more minutes and form a log. Cut into 12 even pieces. Flatten each dough ball with your hands, dust with flour and roll out to about 2mm thin between 2 sheets of grease-proof paper. Peel the paper away, grease one side of the pancake with some sesame oil and set aside. Continue with the rest of the dough, stacking the pancakes on top of one another for frying.</p>
<p>To fry, heat a small frypan on mendium heat and cook each pancake for about 20 seconds on each side or until they start to rise gently and get golden spots. You don&#8217;t want the spots to go to dark though.</p>
<p><strong>Serving:</strong> cut the duck in half down the middle. Gently lift off the skin, place on a clean roasting tray, sprinkle with sea salt and grill for a couple of minutes to keep it from going soggy from the steam of the meat. Slice duck breast and leg meat and arrange on a warmed platter alongside finely sliced cucumber sticks, shallots, pancakes, crispy skin and hoi sin sauce.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11357" title="Picture 1" src="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-1.png?w=400&#038;h=514" alt="" width="400" height="514" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarah Kramer</strong> is a vegan queen. She&#8217;s been a part of the vegan world longer than many of you have even heard of the term &#8220;vegan&#8221; and her enthusiasm for vegan living has expanded to four successful meat-free cookbooks, a vegan wall calendar and a popular website for all your vegan and vintage dreams, <a href="http://www.govegan.net">GoVegan.net</a>. Did I mention she authored the first vegan book I ever owned {La Dolce Vegan}? She&#8217;s also our fourth <a title="Inspirational Women Interviews 2011 {Meghan Telpner}" href="http://cookbakenibble.com/2011/05/04/inspirational-women-interviews-2011-meghan-telpner/">Inspirational Woman</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-11351"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11361" title="Picture 5" src="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-5.png?w=283&#038;h=300" alt="" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Sarah never fails to bring the fun, kitschy and spunky to vegan living, from her comic-book covers, her large collection of thrifted toys, or her colorful tattoos. This was probably the immediate reason I was first drawn to her books. Not to mention the fact that her recipes are amazing! Completely self-employed, on top of her cookbooks and website, she runs a photography company [<a href="http://sarahkramerphotography.com">Sarah Kramer Photography</a>] and a tattoo business [<a href="www.tattoozoo.net">Tattoo Zoo</a>] with her husband in her home city,  Victoria, B.C. No wonder her last book was titled <a href="http://store.govegan.net/products/Vegan-A-Go%252dGo-cookbook-%252d-autographed.html">Vegan a go-go</a>! Sarah continues, through everything she does, to make the world of living cruelty-free easy, fun and exciting. If that&#8217;s not inspirational, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p><a href="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11360" title="Picture 4" src="http://kristinsnibbles.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/picture-4.png?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Kristin&#8217;s note: </em></strong><em>To further prove how cool Sarah Kramer really is, I&#8217;m publishing her interview exactly how she sent it to me- multi-colored! </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>1. In the past ten years you have owned and operated a popular website, a tattoo business, and not one, but four vegan cookbooks you have written or co-authored. How do you do it all?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I don’t know. *laugh*</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">#1. I don’t have kids so that gives me a lot more free time then the average bear.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">#2. I am so passionate about my work that it’s not like work. I love what I do. I love being creative. My interests vary far and wide and I don’t ever want to be stuck doing one thing for the rest of my life so I try to broaden my horizons by sticking my fingers in as many pies as possible!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Life is for living!! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>2. When, and why, did you become vegan? How did this change affect your life for the better?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I wrote about my vegan journey in the opening essay of How It All Vegan but in a nutshelI was born and raised vegetarian (with the exception of a brief experimental meat eating phase in high-school) and went vegan in my early 20’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>3. What made you decide to get into writing vegan cookbooks? Did you ever think one would turn into four?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">NO! *laugh*</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Tanya and I were really broke punk-rock kids who were looking for a cheap alternative to buying our friends family x-mas presents so Tanya came up with the idea of doing a vegan cookbook zine (this was during the height of 90‘s zine culture) and we cut and pasted together a little 50 page home-made zine that we printed and bound ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">We gave them away to friends and family and the response was overwhelming. They wanted copies to give their friends, so we printed a couple hundred more and those sold out right away. So we did another run of 900 (not sure why I remember that number <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  and started selling them at punk-rock shows and via the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">The internet was a brand new baby at that time and I utilized the web to build a web-presence with www.GoVegan.net</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">The book took-off and we knew we were on to something &#8211; so I wrote a cheeky book proposal. Sent it off to 6 different Canadian publishers and THREE days later we had a book deal with Arsenal Pulp Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">HIAV has sold over 1/4 of a million copies and is still going strong. It started out as a little snowflake of an idea and has turned into a giant snowball. It’s amazing! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>4. How does Sarah Kramer spend her days? How about your off-days?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Days off? What’s that? *laugh*</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">When you’re self employed your hours are loosey-goosey. It’s great because I can adjust my day according to what I need to do. But on the negative side &#8211; I end up working 24-7.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Lately I’ve been setting boundaries for myself and have been trying not to do any work after 6pm. All work and no play makes for a very exhausted Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>5. How is your lifestyle different now than it used to be?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I was a very lazy vegetarian and when I became vegan was also very lazy. What I mean by that is I ate to fill the hunger. Not to fuel my body. So I wasn’t very conscientious about the quality of my food.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I became quite ill with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in my 20’s and at one point was bed-ridden. It was a terrifying time of my life &#8211; to lose control of your health and to have a chronic illness with no end in sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">It was during my CFS years that I started to look at my lifestyle. How I was taking care of myself (or not taking care of myself) and had an epiphany. I am the Captain of my ship. The direction I go depends on me. I made big changes in the kind of food I was eating and that made big changes in my health.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>6. How do you stay positive in an increasingly unhealthy world? Does the large amount of new health research that comes up seemingly everyday have an affect on you, or do you like to form your own opinions?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I focus on the things I can change in my life that help move me forward towards being a compassionate well informed human being. Every day I strive to be a better vegan and to be the best version of myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">But there is no such thing as perfect &#8211; that’s a losing battle so I strive for excellence instead. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I have had to start limiting how much A.Rights stuff I read/view. I can’t watch movies anymore of animals being tortured. I know what’s happening. I’m informed. I’m supporting my community to help stop the exploitation of animals but I’ve seen enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">My little sensitive heart can’t take the images. It effects me deeply and at a certain point was dragging me down. It doesn’t mean I’m not involved but I’ve seen enough to know what’s right and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>7. What made you start up your website, GoVegan.net? Any advice for other aspiring vegan bloggers or business owners?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I started www.GoVegan.net right when the internet was a brand-new baby. I wanted it to be a place for like-minded people to visit and get more information about the cookbooks and the work I was doing. Over the years it’s had many incarnations and is now where I keep a blog of my daily exploits and I’ve also turned it into a store where you can buy some of my favourite products.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I carry a myriad of items from kitchy thrift-store finds to my favorite vegan products and some of my favourite fashions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>8. How does it feel to be considered an inspirational woman? Who, or what inspires you?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Well &#8230; thank you. That’s very kind of you to say. I don’t wake up and think “What am I going to do to be an inspirational woman today” *laugh* I just do my thing and people dig it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">As for what inspires me? My dog. He helps me be in the NOW and not the “what am I going to do later”. It’s something I struggle with &#8230; thinking about all the things that I want to do rather then focusing on what I have right here in this moment. Fergus always grounds me. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>9. How has the world of vegan living changed since you&#8217;ve been in it? Is it encouraging to see how much more mainstream it has become? Do you think it will continue to become more mainstream, and what are your hopes for the vegan community in the future?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Well 10+ years ago you could say to a waiter that you’re vegan and they would look at you like you were a crazy person. Now there are vegan dishes on menus, waiters know what a vegan is, your Great Auntie Dotty probably knows what a vegan is thanks to Oprah and Ellen talking about it on their shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">My only concern with veganism becoming part of popular culture is that we are raising a generation of junk-food vegans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I wrote HIAV and my other cookbooks with the focus that ANYONE can cook healthy delicious food for themselves. Cooking is not rocket-science. I want everyone to feel confidant that they can feed their family healthy vegan food without having to buy something out of a box.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">It’s really fun that you can get vegan corn-dogs and vegan ice-cream and vegan whatever out of a box &#8230; but there’s no fuel power in that food. It’s junk food and should be consumed on a limited basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Food is the fuel that keeps our bodies alive and if you’re filling your body with junk &#8211; you are going to feel like junk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">You are what you eat! Ya dig? <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>10. Do you have any future plans for cookbooks or the blog you want to share with my readers?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">No cookbooks on the horizon. I know this bums some of my readers out but I am really enjoying not being in the kitchen working on recipes. I took a year off last year to work at Tattoo Zoo (the shop I own with my husband Gerry) and realized how much I miss working with people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">My goal with Sarah’s Place (www.GoVegan.net) is to turn it into a bricks and mortar store in downtown Victoria. That way I can still do my thing &#8230; but people have a place to come and visit me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>11. What is your favorite thing to eat? To cook?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">I love a good apple. There is nothing better then that! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">My favourite thing to cook is vegan food for my non-vegan friends. My goal is to change the world &#8211; one tummy at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>12. And, the million dollar question: What&#8217;s in your fridge?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Right now? It’s actually quite empty. I am on my way to get groceries right now!!</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My New Garden Project for 2011 is almost complete!  I&#8217;m working on improving my food security, and to that end I decided a few chickens would be just the ticket, providing my family with fresh eggs and manure for my garden.  The chicks have just been relocated to their new home, having outgrown the Rubbermaid tote they were living in until now.</p>
<div id="attachment_607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chicks-day-1-016.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-607" title="chicks day 1 016" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chicks-day-1-016.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chicks in a tote</p></div>
<p>Because I was determined to build my chicken coop using as much recycled material as possible, and my husband was adamant that it not be an eyesore, much of the construction work fell to him.  Good thing he’s handy!</p>
<div id="attachment_608" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/025.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-608" title="025" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/025.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bunk bed with a view</p></div>
<p>The frame of our coop used to be my son’s bunk bed, which was itself a homemade piece that we bought secondhand many years ago.  Does that mean it’s re-recycled?  The lovely window we found at our local re-store, it looks like it came from someone’s kitchen remodel.</p>
<div id="attachment_609" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/006.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-609" title="006" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/006.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking like a henhouse</p></div>
<p>It took eleven people &#8211; thanks neighbours and friends &#8211; to carry the henhouse out of the garage to its home against the back fence.</p>
<div id="attachment_610" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/029.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-610" title="029" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/029.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thanks for the lift, everybody!</p></div>
<p>We have wired the run with ½” poultry wire, dug well into the soil to deter predators, because we have rats, raccoons, and mink who all love to eat eggs and/or chickens!  Hopefully they’ll be safe locked in the coop at night…</p>
<div id="attachment_611" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/013.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-611" title="013" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/013.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My lovely little henhouse, complete with window box!</p></div>
<p>I found an excellent source of information at <a href="http://www.backyardchickens.com/">Backyard Chickens</a>.  Even though we kept a largish flock when I was a kid, I wanted to refresh my knowledge and learn about poultry keeping on a smaller scale.  This site contains everything you need to know and more!</p>
<div id="attachment_618" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chicks-day-1-0061.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-618" title="chicks day 1 006" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chicks-day-1-0061.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">They&#039;re pretty cute when they&#039;re little...</p></div>
<p>I bought day-old chicks from a local producer.  They are hybrid, sex-linked pullets.  That way I know that I have all girls, as I promised the neighbours no roosters!  I have 3 Cinnamon Queens and 3 Red Rocks.  Despite warning my daughter that they were not to be considered pets, I have named them; Petal, Violet and Willow are the Red Rocks (which are largely black), and Fern, Sage and Rosemary are the Cinnamon Queens (the brown chicks).  They are a comical bunch, still working out the pecking order of the flock.  I think Fern will be the dominant hen, she was the biggest chick, and seems to be the bossiest!</p>
<div id="attachment_619" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/127.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-619" title="127" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/127.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fern (aka Miss Bossy Pants) was the first to master the chicken ladder.</p></div>
<p>The chicken coop is tucked against the back fence, behind my wisteria arbour, and far from being an eyesore; I think it’s very cute.  I purposely didn’t keep track of how much I spent on it, despite using a lot of secondhand materials; I still had to buy some wood, the window, hardware, wire, paint and cement blocks.</p>
<div id="attachment_620" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/082.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-620" title="082" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/082.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The girls love their new home.</p></div>
<p>I can’t wait for fresh eggs!  These hybrid chickens are reputed to be excellent producers of big brown eggs, and should start producing them when they are about 20 weeks old.  Then I will be able to provide complete meals from my yard, including veggies, eggs and fruit.  Now that’s food security!</p>
<div id="attachment_621" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/130.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-621" title="130" src="http://hortophile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/130.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And their new yard!</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was asked a rather thought provoking question on Facebook today in the middle of a discussion of how once you are in recovery, the issues seem to multiply, not go away.  And let&#8217;s be honest, who out there <em>didn&#8217;t</em> think life would automatically be better once we kicked the eating disorder to the curb?  I know that&#8217;s what <em>I</em> expected.  The eating disorder was making my life hell, so <em>obviously</em> the only way to go was up, right? (sarcasm fully present)  And life <em>did</em> get better without the eating disorder, but it wasn&#8217;t great, and I for one was surprised at all the issues that suddenly reared their ugly heads.</p>
<p>So someone asked me how I did it.  How I became aware of the issues and faced them without falling back into the eating disorder behaviors.</p>
<p>First off, let me just say that I wasn&#8217;t immune to the temptation of relapse, and it wasn&#8217;t a smooth ride.  I had my moments of relying on the old behaviors; I was not perfect.  No one is.  And that&#8217;s okay.  Don&#8217;t beat yourself up for an off day; acknowledge it for what it was and know that tomorrow you have a chance to make it a different kind of day.</p>
<p>Secondly, remember that this is how<strong> <em>I </em></strong>did it.  This is not the one and only way to work through recovery, but this is what worked for <em><strong>me</strong></em>. Do not feel that this is how you <em><strong>have</strong></em> to go about things.  This is just one option, one path among many.</p>
<p>So.  How did I do it?   Because there were a couple of times when I left treatment on kind of solid ground only to be slammed by these issues that seemingly came out of nowhere and then I relapsed and went through the whole cycle again.  And again.  The important thing to note about those times in treatment is that I was never fully committed to recovery.  I wanted the hell to end, but I wasn&#8217;t yet ready to let go of the eating disorder because I couldn&#8217;t imagine life without it.  The very first thing that happened when I began recovery was I had to realize that I wasn&#8217;t living.  I was existing.  No more, no less.  I was in graduate school and everyone else around me was living full, fulfilling lives.  I was showing up to class and trying to stay awake and trying to convince people I was fine.  The day I realized the extent of my lack of life, I confided in a teacher and because I was afraid to do it on my own, called a treatment center from her office.  I hung up the phone and was shaking and she told me that choosing life was the most terrifying thing you could do.  And I started crying for the first time in months.  Then I packed my bags and went to treatment.  Except this time, I was determined to make it work.  I still went through all the normal struggles and I did my fair share of resisting, but the underlying motivation was different.</p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that I discovered a reason for living free of the eating disorder.  That happened when my nephew came to visit me on Christmas day, all 18 months of his little cuteness.  And I realized I didn&#8217;t want him to grow up visiting me in hospitals, and I hoped&#8211;and still hope&#8211;that he doesn&#8217;t remember that day.  And I didn&#8217;t want him to grow up thinking of me as &#8220;the sick aunt.&#8221;  So in the beginning, I ate for him.  I stopped exercising for him.  I stopped using pills for him.  Eventually, I was able to do these things for me.</p>
<p>The issues that reared their ugly heads?  Yeah, they came up.  But my therapist and I put them on the back burner while I concentrated on controlling my behaviors and getting through normal day-to-day stressors (and there are a lot of them in graduate school!) without relying on any eating disorder behaviors.  I practiced using healthy coping skills.  Once I had confidence in my ability to handle normal stress in a healthy way, using these healthy coping skills, my therapist and I began looking at the underlying issues, the ones I had kept buried through the eating disorder.  We started with the smaller issues first, working our way up to the deeper, more painful ones.  If things started getting too overwhelming and I was having a difficult time not relying on eating disorder behaviors, we backed off and focused on strengthening my healthy coping skills.</p>
<p>Right now, I am working with a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy therapist, and one of the main goals of DBT is to &#8220;create a life worth living.&#8221;  For me, that has been crucial in maintaining my recovery.  It&#8217;s been a slow process, and there has been some give and take at certain points, and I&#8217;m not finished.  My life has changed a lot due to medical reasons in the previous two years, and that has meant rearranging the things that make my life worth living.  At one point, I kept a list in my journal to help remind me of why I was fighting to stay in recovery on the days when things were particularly difficult.  I&#8217;ve had to reevaluate things recently due to some medical news, and that list has made another appearance.  I&#8217;m learning that this is life.  Sometimes&#8211;a lot of the time&#8211;we can&#8217;t control what gets thrown our way.  We adjust the best we can.  And sometimes the road will be bumpy.</p>
<p>So I guess my overall advice, based on what worked for me, is to first get to a point where you are physically strong enough to handle intense emotions and stress and then to make sure that you have a good amount of healthy coping skills that you can rely on.  The best time to practice these skills is when you <em>aren&#8217;t</em> overwhelmed, and then they will eventually become second nature and a natural resource during times of stress.</p>
<p>Above all, I recommend working with your treatment team and being honest with them.  Part of recovery involves trusting other people and learning to let other people help you.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">He walked through my bedroom door,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">my once little boy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">But as I watched him just brush his hair,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">in my bathroom mirror,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> it hit me,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">my youngest child</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is no longer a baby.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And my heart sunk,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I realized, that part of my life, so far, is past.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-738" title="images-1" src="http://itsawonderfilledlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/images-15.jpg?w=160&#038;h=160" alt="" width="160" height="160" />There is a sense of longing that comes as I realize that I am no longer a mom to &#8216;babies&#8217; or even &#8216;children&#8217;. Oh, I am still a mom to minors, but my minors have all reached the edge of the abyss known as adolescence. And this edge is where I say farewell to a part of my life, that has been all-consumingly present for over eighteen years. My adolescent kids have all reached the stage of not needing me.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-739" title="images-4" src="http://itsawonderfilledlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/images-42.jpg?w=273&#038;h=185" alt="" width="273" height="185" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are times <em>(many)</em> over the past eighteen years, when I would have given anything for them to need me less. I can so easily remember those &#8216;touched out&#8217; days, those sleepless nights <em>(they do still happen, but just when they get ready for bed, and they slam the bathroom door)</em>, those stomach virus weeks, when &#8216;the bucket&#8217; would be transported from one sick kid to the next, and then around again, and again, and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I do love the parent-pre-teen/teen relationships. Truly that is what I was looking for when hubby and I decided that we wanted to have children. I feel so bad for our kids &#8230; as neither hubby or I are &#8216;baby people&#8217;. One would thinkg that our kids would have had one &#8216;nurturer&#8217;-parent. Honestly, when I see someone holding a newborn I just feel sorry for them <em>(did I just say that out loud?)</em>, I mean, I am happy for them, but I know they are in the midst of a stressful time of life &#8230; and man, I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s not me! To me, going through all of the stresses of babies and toddlers is worth it, if I get to, finally, live in a house with pre-teens and teens <em>(and really, they are just like toddlers &#8230; they are just too heavy to pick up, place in their bed, and shut the door &#8230; same &#8216;hissy fits&#8217;, same growth spurts, same level of curiosity, and a beautiful sense of wonder &#8230; you just need to look harder for it)</em>. But, I digress &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-740" title="images-2" src="http://itsawonderfilledlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/images-24.jpg?w=230&#038;h=219" alt="" width="230" height="219" />Our youngest is almost twelve, and, although in private he will still hug me, and give and receive &#8216;I love you&#8217;s', he is &#8216;moving on&#8217; through the doorway to his teens, to be followed by adulthood. And, I have to say, it makes me feel a little sad, a little lonely, a lot &#8230; unneeded <em>(and I need to feel needed)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For in this regard, his moving through that doorway signals the end of that, very defining, very demanding, very all-consuming part of MY life <em>(and really, it is all about me)</em>. And I think I am needing to get my head wrapped around it!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The process of this &#8216;end&#8217;, of course began when mothering began &#8230; but it seemed so very  f a r  away. Then last summer, about half of our dinners together consisted of only hubby, the boy and me <em>(as our daughters both have &#8216;gotten a life&#8217;)</em>. This was shocking to me! And, much of the time, one or two, or three of the kids were gone away overnight! My goodness &#8230; my nest is beginning to empty!<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-746" title="images" src="http://itsawonderfilledlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/images7.jpg?w=115&#038;h=96" alt="" width="115" height="96" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But, there is a flip side to all of this. This past year our family &#8216;adopted&#8217; a local university student, who we fed, watched hockey games with and fed again <em>(it is so gratifying to feed a &#8216;starving&#8217; university student &#8230; they eat anything! And talk like you can cook like Jamie Oliver)</em>. And then we rented our suite to a delightful young lady, who we encouraged to join us for many mealtimes, for rides to church, for laughter and chats. And, last summer, our pool was frequently filled with the laughter of not just our kids, but many of our neighbors and friends. And dinners, well &#8230; truly it is feast or famine for numbers sitting at the table. Sometimes three, sometimes thirteen.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, the dynamics of our life are changing. And, so I too need to learn to change &#8230; my expectations <em>(and, frequently, my meal plans &#8230; at the last minute)</em>. I now have the privilege of &#8216;mothering&#8217; others &#8230; who need a hug, a home-cooked meal &#8230; a house with a pool, on a hot day. It&#8217;s a new kind of being needed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And, one day, that too will cause change, and adjustment, and introspection. And, if I am ever going to be wise, I will lean to accept the change, and seek within it a new kind of being needed &#8230; a new kind of wonder.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Cause babies don&#8217;t keep, we&#8217;ve learned to our sorrow.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most sex I&#8217;ve had this year&#8221;. Apparently, making mildly comedic smalltalk isn&#8217;t the done thing when a stranger has your testicle clamped in a vice-like grip. It seemed to make him nervous. By &#8216;him&#8217; I mean my cancer surgeon. Yup. I got cancer, yo. Strange to use the word really. Not only because as a 32 year old, non-smoking, teetotal Decathlete, it&#8217;s not the done thing, but because having met 4 ultrasound administrators, 3 surgeons and a lovely pair of urologists, not a single person has actually managed to say it out loud. You&#8217;d think they night have had some practice. Cancer. The big C. Whatevs.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I found a lump. I say a lump, it was more the fact my left bollock had caught medusa&#8217;s eye and was now forever frozen solid, like Jack Charlton&#8217;s scalp. I&#8217;d been having problems with a sportsman&#8217;s hernia, that had come about whilst at training camp in South Africa. One of the less delicate parts of this diagnosis is a clinical examination whereby I<br />
undergo the &#8220;invagination of the scrotum/palpation of inguinal ring&#8221;. This basically means having someone turn your &#8216;plum purse&#8217;  inside out with their little finger before plunging it deep up into your lower stomach. My defence mechanism was to hum the theme tune to Thundercats. I like to think I am a medical first.</p>
<p>So having had this examination, I was at home in the shower and decided I might give the lads a quick once over. It had been a while and i thought they might be a little put out if, after all the attention they&#8217;d received from a stranger that day, I didn&#8217;t offer some affection myself. I knew things weren&#8217;t right immediately. The consistency was different. In fact it was rock hard. I&#8217;d love to say I didn&#8217;t panic but in all honesty I think I knew then that this was bad and had to hold onto wall not to pass out. I managed to put it to the back of my mind and promised to follow this up with my Sports Dr when I returned for the hernia surgery decision.</p>
<p>The rest of this process has been pretty quick. I went back to my GP, was referred to ultrasound and finally had some panicked faces try their damnedest to sound calm whilst taking my mobile number to arrange an emergency appointment at the A&amp;E urology department that day. My mobile number! I felt so important. I tell you one thing, you&#8217;re never so aware of just how many brilliant female doctors and specialists there are as when you need to get your tackle out every single day and you&#8217;re wearing the worst pants you own.</p>
<p>The last two days have been a whirlwind of ultrasound, CT scans, blood tests and consultations. I am now due for surgery tomorrow. I&#8217;m also incredibly lucky that they are combining the two issues and I&#8217;m having both procedures (cancer and hernia) dealt with together. I was met by a look of terrified bewilderment when I joked that it would be like two WWE wrestlers tag-teaming an unconscious man.</p>
<p>This has actually been an unusual aspect of my discussions with the surgeons. It seems my joviality is not a common trait amongst those who&#8217;ve just found out they&#8217;ve got a life-threatening illness. I can&#8217;t be sure why I have felt the way I have. The only time I&#8217;ve been really scared was the time I found it. Since then, its been on my mind of course, but bizarrely the moment I found out I&#8217;d got cancer (or &#8221;confirmation of the most sinister diagnosis&#8221; as it was broken to me), I was actually quite elated. Perhaps I was glad to know what I was dealing with. Perhaps I&#8217;m more than a little odd but its certainly been the case for the past few days and it still is right now as I type this. When I mentioned I might write this blog, a friend suggested waiting a week in case my mood changed. It hasn&#8217;t. In fact, I&#8217;ve been on a complete high ever since. (He missed the point of course, in that if things did &#8211; and do- get worse, then that should also be chronicled). Regarding my mood though, there&#8217;s a suggestion that I&#8217;m more relieved that I won&#8217;t miss my whole athletics season through two separate surgeries, but i guess we&#8217;ll know more when I come out of hospital on Friday and I know whether I&#8217;ll require chemotherapy but that&#8217;s for another blog.</p>
<p>One of the more amusing, although faintly worrying, aspects I&#8217;ve had to consider is that of &#8216;sperm-storage&#8217;. Apparently, there shouldn&#8217;t be an issue but if there were I&#8217;ve been advised that this is a good idea and so ill need to get onto this today. A female friend though was so distraught at the idea that I might be left having to &#8216;harvest my seed&#8217; to a wrinkled old back issue of Mayfair that she offered to &#8217;help&#8217; the process. The look of utter delight on my face showed that I hadn&#8217;t noticed that she was in absolutely no way being serious.</p>
<p>So here we are. I&#8217;m one day away from owning a fake nut, or a&#8217;testicular prosthesis&#8217; as it&#8217;s known to those who didn&#8217;t see the glorious opportunity to call it a &#8216;Clegg&#8217;. I go in tomorrow, surgery is at 5, I should be high on morphine til the evening and back out by Friday lunch. The point of writing something so wincingly self-interested is not, for once, for attention, (or at least not the personal type), but in order to try and de-stigmatise the condition and hopefully help raise some level of awareness that might encourage just one person to become more vigilant. That would be good. I once tweeted the following during one of those spasmodic episodes of tongue-chewing, brain-gurning status stupidity on Twitter&#8217;s poor relation: &#8220;Nothing helps cure Cancer like reposting a Facebook status&#8221;. This hasn&#8217;t changed at all. Idiots.</p>
<p>I think everything will be fine but if it isn&#8217;t, my heart-shaped slippers were a present, those magazines are being stored for a friend and my Internet history is a cretinous liar.</p>
<p>Cancer. Lol. Brb!</p>

It&#8217;s a famous hot spring destination about 1.5 hours from Tokyo by train. This photo of Mt. Fuji was taken from a ropeway in Ohwakudani.</p>
<p>To be honest I never really &#8220;got&#8221; why people say Mt. Fuji is such a big deal. I&#8217;ve seen it from outside a Shinkansen bullet train window but all I thought was something like &#8220;well, that&#8217;s one big mountain for sure&#8221;. But the view from Hakone made me realize the beauty of it. I&#8217;m not really a religious person but I now understand why Japanese has been regarding it as something sacred.</p>
<p>As you get older, your perception will change over time. But it doesn&#8217;t mean what you believed before is less important or not true.</p>
