				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Zermatt, it was “farewell” to Switzerland and “hello” to Italy… or should I say “Buongiorno”..?</p>
<p>Zee left in the morning and I followed his lead a couple hours later, making the various train switches before boarding the train that would take me to one of the premiere European summer destinations: Florence!</p>
<p>The trip was quick enough and before I knew it, I was pulling into the Firenze station where, to my surprise, the Wilson brothers awaited my arrival. It was so great to be reunited with them. Good times were headed our way..</p>
<p>We stopped to drop off my luggage at our hotel, located just down the street from the station and countless Italian attractions, and we were out in the heat, in search of something to eat. Despite, or in lieu of, my exhaustion from a full day of travel, I was mesmerized by the architecture of the beautiful city. The sun was at just the right angle to cast looming shadows over the towering structures and mix them with the brilliant orange of dusk.</p>
<div id="attachment_605" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9502/" rel="attachment wp-att-605"><img class="size-medium wp-image-605" title="IMG_9502" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9502.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walking down the streets of Florence.</p></div>
<p>We found an inexpensive restaurant off of one of the main roads where we sat down to enjoy a meal of bruschetta, pasta, and, of course, wine.</p>
<div id="attachment_598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 383px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_2026/" rel="attachment wp-att-598"><img class="size-medium wp-image-598" title="IMG_2026" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_2026.jpg?w=373&h=500" alt="" width="373" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Delicious, authentic bruschetta. Can&#8217;t go wrong..</p></div>
<p>The boys and I let ourselves get lost in the streets of Florence, admiring the busy nightlife and the break in scorching Tuscan heat. I’d had vague memories of Florence from when my friend Remy spent time there last year. He’d sent me a video while sitting along Ponte-Vecchio, making me incredibly envious of his travels and fueling my wanderlust. I couldn’t help but reminisce as I stood near the very spot that he once had, now on my very own journey abroad.</p>
<div id="attachment_607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9517/" rel="attachment wp-att-607"><img class="size-medium wp-image-607" title="IMG_9517" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9517.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walking along Ponte Vecchio at night.</p></div>
<p>The next morning, we took a day trip out of Florence. Our first stop: Pisa! In all honesty, there’s not much to see in Pisa besides, of course, the Tower. The streets are pretty enough, but the primary draw of the town is the curious structure that rests on the North end of the city.</p>
<div id="attachment_600" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9453/" rel="attachment wp-att-600"><img class="size-medium wp-image-600" title="IMG_9453" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9453.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The river through Pisa</p></div>
<p>As with most other iconic structures I’ve encountered in Europe, I was in pure disbelief that something I’d seen to frequently in photos was right before my very eyes. The Tower of Pisa is beautiful and intricately constructed… aside from the fact that it couldn’t stand securely on its own for several years. I loved being able to see its details up close.</p>
<div id="attachment_601" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9461/" rel="attachment wp-att-601"><img class="size-medium wp-image-601" title="IMG_9461" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9461.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Keepin&#8217; it cheesy with the Leaning Tower of Pisa!</p></div>
<p>After marveling at the Leaning Tower, the heat became too much for us to bear and we sought out some refreshments and food before hopping on a train to our next destination for the day; the small town of Lucca.</p>
<p>The boys’ family came from here, so naturally, they wanted to visit. They’d informed me ahead of time that there wouldn’t be much to see since it was such a small city, but we were all surprised at how many tourists we saw walking about. I later discovered that it is one of the only Italian cities where you can still observe and walk along the walls surrounding the center of town.</p>
<p>We wasted the next few hours curving through the old streets, eating gelato, and just observing the sights. We made a quick run to a supermarket to grab some snacks and rested among some grass to enjoy the last bit of time we had there. We journeyed back to Florence, loving the indescribable Tuscan hills we passed.</p>
<div id="attachment_602" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9467/" rel="attachment wp-att-602"><img class="size-medium wp-image-602" title="IMG_9467" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9467.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some Cocco gelato from Lucca. Delicious.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_599" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9446/" rel="attachment wp-att-599"><img class="size-medium wp-image-599" title="IMG_9446" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9446.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The hills of Tuscany passing by..</p></div>
<p>The next day marked our final day in Firenze. We were up early(ish) in hopes of getting into the Uffizi museum, but the lines were far too long and it was much too hot to wait around in the sun. We dropped our initial plans and instead explored the Galileo Museum along Ponte-Vecchio. What a treat it was to see such advanced tools from so long ago. Countless items filled the glass cases of the museum, even a few of Galileo’s very own fingers… and a tooth. (Yikes!)</p>
<div id="attachment_604" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9487/" rel="attachment wp-att-604"><img class="size-medium wp-image-604" title="IMG_9487" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9487.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crazy astronomical gadgets at the Galileo museum.</p></div>
<p>After our historical fill, we walked down Ponte-Vecchio to observe the shops. When we couldn’t stand the heat any longer, we bought some wine and gelato and made our way back to our hotel for a bit of a snack and a quick nap.</p>
<div id="attachment_603" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9476/" rel="attachment wp-att-603"><img class="size-medium wp-image-603" title="IMG_9476" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9476.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking down Ponte-Vecchio.</p></div>
<p>For our last dinner in Florence, we selected a quaint little restaurant with a great house wine and a delicious selection of entrées. I ordered spaghetti with various shellfish on top. It was too good.</p>
<div id="attachment_606" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://sarabethoppliger.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/florence-italy-august-5th-8th/img_9507/" rel="attachment wp-att-606"><img class="size-medium wp-image-606" title="IMG_9507" src="http://sarabethoppliger.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_9507.jpg?w=500&h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Delicious pasta with various seafood. Yum yum yum.</p></div>
<p>Behind it’s overpopulated streets and overtly touristy ambiance, Florence is a gorgeous city with an endless supply of history, good food, great shopping, and friendly people. I’d be a lucky girl if I were ever able to return.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/01/10/science/10JPMOON_SPAN/10JPMOON_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="360" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>image via the New York Times</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That&#8217;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&#8221;</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As I&#8217;m sure most of you have heard, Neil A. Armstrong, passed away over the weekend.  Armstrong was a man of many accomplishments &#8211; American astronaut, US Naval Aviator, test pilot, aerospace engineer, and university professor- but he is, of course, best known as the first man to walk on the moon.  In his honor, I thought it would be fitting to talk a little bit about the challenges surrounding the preservation of the Apollo moon landing site.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until I read this <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/science/space/a-push-for-historic-preservation-on-the-moon.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">New York Times</span></a></span> article, I had never really thought about the preservation of a place outside of  the earth&#8217;s atmosphere.  It had just never occurred to me that Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin&#8217;s footprints or the American flag planted on the moon&#8217;s surface could be in any danger.  To me, those footprints &#8211; that flag,  were as indelible as the words Armstrong spoke as he took his first steps onto the moon.  However, renewed interest in the moon from  Russia, India and the Google Lunar X Prize pose a potential threat to the first lunar landing site.  A future lunar landing could easily damage or destroy the artifacts left behind by the first landing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Beth O&#8217;Leary, professor of anthropology at New Mexico State University, began spearheading an effort to preserve the Apollo moon landing site after the topic was raised by a student in one of her classes.  For the better part of a decade, O&#8217;Leary has been working with state preservation agencies and NASA to safeguard the site and its artifacts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the US owns the objects left behind on the moon according to international law, it has no sovereignty over any part of the moon thanks to the Outer Space Treaty (signed by it and 100 other nations).  Federal agencies worried that preservation efforts could be seen as an attempt at claiming lunar territory.  Therefore, efforts have mostly centered around the objects left behind &#8211; the flag,  moon boots, and other items are listed in California and New Mexico&#8217;s catalogs of historic artifacts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Last year, NASA held a workshop to issue recommendations balancing historic preservation efforts with the desire for continued exploration of the lunar surface.  The solution developed at the workshop asks that future visitors respect a boundary 75 meters from the  site of the first landing (also called Tranquility Base) and a 225 meter from the site of the second landing (the Apollo 17 mission site).  It also recommended guidelines for flight paths over the sites in an effort to minimize possible damage to footprints caused by exhaust blowing the lunar dust around.  Of course, these recommendations as well as the recognition of artifacts by California and New Mexico, are not legally enforceable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although I hope that NASA&#8217;s recommendations are respected, it is a distinct possibility that they won&#8217;t be. While I&#8217;m not sure that anyone can argue that Tranquility Base is not an important historical site, I can easily see why someone (or an organization or a country) might wonder what the point to its preservation might be.  After all, the site (and the other lunar landings sites) are inaccessible to all but a tiny fraction of people. The event and site were well-documented at the time (photographs, video, audio, technical reports, news media accounts). And it is possible that further exploration of the site with modern technology could yield important information about the moon and space &#8211; things that might have been missed in 1969.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only time will tell if the site will be preserved.  Future exploration efforts may or may not respect NASA&#8217;s guidelines.  Preservation laws may or may not develop to include the preservation of territories in space.   And technology may or may not develop so that some day it will be more accessible to more people.  Who knows, future generations may be able to visit the moon to stand on catwalks or in an observatory to ooh and awe over the first footprints left on the lunar surface and the rudimentary technology left behind.  One thing I do know &#8211; Armstrong&#8217;s words will continue to encapsulate one of the most significant events in human history.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure you check out the original article published in the New York Times earlier this year.  Also check out <a href="http://life.time.com/history/to-the-moon-and-back-life-covers-the-lunar-landing/#1">Life Magazine</a>&#8216;s original coverage of the mission!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You wouldn&#8217;t forget things.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t lose things. Or people. That in itself is enough for most people. Never having the gut wrenching realization when you wake up in the morning, that <em>Oh My God </em><em>he is dead. </em>Having been blessed with a certain forgetting in your sleep. Never knowing what that remembering feels like, that feeling of a limb gone suddenly missing, without warning. Never forgetting a book that you stayed up 3 nights in a row like a  lover only to realize 6 months later you don&#8217;t remember a single detail of those nights.</p>
<p>You would have an escape when all you wanted to do was close your eyes and slip into time and be part of the fabric of its wings. It would be like you finally knew what it meant to<em> get somewhere.</em></p>
<p>My own time travel machine is a subtle bubble, fragile as a bird. When you climb inside it takes you back to before you were born even, back to when you were just a thought that hadn&#8217;t been thought yet.</p>
<p>It takes you back to moments of your life like the summer you spent in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania for a poetry fellowship at Bucknell University where you read poems in a beautiful old church and ran naked through a football field at night with a bunch of other young &#8220;fellows&#8221;. Back to when you ran through cemeteries that summer, and green green grass. It was July and humid and greener than you&#8217;d ever known green to be, and you ran because that was all you could do. It takes you back to these moments that when you were in them the first time, you thought you were unhappy, but upon revisiting them again in your time machine you realize that you could have never been unhappy running through green like that. How could you have been?</p>
<p>Unhappiness was invented along with the time machine and it is a matter of belief when it comes to being able to enter either.</p>
<p>Upon revisiting moments in your time machine you will realize that it was always better than it seemed, that you were never fat and that you could write your ass off. This is a perk of being a time traveler.</p>
<p>When you close the door to the hatch and tell it to go back to 1983, you can see your father carving sticks in the backyard at a wooden picnic table. The plastic on the chairs in the kitchen and how they stick to people&#8217;s thighs in the summer and you can take back all the things you ever said. You can un-say them. That is another perk of being a time traveler.</p>
<p>For example, if the last thing you ever said to your father was &#8220;I hate you&#8221; before he died, well, you can undo that. You just set the dial back a little farther and then get out and plant your feet firm on the brown carpet, your hands on either side of the doorjamb and remain silent. Or say <em>I love you.</em> Really, the choice is yours. Another huge perk of time travel.</p>
<p>You can go back to before you found out your baby was dying and either decide to not have a baby at all or to just go back to when he wasn&#8217;t so sick. To stay in the moment when he had a light in his eyes and could still move his body. Maybe you&#8217;d just stay there. You could, you know, with your time travel machine.</p>
<p>Any event that occurs in the universe has to involve both space and time. Gravity doesn&#8217;t just pull on space; it also pulls on time.</p>
<p>When we time travel we actually bend gravity so we become light sinewy things that don&#8217;t know what it means to be held down, that fly through space and back into the arms of people we thought we&#8217;d lost and grandparents we never even met. We can bend and alter and climb the walls of time, which is a huge perk of time travel.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also things to take into consideration, like getting stuck in a moment of time. Say you go back to that May in 1982 and decide you want to stay. Fine. You have that choice. You do. But remember, when you go back, you are also still <em>here</em>. Your body is still sitting on the train reading a book, is still doing a backbend, is still having dinner with your husband. Only part of you will be missing. Part of you will be stuck in 1982 eating pizza with your father as you drink wine with your husband. Your eyes will reflect this missingness. There will be an emptiness behind your eyes that over time will turn into a deadening. Although you have mastered time travel you cannot master being in two places at once. So really you must decide if the perks are great enough.</p>
<p>How badly you want to be<em> there.</em> How badly you want to be <em>here.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To start with, let&#8217;s make one thing very clear. I love maps. I always have. When I was a child the books I treasured most were Atlases. I can happily waste large chunks of a day zooming in and out of Google Maps and trying to spot things that I didn&#8217;t before. Their ability to be simultaneously both scientific and artistic, to both reveal and conceal, and both inform and deceive, has always fascinated me. As has the power of a map to shape the way people see the world and the way they live their lives.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for a review of the London Transport Museum&#8217;s exhibition <strong>Mind the Map: Inspiring Art, Design &amp; Cartography</strong> that is truly objective and written by a non-map-lover &#8211; indeed, by someone who feels entirely neutral about maps &#8211; then you should probably stop reading. Telling the story of London&#8217;s transport maps and how they have been inspired by, and in turn inspired, art and wider society, this exhibition was right up my street. I was transfixed from the very first picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_29" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 581px"><a href="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/subterranea.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-29" title="subterranea" src="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/subterranea.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="321" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail from Stephen Walter&#8217;s &#8216;London Subterranea&#8217; (<em>from i09.com</em>)</p></div>
<p>The evolution of the tube map, design icon that it undoubtedly is, dominates the exhibition, but there are plenty of surprises too, including Jeremy Wood&#8217;s fascinating &#8216;GPS drawing&#8217; charting his every move through London, some delightful London Transport posters depicting the paradise to be found in the new suburbs, and a series of crude sketches of the tube map drawn by members of the public from memory.</p>
<p>Stephen Walter&#8217;s <em>London Subterranea</em>, a hand-drawn map of central London jam-packed with place names, facts and figures, anecdotes, myths and legends relating to the places, is one of the highlights. His 2008 work <a href="http://stephenwalter.co.uk/drawings/drawa1.php"><em>The Island</em></a>, that depicted the whole of Greater London and its surrounding &#8220;seas&#8221;, was in the same style but its focus was more general. Walter&#8217;s latest work focuses on London beneath the surface, literally and also, perhaps, metaphorically. Lines that at first look like familiar main roads are, when one peers deeper, revealed to be sewers. Other less familiar lines turn out to be all manner of tunnels, used and disused, snaking their way past underground rivers, a post office tube line, cold war bunkers, and abandoned tube stations. Walters seems particularly interested in the macabre side of London, marking the sites of various famous murders with skull-and-crossbones, and showing the sites of the great many plague pits that lie beneath Londoners&#8217; feet. Like <em>The Island</em>, which I saw at an exhibiton at the British Library, <em>London Subterranea</em> is so staggeringly detailed that it can be gawped at for, well, ages. I defy anyone to take just a couple of minutes to look at it and move on.</p>
<p>Equally enchanting are playful, cartoon-like maps of London from the early twentieth century by artist Max Gill. As some of his also-displayed premilimary sketches show, Gill would begin with a geographically accurate birdseye street plan and then draw on the buildings in rich detail and lavish colour, exageratting the size of the city&#8217;s famous landmarks, and then populating the streets and parks with people working and playing. Other more surreal details would also be added, such as on the <em>Wonderground</em> map of London, a giant serpent in Hyde Park, its arched body forming the curve of the Serpentine lake. The children playing cricket, the comic-book speech bubbles and the slightly medieval-Gothic look to the map&#8217;s decoration all contribute to a rather innocent, whimsical feel but even Gill, like Walter, is still captivated by the dark side of London&#8217;s history, and throws in a condemned man hanging from the scaffold at Tyburn (explore a high-res version of Gill&#8217;s <em>Wonderground</em> <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.billson/McGillWonderground/McGillWondergroundsmall.html">here</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_31" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/p11006071.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-31" title="P1100607" src="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/p11006071.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taking shape: One of Henry Beck&#8217;s preliminary sketches for his iconic Tube map</p></div>
<p>The whole upper floor of the exhibition is devoted to the London Underground map, charting its evolution from the pocket paps of the Victorian era, through Harry Beck&#8217;s famous re-design based on electrical schematic diagram, and into the strange world of tube-map-inspired art. Within this world is the alternative-tube-map strand, which seems to have begun around 1992 when Simon Patterson replaced the names of stations and replaced them with politicians, musicians and saints (<em>The Great Bear</em>, see below). In his updated version of this work, called <em>Saptarishi</em>, he adds a topical feel in the shape of a &#8216;line&#8217; of bankers and of Murdochs.</p>
<div id="attachment_34" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3091547461_9f9cf42fba.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-34" title="3091547461_9f9cf42fba" src="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3091547461_9f9cf42fba.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="369" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail from Simon Patterson&#8217;s &#8216;The Great Bear&#8217; (<em>from the &#8216;Going Underground&#8217; Blog</em>)</p></div>
<p>Even the simple pocket tube map seems to have taken on a life on its own over the years. On display are some wonderful examples from throughout the London Underground&#8217;s history, including special editions made to commemorate important events (such as the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, the Festival of Britain in 1951 and the 1966 World Cup). Alongside are some early examples of pocket-sized bus, tram and street maps of the capital. The oldest was a delightful walking map of central London from the 1840s!  There is also a section focusing on three recent incarnations of the pocket tube map, or more specifically, the &#8216;cover art&#8217; that adorns them, and features video interviews with each of the artists discussing their work, including Tracy Emin whose work is &#8211; at the time of writing &#8211; on the cover of the current pocket tube map.</p>
<div id="attachment_37" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 568px"><a href="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/p1100608.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-37" title="P1100608" src="http://exhibitionologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/p1100608.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="372" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The transport map, pocket-version: a history</p></div>
<p>Map-lover that I am, I found this exhibition not only enthralling but strangely reassuring, for it seems that I&#8217;m not the only one who sees maps as far, far more than mundane, functional items! Seeing how many artists have had their imaginations fired by the tube map, how the designers who came before them constantly strived the improve and perfect Beck&#8217;s masterpiece, and how Beck himself grappled with the challenge of illustrating London&#8217;s underground in a simple, elegant manor, was nothing short of inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Mind the Map</strong> is at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden until the <strong>28th October</strong>. There is no charge for the exhibition itself but entry to the museum is <strong>£13.50</strong> (concessions £10). You can go back to the museum as many times as you like for a whole year once you have a ticket, which I&#8217;ll certainly be doing once the school holidays are over since I want to get on board on of those old buses they have when there&#8217;s a few less children around.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I admit it: I like nonfiction.</p>
<p>Now this might not seem like too big of an admission for a blogger to make&#8211;well, of course she likes writing nonfiction, that&#8217;s all she <em>does</em> around here, anyway&#8211;but, for me, at least, it actually is a big deal. See, I don&#8217;t want to like nonfiction. In fact, I&#8217;ve spent the past several years trying to convince myself that I prefer fiction&#8211;and, to some extent, I still <em>do</em> prefer it.</p>
<p>(Oh, come on now, Bekah, no need to go into denial here, you&#8217;ve already gotten the worst of it out&#8230;)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s true. When I sit down to read a book, it&#8217;s usually a novel I&#8217;m after, or a book of short stories&#8211;with the notable exceptions of a few <em>amazing</em> nonfiction books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345965992&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=outliers" target="_blank"><em>Outliers</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345966031&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=king+leopold%27s+ghost" target="_blank"><em>King Leopold&#8217;s Ghost</em> </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-World-How-Shakespeare-Became/dp/039332737X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345966068&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=will+in+the+world" target="_blank"><em>Will in the World</em></a>&#8211;and, when I daydream about a mythic future in which I&#8217;m a best-selling author (with a few Pulitzers and National Book Awards to my name, of course), the book in my hands as I dole out those interviews with talk show hosts is invariably fiction. When I remind myself that I need to spend more time writing, I sit down to one of my several in-progress short stories, and console myself that, come November (aka <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>), I will at last begin work on a novel.</p>
<p>Yet, even so, when I just sit down to write, fiction is not what comes out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cliche of writing to say that writers write, not because they want to, necessarily, but because they can&#8217;t help themselves. Well, as much as I may hate to admit it, I can help myself when it comes to fiction; love it as I may, my writing process in that genre is full of jerks and half-starts and self-doubt. I question my characters, I question my word choice, I question my conflict(s), I question my pacing, I question where, exactly the story is going, or needs to go. It becomes almost impossible for me to turn off my self-critic and self-editor and just <em>write</em>. I may love the outcome, sometimes, but getting there is often nothing less than painful.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s nonfiction.</p>
<p>Shortly after high school, I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Writing-Life-Writers-Think/dp/1586481495/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345967194&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=writers+on+writing" target="_blank"><em>The Writing Life</em></a>, a book of essays written by famous authors on the subject of writing that a high school teacher had given me, and I remember getting to one entry by a famous biographer, describing his process of becoming a nonfiction writer. The book itself is boxed away somewhere right now, but his general reasoning for his genre choice has haunted me ever since I first read it: He said his life had been to boring, too ordinary, for him to write fiction. I didn&#8217;t want that to be me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, before college I didn&#8217;t even know there was such a thing as creative nonfiction; in my thoughts, writing existed in two categories: fiction, and textbooks. That may be a bit of a simplification, but not much of one&#8211;if I&#8217;m remembering right, I read my first-ever piece of personal narrative, an excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nickel-Dimed-Not-Getting-America/dp/0805063897/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345966475&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=not+making+it+in+america" target="_blank"><em>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America</em></a>, during my senior year of high school, and it existed in my mind as an interesting, but isolated, writing form. Besides, even that was an exercise of journalism, and of research, more than of creativity. <em>Creative</em> nonfiction? That just seemed like a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Even in college, creative nonfiction flew under the radar with me&#8211;I got a Creative Writing degree on the fiction track (the only other option was poetry), and it wasn&#8217;t until my senior year that I took my first and, to date, only class in creative nonfiction.</p>
<p>But I was hooked. Sitting down to write was so easy&#8211;I just <em>wrote!</em> No questioning my story&#8211;it happened! No questioning my characters&#8211;they existed! Sure, I still had pacing and word choice to think about, but the primary struggles behind those concerns&#8211;namely, the constant preoccupation with setting up my main character&#8217;s personality and motivations through tone&#8211;disappeared, since the narrator was, suddenly, no one other than myself. My creative voice sprang forth almost without my trying. It was bliss.</p>
<p>And it is bliss&#8211;even now, as I type this, I cannot help but remember that that is what I am doing, now: writing nonfiction. And it was what I was doing, all last year, as I wrote my <a href="http://bekahnowbaihe.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">stories from Taiwan</a>. When I want to process something, I write. I can&#8217;t help myself. And what do I write? Nonfiction.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t understand about the biographer&#8217;s description of his entry into the field, but which I understand now, is that nonfiction of any sort is more forgiving than fiction of an ordinary background&#8211;but that doesn&#8217;t necessitate a boring life. In fact, in the case of creative nonfiction, it requires precisely the opposite: you <em>must</em> go have amazing adventures, or at least be able to dramatize your smaller ones, or you will have nothing to write about.</p>
<p>As a fiction writer, it actually helps if you had a screwed up childhood or identity issues or what have you, because those are the sorts of real human problems that go into making real human characters out of the ideas in your head; those are the sorts of fictional people people want to read about. As a nonfiction writer, reality&#8217;s okay&#8211;all you have to do is be able to organize it in such a way that it becomes interesting and meaningful. Nonfiction is intensely personal, and it&#8217;s that, very intimate, nature, and the author&#8217;s ability to bring others into that space, that makes for a good piece. Drama isn&#8217;t necessary if you&#8217;re doing it right.</p>
<p>So yes, I like fiction&#8211;I like reading it, and I want to like writing it. But the fact is, at this point at least, I&#8217;m a nonfiction writer&#8211;might as well step out of the shadows and claim it outloud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_530" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://cavemum.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/lambs.jpg"><img src="http://cavemum.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/lambs.jpg" alt="" title="lambs" width="600" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-530" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Farewell, Rambinos.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty intense time on the El Cura ranch. The heat of August soared to 46 degrees centigrade (that&#8217;s 115 Fahrenheit to alla y&#8217;all), and while some of us were metaphysically dying in the heat, three of the sheep we are looking after on our house farm-sit literally died from it. </p>
<p>The first one I found in the bunker underneath the alberca/swimming pool. It was dusk, and I had left Caveboy with my parents to take down to the Sufi watering hole for iftar (yes, there were actually people fasting from food and water in this heat). Usually I give the sheep food (hay or &#8216;forraje&#8217;, dried herby grass, plus oats and water) at sundown, and put them into their shed to keep them safe from wild dogs.</p>
<p>But while counting them up, I kept trying to make them add up to eight, and getting confused at only finding seven. Cavegirl was meanwhile yawning and rubbing her eyes, hungry and dinnerless, but nevertheless determined to &#8216;help&#8217; me. I was in a rush to get to the iftar meal, and ended up running up and down the hectare of land looking for the last lost lamb.</p>
<p>Finding the prostrate woolly figure of the poor beast under the swimming pool sent me into a state of total panic. What the heck&#8230;?! My husband was away working at a festival in Portugal, I was on my own, my kids needed to eat&#8230;in a mad flap I ran about looking for the right course of action. OK, ring the sheep&#8217;s owners&#8230;and then what? The only sensible answer that came back was to go have something to eat and wait for morning.</p>
<p>Dead sheep number one buried, I thought my turn as sheep-sitter was already looking pretty bad, when a few nights later, just as I had just got my kids to sleep, I heard a tremendous clattering and baaing going on in the barn.</p>
<p>Still in my stripy PJs, with a pitifully small bicycle lamp in hand and a swell of trepidation in my chest, I crept out to see if someone was trying to steal the animals, or a dog was eating one of them alive.</p>
<p>But the most peculiar thing confronted me. One of the lambs (a full-grown ewe, really) was lying on her side, running like a stabbed bull. Her hooves scraped the wooden sides in a hollow, futile gallop; her teeth were grinding, her head thrown back, eyes swivelling up in white-striped terror, foam frothing at the side of her mouth.</p>
<p>Stunned, but strangely set into pragmatic mode, I went back to the house in search of Bach&#8217;s Rescue Remedy, the only thing I could think of that might calm her down as it has done a hundred times on my tantruming kids. It did the trick; the gallops started coming in waves, interspersed with peaceful lulls in which she panted in a a paralysed trance. </p>
<p>I also did the other thing that comes to mind when trying to calm my kids down, which was to sing them the last few chapters of Qur&#8217;an in a lullaby voice. Slowly the gallops became less insistent, the pauses for breath a little more protracted. </p>
<p>I started wondering what on earth was wrong with her; I was reminded of an experiment on cats I&#8217;d seen a film of in which scientists had removed the part of the brain responsible for paralysing the body during REM sleep. Sleeping cats were filmed acting out physically all of the actions it was obviously dreaming about – running, biting, hunting. The thought crossed my mind: Is she dreaming? Or is she dying?</p>
<p>Despite the puny LED light shed by my torch, what struck me about the musty, dung-perfumed atmosphere of the scene was its primordial, almost Biblical nature. How many times must this have happened in the past, in exactly the same way? The other sheep were absolutely calm now that their shepherdess was there (oh, how naïve sheep are!) and carried on munching their hay blithely. Meanwhile, her legs became stiffer and stiffer – presumably the root of the Spanish expression for &#8216;kicking the bucket&#8217;, &#8216;estirar la pata&#8217; (to stretch out one&#8217;s leg). Perhaps that&#8217;s where&#8217; kicking the bucket&#8217; comes from too.</p>
<p>It was abundantly clear now that she was dying. A powerful peace descended on us, and I was overcome by the sensation of what people describe as an angelic presence, in that way that precedes the verbal formulation of it being angelic. In my tearful, sleep-deprived state I felt almost as though I was witnessing the birth of Jesus, in an anachronistic barn that had landed on the wrong continent in a malfunctioning time machine.</p>
<p>I finally left her to her dying stupor, and somehow the peculiarity of the experience ebbed to the sort of stoical acceptance worthy of a weather-beaten peasant farmer, or even, perhaps, a sheep. The lamb had been born in that barn, so it seemed kind of sensical for her to die there too. Life and death are, after all, both threshold experiences, opposites ends of the roll of film but double-exposed, different panoramas both taken with the same lens.</p>
<div id="attachment_532" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://cavemum.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ewe.jpg"><img src="http://cavemum.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ewe.jpg" alt="" title="ewe" width="600" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-532" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Only ewe&#8230;.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Now slightly inured to the visceral, animal vision of death – this time, according to the vet, it was caused by septicaemia – I was better prepared (though pretty dismayed) to see another lamb wobble dangerously on his feet as he came down to the barn a few evenings later, collapsing as he arrived. I had to grab him under the belly and hoist him into the shed to be able to close the door, but he stood there in a daze, not rooting around int he boxes of hay like they usually do.</p>
<p>The kids were picked up by their dad at 10pm that night; I had to get him to heft all 50 kilos of the poor beast out of the shed onto the cool ground in the light of the car headlamps before they went (much appreciate it, ex-Caveman). I then put on my gingham lycra campesina superhero outfit and sprang into action, making phone calls and racing into town to find rehydration salts. </p>
<p>En route I co-opted a few friends who gave me packs of salts and sugar, and another who obligingly came down with her son at 11 pm to help lift the lamb&#8217;s head up while I shoved a syringe of salty sugary liquids down its throat. Over a litre went down in 40 ml doses, sometimes trickling out straight away as he had lost the strength almost to swallow. His teeth chattered against the plastic of the syringe; a heavy fever had already set in. He lolled his head back, panting, dragging his legs back and forth across the grass, making straw angels in the dirt.</p>
<p>At midnight we all withdrew. There was nothing else to do, short of sleeping on the manure-imbued earth beside the barn to keep watch over him, but I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t muster up the saintliness for that. In the morning I went straight over to see if he was OK, but he was exactly where I&#8217;d left him, immobile, eyes dusty and frozen, his oily wool coated in icy dew.</p>
<p>Dramas aplenty for one week, you might think. But no, this is the Alpujarras, land of pirates with green moustaches and hippies selling balls of enchanted mud in the market – anything that can go weird, will!</p>
<p>So two days later, due to various bureacratic headaches, and probably a truck-driver who has just now decided to go on holiday, the carcass of Rambino number 3 is still lying under a plastic window blind on the edge of the land, rotting (I am waiting for the campsite next-door to start complaining of the stench). Yes folks, now is not a good time to come and visit Cavemum. </p>
<p>And to top it all off, in the midst of that bubonic hum, together with my new friend Ricardo – a seriously cool old man from the mountains who doesn&#8217;t bat an eyelid at this sort of thing – I helped sheared the remaining five sheep this morning&#8230;with my kitchen scissors. Actually he used my kitchen scissors, I used my sewing scissors; I had to wash off the greenish lanolin with Ecover afterwards.</p>
<p>Shearing a sheep by hand is quite an amusing experience. Pinning them down is one thing; one of the feisty mamas carried Ricardo halfway across the land while he clung onto its collar for dear life. Then we had to tie three of its legs (leaving one free so it can still breath alright), and get to work snipping away a two-inch deep layer of wool so dense and encrusted with mud and God knows what else that it seems we were chopping up a very unsavoury hippie&#8217;s foam mattress. Twice a sheep protested by spontaneously pooing all over the mounting heap of wool. </p>
<p>It took an hour and a half, during which time we bantered about life and drugs and divorce and farming and Kenya and brain tumours and all sorts. Nothing like a tough physical job and a conversation with a weather-beaten man of the earth to set you right. After a vigorous cold shower (my gas bottle is empty), I left for the market feeling on top of the world,remembering why I was drawn to a life on the land in the first place. It&#8217;s real life, in all its shiny, delicious, stinky, hilarious glory.</p>
<p>Well, I have blisters from the scissors on my writing hand, but one thing&#8217;s for sure, it&#8217;s going to make for good material. (Writing material, I mean, not fabric. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be washing that wool to make felt with anytime soon.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://themastershot.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/beasts-of-the-southern-wild.jpeg"><img title="beastin' on crab - _DSC8525.NEF" src="http://themastershot.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/beasts-of-the-southern-wild.jpeg?w=500&h=308" alt="" width="500" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>This post has been half-written for more than 3 weeks now. <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild </em> is a film that I have felt conflicted about since seeing it opening night at the Belcourt here in Nashville. It is, on one hand, rhapsodic and bold &#8211; a personal and daring statement from a young director with ferocious talent. It is, on the other hand, a film whose politics walk a fine line between effective allegory and message-y manipulation. Apparently I am not alone in my reservations. Ever since its triumph at Sundance one camp has declared <em>Beasts</em> to be a <a href="http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/notebook-reviews-benh-zeitlins-beasts-of-the-southern-wild">early frontrunner for best of the year</a> and the other camp has elequently declared it <a href="http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/notebook-reviews-benh-zeitlins-beasts-of-the-southern-wild">faux-naif bullshit</a>. I liked <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild. </em>I had some issues with it, yes, but to denounce it completely would be contrarian. It is a debut feature that swings for the fences and almost makes it there. <em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The movie is emotionally rich and undeniably original; Its grainy 16mm browns and greens make it feel crafted from the muddy swamplands that Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis) lovingly inhabits. The surprise tour-de-force performance from Wallis elevates the movie from average indie fare to the Oscar underdog it seems destined to become. The film would be nothing without her. One scene where her sick father, Wink, desperately confesses to Hushpuppy the inevitability of his fate shows Hushpuppy stubbornly pouting in order to simultaneously fend away tears and prove her strength. Wallis pulls this moment off with an effortless naturalism that any seasoned actor would envy. The film rests on her shoulders and she accepts the weight as if she were born to do so.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Beasts of the Southern Wild </em>takes place in a fictional Louisiana community called the Bathtub. This community struggles to deal with the destruction caused when a Katrina-esque storm floods the area. Hushpuppy, along with the other children in the Bathtub are being taught by the adults to face the destruction of the natural world with courage and fury. Her teacher prepares the children for the coming storm by warning them, &#8220;you can&#8217;t be pussies.&#8221; Nature is very close to Hushpuppy &#8211; both good and bad. The bad is further represented by prehistoric &#8220;Beasts&#8221; that are charging towards the Bathtub from the recently melted ice-caps. Hushpuppy takes all of this on with muscular courage as taught by her tough-love father.</p>
<p>The story that Benh Zeitlan, a New Orleans resident, sets out to tell is that of a community with deep roots. A community that doesn&#8217;t wish to abandon their homes even when it is unsafe to stay. Tying the situation to Katrina is the choice that gets him into trouble. A scene in which the bathtub residents are forced to evacuate and take shelter in a Superdome-esque facility suggests a more complex issue than the film seems prepared to face. We see Hushpuppy forced to trade her from-the-slums white and denim outfit for a light-blue girly dress by the well-meaning volunteers. The shock of this image is heavy-handed and counter-productive. &#8220;These people don&#8217;t understand her!&#8221; we are meant to understand. The movie seems torn between storybook mythology and overt political statement. It works best when it settles into the former &#8211; Hushpuppy&#8217;s noble battle with nature&#8217;s indifference &#8211; this scene suggests the latter without much more depth than &#8220;poor people are awesome and white people just don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://themastershot.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/6a00d834515c9769e2017615a3a7ad970c-500wi.png"><img title="6a00d834515c9769e2017615a3a7ad970c-500wi" src="http://themastershot.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/6a00d834515c9769e2017615a3a7ad970c-500wi.png?w=500&h=297" alt="" width="500" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still conflicted about <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild.</em> A sure thing is that Benh Zeitlan debut signals the arrival of a major new talent. The film is also the first full length feature from production company Court 13 &#8211; a one-stop-shop for indie filmmaking founded by Zeitlan and fellow NOLA residents. Much like the community in <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild </em>it seems that Zeitlan &amp; Co. have forged their own path to filmmaking success with a &#8220;gotta take care of mine&#8221; communal spirit. It seems inevitable that no matter how <em>Beasts </em>is remembered, there will soon be many more where it came from. I, for one, will be watching.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am lucky enough to have possession of most of the family pictures, and I enjoy looking through them from time to time. While rearranging the hall closet recently I came across the box of some of the very oldest pictures I have, my grandparents&#8217; albums from the 1890s and beyond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about my maternal grandmother more often since I wrote the recent post about <a href="http://nonficwriter.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/clotheslines/" target="_blank">clotheslines</a>. As I mentioned, she lived with us until she passed away, just before I turned 15. She took care of us children, and the house, while my mother worked, and she and I were close, although I have to say when I became a teenager I wasn&#8217;t always respectful to her and did not appreciate her as much as I wish I had. From the stories she told me about her growing-up years and early adulthood, I wish I could have known her then. I look at these pictures and think about the girl and young woman she must have been, the fun she had with her brothers and sisters, the way she and my grandfather met, her lonely life in Brooklyn as a young wife, and her favorite role, that of being a mother. Here are some of the pictures I ran across today:</p>
<p>My grandmother, Lucinda Fishback, was born on February 10, 1892, in Battle Hill, Georgia, in Fulton County just outside Atlanta, one of a family of nine children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/babyg1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1606" title="babyg" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/babyg1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="586" /></a></p>
<p>At age 2 she developed pneumonia and narrowly escaped death, and my great-grandmother, fearful she might lose her, after having lost two sons, was often overly careful of my grandmother&#8217;s health, though she was quite healthy all of her life until her death from a stroke at age 76.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/kids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" title="kids" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/kids.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="592" /></a></p>
<p>In the above picture are, front row, my great-grandmother Emma, great-uncle Martin; in the back, left to right, my great-aunt Mary, my grandmother, and my great-aunt Jennie. My grandmother always said Mary was the cut-up of the family; when they did chores together, Mary often shirked and let my grandmother do more of the work, especially when they did the dishes, but she entertained my grandmother by dancing and singing and joking, so she said she really didn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/youngportrait.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" title="youngportrait" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/youngportrait.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="540" /></a></p>
<p>My grandmother is in her mid-20s in this photo. Her great regret in life was that she was unable to attend school once she&#8217;d finished the 9th grade. Because the family lived outside the Atlanta city limits, they would have had to pay for her to finish high school in Atlanta and with that many children, they couldn&#8217;t afford it. She took a secretarial course then and went to work doing office work for a music company in downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p>She enjoyed singing and began voice lessons around that time. My grandfather, Fred, who&#8217;d moved to Atlanta from New York City, was working at the music company tuning pianos, but on his lunch breaks often played the piano for his own enjoyment, and my grandmother would stop in to listen. Shy by nature, one day she got up the courage to speak to him and told him proudly she&#8217;d been taking singing lessons. &#8220;Oh, really? Let me hear you sing something for me,&#8221; he coaxed her. She sang a song of the day and he looked at her blankly. Ever blunt, he grabbed his hat and as he got up from the piano said to her, &#8220;You&#8217;re wasting your money.&#8221; She was indignant, but soon got over it and they began keeping company. They were married in Atlanta on March 11, 1918.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/wedding.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1588" title="wedding" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/wedding.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>Pictures from their honeymoon in New Orleans:</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hmoon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591" title="hmoon" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hmoon.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gmno.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1592" title="gmno" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gmno.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>They moved to Brooklyn then and spent several months living with my grandfather&#8217;s family. My grandmother was miserable there; she missed Atlanta and felt out of place in New York, and unhappy that his family persisted in speaking German around her, though they could speak English perfectly well, and she felt excluded.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gmbro.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" title="gmbro" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gmbro.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>She begged my grandfather to find work in Atlanta, but there was none available. He found work in Newport News, Virginia, and my grandmother felt it was a good compromise. She&#8217;d be closer to Atlanta, and at least she&#8217;d be in the South again.</p>
<p>On February 17, 1919, my <a href="http://nonficwriter.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/remembering-mama-a-mothers-day-tribute/" target="_blank">mother</a> was born, and though my grandmother had developed toxemia and had a difficult delivery, she and my grandfather were ecstatic that they&#8217;d gotten started on what they hoped would be a large family.</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ymom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1595" title="ymom" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ymom1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gandm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596" title="gandm" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gandm.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>But my grandmother was unable to have any more children due to emergency decisions made during my mother&#8217;s delivery, and both she and my grandfather were despondent over this. They adopted a little boy when my mother was 3, but he had learning disabilities they weren&#8217;t well-equipped to handle, and had trouble accepting him as their own son:</p>
<p><a href="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gandf.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597" title="gandf" src="http://nonficwriter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gandf.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>My grandfather started to drink too much then, though he remained a good provider, and my grandmother became ever more absorbed in raising her children and cooking elaborate meals, making some of my grandfather&#8217;s German favorites like sauerbraten and hasenpfeffer, and experimented with making her own doughnuts and potato chips. She was still a great cook in her later years and could do more with leftovers than anyone I&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p>My grandmother loved music, cooking, sewing, keeping house, and her family. She was a hard worker, still mowing the grass with a push mower in her 60s. She had a great head for business, having bought and sold several properties throughout her lifetime. In her later years, she resented anyone trying to take over her work of keeping house, though eventually she had to relinquish all but some cooking duties and doing the dishes.</p>
<p>When she had her stroke, I did not think for a minute that she would pass away. Surely she would get well and come home and things would be like they&#8217;d always been. When the call came during the night ten days later that she&#8217;d had another stroke and passed, I was shocked and refused to believe it at first. Then, after accepting it, I grieved for weeks, feeling horrible that in the days prior to her stroke I&#8217;d not been nicer to her, never told her how much she meant to me and would now never get the chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to have these pictures now, and the memories, memories that will unfortunately be gone once my sister and I have passed away. I guess that&#8217;s part of the reason I write these posts about my family, to have them written somewhere, at least. I&#8217;ve been in the process of writing a book about my mother&#8217;s life, and even if it&#8217;s never published, these stories will be written down for someone to hopefully appreciate one day.</p>
<p>Every family has its stories, however; we hear every now and then to implore our elders to write their stories down or at least tell them to us to appreciate and pass on. I implore you to ask your relatives for their own stories and record them somehow now, before it&#8217;s too late. These are the stories of our lives, part of what make us who we are. Don&#8217;t let them slip away.</p>
