				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://theawesomething.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/6271.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-414" title="Hazard Pay" src="http://theawesomething.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/6271.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a> The key to tonight&#8217;s <em>Breaking Bad </em>might be <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Walt Whitman&#8217;s book of poetry that our own Walter finds in a box as he moves back in to the house at the beginning of the episode. Whitman&#8217;s poems are often orgiastic celebrations of the senses and sensuality, an attitude perverted by Walter&#8217;s assurance to Jesse that &#8220;If it feels rights, it feels right.&#8221; Walt takes that to the extreme, grossly indulging his emotional whims even when they serve no visible purpose. He grapples with Mike on the titular hazard pay just to pick a fight, watches <em>Scarface</em> with his children in a blatantly calculated act of psychological torture directed at his wife, and, in what seems likely to prove a crucial misstep, makes a thinly veiled threat on Jesse&#8217;s life with little or no provocation.</p>
<p><span id="more-411"></span></p>
<p>Walter apparently misreads Jesse&#8217;s willingness to cover the hazard pay as a troubling indication of possible independence. Jesse&#8217;s solo cooking has been a threat to Walt since it made him irrelevant in the Fring organization, but only here does Walt&#8217;s anxiety at his replaceability take its course on Jesse rather than an external source. To be fair, there is a hint of pride in Walt&#8217;s growing recognition that Jesse is growing to be quite resourceful, asking Saul smart questions during their tour and figuring out a workaround for the equipment before even asking Walt about it. But that pride curdles under the possibility that Jesse might become a threat, motivating Walter to contribute some of his cut to Mike&#8217;s hazard pay to save face while instigating sure to grow tensions over not getting exactly what he wants.</p>
<p>The Icarus speech notes that Victor overstepped his natural bounds by cooking by himself and taking excessive liberties of the type Walt believes Jesse could engage in with his new-found hyper-competence. And if Walt doesn&#8217;t conceive of himself as the sun in a universe where he thinks he controls Mike and has grown an enormous <a href="http://theawesomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/i-am-heisenberg-your-god-walter-and-the-unholy-in-live-free-or-die/">God Complex</a>, I don&#8217;t know what to think of this show anymore.</p>
<p>This level of self-indulgence finds its way into almost everything Walt does in the episode, but most directly in his emotional manipulation. The story he feeds Marie about Skyler and Ted is a clear emotional victory for him as well as revenge against Skyler, which he continues to take in the next scene by watching <em>Scarface</em>. Walt is no fool &#8211; he knows why Skyler is depressed, and his encouragement to her suggests that he is now taking active pleasure in making her miserable.</p>
<p>One might justifiably criticize the show for being over the top in using a film marked as one of the great gangster movies, but Walt is the one choosing to brutalize Skyler, not Vince Gilligan (shut up). It makes perfect sense that he would not only choose to engage in such a pseudo-violent activity with their children to use them as emotional pawns (as he has done in the past)  but also say something like &#8220;everyone dies in this movie,&#8221; a declaration in the same vein as &#8220;I forgive you&#8221; &#8211; pure, visceral manipulation. Such blatant, gleeful, and <em>consistent</em> abuse of Skyler might be one of the worst things Walter has done at this point in the series.</p>
<p>Speaking of indulgence, credited writer Peter Gould specializes in both flashy, fan-pleasing episodes (&#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221;) and Jesse-heavy episodes (&#8220;Problem Dog&#8221;). &#8220;Hazard Pay&#8221; is both, particularly in the first 45 minutes, which are the most straight-up <em>fun </em>the show has had in a while, magnets aside. We get some fantastic callbacks from Saul&#8217;s pet laser tag place and Skinny Pete and Badger. Jonathan Banks gets to sound indignant and curmudgeonly (during a Saul Goodman real estate tour, no less). Landry from <em>Friday Night Lights </em>(Jesse Plemons)  joins our favorite meth-cooking enterprise as Todd, a member of  the heir apparent to the Pollos Hermanos mantle, Vamonos Pest, which appeared all ready to make its way to t-shirts everywhere. Hell, there&#8217;s even a cooking montage. For old times&#8217; sake. With chemistry!</p>
<p>Obviously, the devastation Walt brings on Skyler and Jesse (and hints of threatening Mike) kill the lighter tone of the earlier parts of the episode, as they should. The sharp shift in tone seems to justify what&#8217;s been a somewhat slow few episodes thus far. Some critics have suggested that given the last-act nature of this season, the show should be heading for its climax, but I&#8217;d argue that&#8217;s never how the show worked. If anything, the emotional dominos that well start off a series of frenzied last-ditch horrible acts are falling faster than normal &#8211; the seeds of serious conflict between Walt and Mike, Jesse, and Skyler, and a route to conflict with Hank. It&#8217;s important to note that the preexisting relationships Walt has with every major character is game for implosion at this point in the series, and what we conceive of table setting might just be the first rumbles of thunder. We think the situation we&#8217;re in now is the gentle ribbing of Gale&#8217;s favorite Whitman poem, but it seems to be moving ever-closer to cataclysm.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally do stray observations, but there&#8217;s a LOT more to talk about in this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does anyone else think the Skyler smoking bit is actually setting her up to smoke the Chekov&#8217;s Cigarette, or is it just a red herring?</li>
<li>Stuff appearing on screen was bigger than normal in this episode &#8211; one of the characters in the silent film Walt and Jesse are watching has a ladder fall out from under him, and &#8220;nanny cams&#8221; and prison cameras play prominent roles in various scenes as well.</li>
<li>Will Mike actually be able to keep everyone quiet? It&#8217;s nice to have a character believe in people (if in a twisted way), but that doesn&#8217;t work out well often in this series.</li>
<li>Brandon Nowalk notes on Twitter that Marie will now be keeping a Walt-related secret from Hank, which is the perfect in for Hank&#8217;s final endgame in the Heisenberg investigation.</li>
<li>This episode was STUFFED. In an awesome way. I&#8217;m betting it becomes a fan favorite.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>These &#8220;small sellers&#8221; are the most common sight on any Indian street. They are the street vendors, who take up a corner of their own on any street around the city and put up their small shop, from which they earn their livelihood. They aren&#8217;t rich and obviously do not earn enough to put up a real shop, but these poor vendors have to face a lot of difficulty from the government. This difficulty being that, people are not allowed to put up a shop anywhere and everywhere they want to, yet the only option that the vendors have is to see a place where lot of people pass through everyday. And if that place isn&#8217;t permitted by the government, then the police come and chase them away or even at times, take away all their selling items. Here are some such vendors who earn their living on the streets of Shillong, a small hill-station located in the north-eastern part of India, selling items varying from toys to vegetables to fruits, local products, flowers, fast-food snacks, cigarettes, chips, chocolates, or almost anything imaginable.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a post sort of percolating inside my head for a few days&#8230;and while it&#8217;s been doing that (while I&#8217;ve been mulling the topic, in other words), I&#8217;ve come across two posts from other people on sort-of-related subjects.</p>
<p><a href="https://alateralplunge.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/dear-fellow-bloggers/">This was the first</a>.  It was on WordPress&#8217;s Freshly Pressed page recently (it might still be there.)  The blogger was talking about how she doesn&#8217;t like to &#8220;like&#8221; posts indiscriminately.  In other words, she only &#8220;likes&#8221; when she <em>really</em> likes!</p>
<p>Then today I read<a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/get-interactive/"> this post</a>, from WordPress.  This one is on blog engagement.  It mentions luring the &#8220;lurkers&#8221; into interaction (lurkers being the people who read posts and don&#8217;t comment, etc.)</p>
<p>So, neither of these posts touches directly on what I wanted to talk about&#8230;but they&#8217;re in the same family, such as it is.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about isn&#8217;t so much the pros and cons of using that little &#8220;like&#8221; button.  I want to talk about the limitations of it &#8211; the limitations of &#8220;like.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started thinking about this when I read a recent post from a blog I follow.  I&#8217;m not going to link to it, because I feel like it&#8217;s sort of callous to take a post with so much emotion and use it as an analytical tool.  I&#8217;ll just say that it was a post dealing with child custody, and the hurdles the blogger was facing.</p>
<p>I appreciated this post on multiple levels.  As somebody who is currently dealing with custody questions, I was horrified to have it spelled out so clearly what exactly my life COULD look like if I wasn&#8217;t fortunate enough to have had children with somebody who is, at heart, a decent guy and a really great father.  As a blogger, I was really impressed with the writer&#8217;s honesty in laying this all out.  And as a writer, I was struck by the way she wrote it: the way she captured the events and the emotions without devolving into venting.  (That&#8217;s a hard line to walk.)  All the way around, it was an exceptional post.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the question:  what do you do with a post like that?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an easy question for me.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know this woman.  I read her blog, and she sounds like a person I would like in &#8220;real life.&#8221;  I respect her greatly for dealing with what she&#8217;s dealing with right now with such fortitude and strength.  And so I don&#8217;t want to write some stupid comment like, &#8220;Hang in there&#8230;it&#8217;ll get better!&#8221; or something like that.  That trivializes what she&#8217;s going through, I think.  I also don&#8217;t feel comfortable writing something more pointed.  I mean, if I had a question I would ask it, and if I had actual advice that could help her, I would certainly give it&#8230;but I don&#8217;t.  I did begin a few more direct comments, but they all seemed intrusive.</p>
<p>Granted, she&#8217;s the one who laid the whole story out there for public perusal.  But does that mean she really wants a discourse with strangers about it?  Sometimes people write because they just have to&#8230;not because they&#8217;re inviting the opinions of every random person who comes across their piece.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s when I thought about hitting &#8220;like.&#8221;  &#8220;Like&#8221; is handy that way, after all.  It allows you, in the easiest way imaginable, to show support for a post and/or a blogger.  Most of the time, I like &#8220;like&#8221; a lot!</p>
<p>But it just doesn&#8217;t work here.  I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to hit the button.  It didn&#8217;t feel right.  I mean, seriously&#8230;how do you &#8220;like&#8221; a post like that?  Doesn&#8217;t that trivialize inherently?  I was impressed by this post, and I felt a great deal of respect and sympathy for the writer when I read it.  But I can&#8217;t say I <em>liked</em> it (it&#8217;s not like it made me happy.)</p>
<p>I finally decided that there, with that post, was the limitation of &#8220;like.&#8221;  It hadn&#8217;t occurred to me before that &#8220;like&#8221; <em>was</em> limited&#8230;but I see it clearly now.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what I did ultimately:  nothing.  &#8220;Like&#8221; was unsatisfactory.  I couldn&#8217;t think of a comment that seemed appropriate. So, I read&#8230;and I left.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree:  That seems like a shame. But what was the alternative?  If the blogger who wrote that post was somebody I knew in real space, there would have been options of interaction beyond finding words &#8211; nonverbal ways to show solidarity or support. There&#8217;s no nonverbal blogging equivalent &#8211; save for that &#8220;like&#8221; button.  And when that doesn&#8217;t cut it, what are you left with?</p>
<p>After fretting about this a bit, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve finally come around to:  I need to make a comment.  And yes, commenting appropriately requires finding (somehow) an appropriate voice and tone to convey what I mean to convey, without triteness or triviality, and without undue familiarity.  And I haven&#8217;t been able to hit that note yet&#8230;but I think I should keep trying.  It seems wrong to be so affected by another&#8217;s writing and do nothing to indicate this.</p>
<p>Once I get over my frustration that I can&#8217;t just hit that little button and be done with it, I&#8217;ll probably appreciate the personal-growth-component of being forced to deal with a situation like this directly, rather than evading with a button-click. (I&#8217;m not quite there yet though!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/p1080473.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1397" title="Colors of Colombia" src="http://thesoulshines.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/p1080473.jpg?w=553&h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Packing list:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One large yellow backpack stocked with six cans of various precooked meats, too many girl clothes, toiletries, and one towel.</li>
<li>One small red backpack packed with an enviably small and sensible selection of boy clothes and three books.</li>
<li>3 liters of agua (which would later be sweated out in less than an hour) and one bottle of coconut flavored rum.</li>
<li>One plastic grocery bag full of high-sodium and/or high-sugar individually packed snacks and one roll of toilet paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Notably absent from above list:  cutlery, mosquito repellent, and a second towel).</p>
<p><strong>Setting off</strong></p>
<p><em>We love camping</em>, we said.  <em>Three nights won&#8217;t possibly be enough!</em>  We daydreamed about sunsets on the beach, fresh air and stars, and extolled ourselves for our enlightened appreciation of the simple things in life.</p>
<p>With our usual optimism and an amateur packing list, we set off from our homebase of Cartagena for Parque Tayrona, a paradisaical national park in Santa Marta four hours away by bus.  We passed through Barranquilla (home of the legendary <a href="http://thesoulshines.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/quien-lo-vive-es-quien-lo-goza/" target="_blank">Carnaval</a>), over the Rio Magdalena, and into the jungle.  Each town we maneuvered through was increasingly covered in vegetation.  After so much flat coastal land, the mountains appeared slowly, capped with halos of mist that curled down in ribbons into the valleys.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about blood on that bus trip (not for personal reasons), of vicious things that happened in those jungles.  I thought of the Colombia that I heard about growing up: a specter defined only by coffee, cocaine, salsa, and decapitations.</p>
<p>We arrived at the park entrance at 5:02.  Evidently, amid all our starry-eyed daydreaming, we failed to realize that the park closes at 5:00 PM.  <em>Sharp</em>.</p>
<p>After being rebuffed by a cranky employee (with a tight-lipped &#8220;The park is closed&#8221; as definitive as Gandalf&#8217;s &#8220;You shall not pass&#8221;), our puppy eyes and pleading were somehow pathetic enough to convince a second employee to stay long enough to register our IDs in the system and let us in.  And so, we started off our trip with the great luck not to have to search for habitation in the Colombian wilderness.  Win.</p>

<p><strong>First night in the jungle</strong></p>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t heard a howler monkey in the wild, the sound registers somewhere between an energetic woodpecker and a choleric dinosaur, depending how close you are.  During our several hour walk to our campsite, we heard howlers*, dodged bats swooping over the trail, and stepped over multi-lane highways of red ants the size of my pinky toes.  The only real mode of transportation within the park is by foot (or by hoof if you choose to pay for a ride on an unenthusiastic horse).  We chose the first option.</p>
<p>The sounds got stranger and the trail got harder to navigate as the sun set.  Just as the last bits of blue light were leaving the sky, we plodded into the campsite on the first of many beaches in the park.  Over the next few days, I would see other backpackers wander into our site as if they&#8217;d been lost in the wilderness for days: disheveled, hunched under the weight of their packs, and always slightly confused but glad to have found a place to sleep.  I imagine that&#8217;s precisely how we appeared that first night.</p>
<p>We were met in the darkness by a man we&#8217;d later come to know as Andres.  Andres&#8211; owner of the campground, master of the stink eye.  His face seemed to be crusted over permanently by the salty air, like a weathered pirate.  He moved like rusted iron.  Oddly, I don&#8217;t think he was that old.</p>
<p>Our first night consisted of tired legs, coconut rum, an eight-foot alligator washing up on shore (alive), laughing with boisterous Colombians until Andres turned off all the lights in an effort to shut us up, and falling asleep in hammocks at 4 AM.</p>

<p><strong>Paradise and mosquitoes</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the next few days, my dear travel partner and I came to some uncomfortable conclusions regarding our tolerance for the outdoors.  After being ravaged by mosquitoes (I still look like I have the chicken pox), our romantic visions of taming the jungles of Santa Marta with naught but canned tuna began to fizzle.</p>
<p>But as sleepless as our nights may have been, the days were spectacular.  We hiked for hours from beach to beach, dipping in the water whenever we got too hot.  The waves were turquoise and surprisingly powerful.  The humid and buggy nights were alleviated by a few cold beers and still more boisterous Colombians (and Argentinians and Brazilians).</p>

<p><strong>Home Sweet Cartagena</strong></p>
<p>After hiking, swimming, and hammocking to our hearts&#8217; content, we left Parque Tayrona with lighter packs and sore quadriceps.  Finding our way back out of the park to a bus stop required walking several hours worth of trails through humid forests followed by a cramped taxi ride with two Australians.</p>
<p>By the time we climbed onto the bus in Santa Marta, the combination of my own stench and three days worth of sweaty clothes stewing in my pack was beyond repulsive; it was bordering on toxic.  I avoided making eye-contact with the people around us.  In retrospect, I probably should have apologized.  No one deserves to be stuck next to the stinky hippies on a four-hour bus ride.  Que pena.</p>
<p>And so we returned to Cartagena, surprisingly nostalgic for the home we&#8217;d only left for a few days.  Tayrona may be a permanent paradise for some (like Andres and the alligators), but I&#8217;ll stick with the magic of the walled city and air conditioning units for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://media.salon.com/2012/06/newsroom_rect-460x307.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img src="http://media.salon.com/2012/06/newsroom_rect-460x307.jpg" class="aligncenter" alt="Jeff Daniels stars" width="500" height="333"></a></div>
<p> I had some time to kill yesterday and decided that now was as good a time as any to catch up on HBO&#039;s &#8220;The Newsroom.&#8221; I remember seeing the previews and trailers for the show a couple of months ago during the runup to the premiere, and was quite excited about it&#039;s prospects. Jeff Daniels is a great actor; the kind that can hold up a show on his own. The subject matter was something that I can&#039;t get enough of; the behind the scenes workings of a television news program can&#039;t go wrong. And of course, it&#039;s coming to us from Aaron Sorkin, who&#039;s resume speaks for itself.</p>
<p>You&#039;ve got <em>The West Wing, Sports Night, Charlie Wilson&#039;s War, Moneyball, </em>and <em>The Social Network</em> as the proof that Sorkin&#039;s style of writing and vision is a delight to watch. The cadence and rhythm of the dialogue has practically become a language in itself; Sorkin-ese. I could sit down and watch two postal workers talk about their vacation plans if the conversation was penned by Sorkin.</p>
<p>But as the pilot got closer and closer, I began to hear rumblings that the show wasn&#039;t very good. In fact, some critics outright loathed it, which I found shocking considering the pedigree of those involved in its creation. But reading through the criticisms brought me to a point where in my head, I could envision exactly how &#8220;The Newsroom&#8221; would play out. Sorkin has a tendency to be overbearing and pretentious, and apparently that was just what happened.</p>
<p>I watched the first two episodes yesterday, and came away feeling incredibly frustrated; in theory there was an outstanding show just waiting to break out, but what the viewers got was essentially a one man screed against whatever pissed him off in the last 2 years of current events. </p>
<p>Sorkin has completely undermined the characters in &#8220;The Newsroom&#8221; by changing them for the purposes of single episodes. Emily Mortimer&#039;s character is supposedly this amazing producer who has spent years embedded in the Iraqi War, but cannot A. Manage simple technology, and B. Spends a ridiculous amount of time making sure that her staff knows that Will MacAvoy is an amazing man with a heart of gold. Could I buy that second point? Sure, but the problem is that MacAvoy is a jerk; I&#039;m not sure where this amazing person is buried. </p>
<p>The dialogue is classic Sorkin, but just laid on ridiculously thick. Mortimer&#039;s speech on how they can bring back the news to what it used to be is an amazing idea, and one I would fully support in the real world but my god NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT IN THE REAL WORLD! The advantage <em>The West Wing</em> had over &#8220;The Newsroom&#8221; was that the subject matter was dealing with the ideals of democracy and how government should run; such a tact is much more in line with grandiose speeches about ethics and morals. There were also fully fleshed out characters in Sorkin&#039;s other works; here I feel that there is a lack of substance amongst the entire cast. </p>
<p>I also must take issue with Sorkin&#039;s decision to use real world events in the show. Hindsight makes it very easy for Sorkin to ensure that the staff at the network covers each breaking story perfectly, with no repercussions whatsoever. The pilot covered the BP Oil spill, and in Sorkin&#039;s world this network was the only one who had the stomach/skill to cover it the &#8220;right way.&#8221; Every other network? Amateurs. Apparently this phenomenon gets worse with each passing episode, so I can only hope Sorkin eventually catches up to current events an makes up his own. The preaching and the high-mindedness might be less nauseating by that point.</p>
<p>I was incredibly disappointed by the first two episodes of &#8220;The Newsroom,&#8221; and I will not be watching the others. If the second season can somehow fix the major issues that plague the show I would be more than happy to reconsider my decision; and honestly it would not be difficult to makes the appropriate changes for this show. Sorkin needs to cut back on his worst habits; he&#039;s shown he is capable of doing this in the past and hopefully HBO sees this and brings him back to that point again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tree is wild. Who knows what it thinks?</p>
<p>I have been thinking about trees because I saw one last week. I startled a tree who startled me, and we exchanged a long glance.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/tree-stalker.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-856" title="I think it's following me. " src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/tree-stalker.jpg?w=280&h=210" alt="" width="280" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>If I were Annie Dillard, I would go on to discuss necessity, choice, and vocation. But I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>If I were JRRTolkien, I&#8217;d talk about trees as sentient beings, but moving with a glacial slowness.</p>
<p>If I were Ursula le Guin, I&#8217;d discuss the reactions of trees to cars passing.</p>
<p>If I were Joyce Kilmer, I&#8217;d tell you that &#8220;blogposts are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were Robert Frost I would bend birches and catapult myself to heaven, only to fall back to earth with a resounding whump, like Charlie Brown missing a football.</p>
<p>If I were Marge Piercy I would tell you of the limitless potential in a bonsai and the patriarchal pressure that trims it back, &#8220;the hands you love to touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were Madeleine Kahn, I would accuse men of having sex with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bonsai.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-855" title="Eighty feet tall, you say? " src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bonsai.jpg?w=200&h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I have always loved and longed for trees.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hugtree.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854" title="Love." src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hugtree.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>I wonder if trees have their prejudices: if fruit trees can go to the same parties as shade trees, and what would happen if a willow loved a pine.</p>
<p>I wonder if trees have parties, and if this is the real reason we call them Live Oaks.</p>
<p>I wonder if adolescent male trees make up stupid jokes about hardwoods.</p>
<p>I wonder if older trees lose track of dates and names, if they forget the faces of the birds and squirrels who have built homes in them.</p>
<p>I bet they remember the fires and the bolts of lightning. If they survive them.</p>
<p>I wonder if trees value the sweaters people knit for them. I wonder if they value the love that prompts the knitting.</p>
<p>I wonder how trees feel about grafts, and the indignity of being sold as something they are not. Home Depot&#8217;s Japanese flowering cherry trees are branches of the cherry grafted to a different trunk. I wonder how I would feel if someone replaced my arm with someone else&#8217;s, and how I would use the hand of a woman from Osaka.</p>
<p>I wonder if trees can feel me as I hug them, climb them, kiss them. I wonder if they take delight in dropping children to the ground, if they quietly enjoy the sound of bones breaking.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dressed-up-in-tree.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853" title="Maybe I should have taken her to the prom instead. " src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dressed-up-in-tree.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>I once planted a tree, but my older siblings ran over it with a lawn mower and it never grew.</p>
<p>My sister once nailed railroad spikes into a tree to form a ladder, so she could easily climb into its branches. The acorns that year swelled to three times their normal size.</p>
<p>The night of senior prom I climbed a tree in my suit while my date fretted over the potential damage to her brother&#8217;s tuxedo.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago a tornado went through my dad&#8217;s yard. The trees smashed his house and pickup truck. If he and my stepmother had been home, they would have been killed.</p>
<p>Evenings, I walk among trees and read de Quincey or Whitman. Sometimes I get through twenty or thirty pages. Sometimes I get through three or four. Sometimes I hold the book and think without reading at all. The trees make me feel isolated, protected, wrapped in their comforting silence, rapt in contemplation of their ineffable existences.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/0504121356.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-857" title="Not the trees behind the school, but the trees in the national forest have a similar effect." src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/0504121356.jpg?w=348&h=261" alt="" width="348" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>Trees always right themselves. If a tree is bent by a storm, she will grow new branches that point straight up. She will divert her body&#8217;s resources to one of those, which will become the new primary trunk of the tree. She will always grow toward the sun, seeking its light and life.</p>
<p>In a swamp, cypress roots need air, so they grow odd projections up through the water. We call them cypress knees because they look so bony and exposed, thrusting through the trouser leg of bark.</p>
<p>When a tree falls, new life will grow from the old. Sometimes you can see a young tree holding itself off of the ground with bowlegged roots, because its nurse log has already decomposed but its trunk hasn&#8217;t yet grown into the earth.</p>
<p>Trees are silently and slowly working toward our eradication. They break up our sidewalks and roads. They resist the permanence of concrete or pavement. They drop their seeds, and they keep growing and reproducing. I once had a neighbor who didn&#8217;t &#8220;care for&#8221; his yard, and the trees reinstated themselves, producing a layer of underbrush so that they could grow more effectively. Trees have never forgotten that the word for world is forest.</p>
<p><a href="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/treedestruction.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-852" title="Take that, stupid humans!" src="http://angryricky.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/treedestruction.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>We kill trees. We fear trees. We plant trees. We burn trees. We shred their bodies for our own sinister purposes. We worship trees. We hug trees. We study trees. We bring them into our homes and string them with electric lights and stale popcorn. We count their rings and consider their innermost privacy our privilege. But we can never really know or understand them. The trees remain inscrutable, out of reach. The lives of trees will always be secret.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish delight was always a mystery to me. When I was in elementary school I read about it in C.S. Lewis&#8217;s <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>. You know the story, yes? Edmund meets the White Witch while traipsing through the wintry Narnia. The Witch, representing all that is evil (of <em>course</em> satan is a woman duh), lures him in by offering the magical treat. Using the trick of every sidewalk crack dealer (or so I&#8217;ve heard) she gives him the first taste of Turkish delight for free. After that he can only get more if he does her bidding. A food powerful enough to make a kid sell his soul to the devil. Tell me more!</p>
<p>Now, as an ignorant young child the only turkey I knew of was the gobble-gobble kind we ate for Thanksgiving. Turkey the country? Nope, sorry. Never heard of it. It was only later when I was a bit older and received a globe for Christmas that I discovered there was a country named Turkey. Do they have a lot of turkeys there, I wondered? I thought it peculiar to name a country after a bird. Though not as peculiar as the country of Chad which happened to share the same name as a doofus boy in my class.</p>
<p>While I would grow up to become slightly more knowledgeable about many things, including geography, I read the <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> in my pre-globe era. Thus, I was consequently left with the lasting impression that this &#8220;turkish delight&#8221; must be tasty morsels of turkey <em>meat</em>. Sometimes at night, before I fell asleep, I salivated at the thought of this savory snack.</p>
<p>But it turns out it&#8217;s not meat at all. (You knew this already though, right? You are so much smarter than me!) While I&#8217;m sure I realized at some point that Turkish delight referred to some kind of food from the <em>country</em> of Turkey, I still didn&#8217;t really know what it was. In fact, I can neither confirm nor deny that it was not until I read this <a title="The Lion, the Witch, and the Really Foul Candy" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2005/12/the_lion_the_witch_and_the_really_foul_candy.html" target="_blank">Slate article published in 2005</a> (which would have made me, oh, about 26 years old) that I realized it was candy. Candy! Imagine that.</p>
<p>Anyway, even after reading the article I still had only a vague idea of what it was. So last week when I found myself traveling through Turkey (the <em>country</em>), I knew that trying this mysterious candy would be a top priority.</p>
<p>Have you tried it for yourself? No? Well, folks, I&#8217;m going to save you all the confusion I once experienced. I&#8217;m going to tell you exactly what it is:</p>
<p>Gumdrops and marshmallows. That&#8217;s it. Gumdrops and marshmallows.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s <em>good</em> gumdrops and marshmallows. When it&#8217;s fresh the little squares are squishy and soft. Though, as the article describes, they do also kind of stick to your teeth a bit, so if you have loose dental work I would recommend steering clear. But it&#8217;s tasty. Would I sell my soul to satan for more? No. But I did bring some back as gifts for my host mom and coworkers and it was a hit.</p>
<p>So here is a close-up for your viewing pleasure. Now you don&#8217;t have to live in the ignorance and confusion I once found myself. I feel good about pulling back the cover on this mysterious confection. It&#8217;s yeoman&#8217;s work, but important work. Enjoy!</p>
