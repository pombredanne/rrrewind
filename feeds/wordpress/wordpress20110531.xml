			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In hindsight, we probably should have known better than to take gardening advice from our alcoholic neighbor.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/vieques-garden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1155" title="Vieques garden" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/vieques-garden.jpg?w=250&#038;h=250" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>As you may recall, his English left a great deal to be desired, and our Spanish didn’t exactly qualify us for translating positions at the U.N.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/un-translator.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019" title="UN Translator" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/un-translator.jpg?w=102&#038;h=204" alt="" width="102" height="204" /></a>So what were we thinking?</p>
<p>Not much, apparently.</p>
<p>It happened like this.  We were standing at the rear of the house staring at the empty flower box, hoping, I suppose, for divine inspiration, when our neighbor shot out of his house like a (bow-legged) stunt man out of a cannon.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/shot-out-of-cannon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020" title="Shot out of cannon" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/shot-out-of-cannon.jpg?w=220&#038;h=146" alt="" width="220" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>“Hola,” he chortled.  “You make jardin?”</p>
<p>“Si,” we both admitted somewhat unenthusiastically.  In truth, we were convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that this man was both mentally defective and a hopeless drunk—what else could explain his permanent state of cheerfulness, his complete lack of inhibition, his casual friendliness?</p>
<p>Yes, I know what you’re thinking.  They’ve lived in the big city too long, they’re jaded, give the guy a break.</p>
<p>All very nice.</p>
<p>But you’re wrong.</p>
<p>Our neighbor was permanently sozzled.  You could see it in his crimson-flecked eyes, in his jaundiced skin, in the roaring sourness of his breath—and if you weren’t convinced by these subtle signs, there was always the fact that he stood on his roof in the morning and crowed with the roosters.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rooster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021" title="Rooster" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rooster.jpg?w=176&#038;h=173" alt="" width="176" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>“What you plant?” he asked now, sedately scratching his belly with one hand while digging around in his gap-toothed mouth with the index finger of the other.</p>
<p>“Well…” Michael began thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!” the man screamed, apropos of nothing.  Then he turned to me:  “Are you one hundred percent today?”</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/100-ii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022" title="100% II" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/100-ii.jpg?w=168&#038;h=169" alt="" width="168" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>“Si?” I hazarded, wondering what he could possibly mean.  “One hundred percent.”  I certainly wasn’t going to settle for anything less, whatever he was talking about.</p>
<p>This sent him into gales of uncontrollable laughter, punctuated by loud rat-a-tats of flatulence.</p>
<p>We edged slowly away.  Frankly I was tempted to run inside and bolt the door.</p>
<p>But then I noticed that his own garden was lush and reasonably well-tended, and it occurred to me that maybe he’d have some useful advice for us after all.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a try.  “What kind of plant would you put here?” I asked, pointing to the flower box.  “Aqui?”</p>
<p>“Aqui?” he repeated, drooling slightly.</p>
<p>“Si, aqui,” I said, pointing again.</p>
<p>He considered.  “Cactus!” he said emphatically.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/cactus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023" title="cactus" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/cactus.jpg?w=258&#038;h=196" alt="" width="258" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>“Or flores or ferns.”</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ferns.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" title="ferns" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ferns.jpg?w=273&#038;h=185" alt="" width="273" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>Even I, who had never cultivated anything more demanding than a Chia Pet, recognized the complete and utter uselessness of this advice.</p>
<p>“What grows in sunlight?” I prompted him.  “Sol.”</p>
<p>He rearranged his genitals and belched softly.  “Calathea.”</p>
<p>“Calathea?” I repeated.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/calathea1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1156" title="calathea" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/calathea1.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>“Si.”</p>
<p>Michael, looking vaguely encouraged by this scrap of information, took up my thread.</p>
<p>“Come,” he said, gesturing toward the side of the house.</p>
<p>Our neighbor instantly obeyed, propelling himself on surprisingly steady legs along the road and down into our driveway.  “Oh my god,” he muttered to himself as he bustled along.</p>
<p>“What do you plant without sun?” Michael asked.  “Sin sol?”</p>
<p>“Ah,” our neighbor replied, touching the side of his nose with his finger.  Hadn’t I seen Mafiosi perform this same gesture in countless Godfather-type movies?</p>
<p>Only I couldn’t recall its significance.  Arcane hand gestures had always baffled me—if you scratched your chin with the back of your hand you were disrespecting someone’s mother, and if you touched your eyebrow while tugging your earlobe you were suggesting group sex.  Or something like that.</p>
<p>“Heliconia,” the man said, winking ominously.</p>
<p><a href="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/heliconia1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1157" title="heliconia" src="http://viequesdreamhousediary.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/heliconia1.jpg?w=194&#038;h=259" alt="" width="194" height="259" /></a></p>
<p>“Good for no sun?”</p>
<p>“Si.”</p>
<p>After our neighbor had wreathed us in beery hugs and lumbered home for what would undoubtedly be his tenth or twelfth Medalla of the morning we rushed inside to write down his suggestions.</p>
<p>After all, there was a very remote possibility that he knew more about gardening than we did.</p>
<p>Which wasn’t saying much.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 538px"><img class="    " title="yeongeo chaek" src="http://anageonism.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_7250.jpg?w=528&#038;h=352" alt="" width="528" height="352" /><p class="wp-caption-text">English, you&#039;re lucky most of the things I like are in you.</p></div>
<p>I’ve never really thought about or appreciated the language I was born with. In high school and university, I had a lot of boring, pretentious conversations about different languages, and English was usually filed pretty low in the rankings. French and Spanish were romantic, Indian languages earthy and exotic; Japanese, Korean, Mandarin all alluring and bewildering beyond measure. I liked these other languages because I didn&#8217;t speak them, and thus they were somehow more fascinating or special than my own gutter tongue. I would never put work into learning any of them, because that would require effort and forethought and dedication, and all that stuff was for losers. I was to be stuck a unilingual, with the most boring language of all.</p>
<p><span id="more-656"></span></p>
<p>As a Canadian child, I endured numerous years of government mandated French instruction, which I abandoned as soon as I was legally able to. It was hard to nurse fantasies of French as a mysterious, fluttering language from afar when I had to actually speak it every day, and learn about the gendering of various sexless objects. During those years in school, French was basically English&#8217;s uncool relative, who I had to visit and play with because my parents thought French would be a good influence on me. When I ditched it, French  went back to being cool and aloof, and French speakers once again became silk-voiced soothsayers.</p>
<p>When I began to travel, the charm of foreign languages grew still greater. Fancy European people spoke Fancy European languages. They laughed and ate croissants and and fine cheeses straight from the teat, and drank wine by the riverside or downed immense tankards of stupendously good beer.  They hopped on trains and were in other worlds, completely unlike their own, immersed in still other cool, refined languages. Britain and Ireland at least had wacky accents to make their English slightly more suave than my flat, newscastery Canadian usage. Still later in Asia, the languages seemed almost otherworldly, as though wrought under the boiling sun and passed through alternate dimensions before finally arriving in human people&#8217;s mouths. They used writing systems completely different from anything I knew, they wrote in different directions across their pages, and their words spilled out in orders that I didn&#8217;t think possible.</p>
<p>It was easy to think of languages acquisitively, like cool accessories to don and impress others with. Whatever few piddling morphemes I managed to learn in the various other tongues, I generally employed with delirious elan. I liked to think I was in with the locals in some way, colluding with them, even if they were both unaware and not really in any place to give a shit what I was doing or saying. I wanted to be worldly and special and not rely on the boring language I spoke pretty well.</p>
<p>Moving to Korea, being surrounded by a language that was not my own, at first propelled this to greater heights. My Korean study is still a work in progress, but every step I&#8217;ve managed has made me feel more independent, more global, and also more ecstatically full of myself. But English here is foreign and alluring, and moreover a symbol of status. People want to speak it, but not in a way similar to how I&#8217;ve ever really spoken it before.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><img title="English jone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/5080746736_c721b53dc3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">All right, let&#039;s enunciate carefully.</p></div>
<p>It was only here that I started to notice how much I liked English.</p>
<p>On an average day, I interact thousands of English learners, both children and adults, and still others who aren&#8217;t really interested in English at all. My English, generally, is decimated from the way I usually speak it. I abandon huge swaths of my bountiful vocabulary, I utterly restructure my grammar, and I whittle away my meaning to the barest, bluntest points. I care about effective learning and communication with my students more than anything, so my English has spawned a more approachable sub-language. A Korean co-worker once asked me to speak at my regular pace, just to see how much she could catch of it. With trepidation, I spat out a flurry of English phonemes at about three-quarter speed, but stopped when her horror became too vivid. I speak a different kind of English language here, and just as often employ my laboured but economical Korean to do some of the communicative gruntwork.</p>
<p>Openly speaking whatever free-wheeling, fantastical sentences my brain could generate is something I had grown to take for granted. That others would understand my weird vocabulary, my whack sentence construction, my bizarro slang. That I could speak and be spoken to and not really worry about comprehension, and that I could speed and slur my words together until it was a phonetic mush and know that it would simply click for those around me.</p>
<p>I suddenly began to realize how valuable my English-speaking friends were. They were islands of comprehension where I never had to really think about my words, or carefully consider how I could pass along a message to them. My apartment grew to become an English oasis, where books, and movies, and music, and language all live. In there, I write out English in as fanciful and pretentious of tones as I desire. In there, everything makes sense in ways that I don&#8217;t even really need to think about.</p>
<p>English is in my brain. It&#8217;s what that internal voice in my head speaks; it&#8217;s the way I manage and process the world. It&#8217;s the language of the music I listen to, the books that I read, (many of) the people that I know and love. It&#8217;s the language that my mother read stories to me in. The language that I learned math, and science, and art in. The language that I learn other languages in. It flows from my mouth and hands without effort or care. I can make it do tricks in ways I can&#8217;t yet achieve in other tongues. With its ductility, I can mould, and contour, and forge words into strange new shapes and configurations. I can use it to make others happy, or sad, or want to laugh, and others can use it to do the same to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come to appreciate it in ways that I didn&#8217;t before, and also to appreciate what it means when others try to learn to speak it. To communicate to me in the language that is so comforting and easy to me, knowing that every flaw and error will be glaring. And how difficult it can be to try to speak outside of one&#8217;s own comfortable, safe, brain language. That my students, and many of my Korean friends,  try it every day with me is amazing: as basically the only person they use English to speak to, they risk a lot of face and put in a great deal of effort, speaking to me in a language so different from their own. And in turn, I understand why they are so happy, so amazed, and so appreciative when I try to return the favour.</p>
<p>English may not always be pretty. It&#8217;s basically the monstrous CHUD-baby of a dozen European-language gang-bang. For the last few centuries its been rampaging around the globe like a juggetnaut, pilfering vocabulary and grinding other languages to dust in its mighty, destructive jaws. But English made up my first words, it will probably make up my last, and its made up a great deal of the ones in the middle. For all its faults, I&#8217;ve come to love this great lumbering ape of a language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/po-4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1223" title="Po 4" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/po-4.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Buddha teaches that <a href="http://kadampalife.org/2011/04/26/am-i-dreaming/" target="_blank">everything is projected by our mind</a>; and of course this is clear when it comes to movies! But we like to be drawn into them as we like a good story, just as we usually allow ourselves to be sucked up by the drama of our own lives even if we know it is not real.</p>
<p>For me movies can be a time-wasting distraction or they can be helpful. It depends on whether I’m watching them out of some <a href="http://kadampalife.org/about/" target="_blank">delusion/unpeaceful mind</a> such as attachment or laziness, or out of some positive motivation such as the wish to expand my horizons to empathize with others.</p>
<p>Nothing is completely untransformable if we have the wish, capacity and methods to do it – even violent movies could be seen as a <a href="http://kadampalife.org/2011/05/02/wanted-dead-or-alive-our-anger-and-other-delusions%E2%80%A6/" target="_blank">battle against delusions</a>. Of course, it is risky to watch movies that may engender unpeaceful, uncontrolled reactions such as hatred or anger in us, so it is worth being honest to ourselves about our level of mindfulness and our ability to transform appearances to stay peaceful. It is worth protecting ourselves by not straying over certain boundaries (as in the practice of moral discipline).</p>
<p>If we’re going to watch a movie, some movies are probably easier for us to transform and derive meaning from than others, and I personally count <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> as an example. I watched it on the airplane and found a lot of uplifting Buddhist teachings in it. So I thought I’d share a few seeing as <em>Kung Fu Panda 2</em> is coming out on May 26 and no doubt some of you will be watching it, especially if you have the excuse of kids!</p>
<h5>Masters and students</h5>
<p><a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-oogway.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1225" title="Master Oogway" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-oogway.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>My favorite theme is the transformative relationships between the Masters and their students. The Panda Po says to Master Shifu, “You are not my master!”, but that changes when he believes he can learn to be a great Kung Fu warrior and that Master Shifu can teach him. Similarly, we only need a Spiritual Guide if we decide we want to follow in his footsteps along a spiritual path.</p>
<p>Shifu maintains great devotion to his own Master Oogway, even when he seems to be behaving erratically and appointing a very odd choice for the Dragon Warrior. He questions his Master but listens carefully to his replies and is inspired by them. “Obeying the master is not<a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tai-lung.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1226" title="Tai Lung" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tai-lung.jpg?w=150&#038;h=63" alt="" width="150" height="63" /></a> a weakness” says Shifu to the snow leopard Tai Lung. Tai Lung shows the treacherous contrast of what happens if we let our pride and self-cherishing run out of control, and how feeling superior to our own teacher inevitably ends up sooner or later in hubristic disaster.</p>
<h5>What can we control?</h5>
<p><a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-oogay-and-shifu.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1227" title="Master Oogway and Shifu" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-oogay-and-shifu.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>Master Oogway says we have to accept that we cannot control everything. Shifu replies that we can control some things and shows this by hitting the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom to get the peaches to fall and planting a peach seed from which a tree will grow. Master Oogway points out that we can only get a peach tree not an apple tree from that seed, teaching the definite relationship between cause and effect (karma). But then he shows the manner of passing away into the Dharmakaya Truth Body by dissolving into <a href="http://kadampalife.org/2011/04/26/am-i-dreaming/" target="_blank">emptiness</a>, showing that for whom emptiness is possible, anything is possible, as the famous Buddhist teacher Nagarjuna said.</p>
<h5>Just believe</h5>
<p>Po is lumbering and clumsy, at least for as long as he identifies with “me”, a limited self, in his case a big fat lazy Panda. But he doesn’t want to be “me” any more, he wants to change. And Master Oogway gives both Master Shifu and Po the <a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/po-31.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1229" title="Po" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/po-31.jpg?w=213&#038;h=134" alt="" width="213" height="134" /></a>confidence to <em>believe </em>in Po’s ability to do it, and believing is what <em>we</em> need to do if we are to let go of our ego, fulfill our potential and make spiritual progress. (However, unlike in the movie, we are all “chosen”). And Master Shifu also realizes there can be no cookie cutter approach to teaching one’s students, especially these days. The teacher and student sometimes need to think out of the box and find other ways, even if these are unconventional (and involve dumplings).</p>
<h5>Humility</h5>
<p><a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/furious-five1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1232" title="Furious Five" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/furious-five1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=127" alt="" width="300" height="127" /></a>Po’s humility is what enables him to succeed. He has an ingenuousness and zest for life that is very refreshing for the five great and good warriors who have gotten slightly institutionalized and by the book in the Jade Palace. Po is down to earth and unobsequious but at the same time entirely and humbly in awe of Kung Fu and its masters. For me he was an example of staying fresh on our spiritual path, devoted to the teachings, teachers and living beings but not rigidly going through the motions, becoming sycophantic and/or developing a superiority complex in an ivory tower. We need discipline, but we also need lightness of touch and the ability to respect each others&#8217; differences.</p>
<p><a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-shifu1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1233" title="Master Shifu" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/master-shifu1.jpg?w=180&#038;h=135" alt="" width="180" height="135" /></a>Even at the end when Po has defeated Tai Lung and the whole valley are prostrating to him and chanting “Master”, he doesn’t develop a trace of pride or identify with that praise. That word simply reminds him of his own master, so he turns around and rushes back up the steps to see him.</p>
<h5>What is the secret ingredient?</h5>
<p>And the other thing is that Po realizes something very important when he enters the <a href="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mr-ping1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1236" title="Mr. Ping" src="http://ilovekadampabuddhism.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mr-ping1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>mystery of the dragon scroll – <a href="http://kadampalife.org/2011/03/03/meditation-in-the-pursuit-of-happiness/" target="_blank">he does not need to add anything at all from the outside to fulfill his potential</a>. As his father, the goose Mr. Ping, finally confides about his Secret Ingredient Soup, the secret ingredient is …. that there <em>is</em> no secret ingredient! We don’t need a secret ingredient. We don’t need to be someone “special”. We all have the potential already to be great. This is our <a href="http://kadampalife.org/2011/04/20/how-to-avoid-stress-and-burn-out-at-work/" target="_blank">Buddha nature</a>.</p>
<h5>Movies and us</h5>
<p>Okay, I know, I have read far too much into this movie! And a cartoon to boot! But I guess that’s the point; we can and do see anything anywhere because nothing is really out there, it is all projection of our own minds. I cannot find a world outside of my experience of the world, and when I change my mind, my world itself automatically changes. In <a href="http://www.tharpa.com/us/book-Joyful.Path.of.Good.Fortune-587.html" target="_blank">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</a>, my own Master Geshe Kelsang says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Milarepa said that he regarded everything that appeared to his mind as a Dharma book. All things confirmed the truth of Buddha’s teachings and increased his spiritual experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if we are going to watch movies, we might as well make them into spiritual teachings!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Death of a Salesman is all about dreams and hopes. After reading this in class, I evaluated my own dreams and figured them all out. Take a gander then sort out your own life(:<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&amp;blog=256907&amp;post=370&amp;subd=freshlypressed&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In English class we are reading <em>Death of a Salesman</em> by Arthur Miller. It&#8217;s a really great play, but it&#8217;s hard to enjoy it when you have a bunch of 16-year-olds butchering it with their reading.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Death of a Salesman" src="http://ypsgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/death-of-a-salesman.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="182" /></p>
<p>The whole point of <em>DOAS </em>is this salesman, Willy Loman, who has started to really regret his life and not living up to his expectations. Willy wanted to be the most coveted family in New York, making lots of money, having a sports star son and knowing that his family would just be on top. Those things were on his bucket list. But Willy only gets failure in everything. Which really made me think.</p>
<p>The entire play makes me think about my own life. What are my plans for when I get out of high school? What is on my bucket list? What is my Willy Loman plan? After lots of thought, I made up this list of what I want to accomplish before I die.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to have lived in London, England for at least a year</li>
<li>I want to have written and published a book, which hopefully is a big seller</li>
<li>I want to get married to my soul mate</li>
<li>Children!</li>
<li>I want to have a great job working for a magazine (hopefully fashion)</li>
<li>I want to meet my grandchildren</li>
<li>I want to create a charity for people who don&#8217;t have enough self-confidence in themselves, called GIVE A DAMN (I will describe this idea in a later post)</li>
<li>I want to know that I&#8217;ve created a loving family</li>
<li>I want to have lived in New York City</li>
<li>I want to have an article published about me</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the things that I want more than anything. I want to have a great family and to have experienced the world. I want to have made a difference in people&#8217;s lives and finally live out my publishing dreams. I want so many things before I die. I want to say that, in my last few minutes of life, that I&#8217;ve accomplished everything I ever wanted. That I feel educated and experienced. When I die, I want no regrets.</p>
<p>So, Willy Loman, you inspired this thinking inside of me. Thank you for helping me realize my dreams and hopefully you have inspired others too. And for my readers, feel free to make your own bucket list and post it in the comments. Help Willy Loman help you! Thank you for reading.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align:left;">Welcome to the first of what I like to call the, “Let’s Talk About…” series.  For those who know me personally, it will not come as a surprise that I have a variety of incredibly random topics floating around in my head that I plan to delve into at some point or another.  Some serious, many frivolous, and a lot in between.  So, let’s get started, shall we?</div>
<p>Today’s topic:  Machetes.</p>
<div id="attachment_546" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2598.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-546" title="IMG_2598" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2598.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rule of Thumb: Two Machetes are Better than One</p></div>
<p>You say dangerous weapon most frequently found in slasher flicks.  I say super-useful accessory for only the most savvy third world dweller.</p>
<p>Case in point: Here in Nicaragua, machetes abound.  They are everywhere.  You literally cannot drive down the road without seeing machetes jauntily swinging from the belts of men, women, and – I’m not kidding – sometimes children.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the benefits of the machete:</p>
<p>1)      Machetes are cheap and readily available.  I did a bit of mystery shopping and the cheapest one I saw was US$2.84, and the most expensive was US$4.32.</p>
<div id="attachment_547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2639.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-547" title="IMG_2639" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2639.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Machetes: Cheaper than Toilet Paper</p></div>
<p>2)      Machetes are great for assisting with any and all sorts of manual labor, including but not limited to farming, construction, and slash-and-burn land clearing.</p>
<div id="attachment_549" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2526.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-549" title="IMG_2526" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2526.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Machetes: Helpful for Cutting Down All of those Pesky Trees that Keep Growing</p></div>
<p>3)      <a title="Darwin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" target="_blank">Darwin</a> tells us that only the strongest survive, and what better to enhance your chances of coming out on top in the process of natural selection than to carry the biggest machete that you could possibly find?</p>
<div id="attachment_543" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2455.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-543" title="IMG_2455" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2455.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This Machete is Practically a Sword. Do not Mess With This Guy.</p></div>
<p>4)      Machetes are great for hacking into any of the delicious-yet-hard-to-open fruits that are abundant in this neck of the woods.</p>
<div id="attachment_542" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_23991.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-542" title="IMG_2399" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_23991.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coconut + Machete = Refreshing Snack</p></div>
<p>5)      Going fishing? Don’t forget your machete!  You’ll need it to clean the fish.</p>
<div id="attachment_548" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2492.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-548" title="IMG_2492" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2492.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gone Fishing...With My Machete</p></div>
<p>6)      At times, life in the rural parts of Nicaragua (or any developing country, for that matter), can feel a bit like an episode of <a title="Man vs. Wild" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/man-vs-wild/" target="_blank">Man vs. Wild</a>.  What better to protect yourself with than an enormous machete?</p>
<div id="attachment_552" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2589.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-552" title="IMG_2589" src="http://mbadventure.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2589.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Say Hello to My Little...Machete</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, machetes are firmly positioned on the no-fly list, so I don’t think I’ll be able to make it back to the States with one.  However, I am sure there are more developing nations in this MBAdventurer’s future, and I feel fairly confident that my machete knowledge will serve me well.</p>
<p>I’m glad we talked about that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/y-falls-from-distance-fall-vert.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-255" title="Yosemite Falls across the Field, Fall" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/y-falls-from-distance-fall-vert.jpg?w=181&#038;h=300" alt="" width="181" height="300" /></a>When I think of the overwhelming majesty of Yosemite National Park, I cannot help but agree with Carl Sharsmith, a longtime Yosemite ranger.  When a park visitor asked what Carl would he do if he only had one day in Yosemite. Carl replied, “I’d go sit by the Merced River and cry!”  And he was right:  There may never be enough time to see all the grandeur of the Yosemite, in all its wonder.  But however much time you have to spend, Yosemite National Park is worth the trip.  It does not matter what season.  Every experience—taking a sunrise walk with a ranger, strolling through the rain on a chilly fall afternoon, picnicking along the Merced in the summer, being surprised by the mist coming off Bridalveil Falls, noticing deer or coyote across a field, or marveling at wildflowers as they come to life after a spring shower—adds to the tapestry that is Yosemite.  Each experience is its own unique treasure.</p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/road-thru-trees-fall-colors.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-259" title="Main Drive thru Yosemite Valley, Autumn Colors" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/road-thru-trees-fall-colors.jpg?w=209&#038;h=300" alt="" width="209" height="300" /></a>Although I grew up in California, my first visit to Yosemite was as an adult in October 1989.  I was attending a conference, so was able to enjoy the park through small excursions around the meetings and dinners that were part of the event. Since then, I have returned to Yosemite many times, in all seasons.  But I will always remember the gray skies and subdued autumn colors of that first visit.</p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rocky-merced-view-fall-colors.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-260" title="View from Merced River, Autumn" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rocky-merced-view-fall-colors.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300" alt="" width="214" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>A BIT OF HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>By the time of my first trip, the Tunnel Tree in the Mariposa Grove had already collapsed and Mirror Lake was drying up rather quickly, but most of the wonders of the 1200 square mile national park were still available for visitors thanks in good part to the preservation efforts of John Muir, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. In 1833, white explorers first discovered the gorgeous Yosemite Valley that was home to Indians for years and years, but full exploration did not begin until 1851. By 1855, the first tourist groups descended on the Valley, and speculators started considering ways to exploit the area’s natural resources.</p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/yosemite-graphic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-269" title="Yosemite Graphic" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/yosemite-graphic.jpg?w=300&#038;h=95" alt="" width="300" height="95" /></a>John Muir, always a friend to Yosemite, made extensive pleas to preserve the area in its natural state. In 1864, Lincoln signed the act that ceded Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to California as a public park. In 1890, the land around Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove were made a national park.  Finally, in 1906, California gave its portion of Yosemite to the United States, and Yosemite National Park was formed. In 1913, a controversial decision was made to dam the Tuolumne River to create the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to provide drinking water for San Francisco; the project was completed in 1923.  Although less spectacular than Yosemite Valley, the Hetch Hetchy Valley had been impressive, and its flooding to create the reservoir is still mourned and contested by many.</p>
<p><strong>SOME FAVORITE YOSEMITE VIEWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/glacier-point-dramatic-overlook.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-270" title="Glacier Point Dramatic Overlook" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/glacier-point-dramatic-overlook.jpg?w=300&#038;h=218" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a>Over the years, I have visited Yosemite National Park many times. Although a visit any time of the year is wondrous, I tend to avoid the summer—it is just too crowded! My favorite destination is Yosemite Valley, but I have explored other areas as well, including trips to Tioga Pass, Tuolumne Meadows, and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. On my trips I usually do not wander too far off the beaten path because of some health and mobility limitations. That means I will never see everything the park has to offer, but I can experience quite a bit.  For example, I will never hike to Vernal and Nevada Falls or up the back way to Glacier Point, which reaches a staggering height of 7,214 feet.  But I can drive to the <strong>Glacier Point Lookout</strong>, once the road opens each spring.  From that view, it is easy to see why John Muir offered the following conclusion:  “The most striking and sublime features on the grandest scale is the Yosemite.”</p>

When the sun breaks through, it is magnificent. <a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fallen-log-spring-in-yosemite.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-274" title="Fallen Log, Spring, Yosemite" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fallen-log-spring-in-yosemite.jpg?w=186&#038;h=300" alt="" width="186" height="300" /></a><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fallen-log-with-snow-in-yosemite.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-275" title="Fallen Log, Winter, Yosemite" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fallen-log-with-snow-in-yosemite.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300" alt="" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The more I visit Yosemite, the more I realize that it is a mercurial place, changing its mood and personality with each season. The crowds and weather also contribute to the subtle distinctions that make each visit special. Over the years, it is the contrast apparent from one visit to the next that stands out for me, even in something as simple as a fallen tree in the meadow.  The contrasts apparent in some of the major features of the Valley are even more impressive. </p>
<p><strong>El Capitan</strong> is a granite monolith that rises 3600 feet above the Merced River, but at times it is obscured by fog. </p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/el-capt-clear-view.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-276" title="El Capitan, Clear View" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/el-capt-clear-view.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/el-capt-in-fog-v.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-277" title="El Capitan, Fog " src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/el-capt-in-fog-v.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a></p>

The Falls plummet a total of 2,245 feet in stages and are designated as the Upper and Lower Falls. At the falls, the water’s power and majesty can be felt. </p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/clothespine-tree.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-285" title="Clothespine Tree, Mariposa Grove" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/clothespine-tree.jpg?w=196&#038;h=300" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>If you have never visited the <strong>Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias</strong>, make the time to stop at least once.  You will discover over 500 mature giant sequoias.  Many of these trees are over 3,000 years old.  The largest one is 290 feet tall and 40 feet in diameter. There is a tram ride and an easy trail that allow visitors to mingle with the trees. </p>

It is a great story that explains many of the topographical features of the Valley. The story also stresses the human connection to the area and reminds us all that we should be guardians of the valleys and mountains around us. </p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/half-dome-from-top-view-v3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-299" title="Half Dome, Tissiak's Face Side View" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/half-dome-from-top-view-v3.jpg?w=213&#038;h=300" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a>Here is the <strong>Legend of Tissiak</strong> as I recall it:  The first couple, Tissiak and Nangus, was traveling into the Valley from the East.  As usual, Tissiak was playful and impulsive and ran off from Nangus.  In his frustration, Nangus started beating Tissiak to make her stay by his side. The Great Spirit intervened and placed Tissiak into the mountains where she would always be safe.  Can you see her face on the side of Half Dome?  The papoose she was carrying became the Royal Arches opposite her, and her tears filled Mirror Lake.  Her bread basket toppled and became the dome above the Arches. Her scattered, broken loaves of bread took root as pine trees throughout the Valley. The Great Spirit broke Nangus’ staff and sent him off alone, but not before giving him a love and understanding of the landscape around him. The point of his staff became the Lost Arrow Spire near Yosemite Falls. Wherever the broken staff pieces fell, giant redwoods sprang up.  </p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bridal-beil-closer-view-v.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-292" title="Bridalveil Falls, Close View " src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bridal-beil-closer-view-v.jpg?w=149&#038;h=300" alt="" width="149" height="300" /></a>It is an easy hike to <strong>Bridalveil Falls,</strong> another of the famous locations within Yosemite Valley. Depending on the season and the year’s rainfall, you could experience a trickle of water or downpour as the falls plunge 620 feet.  The Yosemite Indians (Ahwahneechee) called this place Pohono, the spirit of the puffing wind. If a breeze picks up, you are likely to get drenched as the spirit races by. </p>

They quench our thirst. They carry our canoes and feed our children. . . . and you must henceforth give the rivers the kindness you would give any other brother.”  A visit to Yosemite would not be complete without some sort of interaction with the Merced, whether that be picnicking along its shores or wading into the shallows to cool off in the summer.</p>

Once there, you will understand why W. E. Dennison, guardian of the Yosemite State Grant, named the place as he did. He states, “No one can visit them without for the while forgetting the grinding strife of his world and feeling happy.”  On one of my visits, I spent a good part of the afternoon watching an American Dipper playing in the water.  This bird is a wonder, the only North American aquatic song bird that catches water bugs by <em>walking</em> underwater on the river bottom.</p>

We did not do much hiking, but we did enjoy the quiet and the solitude and shared some time with a couple coyotes that were out hunting in a snow-covered field.</p>

I called the Ahwanhee Hotel on a lark only to discover they did have a room available because of a last-minute cancellation.  This hotel is usually booked months and months and months in advance.  Upon my arrival, I was greeted by some friendly deer and found many water lilies blooming in the hotel’s outdoor fountain. But the next morning, the weather was overcast and dreary, unexpected for a spring day. The air was heavy with the expectation of rain. But the rains came quickly, and left just as fast.  With the returning sunshine, I was surprised by the splashes of color evident everywhere I looked. Dogwood was in bloom along many pathways, and I also spied Wild Iris, Western Wallflowers, and Snow Plants.  It was a glorious spring adventure! </p>

<p><strong>THE SPIRIT OF JOHN MUIR</strong></p>
<p>Isn’t Yosemite National Park grand?  I really wanted to visit Yosemite this month. With all the rains California received this year, I figured the wildflowers would be gorgeous.  Unfortunately, I have too many commitments right now that keep me from making such a trip. That’s part of the reason I am writing this blog about Yosemite—it lets me take a virtual trip!  If you have visited before at least once, you know what I mean about its wonders.  If you’ve never visited, add a &#8220;Trip to Yosemite&#8221; high on your Bucket List. </p>
<p><a href="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/john-muir-drawing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-330" title="John Muir, drawing" src="http://learnmoreeveryday.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/john-muir-drawing.jpg?w=203&#038;h=300" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a>When you go, keep yourself open to communing with the spirit of John Muir.  He loved Yosemite and protected it for most of his life. One year, a ranger pointed out a pale splotch on the rock face near Yosemite Falls. He explained that a recent rock slide in that area had left that mark, where the rocks had given way.  He claimed, if you looked closely, you would see the silhouette of John Muir’s face, watching the falls he so loved.  I was doubtful, but when I looked, I did think I could see his face, there, in the rock.  Can you see him?  </p>

<p align="center"><em>“As long as I live, I’ll hear water-falls and birds and winds sing.  I’ll interpret the rocks. Learn the language of the flood, storm, and the avalanche. I’ll acquaint myself with the glaciers and wild gardens, and get as near the heart of the world as I can.”  </em>John Muir<em></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We made it back in a 1988 Subaru DL wagon, all the way from Alaska to Vermont with no GPS (not really a problem since we drove on the same road for half the trip) and no cruise control (a bit more of a problem since our right butt-cheeks got sore from continual pressing on the accelerator).  Besides the engine&#8217;s tendency to overheat, causing us to always have the heat on and the windows rolled down a bit, the trip was smooth&#8211;especially after buying two new tires in Whitehorse.</p>
<p>The day before we left Fairbanks, we decided to honor our love through marriage, so on the morning we left the Viking Lodge, we drove back through Tok and, with the town librarian and judge&#8217;s assistant as our witnesses, we said our vows and became husband and wife.</p>
<p><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1610.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-292" title="dsc_1610" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1610.jpg?w=300&#038;h=292" alt="" width="300" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>The road trip turned into our honeymoon, and as we traveled through the yukon, Jasper and Banff, Idaho, down into Southern Utah, across Colorado and Kansas, and all the way to the east, we reveled in the landscape and sank deeper into our love.</p>
<p>As we drove we saw birds: osprey, bald eagles, ferruginous hawks, geese, arctic tern, grouse, magpies, ravens, chickadees, red-winged blackbirds, swans, ducks, a boreal owl, peregrine falcons, gray jays, blue jays, woodpeckers, red-tailed hawks, and more we left unidentified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1904.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-293 aligncenter" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1904.jpg?w=300&#038;h=126" alt="" width="300" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>We saw animals: buffalo, moose, elk, caribou, deer, a black wolf, gray fox, coyotes, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and wild horses.</p>
<p><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1733.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-294" title="" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1733.jpg?w=300&#038;h=140" alt="" width="300" height="140" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1775.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-295" title="dsc_1775" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1775.jpg?w=300&#038;h=219" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>At night we seeked out campgrounds, or took a few turns down quiet roads to hidden pull-offs where we could park for the night.  In the morning we made chai, ate granola, and packed the car again for the next leg of the journey.  Our days were casual with steady driving and spontaneous stops to look at birds, take pictures and stretch our legs.</p>
<p><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1823.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-296" title="" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_1823.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>We spent two days in Southern Utah hiking and climbing before making the final push home, aided with chocolate and maple syrup.</p>
<p><a href="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_2164.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-299" title="" src="http://kathrynspring.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc_2164.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Now we are back in Vermont, living and working on <a title="Applecheek Farm" href="http://www.applecheekfarm.com/" target="_blank">Applecheek Farm</a> in Hyde Park.  In the first week we have milked cows, witnessed the birthing of calves, been pooped and peed on, put up a yurt, planned our bean and corn plantings, waited out the rain so we can plow the field, and become part of the daily chore rotation.  As the season progresses, we will also be helping to develop the farm&#8217;s educational programs, sell food at markets, work in the 2-acre vegetable garden, and of course, with all this milk, we will make ice cream.</p>
<address>I am happy.  I am so happy.</address>
<address>To be living in a yurt.</address>
<address>To be living on a farm.</address>
<address>To be living with my love~</address>
