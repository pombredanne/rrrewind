				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear People of the Internet,<a href="http://whatasillygirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/shy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-754" alt="shy" src="http://whatasillygirl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/shy.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m back!  Don&#8217;t get giddy just yet, but I may have something interesting to say.  Maybe.  It has been six months since that has happened and I may have forgotten what interesting things look like.  This could be related to the fact that it has been nine months (NINE MONTHS?!) since I&#8217;ve had sex.  I could have grown a whole person by now!  Instead I have acquired two cats, which is merely a coincidence, I assure you.  I would like to have reported this interesting situation at a more Godly hour, but I accidentally fell asleep at 9 pm while putting my three year old to bed.  Alas, one of the many pitfalls of parenting.  And so I present to you: The Situation<em> (with a conspicuous absence of abs, though I&#8217;m sure I have some under all this ice cream)</em>.</p>
<p>Remember those times in your life when you were simply mad about someone, probably from the first moment you met, but that person never returned your feelings?  Rhett M., fourth grade.  John R., eleventh grade.  Justin W., college.  I&#8217;m certain you&#8217;ve just made a similar list in your head.  I hate unrequited love.  It&#8217;s the most horrible fate a heart can endure.  I&#8217;d rather go through 10,000 breakups than spend my life hopelessly in love with a man who would never love me back.  <em>(Oh Johnny Depp, when will you return my calls??)</em>  Right now I am on the other side of that equation.  I&#8217;m sure this has happened at some other point in time (Prom Date, high school) but this is the first time I have encountered this situation as an adult.</p>
<p>When I began work at an overpriced clothing store last November I met a man who told me his name a few too many times and said good-bye standing awkwardly outside my car.  I knew right then that he found me attractive, that he was younger than I am, and that he had no idea how to ask me out.  Since that time I&#8217;ve learned that he is in fact three years younger, but he&#8217;s about as emotionally evolved as that guy I went to prom with <em>(what the hell was his name??)</em>.  In fact, let&#8217;s call this guy Spanky.  If he were a dog he would most certainly be a terrier.  Anybody remember Wishbone, the book-loving Jack Russell circa 1998?  Anyway.  He&#8217;d jump up and down at you, eat your shoes and pee in the house, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to get rid of the damn thing because it was cute and you knew that it meant well.  Unlike Wishbone, who was a genius.  I don&#8217;t dislike Spanky as such, but he does not appeal to my sapiosexual instincts and nothing about him says Future Father of My Child.  Normally I&#8217;d give him a polite no thank-you, but&#8230;  I don&#8217;t know.  Don&#8217;t you ever just want to punch Karma in the face?  What would happen if unrequited love got what it wanted just this once?  Would that really be so terrible?</p>
<p>Fact is, I haven&#8217;t exactly got much going on right now.  I&#8217;ve had many offers for dates on OKCupid, but nothing to write home about.  Except that one guy.  He was perfect.  Smart, cute, college professor, sarcastic and clever, and we never met.  We had a bit of wonderful banter about apes and poetry and the next thing I knew his profile had been deactivated.  It was a sad day for this <span style="color:#800000;">silly girl</span>.  He was PERFECT.  Then there was the fellow I met at my Masters conference in Chicago.  He was also all of those things, except he worked in a home for behaviorally challenged teens.  He made me laugh every single day, abhorred the idea of men treating women as objects, and sang karaoke just to make me happy.  But he&#8217;s married with an infant son.  Again, sad.</p>
<p>So what if this time around I decide to make someone happy?  Would that be such a terrible thing?  I think Spanky is something of an idiot, but maybe I&#8217;m wrong.  And just because someone is an idiot, that doesn&#8217;t mean he can&#8217;t be fun to hang out with or good in bed.  The only tricky bit is the coworker aspect.  If things go south (not in a good way, wink wink) then I will still have to see him at work.  I can keep my shit together, but can he?</p>
<p>I told my boss about it (who is a whole other story) and he laughed and said next Spanky was going to bring me an apple.  He&#8217;d hold it out, sheepishly grinning at the floor, and then run away.  I see his point.  Spanky is not the most mature of souls and this has all been very seventh grade in nature.  I half expect to find a note in my locker that says, &#8220;Do you like me?  Check yes or no.&#8221;  Meanwhile I&#8217;m over here calculating how proficient he would be in the sack.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get real people.  Romance is the last thing on my mind.  I&#8217;ve been unsuccessfully trying to check &#8220;one night stand&#8221; off my bucket list for the past month, but this is not a hit it and quit it situation.  I&#8217;d rather not have someone muttering &#8220;bitch&#8221; every time I passed through the men&#8217;s department, but I may not be giving him enough credit.  Oh, hell.  Let&#8217;s throw caution to the wind, shall we?  Let&#8217;s give unrequited love the shot it has always wanted!  Let&#8217;s spread a little happy at the risk of future disappointment!  I mean, what&#8217;s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Brrr.  Anyone else feel that chill go down their spine?</p>
<p>Fate-temptingly yours,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://therealfullhouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/xmas-at-disney-ham-family.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4044" alt="Xmas at Disney, Ham Family" src="http://therealfullhouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/xmas-at-disney-ham-family.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>It may not be the big things in life that you&#8217;re most remembered for.  Three years ago today, my wife died peacefully at Duke Medical Center.  Last night, I asked the kids what they most remembered about mom.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t her leadership in the community or the fact that she spearheaded the effort to build their new school.  It wasn&#8217;t her accomplishments at the Jr. League or the vision she shared on the church building committee.  What they remembered most were the small things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom always wanted to shop at <em>Harold&#8217;s</em> at the mall.  As soon as she was finished shopping, she&#8217;d take us to the candy store right by the escalators.  I looked forward to that every time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweet memories.  Sweet,  sweet memories.</p>
<p>She drank diet Dr. Pepper.  Her fingernails were impeccable.  Once she got addicted to Afrin &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t leave the house without it!</p>
<p>She&#8217;d only listen to one type of music at a time &#8211; winter often brought country, the summer was pop.  You didn&#8217;t even think about changing the Christmas station from November 1st on.</p>
<p>She was a stickler for tradition &#8211; chili and cornbread on Christmas Eve and the song &#8220;Almost Heaven, West Virginia&#8221; as we drove over the mountain to our August getaway at Capon Springs.</p>
<p>One of the things that they miss the most is her back scratches.  &#8220;Dad, you don&#8217;t have fingernails.  Mom scratched.  You give a nub rub.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of trying to change the world, maybe I should just grow my fingernails out and take more visits to the candy store.  In the end, maybe that&#8217;s what counts the most.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_138" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/zach-and-dusty.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-138" alt="Zach and Dusty, 1994" src="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/zach-and-dusty.jpg?w=640&#038;h=596" width="640" height="596" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zach and Dusty, 1994</p></div>
<p>One day, about fifteen years ago, my mom realized that their beloved dog, Dusty, was missing. He was the sweet Springer Spaniel my parents had adopted as a puppy after my sister and I left home. He was smart and gentle&#8211;a great companion to my younger brother as a teenager, and a patient playmate for the grandkids that came in quick succession during the 1980&#8242;s.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget the panic I heard in my mom&#8217;s voice on that fateful day when she called to say that Dusty had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you see him last?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we got home from the store. He ran out and greeted us as usual, but that was hours ago and we haven&#8217;t seen him since. He&#8217;s not in the yard, anywhere. I&#8217;ve called and called for him&#8211;even went into the woods, but there&#8217;s just no sign of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom was really upset. Dusty was Mom&#8217;s constant companion during the day, and Dad&#8217;s walking partner in the evenings. He had eased their transition to empty-nesters by simply being his friendly self.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;s not in the house, hiding somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve searched every room, and besides that, he always comes when I call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s run off, farther away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already driven up and down the road for miles and called and called, but nothing. I&#8217;ve talked to all the neighbors and they haven&#8217;t seen him.&#8221; Her voice broke, making my heart hurt for her. &#8220;Oh, Willow&#8211;I hope he&#8217;s okay!&#8221;</p>
<p>I hung up the phone, feeling helpless from my distant location on the other end of Montana. All I could do was pray.</p>
<p>The next morning, I awoke thinking of Dusty.</p>
<p>The phone rang a little while later. &#8220;He&#8217;s back! Dusty&#8217;s here!&#8221; Mom&#8217;s tone was jubilant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was he? How did you find him?&#8221; I asked.<a href="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/old-nissan.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-139" alt="old nissan" src="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/old-nissan.jpg?w=150&#038;h=69" width="150" height="69" /></a></p>
<p>Mom giggled in a rather odd way and then hesitated. She cleared her throat before going on to tell me that prior to leaving for work that morning, Dad had opened the trunk of their little Nissan sedan to put something in and out jumped Dusty. It seems he had been in the trunk of the car all along. For something like a terrible eighteen hours.</p>
<p>Apparently, Dad had walked by the car after unloading it the day before and closed the trunk lid without looking inside it. Looking back, he figured Dusty must have jumped inside, but didn&#8217;t protest when the lid slammed down. Dad and Mom both felt horrible.</p>
<p>Especially considering that the whole evening before, while they were driving the back roads, searching the ditches and calling for him from the car windows, the dog was right there&#8211;right behind the back seat, in the trunk. Being a patient fellow, he hadn&#8217;t made a noise, at least nothing that could be heard above the hum of the engine.</p>
<p>My parents&#8217; immense relief was mixed with immense guilt. They might as well have been Mafia bosses driving around with a silenced informant stuffed in their trunk.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>The Pharisees, along with all the Jewish people, were watching and waiting for the arrival of the long-predicted Messiah. They were desperate for God to raise up a mighty leader who would deliver them from Roman oppression and re-establish the nation of Israel as a kingdom under a Messianic kingship. As a defeated people, the Jews were expecting a political reformer to lead them to national victory, not a humble carpenter&#8217;s son who, shunning politics, was there to lead them to spiritual freedom.</p>
<p>And so it was, when Jesus came and lived among them, most of the Jews (especially the Pharisees) refused to believe that he was the one they were looking for. But Jesus stated his identity plainly from the beginning of his ministry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached&#8230;&#8217;The time promised by God has come at last!&#8230;&#8217;The Kingdom of God is near!&#8217;&#8221; Mark 1:14-15 (NLT)</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the Pharisees asked Jesus, &#8216;When will the Kingdom of God come?&#8217; Jesus replied, &#8216;The Kingdom of God can’t be detected by visible signs. You won’t be able to say, ‘Here it is!’ or ‘It’s over there!’ For the Kingdom of God is already among you. &#8220;&#8216;Luke 17:20-21 (NLT)</p>
<p>Of course, most of the Pharisees were blind and deaf to Jesus&#8217; truth. Rather than humbly opening themselves up to the possibility that their presumptions regarding the Messiah&#8217;s return were too narrow, they dug in, refusing to see Jesus as anything but a threat to their authority.</p>
<p>In the end, their search for something they already had would result in Jesus&#8217; agonizing death.</p>
<p>Dusty, too, would have eventually died if Mom and Dad hadn&#8217;t discovered that, all along, while they were diligently and frantically searching for him, he was right there with them&#8230;only a few feet away.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>One of the more aggravating symptoms of my Pharisaism disease was a bout of unhealthy expectations. Most likely related to the larger problem of presumption, these expectations became chronic and damaging over time. They caused me to narrow my perspective on the purpose of church, and caused me to expect that the way I did church was the way that God had universally prescribed for all Christians.</p>
<p><a href="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/martintown-church.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-140" alt="martintown-church" src="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/martintown-church.jpg?w=300&#038;h=221" width="300" height="221" /></a>I expected that every church should be housed in a clean, respectable facility, should conduct regular Sunday morning services, should have pleasing worship music, should insist on literal word-for-word bible studies, and be led by a qualified, professional pastor. Anything less could put its members in danger of heresy, or apostasy, or any number of other dangerous conditions ending in -sy.</p>
<p>I expected that the kingdom of God was populated with committed, sober, upright people whose good behavior was the vehicle that allowed them to bring Jesus to their community. That it was every Christian&#8217;s duty to whip our culture back into shape&#8211;to get people to all live respectably, as I defined respectability, that is.</p>
<p>I fully expected that the American Christian Church model was the only true representation of God&#8217;s kingdom to society and I needed to do everything right in order to keep God&#8217;s displeasure with America at bay, and then be first in line to receive my reward for doing so.</p>
<p>The problem was, though, that I wasted a ton of time preparing for something that had already arrived.</p>
<p>I was driving around in my religious institutional vehicle, calling out for Jesus, searching for him, longing for him to come and show himself to the pagan culture, not realizing that he was already with me and everyone else.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize I had locked him up inside my sick presumptions.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Concerning the whole Dusty ordeal, Mom later said the worst part was hoping the neighbors wouldn&#8217;t press for specifics when they asked if the dog had been found. Dad said the worst part for him was when the the poor dog leapt out of the trunk and started running around on three legs so he could pee while still running. Practically flooded the yard, Dad reported.</p>
<p>But everything turned out okay in the end. Dusty survived just fine.<a href="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/running-dog.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-141" alt="running-dog" src="http://thephariseeinme.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/running-dog.jpg?w=720"   /></a></p>
<p>And, as a diseased church person, so did I&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;but only after I opened my mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, Marissa Mayer disappoints me. Yahoo just announced that employees would no longer be permitted to work from home as of June.</p>
<p>This signals a major step backwards for working parents. If a typical male technology CEO made this decision, there would be outrage, of course. But to come from a new mother  who is a CEO? It feels like a sucker punch – and hardly believable. Yet there it is.</p>
<p>There are many industries where you must be at work in person, but technology is not one of them.  As a marketing consultant to an international software company, I have worked both remotely and in the office. There are definitely professional and social benefits to being in the office, but I have found that the physical location of my workspace does not affect my productivity or creativity.</p>
<p>Today, I work exclusively from home. I use my time efficiently, and more so than when I went to an office every day.  My nanny watches my three-year old daughter while I work from a quiet room.  I use conference calls, video conferencing, and email to work with colleagues all over the globe, because hardly any of my coworkers are concentrated in one location. When we need to meet in person, we travel to our home office or meet in a large city.</p>
<p>And while I may grouse about the typical small things of daily work life, the truth is that I feel incredibly blessed and grateful to be able to work without worrying about my child. I am a better, more focused, more productive employee for it. I can contribute to the economy and be a good parent. This is not about waiting for the cable guy. I actually get annoyed with the cable guy, because he interrupts my work day. But let’s be honest &#8211; the chatty gal on her phone in the next cube also interrupts my work day.</p>
<p>If Ms. Mayer believes that Yahoo has been too permissive and that she has to shake up the culture to get the engines of growth and creativity revving, surely there are more effective ways to do it. If the company does have that many human dust bunnies working from home, it sounds like there are serious cultural and managerial problems at Yahoo that won’t be solved with this blunt instrument.</p>
<p>I fail to see how forced face time will create accountability and engender the fresh energy she wants to bubble up and transform Yahoo. In fact, it has a high probability of backfiring, with resentful, angry employees who find subtle and clever ways to sabotage this new policy. She’ll lose a lot of the fat she doesn’t have the guts to fire, but she’s going to lose a lot of good people who have weathered the storms at Yahoo so far.</p>
<p>Yahoo is a behemoth, and it will take big decisions to start turning the ship. I understand that. But I can’t help but question the wisdom of this move. In the short term, it earns her marks for boldness as a new CEO. Wall Street is probably high fiving right now.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, she still has to convince me that she is a visionary business leader who understands that creativity can’t be clustered in a cubicle from eight to six daily.  </p>
<p>She has convinced me, however, that working parents should not expect any trailblazing from her, and in fact, she is going to fill in the path behind her.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hennessy-wild-rabbit_560-1.jpg"><img src="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hennessy-wild-rabbit_560-1.jpg?w=720" alt="HEN_2961_WR_GQ_DPS.indd"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7029" /></a><br />
&#8220;if you go chasing rabbits&#8230;you know you&#8217;re going to fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What’s your wild rabbit?” is the enigmatic question posed in Hennessy’ ad campaign from revered agency Droga5. I’ve seen these ads for some time now on marquee billboards, in national magazines, even as films.  And while I admire agency and client for going all-in with a high concept (clients typically insist on showing drinkers drinking) I don’t get it. Not really.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, on a poetic level I know what the copy is saying: that the “wild rabbit” is a metaphor for your passion. And, because liquor ads are never wrong about these things, we’re supposed to find ours. Masculine icons like filmmaker Martin Scorsese (<em>Raging Bull, Taxi Driver</em>) and fighter Manny Pacquiao reveal what their wild rabbits are. In some ads the body copy overtly describes what the “wild rabbit” is: “It’s the voice that keeps you up at night…lurking in the corner.” </p>
<p><a href="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hennessy-wild-rabbit_560-2.jpg"><img src="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hennessy-wild-rabbit_560-2.jpg?w=720" alt="hennessy-wild-rabbit_560-2"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7031" /></a></p>
<p>Yikes! Given all that lurking who wouldn’t need a drink?</p>
<p>Joking aside, I cannot salute this creative flag. (I want to. For its chutzpa alone.) Yet for me this is a well-hit ball that just goes foul.</p>
<p>Chasing rabbits seems like pipe dreaming. It evokes the notion of big plans gone to seed. Of men sitting in dark corners getting hammered and talking about tomorrow. But tomorrow never comes, does it? Just despair. That’s what I get when I take in these melancholy photographs and the dark prose. Are we not taught to avoid going down rabbit holes?</p>
<p>In the famous movie <em>Harvey</em>, Jimmy Stewart plays an alcoholic with an imaginary rabbit for a friend. He’s found his wild rabbit and it leads to the booby hatch. Some years later Grace Slick warned us about chasing rabbits in her iconic song <em>White Rabbit</em> about a bad acid trip. In the context of booze advertising, don&#8217;t rabbits seem wildly inappropriate? In addition, every time I hear the phrase “wild rabbit” I think of Wild Turkey bourbon. That can’t be good for business.</p>
<p><a href="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/images3.jpg"><img src="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/images3.jpg?w=720" alt="images"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7032" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ll have what he&#8217;s having. -From <em>Harvey</em></p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something. After all, Droga5 seldom botches. When I was researching this campaign I found a nifty piece on a blog called <a href="http://www.breakingcopy.com/whats-your-wild-rabbit-hennessy/">Breaking Copy.</a>The author is gung-ho about the campaign but I don’t buy his analysis. He writes the campaign “feels familiar, tapping into a shared cultural memory of <em>Alice In Wonderland</em> and the woodlands of Old Europe. It’s also a little bit sexy — after all, what are rabbits known for?”</p>
<p>The blogger mentions two other well-known references –which are fair. The first being <em>Alice in Wonderland.</em> It’s been a long while since I read the fable but, to my memory, Alice gets into a world of trouble chasing her wild rabbit. I believe the negative phrase “going down a rabbit hole” stems from her massive tribulations down there. Still, Wonderland is ultimately a magical place where creativity, imagination and personal freedoms are celebrated –perhaps to a fault.  In any event, I’m willing to concede getting stoned on cognac can be a wonderful experience. Was Droga5 trying to tap into that? As in Lewis Carroll’s story maybe the indirect homage to inebriation is intentional. After all, liquor ads cannot go there directly (that’s why they are so hard to do). But then why the prizefighters and movie directors, this idea of “bringing something into the world?” It’s muddy.</p>
<p><a href="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/images4.jpg"><img src="http://godsofadvertising.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/images4.jpg?w=720" alt="images"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7050" /></a><br />
&#8220;Can we see some ID?&#8221;</p>
<p>His second “a little bit sexy” reference relates to bunny rabbits’ affinity for reproduction. I suppose on one level getting drunk and chasing “tail” is akin to “breeding like rabbits” but I’m very certain this has nothing to do with Hennessy’s message, even on a subliminal level. What do you think?</p>
<p>The blogger ends his discussion by stating the campaign’s intent can be summed up in six words: “Getting white people to drink Hennessy.” He actually may be on to something, albeit possibly racist: that white folks will appreciate the brand’s enigmatic approach more than black people. However, this takes me back to my original concerns about the campaign. Namely that rabbit holes, imaginary drinking pals and the Jefferson Airplane paint pictures most Anglo Saxons would find upsetting. They may be reasons to drink Hennessy but they strike me as the wrong ones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Typing" alt="Typing" src="http://artandcritique.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/old-number-13-typwriter.jpg" width="383" height="390" /></p>
<p>Handwriting is like making love; typing, like having sex. It’s essentially the same enjoyable activity, but the approach is slightly different.</p>
<p><span id="more-1467"></span></p>
<p>When writing my story, I am both a handwriter and a typer. I handwrite first drafts, character sketches, and scenes. I also brainstorm ideas on paper. I type everything else.</p>
<p>I handwrite early in the morning when birds are chirping, and late at night, when owls are hooting. I dislike to begin or end my day in front of my laptop screen because it tires my eyes and clouds my head.</p>
<h3>On typing</h3>
<p>Typing is fast, easy, and convenient. The sensation of my fingertips pressing on the keys is glorious, almost like touching something round and soft and warm and milky&#8230; But sometimes typing feels hasty, like I am writing too fast more words than I should write. The impulse to press enter, break the paragraph, and move on to the next, without actually finishing the current, is strong, and sometimes maddening.</p>
<p>Typing brings about a sense of urgency, a desire to finish everything and do it fast. When I have a word count to reach, and time is pressing, that is good. But when I struggle to put my thoughts in order and say exactly what I mean, it’s not.</p>
<h3>On handwriting</h3>
<p>Handwriting is slow, beautiful, and graceful. When I handwrite I think on paper. My handwriting is intelligible, rounded and curvy like a girl’s, so reading it later is not a problem. But sometimes handwriting is too slow. When I am a brimming with ideas, I feel the pen is holding me back.</p>
<p>The words do not write themselves fast enough, and I have to queue ideas, and my thumb begins to hurt, and I fret on my chair because ideas spark faster than they can be queued, and sometimes the terrible happens, and one of the queued ideas vanishes like a pretty girl in the night and I try to catch her and to hold her, to make her stay a little longer, but she is already gone and I am only groping at thin air&#8230; Heartbrake. Something lost that will never return. Paper, pen, you’ve let me down, so I will let you down. Back to typing.</p>
<h3>Advantages of handwriting</h3>
<ul>
<li>A slow, graceful, artistic process</li>
<li>Lets me think on paper</li>
<li>Helps me say almost what I mean</li>
<li>Encourages me to introspect</li>
<li>Does not tire my eyes like a laptop screen does</li>
<li>Makes me think more about the details</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages of typing</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fast and impetuous process</li>
<li>Capable of generating spontaneous ideas</li>
<li>Good for playing with language</li>
<li>Lets me quickly change and rearrange words</li>
<li>Tires my hands less than handwriting does</li>
<li>Good for the trees</li>
</ul>
<h3>On transcribing&#8230;</h3>
<p>I often have to transcribe what I have handwritten because all my story files are in an online document format, which makes storage and especially rewriting and editing more convenient. So sometimes even if I want to handwrite, I am forced to type, because I do not have the time to transcribe. I try to handwrite as much as I can though.</p>
<h3>In the end&#8230;</h3>
<p>Good thing there&#8217;s no need to choose between handwriting and typing! One can have them both. It&#8217;s the same activity, only the approach is different&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jasonbrooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/seth-macfarlane-oscars_510x317.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-3944" alt="Image" src="http://jasonbrooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/seth-macfarlane-oscars_510x317.jpg?w=350&#038;h=218" width="350" height="218" /></a>Once upon a time, I was an Oscars junkie. I loved everything about the evening: the red carpet build up, the opening monologue, the early acting awards, the major technical awards, the best picture nominee clip packages, the musical numbers, the forced pairings, the uneven feel to the entire proceedings. As a movie nerd, the Oscars were my holy grail, because it allowed me to measure my tastes and judgment against the Hollywood elite. More often than not, I found we had different sensibilities, but on those occasions when Oscar and I agreed, I felt like one of the in-crowd, affirmed for my aesthetic perspicacity.</p>
<p>Over the years, Oscar and I have grown apart. Part of it is life situation: being a parent, there aren&#8217;t that many nights when you have the energy to trot out to the local multiplex and catch a flick. And even when those nights do come around, finances are an issue. When it costs $25 just to get in, the number of trips to the cinema drops dramatically.</p>
<p>But the real reason I quit going to the movies is because they kind of pushed me to the side.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of cussing and nudity in movies. Even more recently, graphic violence has also turned me off. Even watching the clip package for <em>Django Unchained</em> on last night&#8217;s Oscars left me feeling queasy. Maybe it&#8217;s my old age. Maybe it&#8217;s things like Newtown. Maybe it&#8217;s just the fact that I see enough blood and guts in my news feed every day. I don&#8217;t know. And while I know that not all movies are slammed full of cussing and nudity and exploding body parts, I know that some of the ones feted as the best of the best last night had plenty of one or the other.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em> because multiple friends said that the F-bomb was prevalent. I didn&#8217;t see <em>Django</em> because of the violence (and, let&#8217;s face it, Tarantinian dialogue is often fraught with choice words). Same with <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> (even though I enjoyed Bigelow&#8217;s <em>Hurt Locker</em>). I didn&#8217;t get around to <em>Lincoln</em> because&#8230;well, I never got around to it. <em>Life of Pi</em> seemed like a great rental (no offense to Ang Lee and his golden statue). I wanted to see <em>Argo</em>, but got warned off because of language. <em>Les Miserables</em> was a non-starter for me (I don&#8217;t really like movie musicals, no matter how awesome it is to see someone as all-around talented as Hugh Jackman). And honestly, no one I knew had even seen <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em> or <em>Amour</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind the occasional coarse word or two; I get that PG language isn&#8217;t always used in real life. And lest you think this is one of those &#8220;bash Hollywood as being out of touch with the mainstream of America&#8221;, I&#8217;ll tell you that I hear and see those words quite prevalently in the everyday language of our younger generation. So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a prude when it comes to the reality of American speech.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the same way with violence (less so on nudity). I get it as an artistic choice. And I don&#8217;t think we need to scrub movies of anything that might be offensive (otherwise, we&#8217;d miss out on some fantastic and thought-provoking work).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that my life and my values make the Oscars an also-ran. What once would have been appointment TV is now a cultural temperature reading at best and an intellectual curiosity at worst. Even if Morgan Freeman hosted, I&#8217;d probably only watch it in pieces, flipping back and forth for the big awards. Last night merely confirmed that fact for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be blunt and say I found Seth MacFarlane tedious at best. <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/25/this-years-oscars-snark-meets-sincerity/">EW.com&#8217;s Owen Gleiberman</a> has a better assessment of his hosting gig (and overall telecast) than I could ever produce, and his note about the broadcast vacillating between snark and sincerity is spot on. I guess for me, the snark took center stage, and for the first time I found it not only unfunny but unpalatable as well.</p>
<p>It would be hypocritical of me to take people to task for their snarky comments when I spent the majority of my time live-tweeting my own attempts at humor and sarcasm during the telecast. I have no problem with sarcasm as a whole; I understand that in our day and age it&#8217;s the stock and trade of our popular culture, and some people carry it to the edges. It&#8217;s one thing when you&#8217;re using snark to push the boundaries of our corporate fuddy-duddiness as a way of encouraging us to relax and laugh more. It&#8217;s another thing when you use it as a blade to slice people out of genuine dislike. Last night, I felt like MacFarlane was slinging his blade very wide.</p>
<p>But hey, that&#8217;s the point of this post: what someone thought would make for a good Oscars telecast was outside my comfort zone, which just proves that both the Academy and I have changed. We&#8217;re no longer simpatico.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s cool. I saw several people bashing on Twitter last night, and while I can agree with the perspective that might have driven some of the tweets, I can&#8217;t agree with the tweets themselves. It does no good to lambaste Hollywood with the same snark it lambastes others. Everyone loses.</p>
<p>My three favorite moments were the last three awards: Best Actress (Jennifer Lawrence &#8211; <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em>), Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis &#8211; <em>Lincoln</em>) and Best Picture (Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Grant Heslov &#8211; <em>Argo</em>). Each of the winners showed a humanity that was touching; whether it was Lawrence&#8217;s unfortunate trip up the stairs, Day-Lewis&#8217; uncharacteristic humor, or Affleck&#8217;s barely contained joy, each moment reminded you of what the movies have always represented: the chance to flesh out dreams.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I miss from the overall Oscars ceremony: the human reminder that dreams can come true, on film and on that awards stage.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s the beginning point of my disconnect with Hollywood: I miss the humanity.</p>

<p>Like most, I hate reading emails from the type of people that forward. Forwards drive me f-ing nuts. Yesterday, I guess you could say I accidentally read one called &#8220;Something to Ponder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sitting in Startbucks I opened that forwarded email that slipped past the &#8220;spam&#8221; guards, lol. Weirdly, in this case I&#8217;m glad I did. I just came to pick up a coffee. Hadn&#8217;t planned to take any photos.</p>

<p>Something to Ponder (Originally titled this in the email and credited to Comedian George Carlin &#8211; Credit actually belongs to Dr. Bob Moorehead as described below)</p>
<p>AKA</p>
<p>The Paradox of our Age: Dr. Bob Moorehead</p>
<p><i>The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.</i><i> </i></p>
<div id="attachment_4064" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 932px"><a href="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000252.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4064" alt="Blackberry Z10" src="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000252.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blackberry Z10</p></div>
<p><i>We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.</i><i> </i><i></i></p>
<p>We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.</p>
<div id="attachment_4066" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 932px"><a href="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000256.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4066" alt="Blackberry Z10" src="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000256.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blackberry Z10</p></div>
<p><i><i>We&#8217;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life. We&#8217;ve added years to life not life to years. We&#8217;ve been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We&#8217;ve done larger things, but not better things.</i><i> </i></i></p>
<div id="attachment_4071" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 932px"><a href="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000238.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4071" alt="Blackberry Z10" src="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000238.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blackberry Z10</p></div>
<p><em id="__mceDel"><i><i> We&#8217;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We&#8217;ve conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We&#8217;ve learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. </i></i></em></p>
<div id="attachment_4067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 760px"><a href="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000247.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4067" alt="Blackberry Z10" src="http://jtinseoul.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_00000247.jpg?w=720"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blackberry Z10</p></div>
<p><i>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.</i><i> </i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a former fundamental Baptist, this is only my second year of observing Lent. Lent, when I was growing up, was one of those things that <em>Catholics </em>do because they don&#8217;t really believe in Jesus (I don&#8217;t think most Baptist preachers actually know any Catholics) and so they are enslaved to law and to rules and boundaries.</p>
<p>I thought, as a Baptist, that I was so lucky to not be enslaved to rules like those Catholics were.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 197px"><a href="http://sarahoverthemoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/199_27612667984_451_n.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image " id="i-3431" alt="Image" src="http://sarahoverthemoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/199_27612667984_451_n.jpg?w=187" width="187" height="299" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by me.</p></div>
<p>Funny, considering the fact that when I was thinking this, I likely had on a skirt that had to go past the bottom of knee and a shirt that passed the &#8220;two-finger&#8221; test. I probably wore a silver ring on my left hand that bore the words &#8220;True Love Waits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting their with a beam in my own eye, judging the Catholics and their Lent, I could not see how bound to rules I really was.</p>
<p>How bound to rules my <em>body </em>really was.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cause your brothers to stumble.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I was addicted to porn because the girls in my youth group wore tight jeans.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Music should speak to your heart, not your hips.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>A Christian man will be able to tell if a woman is not sexually pure. A good Christian man will not find an impure woman beautiful.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>When you give your body away, it is like letting someone test-drive you like a car and crash you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>You do not have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Skin is sin.&#8221;</em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>These are the words I heard over and over growing up. Skin is sin. Using my body is sin. My body itself is sin.</p>
<p>These were the words which kept me afraid of the body that was mine. The body that was <em>me. </em>These are the words that made me afraid of the awesome mass of cells and energy and chemical reactions that was my body. These are the words that made me afraid of any emotional or physical actions or reactions that were considered <em>bodily. </em></p>
<p>Sweating.</p>
<p>Crying.</p>
<p>A need for touch.</p>
<p>Dancing.</p>
<p>Exercising.</p>
<p>Sexual attraction.</p>
<p>I hid my body under layers of clothes. I crossed my arms and my legs and made myself as small as possible. I didn&#8217;t touch. Didn&#8217;t dance. I beat myself up whenever my body reacted to someone I found attracted. I heaped on guilt and shame and self-hatred whenever I touched myself.</p>
<p>And when I met my first boyfriend, and he began to treat my body like it belonged to him, I didn&#8217;t think I was allowed to stop. After all, my body didn&#8217;t belong to me, and I couldn&#8217;t use my body to fight back.</p>
<p>I carry over so much baggage from those years of disconnect from my body, from myself. <strong>Though I spent my years as a fundamentalist bragging about the freedom I supposedly had in Christ, that freedom was for my soul alone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not my body.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never my body.</strong></p>
<p>Yet, as my blogger friend Suzannah Paul says in this wonderful piece (made even more wonderful because of a reference to one of my favorite genres of music):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Our physical selves were knit by God to be wholly entwined with our spirituality,</strong> and the latter doesn’t trump the former. In the Nicene Creed, we affirm the resurrection of the dead. Even in heaven we’ll have bodies, and it makes little sense to live spiritual lives divorced from our bodily ones here on earth. [Emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So, for Lent this year, I&#8217;m setting my body free.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m setting it free from the hatred that I have directed toward it for years and years. I&#8217;m setting it free from any responsibility that the church tries to put on it for the sins of men. I&#8217;m setting it free from Platonic associations with the carnal, the base, the non-transcendent.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m embracing my body for what it is&#8211;one of the amazing manifestations of a universe filled with divine wisdom. Also, me. My body is me. </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m loving my body for Lent. I&#8217;m letting me be me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prose is a mixture of technique and artfulness. In my previous posts, I’ve felt confident enough to talk about aspects of the writing craft that are, in my view, technique oriented. Creating good characters, on the other hand, seems like an art form to me.  Let&#8217;s see if I can take the fun out of it and get technical!</p>
<p><a href="http://ericjohnbaker.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/turtle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-513" alt="turtle" src="http://ericjohnbaker.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/turtle.jpg?w=538&#038;h=399" width="538" height="399" /></a></p>
<p>Each writer has her own way of building characters, but we all share the same goal of making those literary creations authentic and interesting. Where to start? First I want to consider the major components of a character. I&#8217;m no expert, so feel free to add your thoughts or tell me what I missed:</p>
<p>1. History</p>
<p>2. <strong>Motivation </strong>(Today&#8217;s topic. I knew it would come up!)</p>
<p>3. Dialog</p>
<p>4. Action</p>
<p>In regard to history or backstory, many writers create bios of each character, especially for stories with complex family trees, royal bloodlines, or a multi-generational timeline. Others are comfortable with a general sense of their characters’ pasts. When it comes to dialog and action, our literary creations must say and do things that are consistent with who they are.</p>
<p>Which brings us to motivation. We, as writers, should ask ourselves what our heroes, villains, and supporting cast members want to accomplish. Although bit players can be purely functional, our stars must have objectives. Why write a story about them if they have nothing to do?</p>
<p>But is an external objective enough on its own to make someone real or interesting? Think about yourself. I&#8217;m sure you have goals, but you also have the push and pull of your intrinsic nature, which sometimes helps you and other times holds you back. For example, I know I am motivated to control outcomes, and I don&#8217;t like surprises. I relax like a turtle does a back stroke: Very poorly. On the other hand, I&#8217;m empathetic and see value in other perspectives. If you put me in a zombie apocalypse story, I&#8217;ll be the guy telling all the knuckleheads to calm down so we can make a survival plan in a logical, collaborative manner. I have a goal &#8211; to survive the zombie onslaught &#8211; and an intrinsic nature, which is to impose order and control while still respecting others&#8217; views.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my formula for character motivation:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">External motivation (goal) + internal motivation (intrinsic nature)</p>
<p>Internally, each of us is a cauldron of motivations that are often invisible to others. However,when the stakes are high, our intrinsic natures come to the fore. Going back to the zombie scenario, I can&#8217;t be the controlling guy with the diplomatic personality in one scene and the hysterical guy who loses his temper every five minutes in the next. A more plausible dynamic is for me to be frozen by inaction when I&#8217;ve imposed my plan but the zombies manage to breach the fortress anyway, since (warning: theme coming) efforts to control outcomes in life are ultimately futile. As I&#8217;m being devoured by the undead, perhaps I can say, &#8220;You know, I learned a valuable lesson here about living in the moment!&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_515" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 234px"><a href="http://ericjohnbaker.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brains.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-515" alt="Motivation: Find lunch" src="http://ericjohnbaker.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brains.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" width="224" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Motivation: Find lunch</p></div>
<p>Think about the people you know, dig below the surface, and imagine why they act the way they do. Have you ever met someone who puts people down to make up for her own lack of self-esteem? How about someone who tries too hard to please the boss because she needs validation as a human being and doesn&#8217;t know how to find it in herself? Combine those internal qualities, give the character an external goal (getting the heroine fired), and – <i>voilà</i> – you’ve got a secondary villain. The main villain is a serial killer hiding in the air ducts, by the way.</p>
<p>Here is a tiny sampling of intrinsic motivations that can be combined with others and, when coupled with an external goal, make one&#8217;s literary offspring more authentic:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wanting to win at all costs and dreading failure</span>. This character often makes the people around him miserable with all his ups and downs, and the world is all about him.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Striving to win approval and craving attention</span>. This person may seek praise from authority figures and try to make others feel guilty. Passive aggressiveness, in other words.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Seeking variety and distraction</span>. This character can get lost in what he’s doing and let people down who were counting on him.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Avoiding social interaction</span>. No one knows what’s really going on behind her nerd glasses!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Assuming all people see things the way you do</span>. He buys his wife a football. She wanted <i>Sex and the City: Season 1</i> on DVD.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Trying to get everything done yesterday</span>. She’s so wired, she makes the people around her tired just looking at her.</p>
<p>A character is bland if all he has is an external goal.  He needs dimensions. The next time our hero and his sidekick go on a quest to retrieve a magic sword, let&#8217;s make the hero a controlling, pushy type with no concern for others’ feelings, and depict the sidekick as an unassertive people-pleaser who gets walked on. The sidekick shouldn&#8217;t exist simply to help the hero find the sword. Give her a reason to overcome her anxieties and stand up for herself&#8230; even better if doing so is integral to the plot. While we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s teach the  hero a humbling lesson in empathy as he looks for that stupid sword.</p>
<p>On second thought, don’t make the sword stupid. People won’t want to read that.</p>
