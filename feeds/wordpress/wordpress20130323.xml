				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The following includes descriptions, photos, and video that may serve as a trigger for victims of sexual violence.<br />
Please be advised. </em></p>
<p>Someone asked me today, &#8220;What is &#8216;rape culture&#8217; anyway? I&#8217;m tired of hearing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I hear ya. I&#8217;m tired of talking about it. But I&#8217;m going to keep talking about it because people like you keep asking that question.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and though there are dozens of witnesses, no one says, &#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and though there are dozens of witnesses, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">they can&#8217;t get anyone to come forward</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and adults are informed of it, but no consequences are doled out because the boys &#8220;said nothing happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and we later find out that t<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/173387/verdict-steubenville-shows-bond-between-jock-culture-and-rape-culture#">heir coaches were &#8220;joking about it&#8221; and &#8220;took care of it.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and even though there is documentation of the coaching staff sweeping it under the rug,<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/18/meet_reno_saccoccia_steubenvilles_head_football_coach/"> they get to keep their jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and one of the coaches involved in the cover-up <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/01/inside-anonymous-hacking-file-steubenville-rape-crew/60502/">threatens a reporter </a>- saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to get yours. And if you don&#8217;t get yours, somebody close to you will.&#8221; &#8211; but the town is more worried about keeping their coaching talent than his integrity.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, take pictures of the process, and it becomes a source of ridicule along social networks, whitewashing the crime with hashtags.</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rapeinstagram.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239" alt="rapeinstagram" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rapeinstagram.png?w=198&#038;h=300" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and then joke about it on video &#8211; saying, &#8220;“She is so raped,” “They raped her quicker than Mike Tyson!”, “They raped her more than the Duke lacrosse team!”, and she was “deader than Trayvon Martin.” &#8211; while everyone else laughs. (Warning: this video will make you sick to your stomach.)</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/W1oahqCzwcY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/14749/the_problem_with_social_media_in_steubenville/">the town is more concerned with preserving their football program</a> than the fact that their children are attacking others without remorse.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and the mainstream media laments the fact that their &#8220;<a href="http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students">promising futures</a>&#8221; have been dashed by their crimes &#8211; as though THEY are the victims.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and even though she&#8217;s been through enough, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html?ir=Media">the 16 year old victim&#8217;s name is shared on national television.</a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, but because it happens at a party where both sexes were drinking, complete strangers on the internet argue ferociously that she is to blame for being attacked.<em></em></p>

Warning: it will make you sick.</p></div>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and members of the community issue death threats against the victim.</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/death-threats.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-240" alt="death threats" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/death-threats.png?w=300&#038;h=168" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and it is documented across social media channels, and the media informs us that <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/14749/the_problem_with_social_media_in_steubenville/">the takeaway is to be more careful about what we post to social media</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when a group of athletes rape a young girl, and when a cover-up is exposed by a group of hackers, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/01/inside-anonymous-hacking-file-steubenville-rape-crew/60502/">we call them &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and the culpable &#8220;victims.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m talking about Steubenville. Tired of hearing about it? Ok, let&#8217;s talk about something else.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when the Steubenville is far from the first instance of athletic clubs covering up sexual violence allegations. See: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-01/ex-penn-state-president-charged-with-sandusky-cover-up">Sandusky</a>, <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/10/07/impunity-for-college-athletes-who-rape/">Michigan State 2010</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/jk-v-arizona-board-regents">Arizona State 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice-womens-rights/simpson-v-university-colorado">University of Colarado 2006</a>, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5027393/university-of-iowa-athletic-staff-conspired-to-cover-up-a-sexual-assault">University of Iowa 2008</a>, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8853980">Lincoln High School 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/sports/ncaafootball/handling-of-sexual-assault-claims-brings-new-scrutiny-to-montana.html?pagewanted=all">University of Montana 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-marquette-sex-cases-20111028,0,4057558.story">Marquette 2011</a>, plus <a href="http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/athletes.html">this research</a> (and there&#8217;s more to find if you dig)</p>
<p>Rape culture is when universities across the country do not report rape to the police, but handle the matter via &#8220;honor boards&#8221; - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/03/12/why-should-colleges-judge-rape-accusations/rape-is-a-crime-treat-it-as-such">ultimately shielding perpetrators from criminal consequences</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when universities threaten to expel a student for speaking out about her rape (without ever identifying her attacker) <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/unc-student-risks-expulsion-public-alleged-rape/story?id=18609150">because it&#8217;s harassment to talk about her suffering</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/daniel-toshs-rape-joke-defended-by-comedians-2012127">a comedian has a long history of making jokes about rape and sexual assault</a>, is defended from backlash by the comic community, and doesn&#8217;t lose his fan base.</p>
<p>Rape culture is <a href="http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/change-in-action-heather-l-barmore/2013/03/18/the-rape-culture-we-create/">when a journalist says this</a> &#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that the entire conversation is wrong. I don’t want anybody to be telling women anything. I don’t want men to be telling me what to wear and how to act, not to drink. And I don’t, honestly, want you to tell me that I needed a gun in order to prevent my rape. In my case, don’t tell me if I’d only had a gun, I wouldn’t have been raped. Don’t put it on me to prevent the rape.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ForAmerica">the public responds with this</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-238" alt="rape" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when politicians don&#8217;t understand how <a href="http://fatlip.leoweekly.com/2013/02/08/kathy-stein-highlights-the-exceptionally-sadistic-nature-of-kentuckys-ultrasound-bill/">requiring a transvaginal ultrasound of a rape victim seeking an abortion is like raping her all over again</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when political candidates say that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/richard-mourdock-rape-comment-puts-romney-defense/story?id=17552263">God sometimes intends rape</a>, and that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/roger-rivard-reelection-wisconsin-assembly_n_2089654.html">some girls just &#8220;rape easy,&#8221;</a> and that <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79864.html">&#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; does not result in pregnancy</a>&#8230; and do not lose the backing of their party or party leaders.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/03/cpac-where-ashley-judd-rape-jokes-happen">a speaker at a political convention makes a rape joke</a> about a sexual violence victim advocate, and he brings the house down with laughter.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when we <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/dating-blog/protect-yourself-from-rape">spend all our time telling women to avoid being raped by modifying their behavior</a>, inferring blame back onto the victim.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when stunning displays of privilege and willful ignorance combine to create this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONFUSION &#8211; NO, ALL MEN ARE NOT RAPISTS.<br />
THE FOLLOWING AD IS A REPREHENSIBLE ATTEMPT BY AN MRA GROUP TO UNDERMINE PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE ON RAPE CULTURE BY FALSELY ASSOCIATING IT WITH INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>WE GOOD? GOOD. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/voice-for-men.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-243" alt="voice for MEN" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/voice-for-men.jpg?w=294&#038;h=380" width="294" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/no-rape-culture.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-246" alt="no rape culture" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/no-rape-culture.png?w=490&#038;h=291" width="490" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when a woman speaks out about rape culture, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-EvJkimRZyTT3pJcXBiVGRmdzQ/edit?pli=1">and gets subjected to this</a>.</p>
<p>Rape culture is when we see ads like these on a far too frequent basis:</p>
<p><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belvedere-ad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-245" alt="belvedere ad" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belvedere-ad.jpg?w=490&#038;h=452" width="490" height="452" /></a> <a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape-jump.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-244" alt="rape jump" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rape-jump.jpg?w=490&#038;h=275" width="490" height="275" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gross.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-247" alt="gross" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gross.jpg?w=490&#038;h=306" width="490" height="306" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/friendzonedrink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-248" alt="friendzonedrink" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/friendzonedrink.jpg?w=490&#038;h=490" width="490" height="490" /></a><a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dominos.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-249" alt="dominos" src="http://rantagainsttherandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dominos.png?w=490&#038;h=305" width="490" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>Rape culture is when you&#8217;re tired of hearing about &#8220;rape culture&#8221; because it makes you uncomfortable, as your attempt to silence discourse on the subject means we never raise enough awareness to combat it &#8211; <em><strong>and that&#8217;s part of why it sticks around.</strong></em></p>
<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re tired of hearing about it. But I wouldn&#8217;t expect us to shut up anytime soon. Nor should we.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> I will no longer be publishing comments which caveat the discussion of rape culture with false rape accusation concerns. There is a reason for this, <a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/why-i-wont-publish-your-comments-about-false-rape-accusations/">which you can read here</a>. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Lilah,</p>
<p>You are WAY past nine months old now. In fact, you are ten months old, as of yesterday. But, as you know, your mother is nothing if she isn’t a total slacker. It isn’t that I don’t enjoy writing letters to you. Really. It is that between you insisting on trying to pound away at my laptop while I am doing so, and the miniscule amount of time I have without you attached to me, I am unable to do a whole lot of anything these days.</p>
<p>You are getting so big. I was at one of my check-up appointments the other day and there was a woman there with a baby who she “claimed” was 8 weeks old and weighed 11 pounds and I could barely remember you being that tiny ( say “claimed” because I swear to Cheesus, that baby was so small. SO SMALL). You are so full of personality now and you really are a little person and not at all like that little meatloaf that you were when we brought you home from the hospital. It is so strange to think you have changed so much. And also to think that, in just a few months, we will have another meatloaf. And this time it will have a tiny penis. Weird. Anyway, you shouldn’t concern yourself with such things. You just concentrate on being super cute and deliberately spitting on everything in a 20 foot radius of you.</p>
<p>You are not a crawler. And not because you can’t, mind you, but because having to crawl to get somewhere really pisses you off. I wonder if I am the only mom out there scratching her head on this one. I have seen you do it and I know that you are capable, but yet, for some reason, you would rather get in baby plank pose, scoot yourself about a foot backwards and then get super angry and start to screech. I am not as worried that you are behind in development as that you are going to be lazy until your brother is born and then take giant leaps when I don’t have the time or the energy to pad the entire house for you to fall all over.</p>
<p>You say things like “mama” and “dada” but I am pretty sure you don’t yet know that you are saying our respective names. Your dad, however, insists that you say “duck” when it is bath time. (You do have a rubber duckie or two that we have in there with you when Daddy bathes you, but I am not sure that I buy that you are yet calling them ducks. Not because I think you are a dummy, but because I haven’t heard this and your dad has a hearing problem. Meaning he hears what he wants to. And this applies to everyone, not just you.)</p>
<p>You love eating. You are indiscriminate completely about food unless I try to give you peas. Peas and carrots? “Sure, Mom! Bring it!” Peas by themselves? “No way, Mom, get that shit out of my face.” You should know that peas are delicious and you should eat them. Don’t listen to your dad when he talks about how gross they are. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. You especially love strawberries, pears, and green grapes. All three of my favorite fruits. And we have them just about every day for a snack together and it is really amusing for me to watch you master your dexterity and pick up tiny pieces of slimy stuff. Half of the time, most of it ends up in your lap, but I enjoy watching you stuff your face on the off-chance that you make it in there. (You are totally getting good at it, though. At first, I doubted that you had gotten ANY fruit into your mouth, now I only find a couple of slivers in your lap and on the floor…Good work, my love.)</p>
<p>You are still a really weird sleeper. We attempted to do this thing called “sleep training” wherein your father and I would train you about when and how to sleep on your own. What ended up happening was that you ended up training me and your father on how to sleep with you wrapped around our faces. We are about to start this process again because it is really important to me to have you in your own bed/room before your brother gets here and keeps me up all night.  In fairness (to me), it would have been pointless to go full force with sleep training if we were just going to uproot you, which we just did when we moved to this new house. So…yeah. I don’t suck as much as it might seem.</p>
<p>You are also working on getting tooth number 7. And let me tell you, Lilah, teething is a total bitch and you OWE me for this. Like, when you turn 18, you are going to need to buy me a kitten for each tooth that you have. Okay, that’s not a good idea. But I will think of something for you to do. Because this shit is DUMB. (And also makes your sleeping WORSE. Yes. That is possible, it would appear.)</p>
<p>So, again, I am sorry that I was a slack ass during your ninth month, but we had a lot going on. I mean, be for real, we had to move so that we had room for your brother and so that you didn’t catch disobedience and general badness from your cousin. I’m just saying. By the time you read this, you will know exactly what I mean. No need to get too involved.  Either way, your father and I are very proud of you. You crack us up every day and you are so effing cute with your growing front teeth and your chubby, delicious cheeks. We can’t get enough of you. You are the love of my life. Duh.</p>
<p>Love always,</p>
<p>Mom</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rumors you&#8217;ve been hearing. They&#8217;re true.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Salad cancels out bacon. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2>The Salad-Cancels-Out-Bacon Rule</h2>
<p>This logic is derived from a spectrum of proven theories, derived as follows, in a highly scien-matical, derive-atory way:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. First, we establish that the <strong><em>ratio of bacon to salad</em></strong> is the same, that is:</p>
<p><strong><em>bacon:salad = true</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p>We can now proceed in applying the laws of cross-multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>2. In particular, we make use of the cross-cancellation laws, such that:<br />
<strong style="font-style:italic;">bacon/salad * salad/bacon = 1</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>3. Because we slash-ed-ed both the <strong><em>bacon </em></strong>and<em> </em><strong><em>salad </em></strong>factors like they&#8217;re imaginary, we&#8217;re obligated to multiply our remainder by <em><strong>i</strong></em> (the infamous &#8220;imaginary number&#8221;). Like this:</p>
<p><strong><em>      1 * i </em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>4. And <strong><em>i</em></strong>, being imaginary and all, stands for nothing tangible, therefore:<br />
<strong><em>i =</em></strong><em> <strong>0   </strong>carried through as<strong>   1 * 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>5. As everyone knows, anything multiplied by zero = 0  therefore expressed as,</p>
<p><i>      </i><em><strong>1 * i</strong><strong> = 0    </strong></em>or<em><strong>   1 * 0 = 0</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<blockquote><p>6. To conclude and prove that</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;line-height:1.625;"><em>salad cancels out bacon</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">See Mr. Willet? I WAS paying attention in AP Calculus. </span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;font-family:Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:300;line-height:1.625;">And heck! You were right. I DID find a practical application for this math stuff.</span></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the cable car to take us to the top of Mount Korek, I’m stunned by the beauty that surrounds me. Bright white snow-capped mountains are all around. They glisten in the sunshine and despite the sub-zero temperatures give off a warm glow. And all is peaceful.  A sharp contrast, I imagine, to 20 years ago,  when gunfire must have echoed among these mountains and blood stained the snow.<a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignright" id="i-164" alt="Me at the top of Mount Korek" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-me.jpg?w=244&#038;h=244" width="244" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>But this no longer the battleground of Iraqi Kurds and Saddam Hussein’s regime. Thanks in part to a no-fly zone put in place 21 years ago, during the first Iraq war, and the more recent US-led invasion of 2003, some tranquillity has returned. The fall of the former dictator has given a once-persecuted people the security to rebuild and develop this now semi-autonomous region.</p>
<p>Much safer than the south, northern Iraq has even become popular as a tourist destination for Iranians and Turks and those living in the South of he country. The cable car is just one of many new ventures.</p>
<p>As we ascend the steel cable, my guide Dr. Douglas Layton explains how the area has come to be called “the other Iraq”. “So much was demolished by Saddam Hussein” he says.  4.500 villages, 95% of the region. There were no eggs in the bazaar because the chickens had all been killed. Nothing. Nothing, but a little fuel, and a few cars. “</p>
<p>Now though, he says it’s <strong><em>emerging from the ashes.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-168" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iraq-olde-men.jpg?w=273&#038;h=273" width="273" height="273" /></a>We are the first to try out the cable car and when we reach the top,  the technicians are revelling in their triumph. The generator thawed, the cable car worked and all is ready to receive the first group of tourists. Out comes the celebratory sweet tea to warm us up.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that anyone might choose to go to Iraq on their holidays, but last year the north of the country attracted 2 million visitors. The government hopes that will rise to 5 million this year.</p>
<p>Since it opened the doors to domestic and foreign investment in 2006, billions of dollars have been pouring into the region. A newly-built state of the art airport in the capital Erbil and around 500 hotels now await their visitors. From the viewing platform at Mount Korek, half-built ski chalets line the horizon.</p>
<p>But as Douglas tells me, the outside world is still not convinced it’s safe to come here.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 465px"><a href="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg"><img class=" wp-image " id="i-171" alt="" src="http://theopiskarlatos.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kirkuk.jpg?w=455&#038;h=303" width="455" height="303" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">© Ryan Youngblood</p></div>
<p>It is not surprising when you consider the continuing disputes over oil and borders. As we sip tea and admire the views,  200 km south in Kirkuk a building, belonging to a group of elderly Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, is blown to pieces by a suicide bomber.  Their armchairs were ripped apart by the blast, their playing cards stuck to the blood on the floor.</p>
<p>When such incidents make international news headlines, it does not help the tourist board trying to sell the rest of Kurdistan as a safe and beautiful part of the world. But our drive back towards Erbil IS beautiful. We pass sweet stalls, families barbequeing, couples cuddling beneath waterfalls and children throwing snowballs at each other. Huge icicles hang down from the rocky canyon above us.</p>
<p>Below us we can see the original Hamilton road, built by a New Zealand engineer in the 1920s. Winding its way through the mountains it’s a miracle the project  was ever finished. Before even beginning to chisel and dynamite his way through the rocks, Archibald Hamilton had to unite the feuding tribesmen who’d been recruited to work for him.</p>
<p>I wonder what he would make of the melting pot that is Iraqi Kurdistan now. A mixture of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen – Christians and Muslims – who for the most part tell me, they live peacefully side by side.</p>
<p>Ten years after the invasion, this region and its people are moving on.</p>
<div>
<p>Perhaps the mountains are not the Kurds&#8217; only friends.. as the proverb says. Perhaps they are making new ones. New friends from the south, in search of peace and friends from further afield &#8211; keen to hit the open Hamilton road and discover the place they call “the other Iraq”.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>You have a message. It’s a photo. No words, no explanation. Just a photo. Tell us all about it. And what happens next.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p>Startled by the sudden introduction of hazy blue light I awake from my slumber hearing the quiet but melodic tune of my phone. Glancing at the clock on the bedside table I realise it is 2am and grab my phone. Fear of an emergency makes my heart race.</p>
<p>Unlocking my phone I am greeted with a picture where written on a crumpled napkin are the words “Where were you?”</p>
<p>I check the number but don’t know of it.</p>
<p>My boyfriend begins to stir. I quickly grab a cardigan and move to the other room gently stepping over the creaky floorboards that we have yet to repair and head down the stairs, phone in hand. I flick on the kettle and reopen the message. The number means nothing to me.  The image means nothing to me yet the writing seems familiar.</p>
<p>I sit down after pouring myself a mug of coffee and continue to gaze at the phone. Why is this bothering me so much? Spock, the cat, nudges the phone and I grumble and push him towards his food bowl.</p>
<p>“Not now.”</p>
<p>I put the phone down and gaze into the darkness of the window and the reflection of myself as my phone snaps me back into reality. I open the message and am greeted with an image similar to the last only the words have changed. I hear the thud of my own heart as I read again the words written on this new image, “I’m not waiting here for you any longer, I’m on my way.” Almost visible at the edge of the napkin are the last three letters of my post code.</p>
<p>I decide to text them, what else can I do?</p>
<p>New message. “Who is this? Sorry I don’t have your number saved.”</p>
<p>God why am I always so apologetic.</p>
<p>I sip at my coffee and hear movement upstairs. I remain quiet as I hear him rolling over in bed and settle back down. Spock wanders across the table pacing, he seems as stressed as me.</p>
<p>Minutes pass and no answer. I look at the clock it’s 2:22am. I grab my phone and dial the number it cuts straight to an automated message which very politely informs me this number is not recognised. I hang up and reopen the message.</p>
<p>This is some kind of joke; obviously someone I know has a strange sense of humour.</p>
<p>I place the mug in the sink and turn to leave the kitchen as I hear a faint tap on the back door. I look at the window but can see nothing outside. Somehow the night seems darker than ever as I move to the hallway and go to call up the stairs I hear the back door move but not open. I feel the temperature drop and watch as Spock backs into the corner of the kitchen.</p>
<p>A voice in my head echoes with the words “I said I would come.” A voice that reminds me of love, loss and will now forever more remind me of fear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/writing-challenge-nighttime-photo/#more-16692" target="_blank"> Today&#8217;s writing challenge</a> hosted by <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/about-the-daily-post/" target="_blank">The Daily Post at WordPress.com</a>  got my blog juices flowing two days earlier this week. The prompt:</p>
<p><em>It’s 2AM and your phone has just buzzed you awake, filling the room in white-blue LED light. You have a message. It’s a photo. No words, no explanation. Just a photo. Tell us all about it. And what happens next..</em></p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>I love my ring tone, but not at 2 A.M.</p>
<p>Every hair on my body, including the fine almost non-existent ones behind my knees, jumps to attention. There isn’t a down comforter in the world capable of warming the chill running through me. Something must be terribly wrong.<span id="more-792"></span> Unless someone has been dumped by a boy or girlfriend, is drunk and can&#8217;t drive, or has been in an accident, everyone has specific instructions not to call me in the dead of night – even if someone has died. Sounds cruel, I know, but my reasoning is that I’d be in better shape after a good night’s sleep to deal with something that terrible. Dead is dead &#8211; and there would be plenty of time for tears in the morning. That said, I know no one has died. Thank God.</p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>My heart pounds – not only in my chest. My ears throb. My throat closes. Someone must be hurt. I roll over and snatch the phone from the bedside table. For a split second, my hand over the screen casts an eerie shadow on the ceiling. It’s nothing like the happy barking dogs or free flying birds we made with our flashlights as kids.</p>
<p>QUACK! QUACK!</p>
<p>I slide a trembling finger across the bar – it’s a photo. She must have been a beauty. You could tell, even though her smooth olive skin was cracked, swollen, and smeared red. Her velvety blue eyes are barely noticeable from between the pair of luxurious long-lash-Maybelline painted slits. I am so mesmerized by her vacant stare that I don’t notice the thin red line across her throat right away. My free hand smacks against my mouth. It would muffle a shriek except the sound is caught behind the dam of frozen bile in my throat. Chest heaving, I</p>
<p>QUACK!</p>
<p>The text message reads<i>, &#8220;Sorry, Mom. I was up late, working on that model for the book cover. Since you’re up now, what do ya think? Realistic enough?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Thank you DPChallenge! This was an awful lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I don&#8217;t exactly wake up from the sound of the phone, but rather my husband&#8217;s elbow in my stomach.  &#8220;How many times do I need to ask you to turn your phone off before you go to bed?&#8221;  He shoves me to my side of the bed, towards my bedside table with a flickering phone on top of it, like a beacon in the darkness of our small bedroom.  I know my husband isn&#8217;t an angry guy, he just doesn&#8217;t want to wake our four-month-old and have to try to sleep to the sounds of crying baby. I quickly put the phone on silent and habitually tap the fluorescent green Messages window on my iPhone.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>At first, my groggy mind isn&#8217;t quite sure what I am looking at, but then I snort loudly trying to contain my laughter and get shoved in my stomach once again.  </strong><strong>&#8220;Will you turn this damn thing off and stop radiating my head?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><strong>I stick my head under the comforter and zoom in on the picture of my old neighbor Xander.  In the snapshot, he is wearing my brother&#8217;s old baseball cap that says Goofy (quite appropriately!) above the velcro, that the latter left during one of his visits home.  How did it end up on Xander&#8217;s head? I try to think back to the last time he and my brother interacted?  And the last time he and I interacted?…</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Anyway, he is wearing a cap backwards as well as the very apparent blue eye shadow, generous strokes of blush and pink lipgloss.  Because its 2AM, i think even slower than I have already been thinking ever since the influx of hormones from my fourth pregnancy.  Why is Xander wearing makeup and my brother&#8217;s baseball cap?  Why did he send me this picture in the middle of the night? </strong></p>
<p><strong>For a second I think that maybe he decided to come out of the closet, the way I accidentally forced my friend Jordan to come out in high school.  We were all at a big Thanksgiving dinner at Jordan&#8217;s house &#8211; my mom, her boyfriend, my brother with his first wife, me and my then boyfriend Drake with his mom, Drake&#8217;s cousin Jordan, his parents and some more relatives I can&#8217;t recall… I was quite sure that Jordan was gay and even more sure that it was common knowledge.  He was seventeen, gorgeous and showed absolutely zero interest in all the slutty girls in our high school that were throwing themselves at him. He dressed with an effortless cool, was neater than our school principal and knew every Madonna song by heart.  When my boyfriend&#8217;s mom, Jordan&#8217;s aunt, asked Jordan why he wasn&#8217;t playing football for our high school &#8211; &#8220;You have the looks and the physique, hun..&#8221; I blurted out  without pausing to think (unfortunately, I never outgrew this habit) &#8211; &#8220;Yeah, J, why not? Imagine all those dreamy Seniors tackling you to the ground.&#8221;  Jordan chocked on whatever he just put in his mouth, gave me an evil stare and quickly left the table.  As everyone got silent, I wanted to stick my foot in my mouth and choke on it to change the focus, but it was too late.  When i think back to it, however, I don&#8217;t even think my stupid comment was that obvious, but clearly Jordan wasn&#8217;t ready for these type of pronouncements or jokes.  Neither were his parents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>But back to Xander..  Did he decide to come out to me at 2AM?  But the more i stared at the picture, the less oxygen I had under the new thick comforter that we just got at Kmart last week, the more I wished i could say that all this rouge and ridiculous make-up made him look less manly or less brute…</strong></p>
<p><strong>He and I became friends when we were ten.  I started fifth grade and he was the new kid that year.  He was athletic and very funny;  popular with the girls, so for a while, I didn&#8217;t approach him.  I was always easily intimidated by popularity.  Towards the middle of the year our class went on our annual field trip &#8211; to an ice-skating rink.  While my friend Sarah and I were holding on to each other, desperately trying to stay upright, she pointed out that he was looking at me.  I wanted to be half as cool as the other girls he hung out with, so I inquired: &#8220;What are you staring at?&#8221;  He shrugged and skated off.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Back on the school bus he plopped right next to me before Sarah could say a word in protest.  &#8220;Your mom is really nice,&#8221; he said, and I found out that his older brother was in my mom&#8217;s class at the technical school down the street from our house, where my mom held her second job to pay for the house after my dad left us.  I don&#8217;t remember what else we talked about that day but our friendship progressed.  We walked to school and from school and sat together at lunch.  Sometimes he carried my backpack and at other times he hit me on the head with it.  We usually went to his house to do homework but ended up playing board games on top of an old wooden storage cabinet, so his younger brother Finn couldn&#8217;t get to us and steal all the game pieces.   When we got sick of board games we got more adventurous.  Sometimes, we jumped from the top of the storage cabinet across the room onto his sofa bed.  One time Xander missed, hit his head on the metal bed-frame and ended up in that same bed for three weeks with a severe concussion.  And it wasn&#8217;t even his first concussion, as he was proud to announce in class, three weeks later. Two years prior to the jumping incident, he slipped while blatantly ignoring the stupid sign &#8220;No Running&#8221; at the kiddie pool at the Y, rattled his brains quite a bit against the old cracked tile and ended up in the hospital for a while. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>For three weeks, I brought him homework every afternoon but mostly stories of what happened at school while he was missing all the fun. I lay next to him for what seemed like an eternity, we were eleven, have been best friends for almost two years, and it didn&#8217;t seem awkward, except one time.  While watching some old movie on the vcr his dad only  let him have in his room for the time that he was on bed rest, we fell asleep.  When we woke up, his mom was standing over us saying that it was very late and time for me to go home.  I felt as though I was caught doing something wrong, I just wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was.  Other than that aforementioned moment that as a child, I desperately tried to erase from my memory; I would shudder nervously when it would creep back up to the forefront of my recollection of memorable recent events; the three weeks on his sofa with as much potato chips as we wanted and more movies than we have seen in the entire year prior were nothing but unabashed joy (at least to me, as I was not the one with a severe concussion).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>And then I remembered.  Four summers ago, when Gaby was only 2 and my husband and I took her and our older son and drove down to the Outer Banks for a week in August. My brother came there too with his daughter, he and his third wife were on the brink of divorce, and we shared a small house in Corolla right on the beach.   We ran into Xander during our second night there while scanning the menu at the door of one of those seemingly plain looking restaurants that end up costing a fortune because they are the hidden treasure of the islands that are not so hidden anymore.  Gaby was crying because she missed her nap, and because my husband and I had a big fight in the car on the way to dinner, and it always took her a long time to calm down.  It still does.  Last week, her first grade teacher told her that she can&#8217;t chase boys during recess because its unladylike and because it will make boys not like her, she cried from 11am until the time I picked her up.  Her teacher, Mrs. B, told me that I need to show her to a specialist, because no normal child can cry for three hours because of a meaningless comment.  But, anyway, Gaby was crying and my husband was trying to read the menu and decide whether or not we will have enough money to last through the remaining 5 days if we eat at this particular establishment.  Then I turned around and saw Xander and a skinny blonde woman in a lime spaghetti-strap dress with a white cardigan neatly thrown over her shoulders.  My first thought was that I don&#8217;t remember last time I wore white.  My second thought was interrupted with Xander&#8217;s arms around me &#8211; &#8220;Quit stalking me, T&#8221; &#8211; he laughed loud in my ear and pressed me just long enough for me to realize he smelled the same, a cocktail of hay thats been out in the sun too long, oranges and childhood.  He always called me T, even though I always thought that Tina is already short enough.  We had dinner and went home to put Gaby to bed. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>That night my husband and my son watched Mighty Ducks on tv, while I washed the dishes and thought of a night in November when I was walking home from school and ran into Xander holding Ellie&#8217;s hand.  I didn&#8217;t expect it to feel the way it did, because it was he first time I felt this proverbial ground disappear below my feet…I struggled to find my balance and when I did, I asked them how they were doing?  Ellie looked beautiful.  Her cheeks were flushed from the November cold and the lack of warm clothing.  She was wearing a tight black hoodie unzipped, revealing a white fitted t-shirt with some perfectly sparkling design and great jeans that I only ever saw in teen magazines.  Everyone knew that Ellie was &#8216;experienced&#8217; with boys.  There was even gossip that she got her experience from her mom&#8217;s second husband.  But to this day, I hope it was only jealousy fueling the imagination of my classmates, and not real events.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>After that November day, Xander and I saw each other less and less. I ran into him with various girls and in various compromising positions and after a while I stopped noticing it as much.  Only that November evening got imprinted, perhaps, because my mom couldn&#8217;t afford warm clothes that year, but I wasn&#8217;t cool enough to go around without them like Ellie, and who was I kidding, my mom would never let me…long story short, my mom bought a long winter coat from our 45-year-old neighbor Anne. There they were &#8211; impeccably dressed, holding hands and there I was &#8211; in Anne&#8217;s old grey coat that reached all the way to the ground but couldn&#8217;t hide me from the pain.  My mom never did find out why i cried all night in my room and why i never again wore that coat no matter how much she threatened to ground me indefinitely. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Towards the end of our week in Corolla, my husband and my brother invited Xander and his wife to our rental house for some drinks; a small goodbye gathering to celebrate the end of our vacation and a big reason to drink which neither my husband nor my brother could ever refuse.  The house was tiny, space limited and the louder the men got the more scared were the kids.  I sympathized because I very well remembered that long before my dad left, he used to drink and behave in a way that frightened five-year-old me without really giving any reason, other than the fact that he acted differently that the dad i knew.  Girls are always more sensitive and more easily frightened, so I gave Gaby and my brother&#8217;s daughter my makeup case to distract them from the drunken state of their fathers.  I don&#8217;t remember how Xander ended up as the Gaby and her older cousin&#8217;s first client but he ended up lying on the floor while a toddler and a kindergartener were applying his makeup. My brother&#8217;s daughter said that he needs to gel his hair back so he looks like a beautiful girl, which is when Xander&#8217;s patience ran out and he said, &#8220;Enough girls, let me talk to grownups for a bit.&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t want Gaby to start her wailing so I took the cap off of my brother&#8217;s head and placed it backwards on Xander&#8217;s head.  I was stunned at how manly he looked with all this make up on, his features were blatantly staring at me reminding me of everything that pulled me back to my childhood, when no one woke me up six times in one night and when I thought that I will grow up and be famous.  He was beautiful &#8211; strong and so familiar.  I held back my breathe but must have been very obvious because I noticed that he was looking directly at me.  I thought that I shouldn&#8217;t have had that second glass of Asti because I was seeing things.  I don&#8217;t remember how Xander and I ended up alone in the kitchen, but there we were and it was just us, not counting the loud commotion just a thin wall away.   He walked towards me and I thought he would ask me if I ever regretted not being with him, the way beautiful, glossy haired heroines always get asked in the end of sappy romantic films, my husband and I sometimes see at the cinema on Fridays when our neighbor agrees to watch the kids….But he didn&#8217;t say anything.  He put his entire hand on my hair and firmly pressed against my head.   He moved his hand down along the length of my hair and played with the strands for a mere second before stepping back as we both heard footsteps.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>I didn&#8217;t know that someone took a picture of him that day.  And a blurry closeup too.  He is staring right in the phone camera, his brown eyes laughing and piercingly intense at the same time.  It must have been his wife who took the picture because I doubt my brother or my husband would text him the shot, as neither is big on texting.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I turn off my phone.  I think off putting it on airplane mode, but am worried that the light will wake my husband and baby.  The comforter is no longer over my head and I can breathe.  The air feels cold against my overheated face and shoulders.  I must have been starved for oxygen because i just lose myself in this sensation for a while and think about how little we value things that are basic and given and always right here, just like this fresh cool air…   </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My eyelids finally rested and gradually my eyes were comforted by the darkness. My body was finally about to taste comfort after lingering hours of frustrating attempts to fall asleep, but then I heard it. I heard my phone ring, it was 2 a.m. Slowly, I wrapped my fingers around my phone and with so much effort tried to open my somnolent eyes. I saw his name and all the questions in the world raced through my brain, and for a second the only thing I heard were my heart beats. What could he possibly want at this time? Was he trying to ruin all the efforts I&#8217;ve put into deleting every second of happiness I&#8217;ve breathed while in his arms, every tear of sadness that burned my soul, every heartbeat that emphasized that I loved him more than I could love anything or anyone ?</p>
<p>A simple text that is yet to be seen. Yet to be discovered could ruin everything. It could infuriate the waves that I&#8217;ve spent a lifetime soothing, it could awaken them again after I thought they were finally asleep. I slide my frightened thumb across the screen, while my whole body is in agony. It&#8217;s a picture; a picture of us. A picture of a resplendent past, that once succeeded at making a despondent person see with eyes full of faith and dreams. A past where the fairytales I watched as a child were at the palm of my hands. For minutes that seemed like a lifetime I stared at our smiles, trying to figure out what went wrong. Trying to understand how our happiness could vanish, how all this laughter turned into emptiness within a fraction of a second. Attempting to figure out how all the meanings underlying his touch disappeared, where does it all go?</p>
<p>He then emerged into our room, and said with his constantly exhausted voice, looking at me like a damaged child &#8220;Remember that day? When I proposed to you? It was a beautiful day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a tear peeking through the edges of my eyes, I nod and place the phone where it belongs. I feel his warm body rest next to me. Yet I feel like there are thousands of miles separating us, a thousand screams blocking his voice. I place my head softly on my pillow and play back the moments where I was naive enough to think it could get better. I think about all the times that he promised me that he&#8217;d change. Yet all I can see now is a future full of broken promises and flooded with tragic disappointments. </p></p>
