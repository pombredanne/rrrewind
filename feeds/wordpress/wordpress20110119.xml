			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember when you had to put film in a camera to take pictures?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My first camera was plastic and gray and flat and had a picture of the Go-Bots emblazoned on the top.  <a href="http://schlabadoo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110116-090709.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="20110116-090709.jpg" src="http://schlabadoo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110116-090709.jpg?w=179&#038;h=240" alt="" width="179" height="240" /></a>The Go-Bots were fictional cartoon robots that were like a poor man’s Transformers and had nothing to do with the camera&#8217;s functioning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My Go-Bots camera, like all cameras at the time, required film to take pictures.  The film was rolled up inside of a cartridge and contained a limited number of pictures. The number of pictures ranged from 12 to perhaps 48 at the outer limits.  There were no film cartridges that took 500 pictures, at least not at the film kiosks where I was getting ripped off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The film cartridge that my camera required was in the shape of two small tubes connected by a flat plastic piece.  It looked like a little Torah scroll.  Taking a flash picture required buying a cartridge of flash bulbs, which looked like a miniature apartment building made of clear plastic.<a href="http://schlabadoo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20110116-090709.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One memory of using my Go-Bots camera stands above all others.  In 1989 my parents took me to see the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan.  I was not old enough to drink heavily so I really felt the cold.  The only thing that kept me from landing on Planet Whine was my Go-Bots camera and the promise it held for me of a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem was that my allowance afforded me only one roll of 27-shot film.  Even were there exactly 27 floats—and there were far more than that—I would have no chance to take different angles of a float I found particularly compelling.  So I would have to choose.  I could not take pictures of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For each float that approached I employed a three-pronged analysis.  First, how many pictures do I have left?  Second, is this better than what I have already seen?  And third, given how many floats are likely to come by, is this particular float picture-worthy?  Some things, like the many marching bands that went marching by, were easy to pass up…unless there was something unique about it, like a particularly corpulent trumpeter.  Other things, however, were closer calls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One such close call was a float of friendly dinosaurs in various colors.  “How cool,” I said to myself.  “I simply must preserve these dinosaurs.”<em> </em>And there went 1/27<sup>th</sup> of my film.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I regretted my decision as soon as the shutter closed.  Not even a giant blown-up Woody Woodpecker could free my mind from my bad decision.  “Why did I waste a picture on those stupid dinosaurs?” I asked myself.  “The dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago.  Those were probably just people dressed up in dinosaur costumes.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still unable to accept my own mistake, I started taking pictures of things that were even less picture-worthy than the people dressed up as dinosaurs, as if to show the cosmos that my original decision was correct.  I wasted irreplaceable shots on blown-up cartoon characters that did not have their own show, washed-up celebrities whose last work had been when I was an embryo, and a funnel-cake that someone had obviously found disappointing and thrown in the gutter.  The funnel cake had been stepped on, but I could not even tell if the person who had bought the funnel cake was the same person who had stepped on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was still in denial when the grand finale float approached.  The float that we were all waiting for.  The float that bridged an okay holiday to the only holiday that kids actually cared about.  The shouts of children and adults alike presaged the appearance of that greatest of floats…<em>Santa!  Mommy, I see him!  It’s Santa!  Santa!  Santa!!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a well-known fact that Santa Claus is the final float at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.  That meant I had made it on my one roll of film.  Just one more picture and all my mistakes would be forgiven.  But when I pressed on the picture-taking button I got nothing.  I was out of pictures.  My hubris had cost me a picture of the most important float.  I had blundered at the critical moment.  During the long, long car ride home I kept replaying the events in my mind.  A hundred times I saved myself from clicking a picture of the dinosaurs and took pictures of Santa from many angles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That would never happen today.  Had the year been 2009 instead of 1989 I would have had a digital camera with a 300 gigabyte SD flash whatever and could have taken as many pictures as I wanted, of anything, and still had plenty left over for the Big S.  I could have deleted those pictures of the dinosaurs the moment I realized I did not want them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I now have a digital camera, and I have used that digital camera to take thousands of pictures, pictures that, along with the ones I took on film with my Go-Bots camera, allow me to relive the moments of my life, good and bad, happy and sad, again and again for as long as I live.  Pictures that I have not looked at once since I took them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Thanks to Carly Kulig for the topic.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">London was so amazing! Right now I&#8217;m back in Bordeaux, France&#8230; Reminiscing with all of the photographs I took! My favorites were the photographs I took of buildings around the city, namely Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square&#8230; They&#8217;re just so&#8230; Intense and opulent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">London was such an unforgettable gift! It was the biggest surprise for me this year! Actually, I received the airline tickets in the mail with a guide book, and didn&#8217;t know what to say! &#8211; It was such a huge surprise!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4464" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367427471_aa7a6abfbd_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being in the middle of all the crazy British hustle and bustle was an amazing feeling! I&#8217;ve got quite  a few London highlights to write about too! Like our night at MoMo&#8217;s, a very tasteful Moroccan tea house, as well as Gauguin&#8217;s art exhibition&#8230; In three words: It was incredible! * I still can&#8217;t believe I just <em>&#8220;went to London for the weekend!&#8221;</em> Europe is so convenient for traveling! I wouldn&#8217;t mind going to Rome to visit my friend Shamira, or perhaps Barcelona. Although, Malta and Venice look incredible as well. &#8211; Travel always gets the better of me!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the mean time, here is a montage of my favorite London photos from this weekend! Isn&#8217;t it all quite a scene?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4465" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367427911_125e4c58c7_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- The center of London&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4466" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368038678_f4b008550d_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- Beautiful water features at Trafalgar square. Isn&#8217;t it stunning?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4468" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368040752_1527fd6a3d_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- Chanel on every lamp post around London&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4469" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368035550_1cb92de402_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- Royal guards. I don&#8217;t know how they manage to stay so still for hours. This photo was taken outside Prince Charles residence. All quite serious, yet interesting.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4472" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367434433_d8e41798df_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- An intricate chandelier that I found above my head in Kensington&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4473" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367431295_23d36eff9b_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- Across from Big Ben! The weather in London was so cold, but it was worth every minute of it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4474" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368040026_07c14f6314_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- Where the queen celebrates her birthday every year&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4476" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368031862_4424db1f17_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- My conceptual view of a water fountain in Hyde Park. I like the colors. It feels so much like winter.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4478" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368039134_9a8ba998f1_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- The National Gallery. Some of the worlds most famous art work. (I&#8217;m looking forward to a weekend in Paris soon!)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4479" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5368043050_226bb35798_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- I took this photo of &#8216;Big Ben&#8217; through a fence, thus the turquoise pattern around the outside of my lens. London inspired me for so many of my photographs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4481" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367426531_eaa1e8024e_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- Brian walking around the corner from Buckingham palace. I took some new *favorite black and white photos in London too, which I can&#8217;t wait to write about. Black and white photos are sometimes my favorite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4502" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5367416541_2ce8ecb733_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- The sign near the place where we stayed and caught the underground every day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">p.s We purchased fourteen bottles of wine in London to bring back!! There&#8217;s talk of a tasting coming up, which I&#8217;m looking forward to. Anyhow, fourteen bottles of wine calls for fourteen delicious meals in France and fun, fun, <em>fun!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bonne nuit,</p>

<p></strong>Seriously, I felt the &#8217;80s nostalgia pretty bad this week. It was the 25th anniversary of the <em>Challenger </em>tragedy. At the time, I was a precocious seven, and pretty annoyed that my cartoon shows were pre<strong>-</strong>empted for news coverage. I know better now, of course, and my heart is with those who lost loved ones on that terrible day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">On a happier note, I never get quite so nostalgic as I do thinking about the wonderful, awesome decade that was the 1980s. (Who gets all misty-eyed and says, &#8220;Man, I really miss the &#8217;90s?) Nobody. The &#8217;90s were the hangover to the party that was the excessive &#8217;80s. Isn&#8217;t it hard to believe a decade synonymous with excess had the NES as its pinnacle of gaming awesomeness, the LeBaron as a cool convertible car, Yuban coffee for caffeine addicts on the go? Weird, huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I really knew I was a child of the &#8217;80s when, on my dad&#8217;s retirement celebration, I was asked to give him a piece of advice. The first thing that leaped to mind was &#8220;Be excellent to each other.&#8221; Honestly. No Gandhi or Marcus Aurelius or Ronald Reagan&#8230;Bill and Ted. Bodacious!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img title="Wyld Stallyns" src="http://io9.com/assets/resources/2008/04/WildStallyns.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bill S. Preston (Esq.) and Ted &quot;Theodore&quot; Logan</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">Another shocker to my readers&#8230;I did not in fact grow up watching <em>The A-Team </em>as a child despite my fanaticism for it now. I do, however, distinctly remember eating Mr. T cereal at some point and being friends with a kid who had a B.A. Baracus action figure. I really pity the fool who didn&#8217;t. That notwithstanding, there&#8217;s a lot that makes me all mushy-gushy warm-fuzzy about the Decade of Reagan. In no particular order:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*The neighborhood pizza parlor (remember those? Even Pizza Hut, when it still had the eat-in locations?) with the totally awesome arcade and the ride-on horse for a penny. I used to save up coins or beg my parents just so I could indulge in some Asteroids or Ms. Pac-Man every Friday night. And the pizza was really good, too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*Pop culture was at just the right levels of ubiquity. You could play Indiana Jones or <em>Star Wars</em> with your friends, but you had to use your imagination, too. There was no such thing as online shopping or super-deluxe replica lightsabers back then. Just a stick would do nicely for your pretend adventures in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*Kids&#8217; cartoons were more than just talking heads or shameless toy commercials&#8230;at least some of them. (People forget that the Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake, among others, were once properties of the American Greetings company.) I still try to catch reruns of <em>Chip &#8216;N Dale Rescue Rangers </em>whenever I can.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*There were less media outlets&#8230;and more civility. People always talk about how &#8220;back in their day,&#8221; things were more civil. While I can&#8217;t say that I know whether this is true, it just seems that way. Reality shows, the blogosphere, and webcams have allowed anyone and everyone to express their opinions to a live audience. I&#8217;m not advocating a return to the Big Three networks alone, but it would be nice to sit back and listen to the voices sometimes instead of just being bombarded from all sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*Fewer huge cookie-cutter subdivisions meant a greater sense of community, along with a stronger sense of identity. I fondly remember trick-or-treating when I was growing up, and although every one of those houses was different, just about all of them had a family I knew. I could also walk on the sidewalk or on the street without fear of getting run over or attacked by a dog. This wasn&#8217;t some idealized, <em>Truman Show </em>utopia. It was my hometown, and I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s changed beyond recognition in the 20-plus years since I left.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*The TV shows, because of greater competition, were just <em>cooler</em>. <em>The A-Team. The Cosby Show. Dallas. The Wide World of Sports. </em>Icons, not just filler. Think of how the level of talent goes down in professional sports leagues when more franchises are added. Who wants to watch half the garbage that passes for network programming today? Not me. Back then, it really was must-see TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*Speaking of sports: during the Olympics, you actually had somebody you rooted for, and somebody you rooted against. Because of the collapse of the Iron Curtain, this is no longer so. Can you imagine <em>Rocky IV </em>being made today, with Ivan Drago being&#8230;Chinese? Venezuelan? Iranian? Neither can I.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*Less of the nutty political correctness meant happier, better-adjusted people. My late grandfather told all sorts of un-PC jokes in my presence when I was little. Did this make me grow up to be an Archie Bunker-style bigot? No. The main difference was that my parents took it upon themselves to teach me what was acceptable and unacceptable to say or do&#8230;NOT the government or some well-meaning but clueless entity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*On that same thread, it was OK for kids to express a little bit of healthy anger. I call this the Wile E. Coyote conundrum. Back in the day, when most of the cartoons were of the <em>Tom and Jerry</em> or <em>Looney Tunes </em>&#8220;ultra-violent&#8221; variety, did we hear about as many school shootings, violent rampages, or random assaults? I&#8217;m sure they took place, but I doubt in the numbers that we tragically see today. Kids have aggression. Let them duke it out on the playground once in a while. It&#8217;s healthy and natural.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*There were a lot more heroes. Again, this might just be a generational phenomenon, but when I look at the comparisons, they&#8217;re just not there. Sarah Palin is no Lady Margaret Thatcher, and Barack Obama is no Ronald Reagan. I distinctly remember having heroes back them, whether in the world of politics, sports (Tony Gwynn, John Stockton), or television (Bob Barker, Harry Caray). They just don&#8217;t seem to make &#8216;em like that anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I could probably think of a thousand reasons why I really miss the &#8217;80s. Is my life better, safer, more convenient now than it was back then? Probably. But I wouldn&#8217;t take a thousand iPads for one warm, happy memory of Pizza Hut collectible glasses, Asteroids, and Ronald Reagan in the White House. Those truly were the days&#8230;my salad days.</p>

<p>It’s one of those weeks when things have to be done fast.  Several meetings, presentations, special occasions, and expectations.  That’s how it goes sometimes.  So what can we do when we have to move fast?</p>
<p><strong>Don’t respond too quickly to emails.</strong> I got an email this morning that annoyed me.  I knew I was tired, so as a gift to the sender, I did not reply the way I wanted to.  Thankfully, it was just Monday, so I remembered that Sunday’s sermon challenged us to see if we can follow the “golden rule” for just 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Do smile more than you usually do</strong>.  I’ve heard that the simple act of smiling makes us feel better.  When I’m super tired, I say out loud in my brain, “Smile.  It makes you look more put together!”  Try it.  It really does work.</p>
<p><strong>Do say something nice on purpose.</strong> When exhausted, I usually try to form positive thoughts and express them as much as possible.  A good start is, “Good morning!  Isn’t this weather wonderful?”</p>
<p><a title="Smile to Improve Your Mood" href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/living-well/articles/2010/12/01/smile-to-improve-your-mood" target="_blank">Brain research</a> shows that positive thoughts really do improve mood.  I’d like to ramble on, but my time is up!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was surprised to hear the words coming from his mouth only because they were so similar to words that I had used a week earlier in blogging about my community. &#8220;There is so much bad news in the world, that it&#8217;s great to have this garden &#8211; this is good.&#8221; Here I was in Miami Beach, FL seeking a good story and here was a good story and someone who feels exactly as I do telling it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2869" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://agrigirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/victory-garden.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2869" title="Victory Garden" src="http://agrigirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/victory-garden.jpg?w=500&#038;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Victory Garden</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-2690"></span>This is one of the few spots East of the Mississippi where there is no snow right now. And, I was here to meet up with wonderful friends who each came from a different direction. Miami beach is both hip and tranquil. You can find an abundance of hot spots or a still zen setting or in the case of Agrigirl, you can seek out community.</p>
<p>The Joseph J. Vallari Victory Garden is a community garden dedicated to the memory of the men and women who were stationed in training camps in Miami Beach during WWII. The garden is under the jurisdiction of the City of Miami Parks and Recreation but operates under the care of a dedicated team of community volunteers.  I reached out to one of those volunteers, Jerome Duran, via the Victory Garden facebook page.</p>
<div id="attachment_2870" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://agrigirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/jerome-duran.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2870" title="Jerome Duran" src="http://agrigirl.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/jerome-duran.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jerome Duran, Victory Garden Community Board Member</p></div>
<p>Their garden has about 50 plots and for the first time in a while, it is full thanks to the volunteers who take this endeavor seriously. One of the biggest issues is that many people see their plot as an extension of private property. Hence, if there is an individual who is letting weeds go rampant or not using best planting practices, it&#8217;s often difficult to achieve resolution. One thing that Jerome and his comrades have found that works well is the idea of a buddy system. When someone is struggling, they are paired up with someone else who understands basic gardening principles.</p>
<p>The second Saturday of each month is a community work-day where weeds are picked, marigolds are dead-headed and general clean-up takes place. The marigold seeds are spread in boxes throughout in order to act as natural pest repellants. They cultivate worms for sharing and harvest rainwater although their current configuration of pulling rainwater in from one of the nearby roofs may in fact, bring about too much salt &#8211; given their proximity to the ocean. Wind and salt are elements that this group has to combat as both are soil drying.</p>
<p>Jerome has been gardening long enough to know what grows well and what doesn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s also zeroed in on the importance of soil preparation and works his frequently. And during the time that he&#8217;s been a participant in this garden, he&#8217;s noticed a change. People are hanging out at the garden. In fact, he views it as so central to his community that he&#8217;s working to get benches and picnic tables installed.  In addition, he&#8217;s planted fruit trees around the garden that he&#8217;s hoping will have a future yield. Most importantly, Jerome eats from his garden every day and has such an abundance in his plot that he gives fresh produce to friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>The <a title="USDA Community Gardens" href="http://afsic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=2&amp;tax_level=2&amp;tax_subject=301&amp;topic_id=1444">USDA</a> has a wealth of resources for individuals or neighborhoods that are interested in exploring the Community Garden concept. As evidenced in Miami Beach, Community gardens can beautify neighborhoods and have the power to help bring neighbors closer together. As the Desert Botanical Garden explores a Community Gardening Initiative this year, I&#8217;m interested in learning more.</p>
<p>Do you have a community garden where you live or is it a concept that you might explore in the future?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://danjurak.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/match1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2822" style="margin:5px;" title="match1" src="http://danjurak.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/match1.jpg?w=497&#038;h=330" alt="" width="497" height="330" /></a>We all see color differently. Depending upon the time of day, cloud cover, pollution, etc, the colors of the landscape are constantly changing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Probably the worst time of day for many reasons is the middle when the sun is high and we see daylight as &#8220;clean&#8221;, that is without a cast. Of course if you have done any shooting at all you&#8217;ve seen that the camera isn&#8217;t as forgiving as our eyes and brain are. Shoot on an overcast or cloudy day and your photos will no doubt have a blue or cyan cast.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I stopped worrying about the &#8220;right&#8221; color a long time ago. Unless you are shooting for a catalog where a client needs to see the colors of a product exactly as they appear, don&#8217;t waste your time trying to match gray cards or the like. Landscapes are about YOUR interpretation of the land. It&#8217;s about how YOU see it and how YOU wish to present it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve touched on it before but so few people seem to know about it that I wanted to write about it again. Color matching in Photoshop.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">With color matching you are borrowing colors from a source photo to your final image. For that reason, it&#8217;s a good idea to have a variety of photos with different color casts. Find photos with varying shades of red or magenta or blue because the exact shade of the source image will transfer to target image. For example, if I want to make my sky more intense, I find a photograph that has the blue color that I like. Using color matching, that blue will go into the blue and no other color.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It takes a bit of experimentation to be able to start predicting which photos will give you the results that you like. The beauty of this method is that it costs nothing. No filters to buy or carry around and get lost in the bush. With photographs that haven&#8217;t been shot with special effects filters you have more control and it only takes a few seconds to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To give you an idea of how the colors can be introduced to a photo I&#8217;ve included a few examples below.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you&#8217;re skeptical about this and how much time it takes to get these results, it took me under five minutes to adjust and save all of these photos.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Did your blazing sunset not photograph the way you had hoped? Color matching can give you golds and oranges that you never believed were possible. You can be heavy handed with the color or add just a hint. Your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Happy shooting,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Dan</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://americaeats.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20101102-_mg_9834.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126" title="20101102-_MG_9834" src="http://americaeats.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/20101102-_mg_9834.jpg?w=600&#038;h=399" alt="" width="600" height="399" /></a></p>
<p>Like many people in my generation, I did not grow up in a household  with a mom who cooked.  On the occasion that my mom did cook, it was  always her specialty: Spaghetti.  She would make a huge bowl of it and  we would spend the rest of the week eating the leftovers.  Spaghetti and  I now have a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Since cooking was a rare event in my childhood, in adulthood I have  had to find alternative means to a culinary education. As my fast food  generation discovers the slow food movement and the current state of the  economy tightens everyone&#8217;s budgets, it seems that more and more young  adults are expressing interest in learning the art of a quality home  cooked meal.</p>
<p>A group of 20 somethings in Phoenix, Arizona created a solution to  their desire for a home-cooked-meal education.  They found a couple of  mentors who were happy to share their gained knowledge with them. Once a  month they gather in the kitchen of Terry Peterman, and with the help  of her long time friend Mary Laskin, the 20 somethings are instructed on  the tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>The menu changes each month, building on the lessons from the  previous dinner.  This months menus consisted of Vegetable Ragu with  grilled Polenta squares, a fresh spinach salad with homemade vinaigrette  dressing, and homemade pumpkin ice-cream with ginger snap cookies.  It  did not take more than 45 minutes to prep, cook and serve the meal.</p>
<p>The art of the home cooked meal use to be passed from mother to  daughter, from generation to generation.  This monthly gathering is a  fun alternative for those of us who grew up on t.v. dinners and the  oh-so exciting  giant bowl of spaghetti.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no way around it. Art must take risks and risk risks rejection. Is rejection the dark side of art?</p>
<p>You throw your soul on the page, on the canvas, in the work, and then you stand all naked and vulnerable while the gatekeeper says yah or nay. Mostly nay. Even when you&#8217;re good, you get lots of rejection.</p>
<p>I just got a doozy. The person rejected my work&#8211;and told me I was an enormously gifted writer. Apparently they were either being over-the-top polite or being gifted isn&#8217;t enough. Both, I suspect.</p>
<p>Art is oftentimes cutting edge. It&#8217;s new. Fresh. Startling. This isn&#8217;t always accepted. While art is constantly changing and asking more of us, the world tends to want to reproduce what has already been established. It&#8217;s an emperor&#8217;s clothes  &#8220;me, too,&#8221; mentality. And yet when something new catches on, it&#8217;s wildfire.</p>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh suffered this fate. He wasn&#8217;t a realist. He wasn&#8217;t an impressionist, so what was he? The art world wasn&#8217;t willing to take a chance. He died in 1890, and yet look what came next&#8211;Picasso, Matisse, and the ushering in of modern art. Vincent was in many ways the guy who cracked the door.</p>
<p>The other aspect of selling art is the market. What&#8217;s selling? Are you, the artist marketable? Is your art hitting the market at just the right time?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kismet. It&#8217;s preparation meets opportunity meets timing.</p>
<p>So much you as an artist will never be in control of.</p>
<p>The only thing you&#8217;re in control of is the choice to create what stirs your soul. To stay true to you. To be flexible. To be on the edge&#8211;your edge. To challenge yourself. To question.</p>
<p>And then to present yourself and your art to the world.</p>
<p>Yes, you have to put it all out there. Put all of you out there.</p>
<p>Dark or not, risk is the only way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How long before we begin to hear this refrain?  Maybe from students, maybe from &#8220;experts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given developments in today&#8217;s world, and they keep coming, it&#8217;s not far-fetched to think that the present traditional model is simply not up to the task, is outdated, and out-of-sync with the needs to modern life.</p>
<p>We have to get our view up to a higher level to see this.  We have to get out of the myopic perspective that is leading us into the abyss.   The &#8220;fixes&#8221; and &#8220;reforms&#8221; that are being discussed are all old-school ideas based on a system that is out of date and no longer applies to the world we live in.  Look at the pace of change today, look at the shifting landscape of business and our culture.  We are in the midst of significant change &#8211; not just a little &#8220;faster&#8221; or &#8220;newer&#8221;, like for the past 50 years&#8230; no, we&#8217;re in the midst of significant change in how things happen and how our lives function.</p>
<p>Those who will do well in this world, indeed those who will LEAD in this world are those who will be prepared for it.  Preparation requires solid thinking skills, which means thinking in principles and thinking creatively.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Industry-t.html">story</a> in the NY Times Magazine spoke about innovation leadership and reported that &#8220;we need help thinking&#8221;.  The business world is paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to consultants &#8211; the article calls them &#8220;brains for hire&#8221; &#8211; who can &#8220;innovate&#8221; for them &#8211; and the form of innovation is creative thinking.  That&#8217;s it.  There simply aren&#8217;t many good people who can do this &#8220;in house&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is why &#8220;school&#8221; is outdated.  School as we&#8217;ve known it maybe served a purpose 50-100 years ago, I&#8217;m still not convinced it was the best model even for that world though, but it surely is wrong-headed today.  We need an education system that prepares for today: which means <em>preparing students for how to prepare.</em> See the difference?  We can no longer simply prepare for the present time because by the time students get out the other end twenty years later they are already &#8220;obsolete&#8221;.  We need to prepare students for the world that they will encounter in a time when that world doesn&#8217;t yet exist (!).  We need to equip them to solve problems that we haven&#8217;t even identified yet.  Scary?  Not in the least.  We&#8217;re up to this task- it&#8217;s called THINKING, and it&#8217;s the one thing that traditional education hasn&#8217;t done a very good job of &#8220;teaching&#8221;.</p>
