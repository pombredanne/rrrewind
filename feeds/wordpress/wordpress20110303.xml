			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">I’ve gotten over the coconut, but obviously I’m still into blood oranges.  I had some freshly pressed juice left over and was searching my brain for ways to use it up.  I can do quite intricate stuff with food (okay, maybe I haven’t shown that too much here, so I might have to prove it sometime soon&#8230;), but I have confessed before that I like easy options in cooking.  So I came up with the easiest one – panna cotta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3584.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1560" title="Blood Orange Panna Cotta 001" src="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3584.jpg?w=277&#038;h=368" alt="" width="277" height="368" /></a><a href="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3609.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1561" title="Blood Orange Panna Cotta 002" src="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3609.jpg?w=277&#038;h=368" alt="" width="277" height="368" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you get to the recipe, you’ll notice I didn’t use any sugar.  There’s a reason for that.  I forgot it!  Stirring the gelatine into the cream, something kept nagging at the back of my mind, and it took a while to realise I hadn’t used sugar.  However, I opted to not add it after the gelatine, because I had tried the mixture, and it tasted good.  Otherwise, I’d have realised sooner that something was missing&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to enjoying food, I am an advocate for full fat options.  What I enjoy about panna cotta is the cream, so that’s probably also a reason why I didn’t miss the sugar.  I’m not saying you shouldn’t use any – I’d probably add it next time just to taste the difference.  So that’s why I put sugar as optional in the ingredients list below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3686.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1562" title="Blood Orange Panna Cotta 003" src="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3686.jpg?w=461&#038;h=614" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a><em>Blood Orange Panna Cotta with Caramelised Oranges</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 cup / 250 ml cream<br />
½ cup / 125 ml freshly pressed blood orange juice<br />
½ vanilla bean<br />
2 gelatine leaves<br />
25 g sugar (optional)<br />
2 blood oranges, filleted<br />
2 – 3 tbsp brown sugar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Leave gelatine leaves to soak in cold water.  Heat the cream.  Scrape vanilla seeds from bean and add both to the cream.  Once the cream starts boiling, slowly add the blood orange juice.  Stir in sugar, if using.  Simmer for 12 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take pot off the heat, remove and discard vanilla bean.  Squeeze out the gelatine leaves, and stir in with a whisk.   Keep stirring for a minute or so to make sure there aren’t any lumps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fill mixture into jars or receptacles of your choice, and refrigerate for about 4 hours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3699.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1564" title="Blood Orange Panna Cotta 004" src="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3699.jpg?w=461&#038;h=614" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a>To make the caramelised oranges, fillet the blood oranges.  Slowly heat 2 – 3 tbsp sugar in a heavy based pan until it melts.  Once it starts to bubble slightly, add the oranges and stir well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Serve panna cotta topped with the caramelised oranges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3713.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1565" title="Blood Orange Panna Cotta 005" src="http://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pict3713.jpg?w=614&#038;h=461" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>This dessert tastes quite refreshing, in the panna cotta you have the not too tart taste of the blood oranges, and the slightly sweeter caramelised oranges, which is a great combination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And though I like this panna cotta as it is, I would probably do some things differently next time.  As mentioned, I might add sugar to see if it makes a great difference.  Also, my caramelising was not perfect – I let the sugar heat too quickly, so parts of it had become a little bitter (I removed those bits before serving).  Then, what I didn’t mention above, is that instead of 2 gelatine leaves, I added 4, because somehow I had this misconception that adding orange juice to the cream would dilute it too much, so that I’d need to counter that with more gelatine.  Not the case at all.  My panna cotta was a bit firmer than usual, but next time I’ll just use 2 leaves.  But don’t get me wrong – it doesn’t need to be improved, it’s just an option.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that note, I’ll leave you with this Valentine pink dessert&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big source of entertainment at work today was watching the demolition of an abandoned building across the street. My colleagues and I lined up along the windows several times to watch the progress, and we cheered enthusiastically when a big chunk of the roof collapsed.</p>
<p><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/demolition-3529-blog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3457" title="Demolition 3529 BLOG" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/demolition-3529-blog.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Too bad I didn&#8217;t have the presence of mind (or the time) to shoot some  time-lapse photos. It really was fascinating to watch the deconstruction  of the building, to see its hidden structure emerge: The building&#8217;s destruction was actually creating something entirely new.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but draw a parallel when a colleague forwarded a link to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/briandettmer/" target="_blank">Brian Dettmer&#8217;s art</a>.</p>
<p>Dubbed &#8220;<a href="http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/the-book-surgeon-15-pieces" target="_blank">the book surgeon</a>,&#8221; this Georgia-based artist creates intricate sculptures by cutting out portions of old books. Like Michaelangelo, he chips away the parts that don&#8217;t look like his sculpture to reveal the book&#8217;s hidden inner structure:</p>
<p><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3459" title="BrianDettmer1" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3460" title="BrianDettmer3" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=750" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3461" title="BrianDettmer6" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer6.jpg?w=500&#038;h=750" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3462" title="BrianDettmer12" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer12.jpg?w=500&#038;h=750" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a><a href="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer13.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3463" title="BrianDettmer13" src="http://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/briandettmer13.jpg?w=500&#038;h=750" alt="" width="500" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen more beautiful, more mind-boggling proof that destruction and creation often go hand-in-hand.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s still pretty cool and the woods pretty &#8216;stick-y&#8217; here in the northern kingdom.  But hope of new life and springy loveliness has begun to burst forth.  Locally, we have recently discovered the delightful Cambo estate that specialises in the cultivation of snowdrops.  The past few weeks they have been in profusion &#8211; there are little clusters just outside our gate that the wee one exclaims gleefully about each time we pass them.   So on the weekend past, we finally got to take a stroll in the magical wonderland of Cambo gardens.</p>
<p><a href="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/p1000691.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" title="Strolling at Cambo" src="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/p1000691-e1299088457643.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>I love the delicate tenacity of snowdrops &#8211; and they put on a charming show in the moist morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/2011-02-st-andrews.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597" title="Cambo snowdrop glory" src="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/2011-02-st-andrews.jpg?w=490&#038;h=612" alt="" width="490" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>The snowdrop walk ambles down to the sea &#8211; and so Kazuo was in his element, flowers AND seaside in one outing &#8211; perfect!<br />
<a href="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/snowdrops-and-seashells-the-perfect-combo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602" title="Snowdrops and Seashells - the perfect combo!" src="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/snowdrops-and-seashells-the-perfect-combo.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>I am also totally taken by the tiny perfection of the minature irises that are popping up everywhere.  In our neighbourhood in St Louis there were several large beds of standard sized irises that bloomed in early summer that I loved.  But these wee treasures are bursting forth now and come in so many nuanced shades of blue.</p>
<p><a href="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/p1000715.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1605" title="Tiny and perfectly formed irises..." src="http://fionaeason.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/p1000715.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" width="490" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday was another sick day at our house &#8211; the wee guy has been ill with something or other for about 6 weeks now, and consequently no-one has done a full week of work or nursery since I began at the university three weeks ago.  It has been tough&#8230;but he is still able to make a little trek to the gate even with the direst of lurgies.  So we were both delighted to discover this teeny clump of snowdrops halfway down the drive on our wander yesterday.  Spring, you are VERY welcome!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not so many years ago, I had a turning point in my writing career. An &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment. Something made me remember it yesterday and I wanted to share it here—to show how you might think you&#8217;re going one way down a certain path you&#8217;ve carved for yourself, but in fact there&#8217;s another path carved for you. There it is, waiting, glimmering in the near distance. It was your true path all along.</p>
<p>This story is about how I became a YA writer, because I didn&#8217;t start out as one.</p>
<p>My turning point occurred in June of 2007, when I&#8217;d just started a new day job at HarperCollins Children&#8217;s Books. I was a production editor, working on the copyediting team. I was so excited about the job, because I&#8217;d get to work on hardcover YA novels. And I was very serious about the job (so serious, and so determined to do well that I took all the procedural paperwork home in the evenings to study!), but you should also know that on the side, early in the morning and on weekends, I was a writer, too. I wanted to publish my own novels one day. That had been my dream for as long as I could remember, but it sure wasn&#8217;t panning out for me. I&#8217;d gotten my MFA a few years before and at the time I started this new day job I was revising—endlessly, hopelessly, living in a spiral of revising—a novel for adults that I was unable to let go. I could not get an agent for that manuscript. I was very discouraged. But I didn&#8217;t know what else to do, so I kept working on that novel. Or staring at it with gloom and angst and trying to wring from it what was wrong, as if it would one day find it had a mouth and would tell me. (It never did.)</p>
<p>So there I was, starting my new job at a new publishing house, being my Copy Editor Self and pretending my Writer Self didn&#8217;t exist. My boss was this great guy I was excited to work for. And my first couple weeks on staff were spent getting the hang of things, and picking up projects that the other, more experienced production editors had started, so I could learn from what they did. One of the very first projects assigned to me by my boss—the first novel, in fact—was to do work on a book by <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/29411/Laura_Kasischke/index.aspx" target="_blank">Laura Kasischke</a>.</p>
<p>The manuscript had already been copyedited and prepared by another production editor. My task was to simply check the manuscript pages against the bound galley layouts, just to make sure no text had dropped out. I wasn&#8217;t even supposed to read it at this stage. Just make sure everything was in place so ARCs could be printed. A very simple, very quick job.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>And yet I started reading. And then I couldn&#8217;t stop. This book that I was assigned to work on that week was Laura Kasischke&#8217;s second YA novel, called <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Feathered-Laura-Kasischke/?isbn=9780060813178" target="_blank"><em>Feathered</em></a>. And it changed my plan for myself as a writer. Simply put, it changed my life.</p>
<p><a href="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/feathered.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4624" style="margin:5px;" title="Feathered" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/feathered.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Interesting that my boss had assigned me this particular book to work on&#8230; like he knew me or something. But still. I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t want me reading the whole book right then! All he wanted was for me to do the bound galley check, make sure there were no major problems, and move it along. There would be time for a full read later—maybe not even by me, since I was so new. But something happened to me when I was working on those pages.</p>
<p>I read and I remember very clearly looking up, straight into the sun shining through the office window, lighting up my new glossy wooden desk and the bright white proof pages, thinking, <em>I didn&#8217;t know a YA novel could be like this!</em></p>
<p>Thinking, <em>What if</em>—and this would be the first moment I&#8217;d consciously think this—<em>what if <strong>I </strong>wrote a YA novel, too?</em></p>
<p>The book utterly stunned me. After I finished <em>Feathered</em>, I immediately borrowed Laura Kasischke&#8217;s other novel from off the office shelf—her first YA novel, <em>Boy Heaven</em>, first published in 2006—and this book would stun me even more.</p>
<p>Everything changed for me after devouring <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Boy-Heaven-Laura-Kasischke?isbn=9780060813161&amp;HCHP=TB_Boy+Heaven" target="_blank"><em>Boy Heaven</em></a>, something fired up inside me that was personal and growing and growing until it took me over. I was so inspired. So excited. So full of&#8230; possibility.</p>
<p>This, a great change after the low point I&#8217;d hit trying to write—and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite—that manuscript I was working on in my off hours—one that was, in fact, my second attempt at a novel for adults.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4625" style="margin:5px;" title="BoyHeaven" src="http://novaren.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/boyheaven.jpg?w=210&#038;h=300" alt="" width="210" height="300" />I&#8217;d never told myself that I should write a YA novel before this, even though I&#8217;d done work-for-hire writing for kids to help pay my bills. &#8220;My&#8221; writing was for adults, I&#8217;d thought, even though I always wrote about teenagers and from young voices. Writing YA had really never come up—not in all my MFA workshops, though it seems so obvious now. (There wasn&#8217;t a YA concentration, or even classes on writing YA, at that time in my MFA program, so I guess that&#8217;s why it never came up.) All I can say is that it truly hadn&#8217;t occurred to me until I read Laura Kasischke&#8217;s novels.</p>
<p>Reading Laura Kasischke would lead to more eye-opening YA-fever moments: <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316014540" target="_blank"><em>Story of a Girl</em></a>. <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780763632793" target="_blank"><em>Lessons from a Dead Girl</em></a>. <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316014564" target="_blank">Sweethearts</a></em>. <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780061255601" target="_blank"><em>The Blonde of the Joke.</em></a> <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780763632793" target="_blank"><em></em></a> <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525478188" target="_blank"><em>Paper Towns</em></a>. <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316014540" target="_blank"><em></em></a>Months after this, an editor friend who worked upstairs began to lend me YA and middle-grade books (I won&#8217;t call her out, but if she reads this, she&#8217;ll know who she is). Soon enough, I&#8217;d discovered <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781595141880" target="_blank"><em>Thirteen Reasons Why</em></a>. <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780142415573" target="_blank"><em>Wintergirls</em></a>. <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375850868" target="_blank">When You Reach Me</a></em>. And more. More, more, more.</p>
<p>The rest is history, I guess.</p>
<p>I now know why that novel I was endlessly, hopelessly revising when I started that day job was so stalled: I wasn&#8217;t supposed to work on it anymore. There was a reason I <a href="../2006/03/17/thisclose/" target="_blank">couldn&#8217;t get a break</a>. I was supposed to do something else. <a href="http://novaren.wordpress.com/about-imaginary-girls/" target="_blank">This</a>. <a href="http://daninoir.com/" target="_blank">This</a>.</p>
<p>I have my former day job—and my boss, who assigned me that fateful bound galley check—to thank for this. And Laura Kasischke, a poet and a novelist for both adults and young adults—and, so you know, it was hearing about her new adult novel, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/The-Raising-Laura-Kasischke/?isbn=9780062004789" target="_blank"><em>The Raising</em></a>, a novel I must get and devour immediately, that sparked this memory. Whenever I think of <em>Boy Heaven</em> and <em>Feathered</em> I know them as the books that raised the question in me. The challenge. <em>What if I write a YA novel? </em>That was the day this whole new path made itself known to me. The very one that turned me into the writer I am today.</p>
<p><strong>So tell me: Have you had a turning point in your writing life, too? Was there a surprise moment that sparked it?<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago I decided to become a full time photographer. It&#8217;s not something easy to decide but it&#8217;s something we must face at some point when you are working on an artistic field. If you want to make a living out of that you need to give it all your time. I followed my own motto and a sentence I always have in my head (&#8220;your life is yours to create&#8221;) and I jumped to the abysm of the uncertain life. Life is uncertain no matter what you do. And I DO know I want to fill it and write it with light.</p>
<p>So first step. Learn, learn and learn. I&#8217;m attending seminars and workshops to learn what I&#8217;m missing in photography and in business. I&#8217;m learning how to create my own business&#8230; but really&#8230; that&#8217;s just a practical thing to do, that is not going to make you a photographer. YOU are the person, the pillar and &#8211; put it this way &#8211; the product. Your art is what you are. So what really matters is getting better and practice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m creating my business focusing on artistic portrait and wedding photography (want to fight against the classical concept of wedding photography you can find in Spain) so it was a good chance to practice portraits in group when a friend of mine ask me to take photos of him and three friends. We met the morning of a sunny Saturday. Couldn&#8217;t choose the time to meet since we all had to re-schedule our timetables but we did have a perfect time.</p>
<p>I was aware of every single detail in the picture and I tried to think about all the elements I needed to make it &#8220;perfect.&#8221; Lighting, reflections, shadows, bright sun&#8230; I was playing against some of the most hated elements by a photographer. The pictures are not perfect but I got my eye used to look at certain things and technical aspects facing problems and situations I don&#8217;t tend to get into. I planned different things to do with them four, placing them in different parts of the pictures at the same time I gave them a role in the image. I asked my models to define themselves and to define their mates so I could imagine how they would feel comfortable.</p>
<p>We spent a fabulous time, had so much fun, made me LOVE my job. I ended exhausted and excited, I learnt so much that day. And I know I still have to learn A LOT. And I&#8217;m happy about that.</p>
<p>I want to work with colour, now, but they expressly asked me for black&amp;white pictures. That shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for me^^</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5923" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5450106231_215bece472_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I leave for Spain tomorrow, I wanted to write about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris">Notre Dame</a> photographs I took in Paris! I&#8217;ve been to quite a few gothic churches&#8230; But this one is said to be one of the finest examples of French gothic architecture in France, if not Europe!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On my first morning in Paris we drove past the Notre Dame on a city bus and all along the roadside people were selling black and white photographs of <em>Audrey Hepburn</em> and <em>Marilyn Monroe</em>. There were pigeons flying everywhere and against the face of a bridge I could see t-shirts that said &#8220;<em>I Love Paris!</em>&#8221; printed on the front. It was such a nice morning in the city&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From behind glass windows I was awe-struck by everything! I guess you could compare it to the feeling that you feel when you look out the window of an airplane when it lands in a country that you&#8217;ve never been to before!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5925" title="Notre dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5450107183_062bf74de3_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the late afternoon we came back to the center of Paris and saw an urban sunset&#8230; The streets and buildings around the Notre Dame looked terracotta, and the bright red awnings outside café&#8217;s turned into an orange hue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notre Dame at sunset was beautiful! I could see all of the detail outside illuminated&#8230; Amongst the towering archways, pillars and gargoyles, the beautifully carved saints that decorate the gothic building look stunning. All of them have their own facial expressions and they&#8217;re so detailed that you can even see expression lines carved into their hands.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6361" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5476896315_9ac114d55b_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><em>- Charlemagne et ses levdes </em>feels like it guards the central square outside where hundreds of pigeons flock&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6369" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5450108947_0fc78c042e_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p>- There are pigeons everywhere in Paris&#8230; They remind me of <a href="http://dakotad.com/2011/01/22/london-city-life/">moments outside Hyde park in London</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5926" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5450108249_013fbe11fa_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were my favorite statues outside Notre Dame! The female saint holding a flower in her hand reminds me of buddhist statues that I saw in Thailand. The way her hand is carved looks somewhat like <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/mudras.htm">Buddhist mudra</a>, even though it&#8217;s catholic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5927" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5450717238_fc8263dc90_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>- What really <em>amazed</em> me about the Notre Dame is that it was completed in the year: <em>1345</em>&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6362" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5476895531_652af47759_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">- Angels, saints and gothic patterns decorate the stained glass windows&#8230; This one is guarded by a statue of Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6363" title="Notre Dame de Paris" src="http://dakotad.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/5477494786_dfc0a91ceb_z.jpg?w=640&#038;h=427" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the wooden doors are covered with detail!! These patterns are so intricate, they remind me of the breathtaking <em>henna</em> patterns that you see painted on hands at Indian weddings!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my last post in France&#8230; Tomorrow I&#8217;m leaving for <em>Valladolid</em>, Spain and I can&#8217;t wait! I hope you have an amazing weekend, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bon-weekend all!</p>

(Credit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/52461650@N00/24360245/">yoko_w</a>)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often said that Perth is the most isolated city in the world, which only works if you define a city as having a population of at least one million, and if you ignore Auckland. Yet there&#8217;s no denying that it&#8217;s still a long way from anywhere, a distant and lonely place on the far end of the Australian continent, separated from the eastern states by thousands of kilometres of desert. Growing up in Perth, I always saw the eastern states as a semi-mythical place beyond the horizon, the headquarters of a nation where all the important decisions were made, dispatched almost absent-mindedly to our remote outpost. Even Adelaide huddles down in the south-eastern corner of South Australia, close to the warmth of civilisation.</p>
<p>This is one of many reasons I want to spend my life anywhere but in Perth. My current decision was to move to Melbourne, and Perth&#8217;s staggering isolation is also one of the reasons I decided to do this overland. Rather than jumping on a $150 Jetstar flight, I thought it would be much more cathartic (not to mention interesting) to drive to the east coast, to cross the Nullarbor, to watch the odometer roll over and Perth get swallowed up in the trackless wastelands behind me. Even without the move factored in, a roadtrip across Australia has always been something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>At this point in my life, however, the vehicle I own is a 250cc Kawasaki KLX. There are those who say that a 250 is not an appropriate vehicle to cross a continent on. To those I say: please lobby the Western Australian Department of Infrastructure to lift engine capacity restrictions on first-year motorcycle licenses.</p>
<p>Pretty much everybody I talked to said it was a bad idea. On Christmas Day I had nearly every member of my maternal family trying to talk me out of it. I didn&#8217;t see what the big deal was. I rode a 125cc bike across Vietnam and I can guarantee that was a hell of a lot more dangerous than anything Australian roads could throw at me. The Nullarbor in particular had everybody fretting. At the time I was reading <a href="http://grubstreethack.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/book-review-jupiters-travels/">Jupiter&#8217;s Travels</a>, and found this passage to be quite apt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Crossing of the Nullarbor was a legend that died hard. People had been trying to frighten me with it for months&#8230; Australians in cities love to shudder at the merciless hostility of their continent. I wondered whether it was a sort of apology for betraying the national ideal, an excuse for not being out there digging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris was originally one of the legion of naysayers, before changing his mind and deciding to come along with me for the hell of it. Suddenly the choir of disagreeable voices was quieter. Whether because they thought it was safer in a pair or because they thought I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do it without my perpetual caregiver is debatable. In any case, we did a dry run by riding the bikes down to our annual trip to Collie, where much laughter was enjoyed by all as my KLX&#8217;s crappy mileage meant I ran out of petrol on the side of the highway ten kilometres short of the first service station. 135 k&#8217;s, including reserve. No biggie. I&#8217;d just need to carry some jerry cans.</p>
<p><strong>February 7th<br />
Perth to Bunbury &#8211; 182 km</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the first day of a voyage! We&#8217;d packed light &#8211; Chris was carrying his own two backpacks of clothes (one to wear and one to strap to the bike), as well as a sleeping bag, self-inflater and very compact two-man tent. I had two backpacks as well, plus a sleeping bag, self-inflater, and my Dad&#8217;s old saddlebags with a five-litre jerry can in each. I&#8217;d also borrowed my Dad&#8217;s old Rossi motorcycle boots, which he purchased circa 1980. Retro fashion!</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5050.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5050.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5050" width="490" height="367" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1064" /></a></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t set off until about 3.30 pm, which was a slack start, but it really should have been just a quick ride down the freeway. Bunbury was a fairly modest target for the day, but I have relatives there we could stay with, and starting out a trip in comfort and familiarity is always a nice thing. My Dad opened the backyard gate for us, we pulled out into a road covered in schoolkids that had just let out, hit Reid Highway and were soon southbound on the freeway. The skyscrapers and the river came and went, a tiny slice of city separating the huge swathes of northern and southern suburbs. Goodbye to all that &#8211; snorkelling at the beach, swimming in the Hill&#8217;s pool, the cinemas at Innaloo, Karrinyup Shopping Centre, the shady patio out the back of Chris&#8217; house, drinking at the Flying Scotsman with Sam, waking up at 5 am to the sound of Kristie&#8217;s dog screaming like an injured woman, driving along West Coast Highway on a sunny afternoon&#8230; a few days before we&#8217;d left, when I&#8217;d come home drunk from Terri and James&#8217; engagement party at two in the morning, I&#8217;d stumbled across the road to my old high school. I walked across the oval and up the embankment, drawn by a demountable clasroom that had all its lights on for some reason. I stared in the window entranced by it for a while &#8211; I used to have Biology classes in that room, asking Mr. Hugo stupid questions like &#8220;can you drink lava?&#8221; or &#8220;do trees have souls?&#8221; More than twenty years of my life in this encapsulated suburban world, a thousand miles from anywhere, quiet and unimportant, the archetype of a generic city. Goodbye to all <em>that.</em></p>
<p>After the ride to Collie and back I felt much more comfortable sitting on 100 k&#8217;s an hour. We stopped for our first refuel in Safety Bay, just outside Mandurah. &#8220;You be careful on those bikes,&#8221; a woman refueling her car said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, someone&#8217;s already flipped me off today,&#8221; Chris said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno. Riding a bike?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same way that I took a photo of every bed I slept in when travelling around the world, I resolved to take a photo of every petrol bowser we filled up at.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5052.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5052.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5052" width="490" height="367" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1066" /></a></p>
<p>As we pulled out of the servo I was cut off by a truck and didn&#8217;t see which direction Chris went in. I made a wrong guess, and ended up on Ellis Road. After some phone calls we eventually linked back up, but the traffic lights on Ellis Road and trying to find the right address in Bunbury (a larger town than many Perth residents assume) meant we didn&#8217;t arrive at the Gullottis&#8217; house until sunset. I&#8217;d expected Uncle Tony to cook us SOME-AH SPICY MEAT-A-BALLAS, but instead he resisted satisfying our demands for a stereotype and gave us steak and some other exotic, highly delicious stuff. It&#8217;s always pleasant at Collie to drift over to the Gullotti camper around evening and smell what Tony&#8217;s cooking up.</p>
<p>After dinner we pored over some old maps and brochures of the South-West they had, to see if there were any decent free camping spots on our planned route. &#8220;Not that I think you guys haven&#8217;t prepared for this,&#8221; Tony said, &#8220;but isn&#8217;t this something you should have done earlier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of&#8230; hard to do, until you&#8217;re in the trip itself,&#8221; Chris said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really have the motivation for it until then. Or we don&#8217;t, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the Gullotti&#8217;s adorable puppy Indy. Chris and I spent quite some time trying to figure out what her goggly eyes reminded us of, before deciding that it was the humans in Half-Life 2, whose eyes would follow you around the room while barely turning their heads.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5056.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5056.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5056" width="490" height="367" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1067" /></a></p>
<p><strong>February 8th<br />
Bunbury to Busselton &#8211; 53 KM</strong></p>
<p>A weak ride, but Chris had family friends in Busselton we could stay with, and the prospect of two beds in a row was too good to pass up. We lazed around the Gullottis&#8217; all morning with Brett, who is quite eagerly transitioning into the lazy life of a university student. Ah, how I envy him, with three years of rising at noon and drinking as much beer as he pleases ahead of him. We talked about how neither of us were really feeling the trip yet; it always takes a while to get into it. Eventually, after noon, we started packing our bags and putting our gear on. Chris and Brett both mocked me for strapping my Leatherman to my belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look lik a gay ranger,&#8221; Brett said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, with the tight jeans and the boots and all,&#8221; Chris said. &#8220;You look like Woody from Toy Story.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5057.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5057.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5057" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1068" /></a></p>
<p>They had a point.</p>
<p>After a gruelling forty minute ride down the highway to Busselton, we arrived at the quaint little home, well, their names escape me, but they were two old friends of Chris&#8217; parents. We had the rest of the afternoon to kill, so we went and walked the length of Busselton&#8217;s jetty, which is the second-longest wooden-piled jetty in the southern hemisphere &#8211; a merit that contains slightly too many qualifiers to be impressive. It is quite long, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/bussleton-jetty.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/bussleton-jetty.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="Bussleton Jetty" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1070" /></a></p>
<p>We visited the underwater observatory at the end, which was pretty neat, considering all the fish you see are wild animals. </p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/b-jetty-2.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/b-jetty-2.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="B Jetty 2" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1069" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards we went for a quick swim, despite the brisk weather, and lazed about on the beach for a while. It was a perfectly warm evening, and when we returned home, our host cooked us a steak dinner. Beds and steak two nights in a row was more than we had any right to expect on this trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5064.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5064.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5064" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1071" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5065.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5065.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5065" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1072" /></a></p>
<p>The South-West is such a pleasant region. It&#8217;s the kind of place I can see myself retiring to, pottering around with a garden and some writing projects, with a loving wife and a cat and a dog and our kids off at university.</p>
<p>I spent the evening perusing the maps in our road atlas, and noticed, with a tinge of white guilt, that Tasmania has no Aboriginal town names. I wonder why? Obviously Tasmania is the only state where we completely wiped out the Aboriginal population, but they weren&#8217;t greatly loved in the others states either, and those are still full of Manjimups and Wollongongs and Ngangaras.</p>
<p>Also, guess how many sealed roads there are linking western Australia with eastern Australia? Go on, guess.</p>
<p>There are only two &#8211; the Eyre Highway across the Nullarbor in the south, and the Barkly Highway between the Northern Territory and Queensland in the north. That&#8217;s it. Well, okay, technically the Stuart Highway connects the two halves because it runs from the west of the beginning of the Barkly down to the east of the end of the Eyre, but that would be a pretty roundabout route, and in any case three sealed roads is still a stunningly low number. And these aren&#8217;t huge highways &#8211; they&#8217;re just two-lane blacktop. Imagine if the United States only had two or three bridges across the Mississippi River. Australia &#8211; what a country!</p>
<p><strong>February 9th<br />
Busselton to Pemberton &#8211; 232 km</strong></p>
<p>This was our first proper ride, taking us off the highways in the Perth region and down into proper back-country roads. For some reason we decided that we needed to get up very early, which meant neither of us slept very well. I just can&#8217;t relax and sleep when I know I have to get up early, because I worry about oversleeping, and tense up every thirty seconds thinking &#8220;Did I fall asleep?! Did I oversleep?!&#8221;</p>
<p>We ended up leaving at a quarter to eleven, took a road past Dunsborough, and started the first ride we were actually looking forward to: the Caves Road, which hugs the coast from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south. It&#8217;s a lovely little road, winding up and down hills, through karri forests, and past the snobby cultural sector of rural Western Australia &#8211; all wineries and craft stores and art galleries. We stopped for lunch at a hipster vegetarian cafe in Margaret River, and then experienced something I never thought I&#8217;d see this side of the 21st century: a service station with an actual attendant who came out and filled up our tanks for us. Very quaint, but wholly pointless &#8211; I can see why we don&#8217;t have them anymore.</p>
<p>South of Margaret River the road wound through pockets of karri forest. Is it karri or jarrah that we nearly wiped out? There seemed to be an awful lot of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5071.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5071.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5071" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1073" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5075.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5075.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5075" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1074" /></a></p>
<p>East of Augusta, we headed inland on the Brockman Highway, and suddenly the lush karri forests became dry, scrubby banksias. Much less interesting. The road wound through this parched bushland for about 75 kilometres, featureless except for some lizard roadkill and a few lumber trucks. According to the road atlas it’s not national park, yet it doesn’t seem to be put to any use at all. I’m not sure what’s up with that.</p>
<p>Eventually the Brockman led us onto the Vasse Highway, and the scenery returned to karri forest again – with far more of it this time, the trees taller and greener. We were testing out the jerry cans for the first time, since there didn’t seem to be any petrol stations between Margaret River and Pemberton. My ass was sore and my head was hurting from wearing the helmet for so long, but I knew I only had to hold out to 135 k’s, when my bike would run out of fuel. The fickle bastard lasted until 150.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5078.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5078.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5078" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1075" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5079.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5079.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5079" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1076" /></a></p>
<p>In Pemberton, we located a caravan park and were violently robbed at gunpoint, being charged $30 for the privilege of a patch of dirt on which to pitch our tent.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5080.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5080.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5080" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1077" /></a></p>
<p>Once that was sorted, we jumped back on the bikes and set off to hunt down the Gloucester Tree.</p>
<p>The Gloucester Tree is a fire lookout at the top of a 61 metre karri tree, which is accessible to the public by ladder. I was too young to climb it when I first visited Pemberton at the tender age of two, but when we returned some years later, I was determined to conquer it. Unfortunately I was then only five, which was still a little too young to manage it, and I chickened out. But now I’m 22, by God, and there’s not a tree on this earth too tall for me to climb!</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5084.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5084.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5084" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1078" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5083.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5083.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5083" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079" /></a></p>
<p>It is quite an impressive tree &#8211; as you can see, I couldn&#8217;t fit it into one photo.</p>
<p>Here we go. This one&#8217;s for you, five-year old Mitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/big-tree.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/big-tree.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="Big Tree" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080" /></a></p>
<p>Before seeing it Chris had been ambivalent about bothering to, because he’d never heard of it before and had assumed it was some tiny loser tree. “I didn’t think they’d just let people do something like this in Australia,” he said, as we started climbing, before adding, “This is <em>well</em> dangerous.”</p>
<p>I’m not frightened of heights, but there was definitely a low-key anxiety about climbing up there. Theoretically you can’t fall out because there are wires to your right, but you could certainly slip and fall down the rungs, smashing your body to bits along the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5085.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5085.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5085" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1081" /></a></p>
<p>But we made it. After many years, I FINALLY CONQUERED THE GLOUCESTER TREE.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5086.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5086.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5086" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" /></a></p>
<p>Some impressive views. According to the visitor’s centre it’s still a working fire lookout, but there was nobody up there, and I’m pretty sure we have planes and satellites for that kind of thing nowadays.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5087.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5087.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5087" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5088.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5088.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5088" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" /></a></p>
<p>The tree was first climbed in 1947 by forester Jack Watson, using spiked boots and a belt. Another forester, George Reynolds, built the ladder and the original platform. The tree was named after Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, who was Australia’s Governor-General at the time, and who picnicked in the area, no doubt reclining on a tartan blanket and sipping tea while Jack and George took their shirts off and lopped branches off from a height of fifty metres, their sinewy muscles glistening with the sweat of honest labour. Under the quaint logic of British Australia, the Duke clearly contributed the most to the tree and thus deserved the naming honour.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5094.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5094.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5094" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" /></a></p>
<p>I got it in my head as a child that the Gloucester Tree was the tallest lookout tree in the world, and was disappointed to discover that it’s actually only the second-tallest. Not only that, but the tallest, the Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree, is also located just outside Pemberton.</p>
<p>Well, whatever. Childhood goal accomplished.</p>
<p>We stopped off at IGA to buy some food to cook for dinner. Afterwards I had a shower, and then Chris and I fed some ducks for a while, since we had fuck all else to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5099.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5099.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5099" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1086" /></a></p>
<p>“What time is it?” Chris asked, after we&#8217;d gone through half a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>“About 7.30.”</p>
<p>“So we have… four hours to kill.”</p>
<p>The sun set, and we went for a wander around town, which was as thoroughly deserted as if a government evacuation order had been issued. Never before had I encountered such eerie silence in an urban setting. There were faint stirrings of light and life around the local pub, and Chris and I had an argument about whether to go in there or not. I held the notion that country pubs are full of Akubra-wearing, beer-gutted truck drivers who would rapidly sniff out and eliminate any interlopers. Chris’ position that this was ludicrous held the field, and we went to the pub, which was also almost deserted. We played a few rounds of pool, then went back to the caravan park.</p>
<p>“Good God, I’m bored,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s just that… we don’t really have anywhere to <em>be</em>,” Chris said. Our tent was a one-man swag, with a diamond shape that meant we could just barely get away with fitting in two sleepers lying perfectly still. It certainly wasn’t a place where we could hang out.</p>
<p>We retreated to the caravan park&#8217;s cooking area, where the lights meant we could at least read, and cracked open the bottle of wine we’d bought at the liquor store. This was a cunning plan to assist in sleep; since we had only thin self-inflating sleeping pads and inflatable pillows, we both knew we were in for a very difficult night. I’d been texting my girlfriend, and at 9.07 she mentioned “I’m going to see the Getaway Plan tonight and maybe join Mike at the Court after.”</p>
<p>“This bears emphasis,” I said. “While we’re counting down the minutes until our night is over, Kristie’s hasn’t even begun.”</p>
<p>The lights were automatically shut off at 10 pm, and we retreated to the tent. It could charitably be described as cosy. I didn’t fall asleep until after twelve. At about 4 am we were woken by pattering rain, and had to scramble to grab our bags and gear and bring them inside the tent. Now it was even cosier! It took hours to fall asleep again, and then a flock of kookaburras woke us up around dawn. I didn’t even know kookaburras went in flocks.</p>
<p><strong>February 10th<br />
Pemberton to Albany – 243 km</strong></p>
<p>Tired and aching, we packed up camp just before ten and had a quick breakfast of toast and baked beans. Over coffee at the nearby café we reviewed our route: down the Vasse Highway and onto the Western, through Walpole and Denmark along the south coast, before arriving in Albany where we had a hostel room booked. A hostel room with sweet, juicy, delicious, actual <em>beds</em> waiting for us.</p>
<p>It was grey and overcast, and though it didn’t look likely to rain, it was quite cold. For some reason I’d left my jacket lining at the bottom of my clothes bag, which was now firmly occy strapped to the bike. The ride was as beautiful as it had been the day before, winding through more enormous karri trees, but I was too cold to enjoy it.</p>
<p>We stopped to fuel up in a town called Northcliffe, which I had never heard of before, before passing a sign that said “Welcome to Denmark.” This was confusing, since I was pretty sure Denmark was 150 kilometres away. Since I also had no recollection of making the turn-off onto the Vasse outside of Pemberton, I began to worry. Was I suffering from a mental problem that erased huge swathes of my memory? Had I just ridden 150 kilometres without realising it? (It turned out we were actually just being welcomed to the <em>shire</em> of Denmark.)</p>
<p>We stopped for lunch in Walpole, where I finally gave up and dug the jacket lining out of my bag. In the carpark we met a guy of indeterminate European nationality, who lived in Harvey and was just about to complete the final leg of a round-Australia trip on his V-Strom. Looking at his comfy, comfy seat made my ass insane with jealousy.</p>
<p>Outside of Walpole we stopped to visit the Treetop Walk. I’d seen it before, nine years ago on a family trip, but it was pleasant enough to visit again.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5114.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5114.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5114" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1087" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5116.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5116.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5116" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1088" /></a></p>
<p>There’s also a land-based boardwalk nearby, and I insisted we walk along that too, to get our money’s worth. “I’m pretty done with trees, dude,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“You won’t be saying that on the Nullarbor.”</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5121.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5121.jpg?w=490&#038;h=653" alt="" title="DSCN5121" width="490" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually I was satisfied with the ratio of dollars spent per trees witnessed, and we returned to the carpark. Here I did something I’d been doing an awful lot of: while backing my bike out, and twisting the handlebars to turn it, I got directions mixed up in my head and instead of pressing down on the ignition button I pressed down on the horn. Not as embarassing as dropping it in the Video Ezy carpark the day before we left, but close. Chris laughed at me, and we left.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5122.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5122.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5122" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1090" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5127.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5127.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5127" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1091" /></a></p>
<p>We fuelled up in Denmark, where the day’s grey cloud cover was finally threatening to turn into actual precipitation. The final 50 kilometre stretch into Albany was freezing and windy and spotted with rain, and we flew along the road at 115 k’s an hour. The whole day I’d been keen for the ride to be over, eyeing the odometer like I used to eye the clock at work. When we pulled into the Albany YHA I crawled up onto the top bunk and had myself a good, long lie down.</p>
<p>Dinner was a bleak roast dinner at the local pub, where a nearby group of yobbos were loudly discussing their bitches and hos. “When you’re overseas,” Chris commented, “you don’t understand the language, so you don’t really notice… class, or dignity.”</p>
<p>“Shhh,” I said.</p>
<p>Albany is also a place I haven’t been to for about nine years, since I was a young ‘un. It seems a pleasant enough town, with lots of 19th century buildings and blustery weather and a strong nautical tradition. Sort of like New England or Canada’s Maritime provinces. Yes, I did just compare a place I’ve been to before with places I’ve never been to.</p>
<p><strong>February 11th<br />
Albany to Esperance – 483 km</strong></p>
<p>We set our alarms to wake us up at 7.30, but we both ignored them and slept another hour. Neither of us are naturally given to early starts. At 8.30 it began to rain. “Fuck,” I said, peering out the curtains.</p>
<p>“It’s days like these I wish we had a car,” Chris said.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5134.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5134.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5134" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1092" /></a></p>
<p>We packed our bags and went about our morning routine in the hope that it might just be a brief spell, but it wasn’t. Shelled out a dollar to use the Internet and check BOM; both the Albany and Esperance radars were down, but the forecast for the south coast proclaimed shitty weather for the rest of the day. We decided there was nothing for it but to grit our teeth and wrap all our stuff in plastic bags.</p>
<p>We had breakfast at a nice little restaurant called Dillons, which had a vintage bike up on the staircase.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5137.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5137.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5137" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1093" /></a></p>
<p>Half an hour later we were on the road out of town, stuck behind a piece of earthmoving equipment trundling along at 10 k’s an hour. How I loathe riding in such blustery, grey, bleak, overcast, miserable, drizzly weather. My legs were shivering and my visor was perpetually fogging up. At least the rain had lightened up a little, down to a light sprinkling.</p>
<p>From here on there were no more forests – just scrubland and a few farms, the southern fringe of the Wheatbelt, where sheep farmers eked out a meagre living at the edge of the continent. The first service station we came to, a speck on the map called Wellstead, had a sign announcing “Ammunition Sold Here,” which signalled to me that we were now well out in the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5141.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5141.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5141" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1094" /></a></p>
<p>It also had a strange mural.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/welcome.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/welcome.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="Welcome" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1095" /></a></p>
<p>The roads were long and straight and featureless, and it was beginning to dawn on me that the boring stretches of this grand cross-continental ride would consist of much more than just the Nullarbor.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5144.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5144.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5144" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1096" /></a></p>
<p>Worst of all were the cross-winds, requiring us to lean ten degrees to the right, and occasionally making a rapid shift which would unbalance me – an unnerving experience. Sometimes they’d force me quite close to the gravel shoulder, and I was forced to ride essentially right down the dotted line in the middle of the road. We were also encountering our first road trains, which would rush past us in the oncoming lane with a whoosh of displaced air. The trick was to slow down and duck your head down low, so the wind went right over you. It wasn’t as bad as I’d thought it would be; certainly not as bad as the detractors of this trip had made it out to be, who seemed to imagine rural Australian truck drivers as being identical to the antagonist in <em>Duel.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5143.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5143.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5143" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" /></a></p>
<p>The headwind meant I ran out of fuel earlier than usual, at 115 k’s, just two hundred metres shy of Ravensthorpe’s petrol station. The jerries were full, so it was no huge hassle, but Chris and I had an argument about his conviction that I must be riding the bike wrong, rather than the fact that it’s simply a dirtbike with low fuel mileage, and a 110 k’s down straight roads into a headwind will use a lot more fuel than lower speeds along a windy highway near Pemberton on a still day. I always find it frustrating to explain to Chris (or to anyone) the problems and issues I face while riding, because so much of it is just <em>feeling</em>, that&#8217;s hard to articulate.</p>
<p>The final stretch into Esperance was very difficult on the ass and soul, with the wind still going strong and the skies as grey as ever. We caught a brief glimpse of blue skies when we stopped to fill up from the jerries.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5150.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5150.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5150" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" /></a></p>
<p>We finally reached the town at dusk after 488 kilometres of leaning to the right, sore and weary. We’d booked another hostel, which was less flash but more expensive than the one in Albany. We’d originally planned to have a day off in Esperance, which supposedly has the best beaches in WA, but it was still cold and windy and showed no sign of letting up. Behold the wonderful beaches out the front of our hostel:</p>
<p><a href="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5151.jpg"><img src="http://grubstreethack.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn5151.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367" alt="" title="DSCN5151" width="490" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looked like we’d have to spend a day there for another reason – Chris’ chain had started sagging, and he’d need to visit a mechanic. Just like Vietnam all over again!</p>
<p>We had Red Rooster for dinner, and played some pool and chess. Some Danish backpackers were discussing the Internet with an English backpacker, who was using one of those satellite USB thingies in his laptop. “In Europe there is free wifi at all hostels,” the Danish guy said, “and we thought would be the same here, but always just computers and $1 for 15 minutes…”</p>
<p>“Oh, they’re backwards, mate, so backwards,” the Englishman said.</p>
<p>No arguments from me. I recall hearing a maxim that Australia is ten years behind the rest of the world, and WA is ten years behind the rest of Australia. So that would put us in 1991. Of course, Tony Abbott is right, we can’t build the NBN because it’s a great big fat waste of taxpayer money that could instead go towards a new detention centre for refugees surrounded by razor wire and patrolled by crocodiles.</p>
<p>Next: Perth to Melbourne, Part 2</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://katrichterwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/tape-measure.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2028" title="tape measure" src="http://katrichterwrites.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/tape-measure.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a>Earlier this week, fellow blogger (and mastermind of <a href="http://www.musingsonlifeandlove.com/">Musings on Life and Love</a>) Dennis Hong accused me of “getting shallow.”  I told him that I’m not <em>getting</em> shallow, that I have <em>always</em> been shallow when it comes to my taller-than-me-in-heels requirement.</p>
<p>Although the majority of my female readers rallied to my defense (thanks ladies!) I’ve gotten a lot of flack for this over the years.  Ironically enough, most of it has come from my younger brother who, up until his senior year of college, hardly ever ventured beyond the likes of the well-endowed blond.  (So yeah, obviously <em>he’s</em> in a position to tell <em>me</em> I’m being shallow.)</p>
<p>As it turns out, my railings against eHarmony and their associated collection of vertically-challenged men caused quite the ruckus.  And it got me thinking: when do personal preferences cross the line between having standards and being shallow?</p>
<p>The responses to Tuesday’s post were pretty well split across the gender divide.</p>
<p><a href="http://ellensguidetobadinternetdating.wordpress.com/">Grey Goose, Dirty</a> wrote “I’m 5’10″ tall (6’1″ in heels)… I certainly don’t need any help feeling like an Amazon woman as I tower over my date, so although I have ‘lowered’ my height requirement to 5’10″, I refuse to date anyone shorter.”</p>
<p>My cousin Jenn wrote “When you look at a room full of people, there are certain things that attract you more than others. For example, blondes, butts, green eyes. Height is just one of those things.”</p>
<p>My friend Debbie (a fellow dancer and Roehampton grad) wrote, “AMEN SISTER! As a fellow 5’9″ fabulous female I say ask for what you want! We are allowed to have preferences for other parts of our lives. Why not this? Why is height any different from religious preference, location, education, or any of the other crazy questions on the list?”  Well said, Debbie!</p>
<p><a href="http://wordofsoia.wordpress.com/">Wordsofsoia</a> confessed that her past boyfriends were 6’7″ and 6’3″ and that height is a major prerequisite for the so-called “High Heel obsessive.”  (By the way, she’s from Perth so if I’m still single this time next year, I am <em>so</em> moving to Australia.  I’ve never dated anyone above 6’5” here in the US…)</p>
<p><a href="http://rubhub.wordpress.com/">Sarahnsh</a> added that prior to meeting her fiancé, she’s always dated shorted guys and “obviously those relationships didn’t work out.”  Finally, in response to Dennis’s comment, my mom (a self-confessed “poacher”) pointed out “I don’t believe “uggo” or “fatty” is synonymous with short as an insult, but that is just my humble (and short) opinion.”  You go, <a href="http://www.phildelcodepink.50megs.com/">Landlord</a>!</p>
<p>(I’m trying to ignore your comment Freud, Jill, because it has since occurred to me that Freud would have a field day with my “experiment” if he were still alive and I’d rather not consider myself worthy of psychoanalysis <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
<p>As for the men (<a href="http://heelsandhikingshoes.wordpress.com/">h&amp;hs</a>, <a href="http://www.musingsonlifeandlove.com/">Dennis</a> and <a href="http://www.tednghiemphoto.com/#/special/splash/">Ted</a>), there were the usual counterarguments of the double standard that enables women to “have standards” whereas men can only be “shallow.”  My favorite part was when Dennis added, “Just to play devil’s advocate, from an evolutionary perspective, breast size, waist-to-hip ratio, facial symmetry, and overall body size all have a TON of practical aspects.”</p>
<p>Ok, so yes, <em>technically speaking</em> he’s right (I did major in history as an undergrad) and my male readers have a point: there’s <em>definitely</em> a double standard—but for the first time in history, we women <em>haven’t </em>gotten the short end of the stick so maybe we should reap the rewards of this particular inequality while we can?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’m left wondering: when does a standard become shallow?</p>
<p>Your thoughts greatly appreciated!  (And thanks again to everyone who weighed in on Tuesday’s debate.)  Last but not least, don&#8217;t forget that tomorrow marks the start of &#8220;My Single Male Friend Friday&#8221; so be sure to check back in the morning for a male perspective&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>I am approaching my tenth move in sixteen years.</strong></p>
<p>Those are my own moves, rather than moves I have helped with, although there have been some of those as well.</p>
<p>What have I learned from all of this moving? I learned to expect to move again, no matter how contented I might feel in a given location. I learned to be prepared.</p>
<p>I realized that the next move was guaranteed to arrive sooner than I would like, and I learned that certain choices made while stationary would have both physical and economic consequences during that next move. I made my furniture choices accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>My furniture purchases were based on how well a given item would fold, stack, disassemble or fit through a doorway, not to mention how easily the item could be lifted. </strong>I still have some folding and stacking oak shelves I purchased more than fifteen years ago, while other less manageable items have been left behind or given away. In some sad cases, awkward items were broken during a move. No wonder I became interested in minimalism!</p>
<p>Then, I became a wife and mother. I forgot some of the lessons I had learned in my life. I felt settled. I found a large (and still new-looking!) leather sofa at a secondhand store for $600. It <em>just happened to match</em> the almost-new leather chair and ottoman I had already brought home from another secondhand store for $150. It seemed like fate. I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>Now, after just a few years, I am forced to consider how exactly we will fit that large leather sofa up the switch back staircase in our future destination&#8230;there is another side to fate, you see. You win some, you lose some. Hopefully we won&#8217;t need to lose the sofa. That would be a hard lesson.</p>
<p>Something else I learned from my moves is to start packing early. Moving is like going on a trip &#8212; one that lasts a very long time (although sometimes not as long as we hope). I never liked packing for trips. I always thought I might forget some crucial item, like pants. Pants are important. Restaurant signs used to say &#8220;No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service&#8221;, but of course, pants (or a reasonable substitute for pants) are also expected. In fact, I am certain that pants are more of a priority than either the shirt or the shoes, despite what the signs used to say. (These days, signs are more likely to say &#8220;No Cellphones&#8221;.) I have not actually forgotten my pants on any trip, but I worry about these things. I can be a little bit forgetful at times, which is why I try to organize things so deliberately. I need to compensate for my poor memory.</p>
<p>My stress level and my mood on the days before leaving on trips were enough to teach my husband a lesson. Now he encourages me to pack a few days early. Sometimes he even brings my suitcase out. It helps. The very first trip we took as a family had a rough beginning. Now that I think about it, the middle and the ending of that trip were kind of rough, too. It started with my husband and the three boys sitting in the car for the better part of an hour. They were waiting for me to meet them after I finished work, trying to be efficient in their readiness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lack of communication was a problem that day. I was hungry after work and stopped for something to eat, without knowing they were already sitting in the car. The four of them were hot, fidgety, and cranky from being strapped in a parked car for so long, and I was horrified to find them there when I arrived. We left too late in the day, hitting some heavy traffic on the journey. Further crankiness ensued. I have heard that you don&#8217;t really know people well until you have traveled with them. I think it might be true. Lessons were learned on that trip.</p>
<p>At least traffic won&#8217;t be an issue in this move, as we will only be a few miles away from our current home. I wanted to start packing boxes as soon as I knew we were moving, although I knew it was unlikely that we would be able to transport anything for another four to six weeks. Starting early is my own version of efficiency. Now the boxes are stacking up, getting in the way, making the place feel a touch claustrophobic&#8230;but it is better than the anxiety of packing in a rush. At least, to me it is better &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t speak for my family. But really, who wants a stressed out wife or mother? No one. A few stubbed toes might be worth it.</p>
<p>I asked some friends for their own moving tips and I got a few good ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>My advice would be to label the HECK out of every  box. Add  the date and ALL the contents&#8230; unless you plan on unpacking   everything immediately (unlikely, right?). I actually listed all the   contents of each box on at least two sides of the box &#8211; not only don&#8217;t   you have to unpack a box to find something, you don&#8217;t have to unstack   all the boxes to find the right box!  ~J.I.</p>
<p>To move hanging clothes, cover 10-20 items (still on hangers) in a large trash bag and tie the bottom closed.  ~J.L.</p>
<p>Dust everything before you pack it, and always  ask  yourself, &#8220;Shall I pack this or donate it?&#8221; I put all small miscellaneous   breakables in socks. Socks work better than wrapping in paper.  ~J.F.</p></blockquote>
<p>I especially like the tip about socks. I have also read that towels and T-shirts are good for packing dishes, and like the sock idea, this helps eliminate paper waste, and allows you two pack two items at once.</p>
<p>Here are some of my other favorite moving ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pack one room at a time.</li>
<li>Label boxes &#8220;Open First&#8221; if you know you will be needing the contents in the first days after arrival.</li>
<li>Load the moving truck according to the order in which the large items will be moved into the house.  In other words, the last things into the truck will be the first unloaded, so they should be the ones you want to place first.  Pieces destined for the back rooms of the house are likely candidates for the back of the truck.</li>
<li>Pack a suitcase with changes of clothing and toiletries as though you were taking a weekend trip.</li>
<li>Take pictures of the wire hook-ups for your electronics to make it easier to reconnect them, and label all cords, wrapping them to avoid tangling in the move.</li>
</ul>
<p>I already have many of our cords labeled, and I plan to wrap them carefully. No one wants to open a box and release that tangled nest of mysterious black snakes, their threatening metal fangs extended, dripping with the toxic venom of potential frustration. I look forward to more wireless technology in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will settle for some organization, a positive attitude, and the hope that our leather sofa will make it up that switch back staircase.</p>
