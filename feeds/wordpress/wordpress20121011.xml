		<description><![CDATA[Last year few of us knew the Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan or the now famous P90X workout plan, but TIME  was early on the story. We sent Gregg Segal to photograph Ryan at a Wisconsin gym last year. Here are the some of the unpublished photographs from that session. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=55234&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When TIME named Paul Ryan a runner-up in the 2011 Person of the Year issue, many were familiar with his proposed budget, but few knew that the Wisconsin Congressman stayed fit with the now best-selling P90X workout plan. (Ryan&#8217;s father and grandfather both died of a heart attack.) In fact, it was Ryan&#8217;s fitness regime — and Herculean strength on all things fiscal — that inspired this workout-themed sitting for Person of the Year. One of these portraits, photographed by Gregg Segal, appears in the Oct. 22, 2012, issue.</p>
<p>Tony Horton, the stand-up comedian turned P90X creator, says the rigorous workout has been boosted from both sides of the aisle. &#8220;I think Paul Ryan&#8217;s been very good for P90X, as much or more so as Michelle Obama,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with the First Lady and her Let&#8217;s Move campaign. Some of the Secret Service came up to me and said, &#8216;Hey man, we&#8217;re really loving the P90X.&#8217; I&#8217;m well aware that they&#8217;re using it in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Horton, you don&#8217;t need a lot of equipment to get fit. Ryan likes to use weights, but they aren&#8217;t a necessity. &#8220;You need the human body, Mother Earth and Sir Isaac Newton&#8217;s law of gravity,&#8221; Horton says.</p>
<p>TIME asked Horton to suggest a get-fit regimen that could be implemented alongside the presidential campaign but still leave time for careful consideration of the issues. He recommended an upper-body exercise, a cardiovascular interval exercise, a core exercise and a leg exercise. (For further details — and diagrams! — check the Oct. 22 issue.)</p>
<p>Confusing the electorate is unwise, but according to Horton, confusing the muscles is a plus. This involves changing the routine often so muscles don&#8217;t get accustomed to any one exercise. To get the full benefit of this regimen, you&#8217;ve got to make like the party and diversify. &#8220;Do a different push-up every time,&#8221; suggests Horton. &#8220;Add kenpo karate or jumping jacks or whatever on that second move. On the crunches, modify your position to engage the abs or core directly. You can do squats with your feet wide, your feet narrow. It&#8217;s a workout that might also give you a bounce. As few as two rounds of that will release norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perfect for when the poll numbers aren&#8217;t going your way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here I sit at the main view point on the edge of Fish River Canyon, Namibia. It is too early for my liking and the best way you tell that I have been rousted from my bed too early is that I am still clutching my travel mug full of coffee and I am still wearing my Pyjamas under my fleece. But so is Nic so at least we are a matched pair!</p>
<p>Having arrived at our campsite in Hobas in plenty of time last night, we dutifully set the alarm for 5:30 am this morning to make the 10 km drive out here to the main viewpoint overlooking the head of Fish River Canyon.</p>
<p>I have always believed that the only legitimate justification for being awake before 6 am is either a family emergency or in order to make it to the airport in time for a flight.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nonetheless, here we are soaking in this utterly breathtaking view. Between our SLRs, iPhone and iPads, it is a struggle to capture the vastness of Africa&#8217;s second largest Canyon*.</em></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this morning we have an overcast day and the promise of the first rays of sun bitting the Canyon walls to reveal the pinks, greens, reds and brilliant blue of the river has not really come to pass. On this chilly morning, we are sitting and waiting to snap photos and drink in the beauty as occasional (and I mean occasional) patches of blue sky let the sun shine through and tease us in shockingly brief moments.</p>
<p>While we sit and wait for the next patch of blue sky, let me catch you on the trip so far.</p>
<p>At 7:30 am (an hour later than we planned), Nichol and I departed Cape Town on Tuesday morning. Our plan was to drive all the way up across the Namibian border and spend the first night just on the other side in Noordoewer. Truthfully, aside from the long drive through South Africa&#8217;s flower region (we missed the season by 2 weeks but it was still pretty) the most exciting thing about the drive was that Nichol let me take the wheel of the 3 tonne Land Rover for an hour or so. I was certainly a bit nervous and it takes time to find the right rhythm and clutch points in any new car, but this thing is a beast. Braking times are massively longer and with its loose joints for handling the off-road challenges, the Land Rover feels like an impatient filly, kicking at the traces as I urge her to go faster.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes my white-knuckle grip on the steering wheel loosened and Nichol had relaxed enough to catch a few Zzs in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Crossing the border into Namibia was very easy. I don&#8217;t know if it helps to have a Africkaans-speaking South African with me or if everyone really was as friendly and easy-going as they seemed. Either way, we arrived in Noordoewer as the sun was setting and decided to head to Felix Unite, one of several lodges and camps along the Orange River.</p>
<p>There was no camping for us on that first night I have to admit, as the sun was well set by the time we found Felix Unite and our 10 hours of driving (only 1 for me) made the idea of struggling to pitch camp for the first time in the dark just too much to contemplate. We succumbed to the temptation of discounted cabana accommodation with the added bonus of hot indoor showers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After a bottle of red wine and a steak dinner we fell into bed exhausted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wednesday morning saw us back on the road early and we chose a much more managable itinerary. An hour and a half North of Noordoewer is the South end of the Fish River Canyon and we set the Ai-Ais Park entrance there as our first destination.</p>
<p>On the way, we took our first deviation off the main road and engaged the low gears of the Land Rover&#8217;s 4&#215;4 system. Nichol had only recently purchased the 2004 Land Rover Defender that we are using so he was keen to see what she can do. The dry river bed detour just off the main (read unpaved gravel road) took us through a narrow canyon for about 10 km. There was no real climbing or obstacle course to navigate but having the 4 wheel drive on made easy work of the soft sand tracks of the canyon. The beautiful striations of copper ore and pink something or other up the steep canyon walls gave us a tiny preview of the vistas we were to expect t the larger Fish River Canyon. Not a bad way to ease our way into the 4&#215;4 experience in my opinion, but I think Nicol was a little disappointed that we didn&#8217;t climb a small mountain on our first time out!</p>
<p>With the off road detour behind us we whizzed along the road to Ai-Ais and found ourselves at the hot springs at the gate of the park in no time. We took advantage of the free entry and had a dip in the lukewarm swimming pool to wash off the dust that now coats everything inside and outside the Land Rover. At the Ai-Ais Resort shop we bought some firewood and headed up to our ultimate destination, the campsite in Hobas at the North end of Fish River Canyon.</p>
<p><strong><em>Everyone wants their first time to be special!</em></strong></p>
<p>So on that Wednesday evening as the sun set behind the trees in Hobas, for the first time on our epic Southern African adventure Nicol and I set up the roof tent on the Landy and prepared to treat ourselves to a good Braai some wine.</p>
<p>The campsites here are flat and sandy, tenting on the ground here would be easy enough and there really aren&#8217;t the lions and hippos that really make a rooftop tent so appealing. Nonetheless the Landy looks so right with the ingenious foldout tent all set up, the aluminum ladder leading to the surprisingly comfortable queen size mattress and when full decked out in her awnings, side panels, shower curtains and with folding camp chairs placed in front, you would be forgiven for thinking that a 2 story canvas tent of dreams had fully consumed the truck.</p>
<p>Next came dinner, steaks and sausage grilled to perfection over the BBQ (henceforth to be called by the South African term Braai) a tomato, onion and green pepper mix was added to a grilled cheese sandwich concoction that I now know as Braai-Broodjie, essentially BBQ Cheese sandwich, yummy and marginally better for you than the traditional North American Kraft on white with butter on both sides.</p>
<p>The wine led to a glass or two of whiskey and with a promise in our heads to wake before dawn today, we laid our heads down again and slept soundly under a perfect African night sky.</p>
<p>Just a final note on something I am sure you may have been asking yourself. What about the animals??? So far this has been a travelogue about me, lots of wine and some stunning scenery. Well fear not. On our way out the the viewpoint we spotted our first wildlife. A few Springbok and some Ostriches dotted the roadside and upon our return to the campsite this morning a rather large Baboon was being chased through the camp by the staff as it tried to make off with left over Braai from the garbage cans scattered throughout the site.</p>
<p>We stayed here in Hobas for another day to sort out the truck, read up on our next adventure and enjoy the sun when it finally came out.</p>
<p>So for now, I leave you safe in the knowledge that Namibia is everything I hoped it would be and so much more, I am so looking forward to seeing more it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><em>Take care my friends and remember to keep your eyes open, you never know when a Baboon is going to try to take off with your left-overs!!</em></p>
<p>* There is some debate that the largest canyon in Africa, said to be located in Ethiopia is not actually bigger, just longer or deeper or something like that.  Either way, Fish River Canyon is worth a visit for sure!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Funny Names Blog appreciates people with funny names. It appreciates people with funny names who come from funnily named towns, play for strange sounding sports teams, and connect to cities in Canada named after science fiction characters even more.</p>
<div id="attachment_1895" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 276px"><a href="http://funnynamesblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/kurtenbach.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1895" title="kurtenbach" src="http://funnynamesblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/kurtenbach.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="189" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Orland Kurtenbach, the handsome devil, live on fake TV.</p></div>
<p>The great<strong> Orland Kurtenbach</strong> ticks all the boxes, and more.</p>
<p>Orland, being a Canadian, was of course a professional hockey player. Hailing from <em>Cudworth, Saskatchewan</em>, where he grew up on a farm, young Orland seemed destined for a hockey career from the start. He began as a defenceman, playing for the <strong>Prince Albert Mintos </strong>for two seasons, just the first of a series of hilariously named hockey teams in his career.</p>
<p>After a while, his attacking instincts proved him more suitable as a forward, where he was to be deployed for the rest of his playing days. During his junior career, along with the <em>Mintos</em>, he also appeared for the <strong>Saskatoon Quakers</strong> and the <strong>Flin Flon Bombers. </strong>At the latter he won the legendary Memorial Cup in 1957.</p>
<p>Before we move forward, I should probably address the <strong>Flin Flon Bombers</strong> here. Yes, Flin Flon is a real town in Canada, in that tropical paradise sometimes referred to as Manitoba. The town probably deserves its own blog post here, but I will just mention that it was named after its founding in 1927 after a science fiction novel called <em>The Sunless City</em>, whose main character bore the fantastic name of <strong>Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin</strong>. Hey, if I was reading that book and happened to be founding a town immediately afterwards, I&#8217;b be tempted to <em>flonatin</em> it up a bit myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_1896" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://funnynamesblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/josiah-flintabbatey-flonatin.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1896" title="josiah flintabbatey flonatin" src="http://funnynamesblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/josiah-flintabbatey-flonatin.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The town of Flin Flon, population 5592, give or take a few, is home to this statue of Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin, one of the nicest statues of Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin erected anywhere.</p></div>
<p>But we&#8217;ll return to that story at a later date.</p>
<p>Orland Kurtenbach started his professional career immediately following his triumph in Flin Flon, earning a contract with the Vancouver Canucks, then in the minor WHL league. He did well enough in his first season to earn Rookie of the Year honors as Vancouver went on to playoff success that year, managing not to incite any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Vancouver_Stanley_Cup_riot" target="_blank">riots </a>in the process.</p>
<p>He toiled in the minor leagues for a long time, eventually ending up with the Toronto Maple Leafs where our old friend <a title="Punch Imlach" href="http://funnynamesblog.com/2012/05/15/punch-imlach/" target="_blank">Punch Imlach</a> gave him a chance to be a regular player in the biggest of pro leagues, the NHL. Later he wound up back with the Canucks, who had in the meantime joined the NHL as part of its ongoing expansion. He became their captain and ended up playing a highly respectable 639 games in the NHL before his retirement.</p>
<p>To keep his funny name legacy going, Kurtenbach turned to coaching after his playing career, holding jobs with the <strong>Seattle Totems, Tulsa Oilers</strong>, and best of all, the <strong>Richmond Sockeyes</strong> in the minor leagues. He retired from hockey in the mid 80&#8242;s and now runs a golf range in British Columbia with his wife, enjoying his memories of Flin Flon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the first time I came out to anybody. I was a socially awkward fifteen year old boy living in Texas. I had no athletic prowess to boast, and my musical tastes were closer to my father&#8217;s than to my peers. For three years, I kept my sexuality a secret from everybody because I was terrified of being gay. I didn&#8217;t know any other gay kid or adult, so I felt lonely and misunderstood. The only thing that scared me more than my solitude was the very real possibility that others could hurt me with their words or fists if they found out that I preferred boys over girls.</p>
<p>At fifteen years old, I decided that I had lived under fear long enough. There was a reality show on TV back in 2001 that documented the lives of average high school students, including one gay youth; his visible gayness gave me the courage to share my secret with one person. When I came out to a friend in my youth group, I was frightened that he would make my life a living hell &#8211; and because my friend was the most popular youth in our very large church, he had the means to do so. But he did not make my life miserable; he said, &#8220;Thank you for telling me. This doesn&#8217;t change who you are. You are still my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was almost 12 years ago, and since the winter of 2001, I have mastered the art of coming out to friends, coworkers, and family. I have told my conservative, evangelical friends about my sexuality, and I have come out to my liberal friends and colleagues. I have come out in intimate conversations and in public speeches before large crowds. I have come out to straight neighbors and gay neighbors, rich friends and poor friends, Christian friends and doubting friends; by and large, I am a better man for being honest about myself. I feel better knowing that I can be my true, genuine self around my peers, because I do not have to hide something that is a profound part of my existence. I can simply be, and I can simply be gay.</p>
<p>My friends remind me that I am a brave man for coming out. A friend of mine regularly tells me, &#8220;You are the bravest, most courageous person I know;&#8221; this same friend has a story of being delivered by the grace of God from a life of crime (including murder), counterfeiting money, gang banging, and homelessness. Another friend said that my decision to tell my story to a crowd of evangelical Christians numbering over 200 was, perhaps, the bravest thing he ever saw a person do. These comments puzzle me; I am simply being honest. Aren&#8217;t Christians supposed to be honest? And yet, in this society, honesty is bravery; it takes courage to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Two realities &#8211; one societal, and the other personal &#8211;  remind me why it is so important for my LGBT brothers and sisters to come out and make their sexualities known to their network of friends and colleagues. Extremists from the far right will call us monsters, abominations, and sick perversions; their subordinates will tacitly (or not so tacitly) agree with them. The extremists are content to shove us into boxes made of fears based on ridiculous stereotypes and assumptions, and they cannot see LGBT people as such &#8211; people. When we come out, we force all our neighbors to see that we LGBT people are their neighbors, their sons and daughters, their mothers and fathers, their brothers and sisters, their aunts and uncles and cousins. We show the world that we are their teachers, doctors, accountants, scientists, politicians, theologians, preachers, dancers, musicians, and athletes. We show the world that LGBT people, like our straight brothers and sisters, can have hope, can believe in God, can walk in faith and not by sight, can embrace a peace that surpasses all understanding. We show our enemies and allies alike that we are human like them: we breathe, we eat, we laugh, we cry, we hope, we dream.</p>
<p>However, I am constantly reminded two days a week why I must be out and why making my sexuality visible is so vital to my well-being. I work in a church that is hostile to the LGBT community, where the parishioners will sometimes make overtly homophobic comments, where I would be fired if the leadership knew my sexuality. I do feel like I live two lives &#8211; my normal life at home where I can be out with my friends and school colleagues, and a closeted life (although the closet is transparent) where I am trapped in fear and isolation. Because I am not out to anybody in my congregation, I feel like I have no connection to anyone, for I cannot truly be myself with those people. It&#8217;s enough to make me want to leave the church (but not the one, holy, apostolic Church); for the sake of genuine relationships and my own health, I must be honest about myself to my neighbors and friends.</p>
<p>If you are an out and proud LGBT person, I celebrate you and your courage!</p>
<p>If you are a closeted or partially closeted LGBT person, I am with you. Stay strong, and may you one day find a safe place to leave that prison of fear.</p>
<p>If you are a straight ally, thank you of your support and love. We need you as friends and advocates.</p>
<p>As we celebrate National Coming Out Day, let us remember the courage it takes to speak plainly and honestly about ourselves, whether gay or straight, and let us work together to make our country a safer place for our LGBT youth and families simply be their truest selves.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
-JC</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Here are a few photos from the <a href="http://www.renoballoon.com/">Great Reno Balloon Race </a>held about a month ago. I had started this post then, but my computer malfunctioned. But, it&#8217;s never to late to show some cool photos. I had so many to sort through. I hope you enjoy them.<br />
</em></p>
<p>The Great Reno Balloon Race starts early if you want to catch the Glow Show and the Dawn Patrol. I think it&#8217;s worth it, but it did require my family to rise well before the crack of dawn at approximately 4:30 am. Yes, that part was painful. It was actually a miracle that were able to do it. Even more of a miracle that I didn&#8217;t have a cup of coffee until about 6:30 am. Oh, but it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>DAWN PATROL</strong></p>
<p>Balloons twinkled like stars, choreographed to music. It was quite a spectacle and the crowd was awe-struck (and probably half asleep).</p>
<div id="attachment_3126" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/136.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3126 " title="Dawn Patrol" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/136.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes, it&#8217;s very dark! There are seven balloons in &#8220;Dawn Patrol.&#8221;</p></div>
<div id="attachment_3127" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/164.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3127   " title="Dawn Patrol" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/164.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These balloons are qualified to fly in the dark. Atmospheric conditions will change as the sun rises.</p></div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3209" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/212.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3209 " title="Dawn Patrol" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/212.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The sun is on its way.</p></div>
<p><strong>MASS ASCENSION</strong></p>
<p>The moment we had all been waiting for had arrived. Once they are swelling with hot air, it doesn&#8217;t take long for the balloons to begin their ascent.  There were 87 balloons that participated with at least twelve of them in special shapes, including a Pepsi Can, Darth Vader, Tweety Bird, Shark, and a Wells Fargo Wagon. All balloons were sponsored this year. I understand it&#8217;s quite costly to own on of these balloons, estimated at least $50,000, and this does include the cost of racing them. I envisioned them all lifting off at once. But it didn&#8217;t quite happen like that. They mostly lifted in spurts in small groupings.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3435" title="Mass Ascension " src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-300.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_3212" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-3311.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3462" title="Colorful Balloons" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-3311.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/313.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3212" title="Darth Vader Rises" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/313.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a> When Darth Vader ascended, they played the Star Wars theme.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-345.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3448" title="Balloons filling the sky" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-345.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p><strong>THE RACE BEGINS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It is a race, although you&#8217;d never know it. They seemed to float rather aimlessly. The balloons attempt to hit some mysterious &#8220;X&#8221; post in the sky. I never saw them anywhere. Participants throw bean bags (or something) at a target with their insignia to prove, indeed, they were there.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-3591.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3463" title="Racing towards their target" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-3591.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-391.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3456" title="A beautiful day to float a balloon" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-391.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-427.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3466" title="Heading towards their target" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-427.jpg?w=620&#038;h=412" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>Not all balloons finish the race. This one landed in the parking lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-495.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3472" title="Parking lot landing" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-495.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="930" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a nice view of Reno on our walk back to our car. Shark and Tweety Bird never made it off the ground. Poor Tweety never even filled up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-487.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="A view of Reno " src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-487.jpg?w=620&#038;h=412" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>The kids probably had the most fun playing with their cousins and running through the open fields.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-273.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3469" title="Running through the fields" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-273.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-274.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3506" title="Fun with the cousins" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-274.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, spotting a snake on our walk back was pretty hard to beat, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-479.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3471" title="The desert is crawling with snakes" src="http://thebumblefiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dragonrun-479.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a></p>
<p class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3479">I&#8217;m sure one day my kids will ask me, &#8220;Remember that time we saw the balloons?&#8221; Yes, I remember. It was a beautiful day. If you ever get a chance to go to a balloon race, I highly recommend it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went around the house last night &#8220;mommy shaming&#8221; myself while Scott was giving the girls a bath. If you are unfamiliar what mommy/dog/baby shaming is, it is basically holding up a sign in front of yourself, dog or baby admitting something shameful. I believe it all started with <a href="http://dog-shaming.com/">this dog shaming website. </a></p>
<p>I found an article on twitter last night about &#8220;Mommy shaming&#8221;. I was laughing so hard &#8211; check it out <a href="http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2012/10/09/10-hilarious-moms-share-their-mom-shaming-pics/">here</a>. I had to do one myself. I couldn&#8217;t help but admit my own mommy-shames because Lord knows I have some:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joran Van der Sloot, convicted lady murderer, has gotten a woman pregnant &#8211;CONSENTUALLY&#8211; from a jail in Lima. Good GOD, ladies! Get your shit together! You know what should be a dealbreaker? Being a murderer. Another dealbreaker: extorting money from the parents of a girl you murdered.</p>
<p>I thought we were passed this by now! I will give this lady the benefit of the doubt and assume that <em>Sex and the City</em> hasn&#8217;t made it to Lima yet, and she must not know that she can be Single and Fabulous <em>&#8211;exclamation point! </em>Or at the very least, be Single and Not Dating a World Famous Serial Killer&#8211;<em>exclamation point! </em><em> </em></p>
<p>To this lady: here&#8217;s proof that being a spinster &#8211;nay&#8211; a bachelorette, cannot be as bad as dating a psychopath&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_2730" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sperm-piggy-bank-dr-heckle-funny-fail-pictures.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2730" title="sperm piggy bank dr heckle funny fail pictures" src="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sperm-piggy-bank-dr-heckle-funny-fail-pictures.jpg?w=300&#038;h=264" alt="" width="300" height="264" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Guys, it&#8217;s a sperm bank!</p></div>
<p>1. If you really, really want a baby right now (your prerogative, ma&#8217;am!) you can stay single and take a quick trip to the sperm bank, turkey baster in hand. That way, you can still have a baby AND that baby could be filled with Sexy Italian Architect DNA or Adorable Jewish Doctaaah genes instead of Dutch psychopath juice. Talk about having and eating cake!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/anderson-cooper-impersonates-courtney-stodden-on-the-ridiculist-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2729" title="Anderson-Cooper-Impersonates-Courtney-Stodden-on-the-RidicuList-2" src="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/anderson-cooper-impersonates-courtney-stodden-on-the-ridiculist-2.jpg?w=350&#038;h=268" alt="" width="350" height="268" /></a>2. Anderson Cooper did a show on women who marry men in jail, and you should have seen the shade he was throwing in these ladies&#8217; directions. Do you really want to walk around knowing that Anderson Cooper is judging you? Girl, you need to drop this act asap because you&#8217;re about one news cycle away from being on his Ridiculist.</p>
<p><a href="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/so-i-married-an-axe-murderer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727" title="so-i-married-an-axe-murderer" src="http://brunchforeverymeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/so-i-married-an-axe-murderer.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>3. Marrying a murderer is not full of the same hijinks that Mike Myers would have you believe. Remember, in <em>So I Married an Axe Murderer</em> {SPOILER ALERT} at the 11th hour it&#8217;s revealed that Harriet is not actually a murderer, so if you were thinking &#8220;if Mike Myers can make it work, so can I,&#8221; your theory is now null and void.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just something to think about while you wait for the package I&#8217;ve sent you which includes the  <em>Sex and the City</em> Complete Series box set, a wine of the month club membership, and this book:</p>

<p>Joran, <em>who?! </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Disciples,</p>
<p>Yesterday, I walked into the office and saw something I hadn&#8217;t seen in a very long time. One of the Guardians was sitting at the computer, and Brother Henry was strapped to her body with some kind of sling.</p>
<div id="attachment_4411" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-sitting-in-sling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4411" title="Henry sitting in sling" src="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-sitting-in-sling.jpg" alt="Henry sitting in sling" width="500" height="520" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is what I saw when I walked into the office.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-4410"></span>Now, as I said, this was something I hadn&#8217;t seen for a very long time. Brother Henry used to sit in a sling all the time when the Guardian was painting, but she gave up painting quite a while ago. At around the same time, Brother Henry first got word of the possibility that the long-feared Dog Uprising was in the works, so he devoted the time he had been spending in the sling to patrolling our house and watching out the windows for any suspicious canine activity. When I saw him in the sling yesterday, I thought that maybe the canine threat had diminished or something. Brother Henry informed Me otherwise.</p>
<div id="attachment_4412" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-confident-in-sling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4412" title="Henry confident in sling" src="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-confident-in-sling.jpg" alt="Henry confident in sling" width="500" height="373" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I thought that Brother Henry&#8217;s being in the sling meant that the threat of the long-feared Dog Uprising had diminished. I was wrong.</p></div>
<p>Brother Henry told Me that the sling was part of a new strategy he was instituting to increase our readiness. Although the Guardian didn&#8217;t know it, Brother Henry was using her as a mobile command post and lookout tower. From his elevated perch in the sling he had an excellent view of the surrounding landscape and could quickly identify any possible threats.</p>
<div id="attachment_4413" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 440px"><a href="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-vigilant-in-sling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4413" title="Henry vigilant in sling" src="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-vigilant-in-sling.jpg" alt="Henry vigilant in sling" width="430" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brother Henry said that from his elevated position in the sling, he could keep a lookout for any possible threats.</p></div>
<p>Brother Henry went on to say that he was training the Guardian to go where he wanted by pointing his paw and meowing. So far it hadn&#8217;t worked, but he was confident that once the communication barrier was dealt with, his mobile command post would be our most important asset in our stand against the LFDU.</p>
<div id="attachment_4414" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 461px"><a href="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-directing-from-sling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4414" title="Henry directing from sling" src="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-directing-from-sling.jpg" alt="Henry directing from sling" width="451" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brother Henry was attempting to train the Guardian to follow his commands. So far, he was having no luck.</p></div>
<p>And finally, Brother Henry pointed out that if the long-feared Dog Uprising did come to pass, there would be no safer place than being strapped directly to one of the Guardians. He said he was actually trying to figure out a way to fit Brother Oliver, Thomas and Me into the sling as well so we would all be protected if the worst came to pass.</p>
<div id="attachment_4415" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 463px"><a href="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-lovable-in-sling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4415" title="Henry lovable in sling" src="http://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/henry-lovable-in-sling.jpg" alt="Henry lovable in sling" width="453" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brother Henry pointed out that the safest place to be if the Uprising comes to pass is strapped to a Guardian.</p></div>
<p>I must admit that Brother Henry has a pretty bold plan for our mutual defense, but I have My doubts that his &#8220;Guardian Outpost&#8221; project will be successful. This is not because I think the Guardians can&#8217;t be trained to move on command or anything. No, it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t think the Guardian&#8217;s backs can handle lugging around so many pounds of tabby fury for any length of time. Brother Henry alone weighs in at 17 pounds.

Then this crazy idea of his just might have a chance of working!</p>
