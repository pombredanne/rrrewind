				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24703" title="latest_pivotalstates" alt="" src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/latest_pivotalstates4.png?w=1024&#038;h=617" height="617" width="1024" /></p>
<p>Results are due tonight in the United States presidential election. We&#8217;ll keep a running tally here of the Electoral College—270 votes are needed to win—and for more detailed results, we recommend the <a href="http://elections2012.npr.org/">mobile-friendly display at NPR</a>. Romney has an early lead, <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/network-calls">according to the networks</a>. We&#8217;re using NBC&#8217;s count above. But the pivotal states haven&#8217;t yet been called.</p>
<h2>Latest update</h2>
<p><b>Some not quite great early returns for Romney in North Carolina and Florida. </b>The two sunbelt states are critical to Romney&#8217;s election; he&#8217;ll need them both to get 270 electoral votes, and both were leaning toward him in the latest polls. Now that voting is done in both states, we&#8217;re starting to see results that are surprisingly good for President Obama.</p>
<p>In Florida, he leads <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/florida">the early count</a>, outperforming his 2008 results in key counties like Palm Beach and Miami-Dade, while remaining competitive in the state&#8217;s central I-4 corridor. The CNN exit poll <a href="http://twitter.com/BuzzFeedAndrew/status/265982682226368512">predicts</a> he wins by just one percentage point. In North Carolina, Obama is again <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/north-carolina">outperforming in critical counties</a> in the early vote, and <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20121106/BLOGS02/121109821/exit-polls-say-obama-ahead-in-ohio-tied-in-virginia-n-c">exit polls</a> have the two candidates tied. The last opinion polls in North Carolina showed Romney with about a 2 percentage point lead, so if the final results have him tied in the state, he&#8217;s not seeing the kind of broad national turn towards his candidacy he needs to upset Obama more important swing states.</p>
<h2>Following the results</h2>
<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">Nate Silver</a>, the statistician and polling soothsayer who gained popularity after his accurate calls in the 2008 election, figures Obama has a 90.9% chance of winning re-election. The betters at <a href="http://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/scoreboard/">Intrade</a> put the president&#8217;s odds at 69.8%. And when you look at the swing states that will determine the outcome, Obama has many more <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/scenarios">paths to victory</a>. So he&#8217;s clearly the favorite.</p>
<p><strong>There are only nine states that matter:</strong> Florida (with 29 Electoral College votes), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10), Colorado (9), Iowa (6), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4). Obama is expected to take Pennsylvania and Nevada by narrow margins; if he adds Florida or Ohio, Romney would have few opportunities to catch up. But Romney victories in Florida and a number of the smaller states would pose a challenge.</p>
<p>Poll closing times for the states that matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia closed at <strong>7 p.m. ET</strong>.</li>
<li>Ohio closed at<strong> 7:30 p.m. ET</strong>.</li>
<li>Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire closed at <strong>8 p.m. ET</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>9 p.m. ET:</strong> Iowa, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is it about first times that suck? OK, that&#8217;s not a blanket statement for everything, but in general, first times tend to be weird and awkward and not at all like what the movies tell you.</p>
<p>I guess media is to blame for this great expectation I have for first times. I always think that the first time I do anything it&#8217;s going to be epic&#8211;I&#8217;ll remember it for the rest of my life. And, I do, remember it. But not for the reasons I think.</p>
<p>In my head I picture fireworks and probably confetti, maybe balloons that drop from the ceiling. There&#8217;ll be a soft glow around everything that gives off the illusion of perfection. Everywhere I go people will be staring and clapping for me with huge smiles on their faces. &#8220;Way to go!&#8221; &#8220;You did it!&#8221; &#8220;That was amazing!&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re fabulous!&#8221; Those are some of the words of encouragement I&#8217;ll hear among many other praises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-66" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Expectations" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/expectations.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;ll probably be flash photography and a red carpet, too.</p>
<p>But what tends to happen is I am sorely disappointed and left . . . well, unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Like first kisses for example, do you remember your very first kiss? Was it romantic and sweet?</p>
<p>You probably envisioned this perfect night where you and your love interest spend an evening talking and laughing, getting to know each other, probably eating something deliciously romantic like pasta where you share a plate and it just so happens that you grab the same noodle. You look into each others eyes and draw closer and closer until your lips touch in a chaste peck. And there it is. Your first kiss. Sweet and memorable. (This may or may not have derived from a romantic flick about two dogs who fall in love. Ah, amor!)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/expectation-kiss.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Expectation Kiss" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/expectation-kiss.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>But I bet most first kisses lean more towards the line of over eager lips going in for a kill that end up in bumping teeth and blood. Or maybe knocking foreheads. If not that then just a remarkably unremarkable, non-monumental, big disappointment of a silly milestone. Possibly something entirely clumsy and messy and not at all the romantic scene you&#8217;d envisioned from childhood&#8211;it may have even been frightening. That&#8217;s OK, it happens. It&#8217;s normal. If the first kiss you had terrified you because you saw this huge face zooming in to attack your personal space to plant an unwelcome slobbery mess of a kiss on your un-puckered lips, don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/reality-kiss.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Reality Kiss" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/reality-kiss.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>Really, I&#8217;m sure it happens every day.</p>
<p>Or maybe the first day of high school, or your first day of college. You imagine walking in all cool and suave&#8211;the picture of nonchalance. People will look at you in class and whisper, &#8220;Who&#8217;s that? How cool.&#8221; You&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;re walking on a million bucks, and then something will happen that will just make you stand out from every other student. And everyone will know who you are&#8211;all eyes are on you for the rest of your four years at this educational institution.</p>
<p>What probably happens is you&#8217;re in class and you&#8217;re so nervous about it being your first day and how you don&#8217;t want to blow anything because you never get a second chance at a first impression. But you&#8217;re so nervous that your stomach is just bubbling with indigestion and you&#8217;re trying to get comfortable in your seat, however, there&#8217;s a moment of silence when the teacher asks a question and your stomach is so uncooperative that you let out the tiniest squeak of a fart. And there it is. Your first day ruined. And now you&#8217;re known as Farty McFart for the rest of your four years. Classmates will be whispering and snickering at the kid who farted on the first day. (Hopefully it&#8217;s not as traumatizing as that).</p>
<p>That was a long story, but I have a point, I think. (I may not).</p>
<p>I voted for the first time today. I exercised my right as an American citizen to vote for the president of the United States. I did my civic duty and will probably peace out for the next four years. (Joking . . . )</p>
<p>So, I was getting a little psyched up about going to the polls and casting in my ballot. My parents and I took a family walk to my old elementary school. It looked exactly as I remembered . . . I&#8217;m 24 . . . I was there when I was 12 . . . . wow, that was more than 12 years ago. Still the same tiny place.</p>
<p>I envisioned long lines teeming with people, young and old. I built up this imaginary feeling of 1 part thrill, 2 parts nerve and every part of my body tingling with magic. I could just see my little ballot making its way to the electoral college weighing so heavily in their hands&#8211;my vote, with the weight of choosing the next president resting on its paper shoulder.</p>
<p>When we entered the multi-purpose room, the scene that unfolded before my eyes was a little tiled room with mothers and fathers and grandparents (I was the youngest person there by 15 years, except for the babies who were maybe 7).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/voting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Voting" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/voting.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t full by any means. The lines were staggered and people were engaged in friendly conversation: &#8220;Hey, Bill!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, hey&#8211;you still live in this precinct?&#8221; What the heck was this place? And why did all these old people have the same shoes? (My folks included).</p>
<p>I thought I would walk confidently, striding behind my little screen to cast my vote; I thought it would look something like the Wizard of Oz. We just stood in line waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And I tentatively took my seat at the electronic station, which was this computer that looked like it was built in the 1980&#8242;s. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, I just touched some buttons on the screen. And then I was done.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ballot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Ballot" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ballot.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>There were no bells ringing. No lights flashing. Definitely no confetti or pyrotechnics of any kind. So when I walked away, I wasn&#8217;t even sure I did it. Vote that is.</p>
<p>I think, to get more people to vote, they should probably incorporate some kind of celebratory confetti throwing, or clappers, or maybe even party hats and those funny sounding paper whistle things. I truly believe with my whole heart that this would entice Americans to come out from hiding if they could feel like superstars for a mere moment.</p>
<p>On the upside, they do give you a sticker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/sticker.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Sticker" alt="" src="http://easilyemused.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/sticker.jpg?w=640&#038;h=420" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Last year Lomography came to Brighton and let us play with their various cameras and film. I settled on the LCA and a red scale film. By accident, my local photography shop played around with the colour, as they didn&#8217;t realise the film that I used. I quite like what they&#8217;ve done.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=freshlypressed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=256907&#038;post=24&#038;subd=freshlypressed&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><a href="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/woman-writing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1147" title="woman-writing" alt="" src="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/woman-writing.jpg?w=240&#038;h=314" height="314" width="240" /></a>From Traci&#8217;s journal, February 16, 2009:</p>
<p>It’s hard to understand even the simplest of things. Communication is key. I have to understand what people are trying to convey to me. Especially those closest to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>My relationship with <a title="Traci" href="http://valleyroadrambler.wordpress.com/traci/">Traci </a>seemed to soar on the wings of angels for our first few years. Everyone could see we were in love. We wrote notes for each other and left them where they would be found later, when we were apart. I believe Traci started it, with notes that she wrote for me when I went away on a trip, and we continued throughout our time together to express fondness and appreciation for each other in both handwritten notes and email messages.</p>
<p><a href="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dreaming.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1152" title="dreaming" alt="" src="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dreaming.jpg?w=584&#038;h=362" height="362" width="584" /></a>Not that it was always rainbows and butterflies. Traci had two very different personalities I came to refer to as Screeching Crow and Cooing Dove. She liked those descriptions and referred to them herself.</p>
<p>For five years, we never fought. We had disagreements, but neither of us felt so strongly about an issue that we weren&#8217;t ready to compromise. Even when we couldn&#8217;t resolve an argument through words, one of us would often say something funny, whether intentional or not, and we&#8217;d both end up laughing and forgetting what we had disagreed on.</p>
<p>But not this one morning. It was the spring of 2009. At that time, Traci worked in the mess hall kitchen at the local military training base, a job which required her to get up and leave early in the morning. Because of her epilepsy, in which almost all of her seizures occurred within a half-hour of waking, she needed to wake up slowly and gently, and wait at least 30 minutes before getting out of bed. Usually I would get myself up at the same time and go downstairs to prepare a light breakfast and bring it up to share with Traci before she went to work.</p>
<p>This was a rough morning for both of us. I&#8217;m going to take you back in time with me via my journal entry for that morning, slightly edited:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>This morning I woke at 4 a.m. after less than 5 hours sleep. I went downstairs, prepared breakfast and brought it up, then went back downstairs to clean up a pile of wet dog shit in the kitchen. Apparently he has worms, which might have been prevented if we&#8217;d had an extra $25 this past week to get him de-wormed. With a little bit more we could have bought cigarettes too &#8230; but I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>After I finish cleaning up I come back to bed. Traci sits beside me, reading, for a couple of minutes. I stroke her back. She says she likes it. Shortly after that, she gets up &#8211; time for her to go to work. She turns her light out. I say, &#8220;Can I have a kiss?&#8221; Here&#8217;s what I get back, in her harshest Screeching Crow voice: &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s dark, just hold on a minute!&#8221; She turns the ceiling lights on, then says, still harshly, &#8220;And now you&#8217;ve got a big smile on your face?&#8221; (I think it might have been a smile meant to convey affection, but anyway &#8230;) Not much feeling in the kiss that came after that. It felt like I&#8217;d been punched in the heart, so the kiss was no consolation.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Next, she&#8217;s looking for her cigarettes. Can&#8217;t find them, nor is there any money in the house or any left in the bank account. It&#8217;s two days before her new job&#8217;s first pay is deposited, so I tell her to use her Visa card, which she thinks is a bad idea. She leaves in a bad mood, and I&#8217;m left here wondering, not sleeping, wondering what the hell just happened.</em></p>
<p>Later that day, I receive a heartfelt apology from her by email. (Sadly, I haven&#8217;t been able to find that email.) She acknowledged her mistake in treating me as she did that morning, expressing her appreciation of me and dismay at her own behaviour. In my next journal entry, I wrote, &#8220;The fact that she acknowledges when she&#8217;s done wrong and doesn&#8217;t let her ego stand in the way of doing the right thing, is another reason why I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/thumbs_up.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1148" title="thumbs_up" alt="" src="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/thumbs_up.jpeg?w=144&#038;h=144" height="144" width="144" /></a></p>
<p>All couples, no matter how happy they may seem, are going to have fights and disagreements. If you&#8217;re fortunate, as Traci and I were, you may be together for years before having your first major argument, but it will happen.</p>
<p>The key isn&#8217;t to avoid arguments at all costs. That can put you into a state of denial and tip-toeing around each other to avoid emotional distress and pain. If you keep stuffing down hurt feelings or denying your own perspective on a situation, you are opening yourself up to greater unhappiness and distress down the road. Might as well get things out in the open in an air of mutual respect and desire to resolve your disagreement.</p>
<p>Maybe prior to that morning, Traci and I had coasted for a while, and there were things she at least needed to get out in the open that she hadn&#8217;t yet. Even if her own frustration at finding a decent-paying job that she could stay in for a while was what was eating at her that morning, it would have been better if we&#8217;d had a chance to talk that through before her repressed feelings exploded to the surface the way they did.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a lot about the importance of effective communication between partners in a relationship. Traci and I had worked a lot of things out through talking, but she was still saying we needed to improve in our communications with each other. I guess it&#8217;s like playing a game where someone keeps moving the goal posts. You may score a few points, but if you&#8217;re going to win the game you need to keep moving to keep up with the target.</p>
<p><a href="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d-and-t-garden-party-2010.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1150" title="D and T - Garden Party 2010" alt="" src="http://valleyroadrambler.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d-and-t-garden-party-2010.jpg?w=300&#038;h=244" height="244" width="300" /></a>This is an important topic. To Traci it might have been the most important. I&#8217;ve had it on my mind for months to write about it, yet I kept putting it off, and now I realize it will take up at least two blog posts.</p>
<p>Through many talks and experiences with Traci, I learned that effective communication is the key to a long, happy, mature relationship. In my opinion, the basic principles of effective communication are:</p>
<p>1. Listen<br />
2. Reflect<br />
3. Respond</p>
<p>In my next post I will elaborate on these principles and share a few things I learned during my time with Traci that I hope will be helpful to my readers.</p>
<p>Comments, as always, are welcome and appreciated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>A short little piece inspired by the tenth student in fifteen minutes to inquire about a test.</i></p>
<p><b>1. Have you graded our tests yet?</b></p>
<p>No.  Contrary to popular belief, I am not a Scantron machine.  Good thing, too, because to my knowledge, Scantron machines cannot grade short answer or essay questions which make up the bulk of your test.  And while I do consider myself a reasonably intelligent human being I have not yet perfected my reading skills to complete ninety, four-page tests in one hour (which is exactly how long it has been since you walked out of my classroom) even if I weren’t teaching the rest of the day or preparing your classes for tomorrow.  I reassure you that the second the tests are graded, the grades will be posted online because (also contrary to popular belief) I have better things to do than get my kicks by keeping already-graded-but-still-unentered exams around my house for added decor or extra toilet paper.  Even though I&#8217;m paid peanuts, even I can afford toilet paper.  So scoot your butt out of here and let me start digging through this pile o’ trees I just killed in the interest of furthering your education.</p>
<p><b>2.  Must be nice to have all that vacation:</b></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to have twenty six minutes to eat your lunch, lovely to share a bathroom with 500 teenagers, and a delight to climb to the second floor every time I need access to a printer that works.</p>
<p>Oh wait&#8230;no it’s not.</p>
<p>Nor is it a party to work twelve hours a day when everybody pretends it’s just seven, never have enough money to buy supplies I need for my classroom (like the newest name-brand technology&#8230;or just staples.  Really would be happy with staples) or watch my profession get reamed in the news for not doing our job, while those doing the reaming cut the resources we’re actually given to do our job, then lay off a wad of us, increasing the job load for the three teachers left standing.</p>
<p>But yeah, the vacation’s pretty nice.</p>
<p>3.  <b>I know you’re really busy, but&#8230;</b></p>
<p>Don’t.  Just don’t.</p>
<p>4.  <b>Those who can, do.  Those who can’t, teach.</b></p>
<p>Hey, listen.  I need to run to the office for a second.  Can you keep a handle on this room of 30 teenagers for about 15 minutes?  I’m sure you’ll be fine.  Oh, and if you could make sure they learn some Calculus, that’d be great, too.  Don’t forget that Jodi’s allergic to peanuts, (I’m sure you know how to use an Epipen).  Eric and Bobby can’t be within a three-foot radius of one another.  Leena’s diabetic supplies are in the top right-hand corner of the desk, and the lesson always has to be differentiated for&#8230;never mind&#8230;of course you already know how to handle this, because you’re one of those gosh durn smart “doers.”</p>
<p>5.  <b>But I <i>need </i>an A!</b></p>
<p>No, you don’t.</p>
<p>You need air, water, food, sleep and probably the occasional bowel movement.  You <i>want</i> an A.  But how you plan on going about getting it is entirely up to you.  I’ll just be over here in my little corner hangin’ out in case you decide to turn in some homework or ask for help on a concept or something.  You know, hypothetically speaking.</p>
<p>6.  <b>Ugh.  How do you deal with teenagers all day?</b></p>
<p>You get year-end bonuses.  Or maybe quarterly bonuses.  Oooh&#8230;and raises.  And non-frozen salaries&#8230;</p>
<p>I change lives.</p>
<p>And I get year-end Christmas cookies.  And daily high fives&#8230;.and pant-peeing laughter.  And non-conforming creativity&#8230;</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p>So shove it and let me get back to work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_1147" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://justinegraykin.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/erica-me.jpg"><img src="http://justinegraykin.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/erica-me.jpg?w=210&#038;h=300" alt="" title="erica &amp; me" width="210" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1147" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Erica and me, Christmas, 1957</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">It&#8217;s been a rough couple of months.  Losing the first cat wasn&#8217;t so bad (I wrote <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/search/2405694-95/witchie-cat-cats-peppercorn" target="_blank">a nice article for the newspaper</a> about that).  The second cat was a lot harder (see the <a href="http://justinegraykin.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/the-undead-within-us/" title="The Undead Within Us" target="_blank">previous post</a>).  But that was nothing.  My brother-in-law called yesterday morning and told me my sister had died.  I didn&#8217;t even know she was ill.  Everyone else did.  All her friends, the entire family, her church.  Not me.  Because she had expressly told them she didn&#8217;t want me to be told.  They had their chance to visit her in the hospice where she lay dying of cancer.  Not me.  They begged her to let them tell me.  She refused.  Why?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
Because I am an atheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
It was her final gesture to me, her final retribution for my lack of belief in her god.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
We had been estranged for a long time because I did not share her fundamentalist Christian beliefs, or in fact, any belief in a god at all.  I am not an &#8220;evangelistic&#8221; atheist.  I don&#8217;t push my beliefs aggressively on others, although if they push theirs on me I&#8217;ll readily push back.  If a claim, religious or otherwise, seems patently ridiculous to me, I have little patience for it.  But although I do not believe in God, I do believe in tolerance.  Besides, she was my only sister.  Our parents and grandparents were gone, and she was the only close family I had left.  She could have believed in alien abductions and fairies in the back garden and it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
Those who knew her and loved her, knew what they had lost when she died.  I can never know because she denied me that.  Even at the end, when she was dying, she denied me the chance to speak with her one last time.  That was the deepest cut of all.  But I don&#8217;t blame those who knew she was dying and didn&#8217;t tell me.  It was her wish and they felt compelled to honor it.  I forgive them, and moreover, I feel deep sympathy for them because of the terrible position they were in.  I am sorry they had to deal with that on top of dealing with Erica&#8217;s death.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
I cannot know what possessed Erica to do this to me.  She said it was because I had no faith.  Because I am an atheist.  She held her love for me hostage, demanding a payment I could not give, because belief is not a choice.  It comes from the heart.  It is a conviction that you cannot argue yourself out of even if you try.  It is what makes sense to you, even if it is because you must throw up your hands and admit you don&#8217;t understand.  Credo quia absurdum.   I respect that.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
You see, I had no problem with Erica&#8217;s faith.  We cannot know what compels a person to believe in one thing and not another.  We argue, debate, but we rarely change each other&#8217;s convictions.  Still, if the debating is done in the proper spirit, it has its use, as a means to help us understand what it is that each believes.  Because we must all learn to live together, in spite of our differences.  We can do this through compassion, through understanding, through tolerance and forgiveness.  This is what I believe.  It is not a Christian thing; it is not a Buddhist thing; it is not an atheist thing.  It is a human thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
I always hoped that some day Erica would relent, and would welcome me into her heart and let me know her.  Now that she is gone, so is that chance, that hope.  That is what I have lost.  She was my only sister.  We should have been close.  We should have forgiven each other our differences and shared the love of family.  Her nephews, my sons, will have no memories of her.  She denied them that.  What a tragedy.  She said she believed in a god of love and compassion, why then had she none for me?  She said she believed in a forgiving savior, why then, could she not forgive me?  It baffles me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
But I forgive her, because she must have had her reasons, reasons I cannot understand.  And if I am to see any good come from her death, and the way she denied me, it is by appealing to all of you, theist and atheist alike, but especially Christians:  Do not shut others out of your heart because they do not share your faith.   If your god is true and real and as powerful as you believe, what defense does he need?   I am an atheist, but I am not the enemy.  I do not seek to deny you your faith, or the faith of any other.  If you act in love, compassion and forgiveness, then I have no quarrel with you.  Let this be our common ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:15px;">
There are so many things that set us against one other.  Please don&#8217;t let differences in belief be among them.   Do not let forgiveness be solely the prerogative of the Divine.</p>

<p>Confused.</p>
<p>Lately, it&#8217;s been a lot of that. I&#8217;ve felt that a lot.</p>
<p>Hard to find substance.</p>

<p>In traditional publishing circles especially, fingers are being pointed at self-publishers (and their chief enablers, Amazon), who stand accused of encouraging a race to the bottom, of devaluing books, and training readers to pay ever-cheaper amounts &#8211; making the whole book business unsustainable.</p>
<p>Today, I have a guest post from Ed Robertson &#8211; author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007712HM4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank">Breakers</a></em> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S17UG4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank"><em>Melt Down</em></a> - which takes issue with that view. His logic is compelling, based on a historical look at book prices. This is <em>really</em> worth the read:</p>
<p><strong>Self-Publishers Aren&#8217;t Killing The Industry, They&#8217;re Saving It</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a self-publisher. An indie author. Whatever you want to call me. I&#8217;ve read many articles about how self-publishers are killing the book industry. I&#8217;ve heard it from big publishing houses. From the president of the Author&#8217;s Guild. From traditionally published novelists and agents and even other self-publishers. If I want, I bet I can find a new one of these articles every single day.</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t, because I no longer believe them.</p>
<p>Self-publishers don&#8217;t have the power to kill the publishing industry. I don&#8217;t think anyone does. But we do have the power to change it. We already have &#8211; and paradoxically, this change isn&#8217;t a change at all. And instead of killing books, this change has helped resurrect them.</p>
<p>We aren&#8217;t the first to be accused of killing the industry. In 1939, Robert de Graff threatened to kill publishing, too. At the tail end of the Great Depression, when hardcovers regularly sold for between $2.50-$3.00, he started selling paperback Pocket Books for $0.25.<span id="more-2476"></span></p>
<p>To put that in 2012 dollars, hardcovers cost roughly $40-50. The new paperbacks, the first of their kind in American markets, cost the equivalent of $4.16. In modern terms, a book that once cost as much as a coffee maker now cost as little as a cup of coffee. A book that once cost as much as a full tank of gas now cost as little as a gallon.</p>
<p>In just over five years from that 1939 launch date, Pocket Books sold 100 million paperbacks.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t all high fives around the burgeoning paperback business. One publisher at Penguin was so aghast at the tawdry covers on his books he wound up selling off the entire line. Others worried openly about the death of the hardcover industry. On the concept of skipping hardcovers entirely and printing straight to paperback, even Pocket Books&#8217; own VP Freeman Lewis said, &#8220;Successful authors are not interested in original publishing at 25 cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they were, of course. Particularly genre writers who didn&#8217;t care if this new format was disgraceful. Because it sold. Readers bought their books by the millions. As the format was being denounced as the playground of hacks, authors like William S. Burroughs and Philip K. Dick got their start with bargain-priced paperback-only prints (specifically, with Ace Doubles that sold two novels bundled for $0.35). The history of the era is fascinating &#8211; <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/137715" target="_blank">a short yet rich article recaps it here</a> - but what is most interesting to me is that initial $0.25 price.</p>
<p>Passive Guy suggests that <a href="http://www.thepassivevoice.com/10/2012/are-self-publishing-authors-killing-the-publishing-industry/" target="_blank">self-publishing is saving an industry crippled by missteps</a> (scroll down for his comments underneath the excerpted article). He says big publishers have raised the price of books far beyond the rate of inflation, driving away readers and strangling the market. He doesn&#8217;t cite numbers. I will.</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1939-1961, many paperbacks sold for $0.25-0.35. In 2012 dollars, prices started at $4.16 and decreased to as little as $2.71.</li>
<li>By 1966-68, low-end prices bubbled back up to $0.60-0.75. In 2012, that&#8217;s $3.99-4.99.</li>
<li>By 1972-75, mass market paperbacks kept on climbing to $0.95-1.25. In 2012, that&#8217;s $5.26-6.92.</li>
<li>By the mid 1980s, mass markets hit $2.95-3.95. In 2012, that&#8217;s $6.34-8.49, with some beyond $9.50.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, relative prices slowly decreased between 1939-1961. By 1966, they climbed steeply, peaking around 1982-86 at an inflation-adjusted $7.99 (or more). The price of most mass market paperbacks has remained there ever since. In less than two decades, paperbacks cost 295% what they did in the years before.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, corporate mergers of publishing houses began in earnest in 1958, accelerated in the 1960s, and became an &#8220;epidemic&#8221; by the 1970. By the 1980s, the American publishing industry reached a state largely like the one we see today, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34566/" target="_blank">where a handful of companies own the vast majority of the business</a>.</p>
<p>And as publishing companies grew larger and ostensibly more efficient, the prices of their cheapest offerings tripled.</p>
<p>Correlation isn&#8217;t causation. I don&#8217;t know that the consolidation of the publishing industry was a direct cause of this massive surge in prices. But if I had to bet, I would bet that these mergers resulted in a de facto monopoly, a semi-collusive state where publishers raised prices simply because they could. I don&#8217;t think these price increases were natural or inevitable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, it doesn&#8217;t matter why they happened.</p>
<p>What matters is that prices went up. A lot. People had to pay more to read. The more they read, the more they had to pay. Books, as much as it might feel otherwise, aren&#8217;t a necessity of life. They aren&#8217;t food. They aren&#8217;t gasoline or electricity. As prices go up, sales go down. Readers read less&#8211;especially in times of recession. The market erodes. Becomes vulnerable to change.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the publishing industry failed to keep their lowest-priced books anywhere near the prices they&#8217;d maintained for decades. When ebooks arrived, instead of going lower, they wound up costing even more than the old paperbacks. $9.99. $12.99. $14.99. They still don&#8217;t cost as much as a tank of gas, but three of them do.</p>
<p>Big publishers maintained these ebook prices through outright collusion. Even as they fought to keep ebooks even higher priced than their artificially-inflated paperback prices, online retailers like Amazon, iTunes, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Kobo threatened to kill the publishing industry again. They made it possible for authors to publish directly to readers. In the midst of the Great Recession, independent authors offered their books at prices first established in the Great Depression. Some authors went even cheaper. Many wrote genre trash. Many sported lurid, shameful covers. Across the industry, hands were wrung.</p>
<h3><em><strong>&#8220;If indies have killed anything, it&#8217;s the idea that books need to cost as much as they do.&#8221;</strong></em></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what happened to spike prices between 1961 and now. Maybe publishers got greedy. Maybe they just got inefficient, but never had to address the issue, because they were the only game in town; if people wanted to read good books, they had to buy from traditional publishers. Publishers who, for whatever reason, abandoned those low-cost, Pocket-style books.</p>
<p>And when the opportunity finally arose, indie authors stepped in to that gap. If indies have killed anything, it&#8217;s the idea that books need to cost as much as they do. Many indies have gone so far as to sell their books for $0.99, or give them away for free. Confronted with this novelty, and constrained by their own recession-tightened budgets, readers have snapped up these cheapest books, leading to a constant deluge of arguments that self-published authors have gone too far, that these prices are unsustainable, that in their race to the bottom, they&#8217;ll ruin the market for everyone.</p>
<p>The proper dismantling of these fears would require a response even longer than this one. I will say that indie authors need to eat, too. The rising class of professional self-publishers has to pay for cover artists, editing, proofreading, and advertising of its own. To treat writing as a job, indie authors have to find a way to be paid like it&#8217;s a job. In the meantime, self-publishing platforms like Amazon&#8217;s prevent prices from bottoming out by rewarding higher prices with better royalty rates and more visibility.</p>
<p>And readers help keep prices from zeroing out by proving by the millions that they are willing to pay a few dollars for books by the indie authors they love.</p>
<p>Very strangely, if you look at many of the moment&#8217;s most successful indies, the prices they charge &#8211; $2.99, $3.99, $4.99 &#8211; are the exact same prices readers paid more than fifty years ago. Indies are the new Pocket Books. And some of them are very, very good. I expect several classics have already been self-published. Able to buy and explore at prices they haven&#8217;t seen in half a century, readers are giving us real careers. In return, we&#8217;re able to offer them even better books.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, there will be a new article about how self-published authors are killing the book industry. I won&#8217;t read it. I don&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think we have anything left to prove.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>Thank you to Ed for that fascinating post. <a href="http://www.edwardwrobertson.com" target="_blank">Ed&#8217;s blog</a> is always a good read &#8211; especially on the finer points of the Amazon algorithms and maximizing KDP Select free runs. You can also <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Edward-W-Robertson/221207091226016" target="_blank">catch up with him on Facebook here</a>.</p>
<p>Ed isn&#8217;t just a smart guy, he&#8217;s a fine writer too. I read his post-apocalyptic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007712HM4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank"><em>Breakers</em></a> a few months back, and <em>loved</em> it &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPZOQAOBNT0O/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007712HM4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank">giving it five stars</a>. He released the sequel a couple of weeks ago - <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S17UG4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank">Melt Down</a> </em>- and I bought that about ten seconds after it came out, then devoured it over a few days. The sequel was just as good, and I&#8217;ll be giving that five stars as well.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007712HM4/?tag=lesgedi-20"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2479" title="BREAKERS-thumbnail" alt="" src="http://davidgaughran.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/breakers-thumbnail.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" height="300" width="200" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007712HM4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank">Breakers</a></em> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S17UG4/?tag=lesgedi-20" target="_blank"><em>Melt Down</em></a> are reduced to 99c this week, so there&#8217;s no excuse not to pick them up. Both books are also available on all the other retailers &#8211; at the same sale price.

<p>I found Ed&#8217;s post very interesting &#8211; especially the parallels between the price of a typical indie book and the original Pocket Books. It seems pretty clear that consolidation was &#8211; at the very least &#8211; a factor in increasing prices (as well as worsening conditions for authors, like advances).</p>
<p>There has been a lot of worry expressed by authors and agents that the merger of Penguin and Random House will adversely affect advances, and reduce the number of houses they can submit to. But what about book prices?</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts, but perhaps one motivation for the merger was to increase their bargaining power with Amazon. If the DOJ won&#8217;t let the Big 6 act in concert to artificially increase prices, perhaps they see a round of mergers as a way of side-stepping that pesky anti-trust legislation&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;">I work for the people we all pretend not to see. Most of my clients have pretty severe, obvious disabilities and the looks that people give (or try painfully and obviously hard NOT to give) are constant. The stares are very rarely hurtful, but the &#8220;I&#8217;m pretending to look at something else just over your shoulder but it&#8217;s not you&#8221; look. That&#8217;s the one that hurts. It&#8217;s never even directed at me. It hurts for the people I care about. It hurts because they&#8217;re PEOPLE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Since I work in their homes, often times I&#8217;m in the worst of the bad neighborhoods. Public housing sure is a popular whipping post for America, but it sure is terrible. The streets around those areas are quieter than you might think, but they&#8217;re always off of a road that intersects another road and on those corners are men and women with signs saying &#8220;Anything helps.&#8221; On those corners is where I always get frozen in a terrible place between charity and stone-heartedness. Essentially, I have two sides battling inside me when I see a Person on the Corner.</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color:#339966;">Side A</span></strong></h1>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#339966;">Are there no workhouses?</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Side A is the cynical jerk inside me. Side A whispers icily &#8220;They&#8217;re just standing there holding a sign. There&#8217;s really nothing better they could be doing?&#8221;  I know firsthand how <em>extraordinarily difficult</em> it is to get disconnected from state benefits once someone is enrolled. I know how easy it is to get assistance if you&#8217;re a parent. I know that you probably can&#8217;t afford that Louis Vuitton purse and those Juicy pants if you&#8217;re as destitute as you claim to be. I know that many homeless people are not THAT much overweight. Side A tells me &#8220;No, keep your money, at least you know where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I already give to the United Way through both my employers. We donate at church. We bring canned food to food drives and we financially support several local food shelves. Isn&#8217;t that enough? Can&#8217;t somebody else take it from here?</span></p>
<h1><span style="color:#339966;">Side B</span></h1>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I should help. I shouldn&#8217;t judge. I should take them at their word and give them some money to get food and feed their kids. The only reason I&#8217;m in my nice new car and not standing in his place is dumb luck. There are <a href="http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/poor.htm">over 90 verses in The Bible</a> about giving to the poor. The Quran similarly tells its readers that <a href="http://www.biharanjuman.org/charity.htm">good followers give a set portion of their income</a> to the poor. What I can&#8217;t find, however, is what to do about The People on the Corners. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">One thing that The Patient Wife and I are starting to do is make care bags to hand out in lieu of cash. In each bag, we will put:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Razors</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Tampons</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Soap</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Hand Sanitizer</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Gift cards to grocery stores</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Pamphlets directing them to the homeless outreach at our church</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">An MRE (meal ready to eat) where you only need to add a little bit of water to get a hot, nutritious meal</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">A small blanket</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Toothbrush</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Toothpaste</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Dental Floss</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Shampoo</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Granola bars</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">That stare I mentioned before? I&#8217;m man enough and ashamed to admit that I do that stare to the People on the Corners. I look through them, as if eye contact would commit me to an awkward, inconvenient interaction. I may glance at their sign, but if they see me looking, then they may smile and wave. If they smile and wave and I wave back, they may come to my window for money, forcing me to stammer out &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t carry cash. Sorry.&#8221; While it&#8217;s true that I don&#8217;t, I always feel like a tool saying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Am I just supposed to take them at their word? Is there a biblical definition of &#8220;poor&#8221;? Is there a formula I should be following?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">What do YOU do when you encounter The People on the Corners?</span></p>
