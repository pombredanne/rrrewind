				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m allergic to hyperbole. That said, Evgeny Morozov <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324503204578318462215991802.html">identifies</a> one of the most important challenges we face in the coming years:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are many contexts in which smart technologies are unambiguously useful and even lifesaving. Smart belts that monitor the balance of the elderly and smart carpets that detect falls seem to fall in this category. The problem with many smart technologies is that their designers, in the quest to root out the imperfections of the human condition, seldom stop to ask how much frustration, failure and regret is required for happiness and achievement to retain any meaning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great when the things around us run smoothly, but it&#8217;s even better when they don&#8217;t do so by default. That, after all, is how we gain the space to make decisions—many of them undoubtedly wrongheaded—and, through trial and error, to mature into responsible adults, tolerant of compromise and complexity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made,&#8221; Kant observed. Corollary to keep in mind: If a straight thing is made, it will be because humanity has been stripped out of it.</p>
<p>What is the endgame of the trajectory of innovation that is determined to eliminate human error, deviance, and folly? In every field of human endeavor &#8212; whether it be industry, medicine, education, governance &#8212; technological innovation reduces human involvement, thought, and action in the name of precision, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Morozov&#8217;s forthcoming book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610391381/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1610391381&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thefrathi-20">To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thefrathi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1610391381" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /></em></a>, targets what he has called &#8220;solutionism,&#8221; the temptation, I take it without having read the book yet, to view the Internet as the potential solution to every conceivable problem. I&#8217;m tempted to suggest for Morozov the target of his next book: <em>eliminationism</em> &#8212; the progressive elimination of human thought and action wherever possible. Life will increasingly consist of automated processes, actions, and interactions that will envelope and frame the human and render the human superfluous. Worse yet, insofar as the human is ultimately the root of our inconveniences and our problems, <em>solutionism&#8217;s</em> ultimate trajectory must lead to <em>eliminationism</em>.</p>
<p>There are tragic associations haunting that last formulation, so let me be clear. It is not (necessarily) the elimination of human beings that I&#8217;m worried about; it is the elimination of our humanity. The fear &#8212; and why not, let&#8217;s embrace its most popular cultural icon &#8212; is that we will be rendered zombies: alive but not living, stripped of the possibility for error, risk, failure, triumph, joy, redemption, and much of what renders our lives tragically, gloriously meaningful.</p>
<p>Albert Borgmann had it right. We must distinguish between “trouble we reject in principle and accept in practice and trouble we accept in practice and in principle.” In the former category, Borgmann has in mind troubles on the order of car accidents and cancer.  By “accepting them in practice,” Borgmann means that at the personal level we must cope with such tragedies when they strike. But these are troubles that we oppose in principle, and so we seek cures for cancer and improved highway safety.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2054 alignright" alt="wall-e" src="http://thefrailestthing.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wall-e.jpg?w=214&#038;h=198" width="214" height="198" /></p>
<p>Against these, Borgmann opposes troubles that we also accept in practice, but ought to accept in principle as well. Here the examples are preparation of a meal and hiking a mountain.  These sorts of troubles, sometimes not without their real dangers, could be opposed in principle — never prepare meals at home, never hike — but such avoidance would also prevent us from experiencing their attendant joys and satisfactions. If we seek to remove all trouble or risk from our lives; if we always opt for convenience, efficiency, and ease; if, in other words, we aim indiscriminately at the frictionless life; then we simultaneously rob ourselves of the real satisfactions and pleasures that enhance and enrich our lives &#8212; that, in fact, make our lives fully human.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huxley.net/bnw/seventeen.html">Huxley</a> had it right, too:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; said Mustapha Mond, &#8220;you&#8217;re claiming the right to be unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; said the Savage defiantly, &#8220;I&#8217;m claiming the right to be unhappy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In claiming the right to be unhappy, the Savage was claiming the right to a fully human existence. It is a right we must take increasing care to safeguard against our own fascination with the promises of technology.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://brentwaggoner.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/austen.png"><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-218" alt="Image" src="http://brentwaggoner.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/austen.png?w=490" /></a>I have a confession to make: I am sexist.</p>
<p>Not that I’ve been paying my female employees less or expecting my wife to wash my feet every night, but&#8230; actually, let’s put it another way: I’m sexist when it comes to art.</p>
<p>I began having this realization two years ago, when I finally got around to reading Jane Austen. In my mind, her novels were about women chasing after men or vice versa, storylines whose protagonists could be replaced with Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl without compromising their integrity. Imagine my surprise, upon reading them, to find novels that were as sparkling, clever, and poignant as any other classic I’d read. I felt pretty good about myself.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now. I’ve read over 300 books since 2007, and, by my count, less than 25 were novels by women. Of those 25, approximately half were Young Adult books and 2 were Harry Potter. The fullness of my prejudice hadn’t even occurred to me until earlier this year, when I was asked to review a biography of Sylvia Plath. Not having read anything of hers, I sat down with The Bell Jar, expecting an emo-tastic slog, and was amazed&#8211;amazed&#8211;when I loved it. Where had my bias come from? The blurb on the back said it was like a female Catcher in the Rye, a widely misunderstood book that I love, and that turned out to be a fair description. </p>
<p>And why do I feel this way? I can think of one main reason: I always assume I won’t be able to relate as well, because, well, I’m a man. That’s silly, of course&#8211;I can’t relate with Hemingway’s protagonists either, but I can understand their feelings and motivations. Leopold Bloom and I don’t have much in common either, but I don’t mind journeying through Dublin with him.</p>
<p>The worst thing about this assumption, though, is that it drives a stake through the heart of one of literature’s primary benefits, the chance to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes, to see life through their eyes, to understand the weight of the things that oppress them, things that would seem silly to us without that empathy. In this way&#8211;maybe primarily in this way&#8211;literature can help make us better people; but how can it change us if we never stretch outside our comfort zone?</p>
<p>So I’m trying to stretch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today’s blog is a guest post from <a href="http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucas/organisation/members/porckmh.html" target="_blank">Thijs Porck</a>, a lecturer in the Department of English Language and Culture, Universiteit Leiden. </em></p>
<p><em>This week <a href="http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucas/turning-over-a-new-leaf/researchers/kwakkelf.html" target="_blank">Erik&#8217;s</a> tweet on cat-paws in a fifteenth-century manuscript went viral across facebook and the twittersphere when it was shared and commented on by thousands. Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/erik_kwakkel" target="_blank">@erik_kwakkel</a><em>  today for more animal-themed tweets </em>#manuscriptzoo</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever owned a cat will be familiar with their unmannerly feline habit of walking across your keyboard while you are typing. One of the manuscript pictures tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/erik_kwakkel" target="_blank">@erik_kwakkel</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/erik_kwakkel/status/303614922103865346/photo/1">http://twitter.com/erik_kwakkel/status/303614922103865346/photo/1</a> ) revealed that this is nothing new.</p>
<div id="attachment_1241" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1241" alt="Cat paws in a fifteenth-century manuscript (photo taken at the Dubrovnik archives by @EmirOFilipovic)" src="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=481" width="640" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cat paws in a fifteenth-century manuscript (photo taken at the Dubrovnik archives by @EmirOFilipovic)</p></div>
<p>Although the medieval owner of this manuscript may have been quite annoyed with these paw marks on his otherwise neat manuscript, another fifteenth-century manuscript reveals that he got off lucky.  A Deventer scribe, writing around 1420, found his manuscript ruined by a urine stain left there by a cat the night before. He was forced to leave the rest of the page empty, drew a picture of a cat and cursed the creature with the following words:</p>
<p>“Hic non defectus est, sed cattus minxit desuper nocte quadam. Confundatur pessimus cattus qui minxit super librum istum in nocte Daventrie, et consimiliter omnes alii propter illum. Et cavendum valde ne permittantur libri aperti per noctem ubi cattie venire possunt.”</p>
<p>[Here is nothing missing, but a cat urinated on this during a certain night. Cursed be the pesty cat that urinated over this book during the night in Deventer and because of it many others [other cats] too. And beware well not to leave open books at night where cats can come.]</p>
<div id="attachment_1242" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 559px"><a href="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1242 " alt="Caption: Cursed be this cat for peeing over my book! (Cologne, Historisches Archiv, G.B. quarto, 249, fol. 68r)" src="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats2.jpg?w=549&#038;h=640" width="549" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cursed be this cat for peeing over my book! (© Cologne, Historisches Archiv, G.B. quarto, 249, fol. 68r)</p></div>
<p>Given their inclination to defile beautiful books, why were cats allowed in medieval libraries at all? A ninth-century poem, written by an Irish monk about his cat “Pangur Bán”, holds the answer:</p>
<p>I and Pangur Bán my cat,<br />
‘Tis a like task we are at:<br />
Hunting mice is his delight,<br />
Hunting words I sit all night.</p>
<p>(You can read the full poem <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/pangur-ban.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Other musings on this poem from this blog can be found <a title="‘Turning Darkness into Light’: Depictions of the Medieval Scribe" href="http://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/turning-darkness-into-light-depictions-of-the-medieval-scribe/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>The cats were there to keep out the mice. For good reason, because a medieval manuscript offered a tasty treat for the little vermin, as this eleventh-century copy of Boethius’s <i>De consolatione philosophiae </i>illustrates. The manuscript has been all but devoured by rats and mice and every page shows the marks of their teeth.</p>
<div id="attachment_1243" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 513px"><a href="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats3.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1243 " alt="A mouse ate my Boethius! (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 214, fol. 122r)" src="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats3.jpg?w=503&#038;h=640" width="503" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A mouse ate my Boethius! (© Corpus Christi College Cambridge, MS 214, fol. 122r)</p></div>
<p>Aside from their book-endangering eating habits, mice could be an annoying distraction, as illustrated by the twelfth-century scribe Hildebert. The illustration shows how a mouse has climbed up Hildebert’s table and is eating his cheese. Hildebert lifts a stone in an apparent attempt to kill the mouse. In the book that he was writing, we find a curse directed at the cheese-nibbling beast: “Pessime mus, sepius me provocas ad iram; ut te deus perdat” [Most wretched mouse, often you provoke me to anger. May God destroy you!]</p>
<div id="attachment_1244" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats4.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1244" alt="Hildebert distracted by a mouse. (© Prague, Capitular Library, codex A 21/1, fol. 153r)" src="http://medievalfragments.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cats4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=640" width="640" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hildebert distracted by a mouse. (© Prague, Capitular Library, codex A 21/1, fol. 153r)</p></div>
<p>So, while at least two cats are responsible for leaving their unwanted marks on manuscripts, the cat’s mouse-catching abilities may have saved a large number of manuscripts from ending up in a mouse’s belly and may have enabled many a scribe to focus on his work, knowing that his lunch would remain untouched.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in New York, Manhattan has always held an ineffable mystique to me; propped up by the bourgeois societals, limitless culture and a Hollywood love affair.  Coming into the “city” I would wax poetically about the grandiose air of the people and the pretense of their demeanor. Back then, when the economy was bristling with endless wealth, we romanticized the affluent in hopes that we will someday enjoy the fruits of our own labors.  We chased the reservation of the most highly touted restaurants and accepted the fate of an over judgmental waiter as he scoffed at our attire.  It was all part of the experience; a submission to abuse that made us feel ever more alive.</p>
<p>Times have certainly changed.  The endless luster of the Manhattanite has become pocked and pallid under a reeling economy.  The youth have seceded from the shores of the island for more practical grounds and with it they took the fresh-faced culture of the millennials.  Culinary and cultural hotbeds have moved east across the bridges and tunnels, settling in neighborhoods removed from Wall Street, but close enough to peer proudly at its monolithic spires.</p>
<p>I have just recently ventured down to the East Village, where my good friend lives in one of the last great youth enclaves on the island; StuyTown.  Hitting the bar scene, I quickly realized how antiquated and flaccid the neighborhood has become over the years.  It is teeming with Greek life, popped collars and cookie-cutter character; they pour from one dimly lit establishment to the next with the confidence of a wrecking ball.  The bars themselves seem to rely on the ideal of a time capsule, still grasping onto the brighter pasture of an earlier era when the Village was Mecca and the patrons were the trendsetters.</p>
<p>While on the other side of the river, a burgeoning community of artists, denizens, throwaways and professionals twill and grow neighborhoods into lively, cultural bastions.  From Astoria, Queens to Prospect Park, Brooklyn people are building alternative economies away from the once great Manhattan streets.</p>
<p>This is the generation raised by the comforting hum of Wall Street but came of age when the system broke down.  Lost and confused, the youth have decided not to chase the dreams of their fathers, but to create their own.  The silver spoons have been removed, the golden parachutes have been clipped and now all they have is each other.  The American appeal for excess and gaud is dead and in its place a new aesthetic is being born.  Success, by American design and standard has changed; Gucci and gold have become less a statement of class and more a symbol of the old flawed blueprint. <a href="http://plumbingforthepipedream.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dead.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-29" alt="Image" src="http://plumbingforthepipedream.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dead.jpg?w=470" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been out of commission for a while.  Not as in a my-organs-were-removed/repaired-and-I&#8217;m-recuperating sort of way, but in an I&#8217;ve-lost-all-drive-to-write sort of way.  Personally, the former would be easier for me to deal with.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance and not all organs are necessary for survival.  Just ask Slim Goodbody.</p>
<div id="attachment_2492" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 186px"><a href="http://michellestodden.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/stripped-of-my-desire-to-create/tumblr_m7p19gbmk71rn2nm0o1_500/" rel="attachment wp-att-2492"><img class=" wp-image-2492  " alt="Bask in my greatness." src="http://michellestodden.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tumblr_m7p19gbmk71rn2nm0o1_500.jpg?w=176&#038;h=300" width="176" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You know you want it.</p></div>
<p>I attempted to pinpoint when the creative breakdown was conceived, but I failed to locate that nefarious moment.  I&#8217;ve no recent traumatizing situations to speak of, save for my friend&#8217;s Christmas party where she kept dumping out my drink in order to wash my glass.  I would set down my glass to talk to someone and then turn back around to take a sip of wine only to discover it sprouted legs and trotted away.  (I must warn you that one has to watch their plate around her, too.  It&#8217;s a compulsion she&#8217;s trying to tame.)</p>
<p>At any rate, my desire to create also sprouted legs and trotted away because I cannot summon a spark to save my wit.  But here&#8217;s the real kicker:  up until a few days ago, I didn&#8217;t even care.  The last time I can recall honestly giving a hoot about my writing was at the very beginning of the year.  My muse apparently jumped ship shortly thereafter, and who can blame her?  Apathetic behavior doesn&#8217;t exactly encourage your muse to whisper sweet nothings into your ear.</p>
<p>So what happened status-post amputation of 2012 that caused my creative decay?  Because my lack of desire hasn&#8217;t invaded other areas of my life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been highly focused on my physical and mental well-being since the beginning of the year.  Returning to my pre-Maya shape is one of my (seemingly unattainable) goals.  I gained weight throughout the last quarter of last year and it affected everything in my life.  My energy level plummeted, my mood sunk, my washer and dryer shrunk ALL of my clothes.  It was crazy.  Thus, dropping the weight isn&#8217;t <em>all</em> about my quest to build a sweet backside.  I keep a food log of what I eat and drink (wine has deliciously evil calories) so that I can hold myself accountable.  I exercise 5-6 days a week&#8211; jogging, walking a couple of miles during my lunch hour, working out to Bob Harper&#8217;s bitch of a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bob-Harper-Pure-Super-Strength/dp/B003ULW71Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361394776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bob+harper+strength+dvd" target="_blank"> strength dvd</a>, working out to Jillian&#8217;s exercise dvds, even doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brazil-Butt-Lift-BASE-Kit/dp/B00337MOMO/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361394927&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brazil+butt+lift+leandro+carvalho" target="_blank">Brazil Butt Lift</a> workouts&#8211; and I&#8217;ve only managed to drop <em>almost</em> one size in eight weeks.  Almost, but not quite.  Needless to say, I am frustrated with my lack of bodily shrinkage.  My bubble butt and my thunder thighs are like adult children who won&#8217;t leave the nest.</p>
<p><del>My financial state still sucks.  I&#8217;m not going to go into detail right now, but it sucks.  Granted, I am far better off than most of the world</del> (<a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/world-poverty-statistics/" target="_blank">World Poverty Statistics</a>), <del>so I truly shouldn&#8217;t complain.  In fact, I feel like a twat for even whining about my financial state</del>.</p>
<p>My financial state is fine, so that&#8217;s not it.</p>
<p>I think my work is draining me of all my creative spunk.  I love my boss and I am truly grateful to have a great job, but the endless corporate paperwork and red-tape and mounds of billing and unbelievably dense people wear me down.  By the time I arrive home, I&#8217;m a mental zombie.  I push myself through a workout and then cook dinner, wash dishes, play games and read to the girl, bath time, clean up, and then attempt to space out in a chair while the girl makes me sing the numbers 1 through 100 with her.  And then we sing ABC&#8217;s.  And then play &#8220;Alphabet.&#8221;  (<a href="http://www.schoolzone.com/flash-cards/alphabet-flash-cards" target="_blank">Alphabet flash cards</a> with words and pictures&#8211; all of which she has memorized and 3/4 of which she can spell upon quizzing.  She&#8217;s already smarter than I will ever be.)  When she&#8217;s finally done trying to stimulate my mind, Maya crashes around 10:30 and I am wiped out.  Understandably.  (And now you see how exciting my life is.)  I try to get up early to write, but it simply isn&#8217;t happening yet.  My body refuses to budge before 6:15.</p>
<p>Something has to give.  I need time to relax and create.  I don&#8217;t want to give up time with my kid, because even though she sometimes drives me bats, she&#8217;s a prodigious sponge who eagerly drinks in everything I teach.  We&#8217;re starting on beginner reading books and addition/subtraction and French lessons not because I want her to but because she LOVES it (her sitter is French, hence the French language thing).  Numbers are fun to her and I want to encourage her to learn as much as she can (while she still thinks it&#8217;s a game).  I can&#8217;t&#8211; I won&#8217;t&#8211; trade her developing, freakishly smart brain for my story.  Forget it.</p>
<p>I could give up work, but that means not having a home and car and food and having to go on welfare, which would make my self-confidence plummet and I would somehow end up with a bunch of cats and become a homeless hoarder pushing around a shopping cart full of one pre-schooler and her Alphabet cards, towels and mis-matched socks, lampshades, and old VHS tapes.  I know it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2525" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://michellestodden.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/stripped-of-my-desire-to-create/dscn0961/" rel="attachment wp-att-2525"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2525" alt="This would be my new home.

Wipe your feet at the door, please.</p></div>
<p>So we&#8217;re down to my body.  I will trade my body for creative gain.  Well, not trade my actual body.  I&#8217;m not sacrificing a kidney to gain a screenplay or anything like that.  But maybe it&#8217;s time to drop a day of exercise and see what happens.  Go down to 4 or 5 days and play around with my diet. Throw in a light smoothie in place of dinner here and there.  (This does mean I&#8217;ll have to buy a blender.)  Purchase some Spanx and call it good.  Who knows.  Maybe I&#8217;ll have more energy in the long run.</p>
<p>I have to give it a shot.  My characters are moping about because I haven&#8217;t had them out to play.  I feel like a bad parent.  They <em>want</em> me to let them out, too.  Dick is straining to hold back sarcastic remarks; Priti&#8217;s nose twitches with my every peek into their world; and Adam and Rebecca sit next to each other, hands close but not touching, and wait to see in which direction I will nudge their cracked relationship.  But my desire to set my characters free and run around is not entirely present.  Almost there, but not quite.  Perhaps this rambling, go-nowhere blog entry will help me release whatever (bad writing maybe?) holding me back.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this happen?  Does the heaviness of everyday life (or your body) strip you of your desire to create for a period of time?  Any suggestions?</p>

<p><i>“Well, when I lived in </i>Asia<i>…” begin so many of my sentences these days. Moving away is hard, and as it turns out, so is moving back. Chronicles of Reverse Culture Shock is a series devoted to these difficulties, and is also an outlet so that I don’t become That Guy Who Won’t Shut Up About Korea to all of his friends. </i></p>
<p>A Korean restaurant in Korea is a beautiful, efficient kind of place. You enter, sit at your table, and order essentially within the first moments. The menus are not terribly voluminous, and the assumption is that if you entered this restaurant in the first place, you knew what you were coming for. (Many restaurants specialize in exactly one kind of dish, so you say how many of the foods you want and in what, if any, variations.) The waiters disappear, and rush back with your steaming bowl or your rack of raw ingredients and leave you to it. They will not check on you, they will not make small talk, they will not feign interest, and they will not interact with you unless they you summon them by the convenient doorbell on your table (<i>bing-bong!</i>). They give you food and then leave you alone, and at the end of the meal you take the bill, which was already at your table, and pay elsewhere and never ever think of leaving them a tip. The people operating the restaurant are unobtrusive, practically invisible, more spectral visions of humans, ghosts carrying trays that exist only in your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Which is to say that a Korean restaurant in Korea is my idea of paradise.</p>
<p><span id="more-1654"></span></p>
<p>When I first arrived, of course, the process was a little jarring. I was used to highly attentive wait staff, indentured young people who hovered off in the middle distance constantly watching though only interrupting precisely when needed. My cup would never go empty, because someone in a dress shirt and an embarrassing nametag would rush to my aid the moment we passed a critical beverage threshold. My food would arrive hot, and exactly synchronously with the food of my companions, and it would come with a side of blowsy smalltalk. I could be wished happy birthday, or talk about my work, or about the weather, or about television. Something innocuous and comforting and sweet, and the waiter could coolly lull me into the belief that they cared, and I in turn would give them money for nursing the illusion that the world was not a scary, desolate place full of people who hated every stranger they saw. I knew this restaurant tango, had grown with it, had seen it as the way of the world.</p>
<p>So to be in Korea, where the waiters will never look you in the eye and will only come if you summon them by scream or electronic buzzer, seemed impersonal and terrifying. What a cold, robotic world! No one pretends to like me or pays attention to how much drink I have drunk!</p>
<p>The acclimation, however, was swift. Korean waiters respond to a shout or a buzz with practiced speed and efficiency. The middle-man is often cut out, and food preparation is left to my own hands. Interruptions only arise if a waiter or restaurateur feels they can improve the deliciousness of my meal for me, either through dips or assembling the constituent ingredients to one harmonious, perfected whole. The table is littered with so many dishes I don’t even know what to do with all of them, and it becomes my fiefdom, my own precious Tetris territory of bowls and chopsticks and eternally replenished side-dishes.</p>
<p>The most space-aged restaurants have specialty bing-bongs on their tables, adorned with specialized buttons detailing the nature of your needs. Press this button for more beer, this one for soju, this one for more meat. Press three for more ambrosia. Press 10 for a side of unicorn shavings. Press six for the table to convert into a time machine that takes you on a magical journey to old prospector times. Press 9 for an alternate dimension where everyone is actually a frog and the sky is made of ice cream. Press the central button to call an operator for any other inquiries. Minimize human interaction, maximize rate of gorging, and enjoy your glorious futuristic magic table.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the system. Whatever semblance of hope I derived from the training-mandated waiter smalltalk in Canada, I could probably squeeze from my eating companions. Whatever marvels experienced from an efficient kitchen could easily be replaced in my heart by a central grill and the power to wield my own tongs. And I didn’t have to tip anyone.</p>
<p>But now I am back in the homeland, and every excursion to a restaurant is fraught with anxiety and terror. I feel, in some ways, like I am speaking with earphones in: always too loud or too quiet, unaware of how I come off, incapable of speaking like a human being. I am Pinocchio just recently transformed into a real boy, and I still haven&#8217;t worked out all of the quirks. I am a robot, and have not yet been taught this human emotion called love, nor with it the ability not to freak out in a restaurant. It feels like all my capabilities for normal, socialized restaurant interactions have completely withered.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 394px"><a title="First udon by stupiduglyforeigner, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anageonism/7293614074/"><img alt="First udon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8156/7293614074_34dd13e167_z.jpg" width="384" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In Japan, you just order by vending machine, and everything turns out okay.</p></div>
<p>Why are the waiters all talking and smiling at me? Are they making fun of me, or planning to steal my wallet? Am I allowed to summon them in some capacity, or is it deemed rude? A “hello?” A polite wave? Gentle eye contact? Signal fire? Will they think me boorish and impatient for not waiting until they finish up with table six, will they deem my needs sufficient or treat me with disdain for the rest of the meal?</p>
<p>Why does this menu have so many <i>things</i> in it? We’re not in a grocery store. I already made the decision to enter the restaurant, and everything else should be taken care of for me. And are those prices in won? Hong Kong dollars, perhaps? Because if they’re in local currency, then we are being gouged, and maybe we should probably make a run for it.</p>
<p>The greatest struggle comes when I go to a Korean restaurant in Canada, a strange borderland, the interstitial grab-bag of restaurant culture effluvia that I cannot begin to decipher. Can I summon a waiter? Should I order in Korean or English? Exactly how pretentious am I allowed to be while consuming this food, judging its flavour and authenticity with permanently upturned nose? And tips&#8211;I’m paying at the cash register, and there is no tip jar. Or there is a tip jar, but the value of currency currently inside of it is pitiful. Or I paid at my table, but the waiter did what a Korean waiter would do, so do I tip them like a Korean or a Canadian waiter? My hands begin to tremble as I clutch loose quarters and loonies in my greedy fist. Sweat is pooling in every crevice I have. If I mangle this, I will either look like a cheapskate or an over-generous rube. If I mangle any other part of the restaurant action, I seem like maybe I was raised by wolves&#8211;wolves that didn&#8217;t go out to restaurants very often. If I do the wrong thing with the waiters, if I do things in the wrong restaurant order, if I mishandle the various equipment on the table&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I think maybe I’ll just start eating at home.</p>
