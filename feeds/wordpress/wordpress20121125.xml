				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#phdchat is a Twitter chat session that is held on Wednesdays at 19:30 GMT (which is like 14:30 in the afternoon for me) for scholars to discuss theses, dissertations, and research, and while I&#8217;ve been following it for months, it happened to occur while I was available to interact on my feed, so I decided to join in on the topic of &#8220;how do you know when a dissertation is done&#8221;? Being a fan of considering the Ph.D. as process of developing self-regulation and metacognition, my immediate response is that finding the answer to that question is one of learning objectives of the doctoral program itself. As <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/tmbarnes">Dr. Tiffany Barnes</a> (sitting right next to me at the time) said: &#8220;If you&#8217;re asking that question, you aren&#8217;t there yet.&#8221; <span id="more-1732"></span></p>
<p>I was following the chat, half-engaged while working on a project, when I noticed a tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/Comprof1">@Comprof1</a> that I absolutely had to respond to:</p>
<blockquote><p>@EmmaBurnettx @lizith @ajwooff @NSRiazat Midway is when you realize this isn&#8217;t &#8220;your&#8221; thesis, but your work approved by others. #phdchat</p></blockquote>
<p>If you know me, you know that taking ownership of one&#8217;s research is a huge part of my philosophy on Graduate education and a life of research in general. I wanted to reply by saying that it was a very sad and depressing way to view the thesis-writing process&#8230; but something made me stop in my tracks.</p>
<p>This blog entry isn&#8217;t about my philosophy of taking ownership of your work. It&#8217;s about how when I read my very sincere reply, it didn&#8217;t look very sincere. In fact, it felt like I was reading one of the self-deprecating jokes that make up a large bulk of Graduate Student culture. I was genuinely worried that what I was writing would not be taken seriously, and restructured my reply so that it better represented how I felt. Why would I feel that way?</p>
<p>This &#8220;humor&#8221;, if you can really call it that, is something that is prevalent among Graduate Students. We poke fun at ourselves for choosing a &#8220;life of poverty&#8221;. We bemoan spending &#8220;far too long&#8221; in Universities doing research that nobody cares about with adversarial advisors that work us to the bone. I&#8217;ve been there, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://phdcomics.com/">read the comics</a>, and I&#8217;ve probably engaged in some of that in my blog. But when I do, it&#8217;s just a joke, because I could not be happier or <em>more proud of myself</em> for choosing the career I&#8217;ve chosen. That much should be apparent from the tone of this blog. Some of my colleagues make fun of me for being as positive about my research as I am: they tell me I&#8217;m trying too hard, that I&#8217;m young and naive, and that one day I&#8217;ll realize that I&#8217;m wrong. My first issue with that is that it&#8217;s only <em>self</em>-deprecating when you are making fun of yourself &#8211; don&#8217;t rain on my parade, guys. But even more troubling is that it makes me wonder <em>to what extent do Graduate students believe this stuff</em>, and <em>how do others perceive us when this is our attitude</em>?</p>
<p>I understand that the reason why self-deprecating humor is so prevalent is because it builds a sense of solidarity. When we&#8217;re beat down and exhausted, it&#8217;s encouraging to see that we aren&#8217;t the only ones going through our troubles. The Ph.D. can be a lonely path where even our colleagues have trouble understanding what we do each day. However, we&#8217;ve all had to put up with frustrating departmental policies, absent-minded advisors, and long nights in the lab. The suffering essentially becomes the common ground between us, no matter our disciplines. The problem is that while it produces solidarity between <em>us</em>, it makes us harder to relate to with the rest of society &#8211; the people who will supposedly benefit from the research that we are doing. It makes us inaccessible to the non-academic.</p>
<p>Is this attitude really how we want to be perceived?</p>
<p>We, as Grad Students, are the driving forces behind many of the scientific advancements in this world. Our work is moving mountains and changing lives. The common ground between us should not be the hard times that come and go, but the passion for our field that makes us stay with it <em>in spite</em> of the difficulties.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2588November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8205421547/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2588November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8205421547_5d29fd7a19_c.jpg" height="534" width="800" /></a></p>
<p><em>This is a bit of a sleep-deprived post so apologies for any strange errors or abrupt transitions&#8230;busy week to share hopefully soon.</em></p>
<p>The sunrise in Delhi is something worth getting up early for. It&#8217;s winter now in Northern India and the sun rises after 6:30 and seems to stop and hang half-way up the horizon. It takes up so much space in the sky that it&#8217;s hard to believe its the same sun with which I&#8217;ve risen my whole life. Â It shimmers in an arresting shade of reddish-gold and makes everything the light touches appears washed in a hazy, soft pink glow.</p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2597November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8206507384/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2597November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8058/8206507384_c230b92176_c.jpg" height="534" width="800" /></a></p>
<p>This morning we set out far earlier than usual, in search of a supposedly stunning wholesale flower market open only just past dawn at the Hanuman Temple near Connaught. For anyone who&#8217;d like to cut to the chase, I&#8217;ll tell you now: that market no longer seems to exist.</p>
<p>A man sitting on a blanket surrounded by pairs of shoes asked me to remove mine as soon as I stepped off the sidewalk-a sign as sure as any that I was in the wrong place. Â I walked barefoot through the temple crowd anyway though, carrying 15-month-old Will and his companion, &#8220;Monkey,&#8221; hoping in vain that the flower market might be found somewhere just beyond the worshippers. Â I bought a wreath for the temple and wondered which of the beggars, who turn out in the hundreds here to receive free food and donations from temple parishioners, needed my money the most. I felt out of place and confused. As I tried to collect my shoes from the shoe watcher, a tall man with wearing a mangey shawl and vacant eyes came lurching after us yelling, reaching for Will and demanding money. People shouted for me to give him money, to not give him money, to give <em>them </em>money and suddenly everyone was watching aÂ bewildered foreigner handing out rupees like they were flyers for a new high-rise apartment complex in Gurgaon. Â I beat anÂ embarrassedÂ retreat back to our car, realizing suddenly that this might be exactly the sort of Indian experience that makes some people hate it here.</p>
<p>The truth about India though, the truth about any country really, is that you will only like the place as much as you like the people there whom you are lucky enough to meet. Â And, contrary to what it might seem to any tourist trying to make their way around Connaught, there are far many more good people in Delhi than not.</p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2603November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8205416691/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2603November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8205416691_ed8c60259e_c.jpg" height="800" width="525" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2590November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8205419307/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2590November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8205419307_a14ec55f18_c.jpg" height="800" width="520" /></a></p>
<p>Our new driver is one of them. Â Chris and I realized that if we really wanted to see Delhi we would need not just a vehicle with which to get around, but a person with an inborn understanding of Delhi to drive it (and, quite honestly, someone to circle the block wherever we go because parking is usually quite scarce). Â R is our housekeeper&#8217;s nephew and when she talks about him, her love and admiration for him practically radiates out of her face. Â We are beginning to understand why.</p>
<p>R is one of those good-down-to-his-bones sorts of people and he&#8217;s also slowly getting used to me and my little quests around town. When I came back to the car without finding a flower market, he asked if I would like to drive clear across the city to find a flower market near Mehrauli that one of his friends had told him about. Â He laughed a little knowingly when I said yes.</p>
<p>About 5 minutes away from Qutab Minar (still on my list to go see) and in the middle of a seemingly quiet neighborhood, we parked next to a cluster of scooters, the passengers&#8217; seats all piled 3 feet high with stacks of Â bundled stems and maroon and gold marigolds.</p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2583November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8205423877/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2583November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8205423877_678c915b0d_c.jpg" height="534" width="800" /></a></p>
<p>From there I edge my way through the crowd and found myself in an open-air market, surrounded on all sides by the walls of restaurants and apartment buildings. Cast-off leaves and foliage bedded the ground in soft piles and a million and one rose petals buried the normal din and noise of a busy market beneath the whisper-soft sounds of so many flowers being bundled and moved around the small space. Â  Hundreds of thousands of lilies and roses and daisies, ginger flowers, gladiolas and so many flowers I&#8217;d never seen before lined the tiny walkways between vendors. Â Along the walls, on a raised platform, women sat wrapped in heavy woolen shawls, delicately stringing marigolds and jasmine blossoms together to form the long beautiful chains that are used here to decorate temples and special occasions. When I lived in Chennai, women would buy miniature versions of these flower chains and wear them in their hair, leaving behind a trail of otherworldly fragrance that banished all sewer and street smells in their wake.</p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2586November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8205422633/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2586November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8205422633_e4f423dbc9_c.jpg" height="530" width="800" /></a></p>
<p>The haze and the smell of the flowers and that beautiful golden-blush glow from the sunrise made the market feel more like a dream than a real place and Will and I both smiled. Â As I wandered, vendors rummaged through their piles of orphan blossoms and, beaming, offered carefully de-thorned rose blossoms to Will and I. Â When I asked how much I should pay, they just shook their heads, said something about smiles and walked away.</p>
<p>Markets are interesting to me, I get a kick out of seeing how they work, what&#8217;s for sale, how to pronounce what&#8217;s for sale, how it should be cooked or used or displayed. Â I find that whenever I&#8217;m genuinely excited, genuinely fascinated by what&#8217;s going on around me, people respond in kind and share with me small tidbits about themselves and the places in which I meet them. These little interactions are grounding. Â Like tiny threads, Â each one of them gently ties me a little closer to Delhi, tugging me&#8211;if only briefly&#8211;out of the expat bubble I usually inhabit.</p>
<p><a title="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2609November 19, 2012 by dani920, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danidumm/8206504020/"><img alt="Mehrauli Flower Market_MG_2609November 19, 2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8206504020_6cc3783875_c.jpg" height="534" width="800" /></a></p>
<p>We left the flower market with 2 dozen jasmine flowers and 7 rolls of something like tissue paper&#8211;an item I&#8217;d been desperately trying to find in Delhi for weeks and weeks now and finally found for sale amidst the flowers. Â Afterwards we headed to INA market to pick up a few things for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The INA parking lot is crazy at most hours of the day. Usually R drops me off and circles the block while I bumble and blunder my way across the slick, broken tiles to find what I need. But two freshly-slaughtered chickens and a big bag of flour, plus Will in his baby carrier, is a bit much for even me to carry by myself; and since the market was still nearly empty so early in the morning, R parked and came with me.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the other thing about needing to know good people to really fall in love with a country. No matter how good I get at navigating that market, I&#8217;ll never be a native Dillite&#8211;and it&#8217;s a completely different experience to go with someone who is. The interactions are smoother, we visit specific stalls purposefully, seemingly picking our vendors based on cues of quality or relation that are invisible to me. Â I learn a lot.</p>
<p>I ran into the chai-wallah from <a href="http://hotpotdc.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/early-morning-at-ina-market/">this post</a> while we were buying some flour. He remembered me and offered another 10 rupee cup of chai from his traveling tankard of brew. Â The shopkeepers all laughed, but I bought. Â It&#8217;s not everyday that I&#8217;m at the market with a free hand to wrap around a steaming styrofoam mug of chai and in the company of good people with whom to share it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am poised for the greatest achievement of my life. It, of course, will be followed by many more. I will probably be a quarterback (even though Iâ€™m getting a late start, because Iâ€™m not tall enough for the team yet), or a judo instructor, or at least a scientist who cures cancers and invents the hoverboard, but <i>for real</i>. But those are for later. Those are for when I am living in California in a big house all by myself, watching brush fires from my swimming pool (I saw it on Discovery because I thought it was Shark Week, and even though it wasnâ€™t, it was still cool).</p>
<p>Now, I am getting ready. I am preparing myself with great calm. This takes patience (which apparently Iâ€™m not very good at, says Mom and Mrs. Thomacelli, and EVERYONE), this takes stillness (something else Iâ€™m not very good at). I had to do a lot to get here. First, I had to make sure the way was clear, like runways at airports. One time, when we were flying to this beach in Mexico, we had to wait in the plane for two extra hours because there was a deer on the runway. We got there really late but that was actually more fun. The streets were noisy and crowded, the air was dark and blurry, but I didnâ€™t even need to hold anyoneâ€™s hand. We ate churros on the way to the hotel, and I got cinnamon all over my shirt. Iâ€™m planning on going back very soon, maybe even next week, if this all works out.</p>
<p>After I made a clear path, I had to climb up into the fort. Itâ€™s not really hard â€“ there are stairs and everything â€“ but I had to get a really good spot. That means getting on top of the rails, and that is a lot harder. I wore my good sneakers on purpose. Theyâ€™re new, probably cooler than anyone elseâ€™s, even if they donâ€™t have lights in them. They got me here, so when Iâ€™m famous, Iâ€™ll definitely endorse Nike. Iâ€™ll even be in their commercials for free, as long as I get new shoes every year.</p>
<p>Now, I am standing here, on top of the railing, taking deep breaths. I know about bone density (Mrs. Thomacelli made us color pictures of the insides of birds in science), but I think that my bones arenâ€™t too dense yet. After all, Iâ€™m not allowed on most roller coasters, so theyâ€™re probably not fully developed. Besides, I made a parachute, just in case. Thatâ€™s safety.</p>
<p>I take a breath. I let it out, just like in judo. I brush the band-aids on my knees, remembering the last time, remembering the woodchips in my mouth and the Tootsie Pop I got in the office. This time, I wonâ€™t need them.</p>
<p>I take a breath. I let it out, making sure to focus all my energy, just like mom does in yoga. I flex my toes, tight in my new sneakers. Maybe Nike will make shoes with little wings on the sides, and my name will be all over the laces.</p>
<p>You know, people keep telling me Iâ€™m too old for this, and that come on Ray, you should know better by now. But I think that the reason that people say that is because theyâ€™re afraid that Iâ€™ll be able to do it. When they were little (and they had light bones) they didnâ€™t practice hard enough and they were too scared of getting skinned knees.</p>
<p>I take a breath. I let it out, just like when dad told me not to be afraid when the plane took off. I forgot to bring gum, but itâ€™s okay because ears only pop inside airplanes. He will be so proud of me, and next time, heâ€™ll bring his video camera and we can watch it after my Saturday soccer game.</p>
<p>The last time, I really felt it, but only for a little bit. It was a big rush of air and my heart was bouncing up and down in my chest and then it all stopped. Thatâ€™s how I know Iâ€™m getting closer. Thatâ€™s how I know.</p>
<p>I take a deep breath. I let it out.</p>
<p>I take off.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a great debate in the comments section of yesterday&#8217;s sketch about the educational value of posting an unfinished or unsuccessful work. I was very torn about what to do, but in the end the teacher in me won out.</p>
<p>A few days ago I started this street scene but never completed it. My first wash was wet-on-dry and I wasn&#8217;t very satisfied so I tried to wash it out and paint wet-in-wet. This turned out to be a disaster because the pigment I had used in the sky stained the paper. My intention was to have a gray mix in the upper right corner but when I attempted to rinse it, the blue washed away and I was left with a horrible brown stain in the sky. No matter. I persisted to add colour but the underpainting gave a dirty glow to everything. I abandoned mid-way through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://shariblaukopf.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/walkways_unfinished.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2331" title="Walkways_unfinished" alt="Walkways_unfinished" src="http://shariblaukopf.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/walkways_unfinished.jpg?w=472&#038;h=343" height="343" width="472" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Â A few days later I made a colour sketch to clarify the direction I was going to take and posted that yesterday. Below is the finished painting. This time I chose a 300lb Winsor Newton paper and proceeded with caution. It is easy to get overly excited when you are starting a painting and jump right into adding colour to the paper. But in this case, planning the values first and the colours second helped me to know where I was going.</p>

<p>Ah, it&#8217;s the holiday season. My favorite time of year. Thanksgiving is a time to be grateful, and I hope you will take a moment to check out my Mansfield Magazine post <a href="http://www.mansfieldmagazine.com/2012/11/19/attitude-of-gratitude" target="_blank">Choosing an Attitude of Gratitude.</a> We are supremely fortunate in this country, and I feel it is VERY important for us to count our many blessings. A roof over our head, plenty to eat, freedom, democracy&#8230;AND NEW VIDEO GAMES. My opinion? <a href="http://www.ea.com/" target="_blank">EA </a>and <a href="http://epicgames.com/" target="_blank">EPIC </a>games are Santa for grownups, and most of the best games are released this time of year.Â  <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/blackops" target="_blank">Black Ops 2</a>, <a href="http://www.armyoftwo.com/" target="_blank">Army of Two&#8211;The Devil&#8217;s Cartel</a> (yeah, they had me at &#8220;Devil&#8221;), and the new <a href="http://www.halowaypoint.com/halo4/en-us/" target="_blank">HALO FOUR!</a> This is my favorite season for many reasons, but gaming with my family is definitely a highlight.</p>
<p>I was not always this way.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, my brother told me of this device called the X-Box. I was not interested in his silly reindeer games. Like many other Gen Xers, I grew up on Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Centipede and Pac-Man, etc. Yes, these games were addictive, but they almost too accurately mirrored life. They started out new and fun and slow and then just got faster and faster and faster UNTIL YOU DIED. So when my brother approached me about playing a game known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-Xbox/dp/B00005NZ1G" target="_blank">HALO</a>, I only agreed to play to shut him up.</p>
<div id="attachment_8904" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-7-55-15-am.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-8904" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-21 at 7.55.15 AM" alt="" src="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-7-55-15-am.png?w=590"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jaysen, where are you? Someone keeps shooting me in the back of the head.</p></div>
<p>My brother might not be the best introduction into the world of gaming. He believes that you learn by dying. Not doing. You read correctly. DYING. For two hours, I found myself trapped in corners or under staircasesÂ because I didn&#8217;t know how to work the controller, thusÂ I spent most of the time seeing only my cyborg feet and getting shot in my cyborg a$$. Not only was I supposed to keep the aliens from killing me, but my brother would pop out of nowhere and shoot me in the face and run away while my character regenerated (respawned).</p>
<p>Jerk.</p>
<p>So weÂ somehow escape the craft that has been boarded by aliens and crash-land on some earth-like planet, where we see this giant ring in the sky (the HALO and the center of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)" target="_blank">the game&#8217;s storyline</a>). I would have loved to have learned more, but my brother found a HummerÂ and promptly ran me over&#8230;.then ran me over again&#8230;and yes, again. I finally managed to respawnÂ and beat him to the Hummer. Ha! Revenge&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;.so he threw a plasma grenadeÂ in my back seatÂ and killed me again. Yes, I come from a family of sadists and I am their favorite object of <del>torment</del> entertainment.</p>
<div id="attachment_8906" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-00-51-am.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8906" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-21 at 8.00.51 AM" alt="" src="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-00-51-am.png?w=300&#038;h=157" height="157" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">LUZR! Muah ha ha ha ha ha ha!</p></div>
<p>The odd thing, however, is how well my brother knows me. If he would have held my hand and gently introduced me to gaming, he wouldn&#8217;t have ignited my competitive nature.</p>
<p>Shoot <em>me</em> in the a$$. I&#8217;ll show YOU!</p>
<p>The next day I recruited my six-year-old nephew Josh to teach me the Jedi X-Box ways. Josh was a better teacher. Granted, he got us lost&#8230;all the time and took ALL the ammunition, but it was a step up from being run over 42 times in less than a minute and a half. I had to grow strong and become a warrior.</p>
<p>*insert montage music* <em>If you need to do a lot in a really short time, you need a montage! A montage!</em></p>
<p>I trained using HALO. Eventually I graduated to playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Heroes-Xbox/dp/B00008G886" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes </a>with my nephew and twin cousins (all six years old at the time). We played all day (it was summer and they wouldn&#8217;t stay outside). We learned to fight, to cheat and to win. I gained legend-status among all 4-7 year olds on the block. I gamed three days straight until I&#8217;d finally beaten Halo and D&amp;D. The very small kindergartener bards would long sing of my adventures and draw CrayonÂ depictions of my many battles.</p>
<p>After beatingÂ HALO 1 &amp; 2 and D&amp;D I finally met my match&#8230;.<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/enclave/" target="_blank">Enclave</a>. To this day it is the only game I have never beaten.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-04-19-am.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8907" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-21 at 8.04.19 AM" alt="" src="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-04-19-am.png?w=300&#038;h=219" height="219" width="300" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*<em>Note to game designers: We need to actually be able to win. Thank you.*</em></p>
<p>It took seven months of playing Enclave almost every day to finally give up and admit a game had bested me. Ah, but I never could have known how this worthy adversary prepared me for my finest hours of battle.</p>
<p>GEARS.</p>
<p>The Gears of War games are not games; they are an experience. What makes them so addictive really isn&#8217;t the battling monsters (cool) or even the Lancer, which is a a SAW fitted with a saw&#8211;literally it&#8217;s a semi-automatic weapon fitted with a chainsaw (awesome)&#8211;or even the Torque Bow (exploding arrows &amp; AWESOME-SAUCE)&#8230;or sniper rifle&#8230;it is the story.</p>
<p>Gears is some of THE best writing anywhere, and, frankly, I am a little happy that Gears of War&#8211;Judgement is not coming out until spring. My hands can only take so much.</p>
<div id="attachment_8908" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-10-56-am.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8908" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-21 at 8.10.56 AM" alt="" src="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-10-56-am.png?w=300&#038;h=172" height="172" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">*foot thumping* What? I&#8217;m not addicted. I can quit any time I want.</p></div>
<p>Of all the games, Gears is my favorite, namely because of the story. Most novels and movies cannot compare. The characters are real and it is easy to get emotionally attached. Each level reveals more and more of the overallÂ story-problem. There is a plot and we as gamers are participating in this real-time adventure. There is tension and conflict on many, many levels, not only from the enemy, but from allies as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_8913" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 340px"><a href="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-30-07-am1.png"><img class=" wp-image-8913" title="Screen Shot 2012-11-21 at 8.30.07 AM" alt="" src="http://warriorwriters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-21-at-8-30-07-am1.png?w=330&#038;h=445" height="445" width="330" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My alter ego&#8230;</p></div>
<p>Gears is a story of the underdog&#8211;Alpha squad fails on their mission to map the enemy tunnels, and Delta Squad, the rejects, take up where their brothers fail. It&#8217;s a story that eerily reflects life. In war there is no clear hero or villain. Each side has good reasons for taking up arms. Gears is a story of family, love, sacrifice. It is a story of redemption.</p>
<p>Sure, the shootingÂ bad guysÂ and making stuff go BOOM is a lot of fun and strangely cathartic, but the real draw to this game is the characters. We want to understand, to make sense of why this war ever happened. We care. We want to play the next level and the next because beating the game is the only way we will ever sleep. We <em>need</em> resolution. It is a strange desire. We <em>need </em>the world to be saved while at the same time we are hopingÂ the save is temporary because we want a chance to be able to saveÂ the worldÂ again.</p>
<p>The Gears saga sucks you in and you cannot help but care. For those Gear Heads out there, tell me you didn&#8217;t have to pause the game in Gears 2 when Dom found his wife or in Gears 3 when he visited his children&#8217;s graves. You KNOW you cried. Even the dudes. You got tears. It&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;re among friends.</p>
<p>Sure there are all kinds of morons out there who have played video games until they starved to death or died from their heart exploding from too many energy drinks. I can&#8217;t speak for them. I have yet to resort to wearing adult diapers during gameplay (been close, but there are lines best left uncrossed). But gaming has this wonderful way of uniting those of us who never understood football. We can have cool gamer tags (I am known as Miss Mayhem) and meet on-line to&#8230;.play. We can shoot each other in the butt and play King of the Hill and laugh and be childlike.</p>
<p>Gaming is also great for dating. It&#8217;s how I met my husband. He&#8217;d never played before. Mwah ha ha ha ha.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 266px"><img alt="" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBxvroH1LAzSeM5bd09taR-6v6nzJLmJabSwGPbubkhGt6b_qmFg" height="125" width="256" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Hey, little boy. Ever heard of X-Box? I have free candy.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Hey, it worked. Less than a year later we were married.</p>
<p>Gaming is actually a great way of getting to know who people really are. Ladies, if you are single, dudes dig gamer chicks. Learn to game. Something about a woman and a shotgun that is infinitely hot. Ah, but there is more to gaming than just being smokin&#8217; hot. This is one of the best ways for us (ladies)Â to see who a man really is.</p>
<p>Can thisÂ dudeÂ play as an effective part ofÂ a team? DoesÂ he loseÂ his temper? CanÂ he have fun? DoesÂ your gaming partnerÂ hog all the treasures with no consideration for others? Is your gaming partner an ammo whore, keeping all of it for himself? Does he share frag grenades and ammo cans?</p>
<p>Science shows that aÂ man who won&#8217;t share ammo isn&#8217;t worth dating let alone marrying.</p>
<p>DoesÂ your partnerÂ charge off ahead and leave you to the monsters? My husband and I are such an effective monster-killing force that frequentlyÂ even the game can&#8217;t keep up. THAT is teamwork. And the best part is we get to have fun, unwind&#8230;and PLAY.</p>
<p>Stories unite us and ignite us. Being able to PLAY is key to balance. Oh, I have to confess that after several bad bouts of tendonitis, I have learned more moderation when it comes to gaming. Yet, I still want to plunge ahead and unlock the next clue, the next key, the next adventure. And this is why I LOVE Gears. I have to confess that one of my big life goals is to write a video game. There, I said it.</p>
<p>I love the holidays, because I get to have fun with my uncle, cousins, husband, brother and nephews. We get to laugh and have fun and make great memories.</p>
<p>So what is your obsession? How you do play? Are you a gamer? What are your favorite games? Why? What makes you passionate for your hobby? Do you come from a family that games together? Ladies, do you game with your hubby?</p>
<p>I love hearing from you!</p>
<p>To prove it and show my love, for the month of November,Â <strong>everyone who leaves a comment I will put your name in a hat. If you comment and link back to my blog on your blog, you get your name in the hat twice. If you leave a comment, and link back to my blog, and mention my bookÂ <em>We Are Not AloneÂ </em>in your blogâ€¦you get your name in the hat THREE times.</strong>Â What do you win? The unvarnished truth from yours truly.</p>
<p><strong>I will pick a winnerÂ <em>once a month</em>Â and it will be a critique ofÂ <strong>the first 20 pages of your novel</strong>,Â <strong>or your query letter, or your synopsis (5 pages or less)</strong>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>And also, winners have a limited time to claim the prize, because whatâ€™s happening is there are actually quite a few people who never claim the critique, so I never know if the spam folder ate it or to look for it and then people miss out. I will also give my corporate e-mail to insure we connect and I will only have a week to return the 20 page edit.</p>
<p>At the end of November I will pick a winner for the monthly prize (will announce October&#8217;s winner at the same time. Been on the road too much to effectively tally). Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>I alsoÂ hope you pick up copies of my best-selling booksÂ </strong><a href="https://coolgus.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;keyword=We+Are+Not+Alone&amp;description=1&amp;model=1&amp;product_id=87" target="_blank"><strong>W</strong>e Are Not Aloneâ€“The Writerâ€™s Guide to Social Media</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://coolgus.com/index.php?route=product/search&amp;keyword=are%20you%20there%20blog&amp;model=1&amp;description=1" target="_blank"><em>Are You There, Blog? Itâ€™s Me, Writer</em>Â </a><a href="https://whodareswinspublishing.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=59" target="_blank">.Â </a>And both are recommended by the hottest agents and biggest authors in the biz. My methods teach you how to make building your author platform FUN. Build a platform and still have time left to write great books.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Rudyard Kipling*</p>
<p>Hear, attend and listen, O my Best Beloved, for this story Â­â€“ a Most New and Most Wonderful Story â€“ tells of the most magnificent power of Natural Selection.</p>
<p>Long ago, in the High and Far-off Times, the Beetle lived near the Nest of the Termites, in the shadow of the Camphor-Tree. This was not a happy arrangement, as the Termites, O Best Beloved, with their High Falutinâ€™ ways and most strong Sense of Entitlement even though they are nothing more than clever cockroaches, are the most biteful and fractious of creatures, happy to snip and snap at any passing Beetle, or indeed any animal that crosses their path.</p>
<p>But although the Termites would snip and snap at the Beetle whenever they could, he would not move his home from near their nest under the Camphor-Tree, for from the nest floated the most glorious scents, the smell of food from far-away fields â€“ pomegranates and gingerplants, roses and cannas, loquats and lillies. And the Beetle, with his â€™satiable greed, would sit on a small hillock nearby and twitch his most twiggly-twirly-wirly antennae and imagine feasting on the rich store deep within the termite nest.</p>
<p>Every time the Beetle asked the Termites to share their wondrous storehouse, they would snip and snap at him and grab his twiggly-twirly-wirly antennae and pull and pull and pull and then spank him hard until he ran away. Decidedly, O Best Beloved, the Termites are the most selfish and unsociable and grumpy of animals.</p>
<p>One day, after being spanked particularly hard by a most particularly selfish and unsociable and grumpy group of termites, the Beetle noticed a most Strange Smell coming from his feet. He no longer smelt of Beetle, but instead carried the most delicious odours of the termite nest â€“ the smells of pomegranates and gingerplants, roses and cannas, loquats and lillies, which had rubbed off onto him while he was being spanked and having his twiggly-twirly-wirly antennae and pulled and pulled and pulled.</p>
<p>And the next time the Beetle met the Termites, they just let him pass by and walk deep into their storehouses, for he smelt just like One of Them. And that, O Best Beloved, is how the Beetle got the smell of the Termite and was able to feast on the Termitesâ€™ storehouse.</p>
<p>But the Beetle was a lazy animal who soon began to get Ideas Above his Station, and while he was living and feast on the storehouses of the grumpy and bitey Termites, he decided that no only should the Termites provide him with pomegranates and gingerplants, roses and cannas, loquats and lillies, they should also carry him about. So he held his breath so hard that he thought he would Burst and pushed and pushed and pushed until two small handles appeared on his back, Most Golden like the morning sun (you can see this in the First Picture).</p>
<p>And the next time the Beetle met a Termite, he pushed the handles towards the Termite (you can see this in the Second Picture), which most obligingly picked up the Beetle and carried him over to the pomegranates and gingerplants, thinking it was a Baby Termite that was most â€™mazingly suitably provided with handles, just right for its bitey and snappy mandibles (you can see this in the Third Picture).</p>
<p>And that, O Best Beloved, is how the Beetle got his Handles.</p>

I have numbered the pictures because that is what Scientists do, and on Picture Number 2 I have put a white arrow to show you where the handles are, in case you canâ€™t quite make them out. You might think they donâ€™t look much like handles, but if you were a Termite you would be Most Happy to find something that fitted so nicely to your bitey and snappy mandibles. You can see this in the Third Picture.</p></div>

I havenâ€™t been able to show all the foodstore as there isnâ€™t enough space, but you can imagine it all, just off to the left. And of course, O Best Beloved, I had to draw it all in the light, so that you could see what was happening, although all this would happen deep in the dark in the shadow of the roots of the great Camphor-Tree where there is no light, only smell and touch.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Satan's fall" alt="" src="http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/spotlights/2008/rtuk_news_paradise_lost_01.jpg" height="162" width="288" /></p>
<p>In John Milton&#8217;sÂ <em>Paradise Lost,Â </em>there is a point where Satan, thinking through how he is going to tempt Adam and Eve to fall, comesÂ up with this plan, &#8220;<em>I willÂ exciteÂ their minds with vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate Â desires&#8230;&#8221;.Â </em>For Satan, this plan is hatched from his own recollection of the fact that, &#8220;<em>lifted up so high I thought one step higher would set me highest.&#8221;Â </em>What Milton gives us through his depiction of the fall of both Satan and man is this picture of the inflamed desire for more. What seems to be at the heart of both &#8220;falls&#8221; is this illusory hunger for more.</p>
<p>In another text,Â <em>Death of a Salesman,Â </em>the lead character, Willy Loman, unravels to the point of madness, despair and suicide because he is always chasing &#8220;the wrong dreams.&#8221; He dreams of respect, identity, and acceptance even though he has everything he needs right around him in the form of a loving wife and two doting children. His inflamed desire for the illusion of happiness beyond what he has already sends him on a downward spiral that ends in him taking his own life.</p>
<p>There seems to be a great danger inherent in these &#8220;vain aims&#8221; and &#8220;inordinate desires&#8221; that is very costly to the human condition. To hunger for more seems paradoxical, given that we don&#8217;t usually find stuffing ourselves to be a very pleasant experience once we&#8217;ve done it. And yet, over and over we desire this illusion of &#8220;more&#8221; at the great expense of our relationships, marriages, careers,Â livelihoods, sanity and health.</p>
<p>What concerns me is that our very culture is built upon this hunger for more. I can imagine, without too much difficulty, a team of advertising folk sitting around a table, using much of the sameÂ verbiage Satan uses inÂ <em>Paradise LostÂ </em>for whatever product they are trying to pitch: &#8220;What can we do toÂ <em>exciteÂ their minds with vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate Â desiresÂ </em>in order to get <img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSrn0RVns9_btwuYu9JuLy7uCK1h48_pckbgTsfHNZqdmCbii60ig" height="148" width="122" />them to feel incomplete until they buy X?&#8221; (Check out this familiar Best Buy commercial that seems to play Â upon this very idea: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufw2D8oMJ64" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufw2D8oMJ64</a>). In fact, this seems to be the very thing that greases the engine of consumption we call business (it might not beÂ coincidentalÂ that the product I am using to create this blog post has as itsÂ symbol an apple with a bite out of it).</p>
<p>This Thanksgiving, not long after the turkey, dressing, and pumpkin pie have worn off, the sacred ritual we call Black Friday will commence whereby normal, rational, sane individuals will be transformed in the wee hours of the morning into hungry, insatiable consumers, willing to obtain a deal at any cost (see this heartbreaking story of a man trampled to death by his fellow shoppers on Black Friday last yearÂ <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2008448574_shop290.html" target="_blank">http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2008448574_shop290.html</a>).</p>
<p>If this cult of desire seems to have its roots in very &#8220;demonic&#8221; aims and means, why is it that we venerate it throughout our culture? What are the consequences of a society whose very ethos is built upon that which causes the fall of so many? And what, if anything, can be done about it?</p>
<p>I think what we must do is address this very dangerous trap that we have fallen into whereby our basest desires are glorified at the expense of our humanity, decency, and virtue. That we have vain aims and desires is part and parcel of the human condition; that we glorify and center our culture around them with such &#8220;hellish&#8221; consequences is scary. As Aristotle taught centuries ago, it is not easy to do the difficult work of being virtuous, but it begins in refusing to listen to the seductive voices calling us to worship desire at the expense of being whole. Though we may have traded Eden for Sodom, we don&#8217;t have to stay there. The counter, I believe, is anchored in the Hebraic idea ofÂ <em>shalom</em>: a life wealthy in wholeness, a being complete, a mind at rest. The life rooted inÂ <em>shalomÂ </em>sees through the clutter and the noise, is able to resist the temptation to &#8220;step one step higher,&#8221; and refuses to worship at the altar of Mammon, that god of gluttony, consumption, and avarice. Jesus was right; it is impossible to serve both the God ofÂ <em>shalomÂ </em>and the god of Mammon.</p>
<p>May we be wise enough to choose correctly.</p>
