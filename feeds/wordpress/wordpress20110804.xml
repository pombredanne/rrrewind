			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/intense_stretch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617" title="intense_stretch" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/intense_stretch.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>The four young Great Horned Owls of Golden Gate Park&#8217;s Stow Lake are on the verge of dispersing. They have been the darlings of bird watchers and photographers for the last few months. Now capable of catching their own rats (the squirrels seem too elusive for the moment), they are becoming competition for their parents and will eventually leave or be escorted from the area. I haven&#8217;t been out to see them much this season but I did spend an evening with them last week.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/eyeing-a-squirrel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614" title="eyeing a squirrel" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/eyeing-a-squirrel.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>Owls often look fierce but this one just looks frustrated. I&#8217;m guessing this isn&#8217;t the first time it has been tormented by the squirrels.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wing-stretch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-626" title="wing stretch" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wing-stretch.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>Stretching in the early evening light, the owls prepare for nightfall.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/tucked-in.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" title="tucked in" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/tucked-in.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>This youngster stays tucked in the longest. Perhaps it had a mid-day meal and is in less of a hurry to hunt. Below, one of its sibling has other ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rat1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-620" title="rat1" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rat1.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>Success! An almost casual hop into the grass produced a large rat. After making quick work of its meal, the owl settled in for a rest (below).</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/perch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618" title="perch" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/perch.jpg?w=590&#038;h=861" alt="" width="590" height="861" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pounce.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-619" title="pounce" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pounce.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>The squirrels were pressing their luck and tried to sneak down the trunk past the resting owls. The result was this lunging dive straight down the trunk in an attempt to pluck the squirrel off the tree. You can see it escaping down the right side of the trunk.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squirrel-bound.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622" title="squirrel bound" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squirrel-bound.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>Having missed its target, the owl pulls out of its dive and, while I&#8217;m not one to anthropomorphize, I sense frustration.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squirrel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623" title="squirrel" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squirrel.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>This is the same evasive little squirrel. As comfortable with people as with owls I guess.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/young-owl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-627" title="young owl" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/young-owl.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>It really is wonderful to get the chance to see them at close range. There is something to be said for urban birding. The close quarters brings its own challenges but also creates a familiarity/comfort that is hard to find among birds in far flung wilder places. I guess this reverts once you get so far away that lack of exposure brings a comfort aided by ignorance (i.e. the Dodo).</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rouse.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-621" title="rouse" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rouse.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/fly-by.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615" title="fly by" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/fly-by.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>In the dying light I managed this shot of one of the owls rejoining its siblings. They were now very active and calling from all over the hillside but with no light and a long commute I called it a night.</p>
<p><a href="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/downy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613" title="downy" src="http://kitundu.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/downy.jpg?w=590&#038;h=393" alt="" width="590" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>Bonus Bird: Things often happen when you are waiting for birds to do something interesting. This little Downy Woodpecker landed about four feet from me while I was watching a motionless owl. It flitted about for two minutes softly tapping the branch and then jumped into a cavity to roost for the night. While this was going on, the motionless owl executed a beautiful full-body wing stretch that I could only watch from the corner of my eye, my camera settings having been changed to accommodate the woodpecker. A lesson learned&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://kdstern.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/race_start.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-329" title="race_start" src="http://kdstern.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/race_start.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></h2>
<p>A little over two months ago, some friends approached me with an idea: get a group of guys together to run the Warrior Dash. At the time all I knew about this “Dash” was that it was a 5k with obstacles including, but not limited to: water, mud, jumping over cars, haybales, 14’ rope ladders, hurdles, barbed wire, and jumping over fire. After reading the <a title="Warrior Dash" href="http://warriordash.com/">Warrior Dash</a> website I thought it sounded like a fun idea.</p>
<p>There was one problem though: <em>I wasn’t a runner</em>. I had tried running in the past to extremely limited success. Shin splints, doing too much too soon, and not really being motivated to push through were limitations I faced in the past.</p>
<h2>Merrell Trail Gloves</h2>
<p>A number of friends had told me about running ‘barefoot’ style using minimalist shoes like <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Vibram’s Five Fingers (VFFs)</a>. Given that the VFFs aren’t the most practical looking shoes, I decided to seek out an alternative while still maintaining the essence of bareform running. One Saturday morning when Amelia and I were strolling through downtown Lawrence we stopped in at Sunflower Outdoor and Bike shop and I saw the <a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/en/Barefoot" target="_blank">Merrell Trail Glove</a> shoe. After conversing with the staff, I found out this was Merrell’s entry to the barefoot running craze. At that moment I knew this would be the shoe for me. Though it turned out that Sunflower didn’t have my size, Brown’s ShoeFit did so I made my purchase and promised myself they wouldn’t gather dust.</p>
<p>Though you can find out all about the <a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/en/BarefootConnection" target="_blank">benefits of barefoot</a> (or bareform, which I prefer) running through a few quick searches, here’s the basics that attracted me to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bareform running forces you to strike midfoot, ensuring that you land with your knee partially bent rather than striking heel-first with your knee completely straight. This slight change completely redefines how the body absorbs the shock of impact when running on any surface. This was really important to me because as a veteran of 7 years of marching band, my body was <strong>trained</strong> to heel-strike and I suffer shin splints as a result. Heel-striking while running was one of my biggest downfalls that always ensured that it would be weeks between each run because of the pain.</li>
<li>Bareform running helps you be more aware of the terrain on which you are running. Due to the fact that the Trail Glove shoes are so thin-soled, it is very easy to feel the changes in the terrain and it has made me more mindful of how I’m running and how my stride affects how I feel and how much impact I’m making.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Couch to 5k</h2>
<p>Once I had the shoes figured out, I needed a plan that would work to get me trained for the running portion of the Warrior Dash. Luckily, I had heard many success stories about the <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank">Couch to 5k program</a>. After downloading the plan and looking over it, I felt like it was the right one for me. The very next day was a Monday, and what better day to start than a Monday, right?</p>
<p>I followed the plan pretty much to a ‘t’ though there were some days when I slacked off because it was too hot or I didn’t wake up in time to run before work. I made excuses on these days and definitely paid for them when it came time for my next run. As my Dad, track coach of 30+ years says, “Skip one day, no one notices; Skip two days, you notice; Skip three days, everyone notices.” Overall, the training went very well and I was continually impressed with myself for keeping up with the demands of the training. Before I started Couch to 5k, the thought of running more than one mile without walking was daunting and seemingly out of reach.</p>
<h2>The Warrior Dash</h2>
<p>Fast forward to Sunday, July 31st, the day of the Warrior Dash. My training was complete and I was mentally psyched to finish the race, have fun, and not get hurt. Although two of the original 4 guys who registered were not able to participate, my friend Brian and I banded together and completed the Warrior Dash in just over an hour. I’m not particularly proud of the time that it took but there are few things to consider: Temps were in the triple-digits, the course was extremely hilly and very very muddy (we ended up having to walk a good 1/4 of the course due to mud) and we had 10 obstacles of varying difficulty to deal with. In the end though, Brian and I met our three goals:</p>
<p>1. We finished<br />
2. We didn’t get hurt<br />
3. We had fun</p>
<p><a href="http://kdstern.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/firejump2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-330" title="firejump2" src="http://kdstern.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/firejump2.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The Warrior Dash was physically one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but I’m so glad I did it. To complete a ‘bib race’ as Brian called it made me really feel like I’m a “runner.” If you had told me 6 months ago that I would complete a 3.10 mile course with hellish obstacles, I would have laughed at you and told you that I don’t run. Today I’m given the opportunity to look at my race bib and the “Warrior Dash 2011: I Survived” medal that are hanging on the wall behind my iMac. It’s an extremely proud moment in my life and I look forward to future 5ks, 10ks, and possibly a half or full marathon. Six months ago, thinking of running 2 miles was a laughing matter. Today, 13.1 miles sounds difficult, yet feasible.</p>
<p>Thank you to my wife who believed in me from day one and didn&#8217;t question my ability to train for or run the Warrior Dash. Thanks to all those who encouraged me along the way, even if you don’t know it. Thanks to Brian for keeping me going during the race. And thanks to Merrell for creating a shoe that lets me run in a way that I no longer have to worry about shin splints and debilitating pain that would normally keep me from running for weeks.</p>
<p>All these things plus a little determination and will power have taken me from my couch to the finish line of the Warrior Dash and beyond.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_6820" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/scary-things.jpg"><img src="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/scary-things.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" title="Scary Things" width="500" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-6820" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This would be a low.</p></div>
<p>On Sunday, my friends Katie, Lindsey and myself headed out to Brimfield, MA for the <a href="http://www.brimfieldshow.com/">Brimfield Antique Show.</a> This was my first ever antique show. However, I have been to the <a href="http://www.floridaswapshop.com/">Swap Shop in Fort Lauderdale, FL</a> many times, and I can safely say that Brimfield is way classier, yet, still, not very classy at all, if that&#8217;s possible. </p>
<p>They say one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure, and that was never more clear to me than on Sunday. While some booths contained beautiful furniture, glass fixtures, and jewelry, others were selling baby doll heads and used socks. I&#8217;m not totally sure what the exact definition of &#8220;antique&#8221; is, but I know it does not include gum wrappers or old oil cans.</p>
<p><span id="more-6818"></span> </p>
<p><a href="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/books.jpg"><img src="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/books.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="Books" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6825" /></a> <b>High:</b> Finding dark wood furniture, similar to the likes of Pottery Barn, for less than $100.<br />
<b>Low:</b> Trying to open a wooden box and having the booth owner yell at you. He was wearing a leather vest and was <i>very</i> scary.</p>
<p><b>High:</b> It was 90 degrees outside and the show road was about 1.5 miles long, so working out while shopping was worth it.<br />
<b>Low:</b> All they serve at these things is fried dough, fried chicken, french fries, homemade donuts, ice cream, lemonade and soda. So when you get to the point of passing out and have to eat, you&#8217;re also clogging every artery you have. </p>
<p><b>High:</b> Ron, the very helpful older gentlemen in the antique barn who sold me my new blue chest at a 10 percent discount.<br />
<b>Low:</b> The cat lady selling figurines that told us about her skin cancer and tried to kidnap Katie.</p>
<p><a href="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/moxie.jpg"><img src="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/moxie.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" title="Moxie" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6832" /></a></p>
<p><b>High:</b> Getting there early allowed us to browse the booths with little congestion for a few hours.<br />
<b>Low:</b> When we were leaving, and Katie told me it was only 1:30pm, I almost had a heart attack, because I was certain it was after 5pm. And I&#8217;m still not totally convinced we had only been there for 3 hours. It&#8217;s possible Brimfield has some type of force field, time warp thing going on. I&#8217;ll investigate further and get back to you.</p>
<p><b>High:</b> Having one booth owner explain to me that one of his mudflaps was from an ancient Native American hut.<br />
<b>Low:</b> Having that same booth owner then tell me the mudflap was about 80 years old.  </p>
<p><a href="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pot.jpg"><img src="http://kellyanncarroll.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pot.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" title="Pot" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6829" /></a> <b>High:</b> Finding my new blue wooden chest with rope handles. It&#8217;s freakin awesome.<br />
<b>Low:</b> Getting in a fight with the guy outside the antique barn when he wouldn&#8217;t lower the price of a treasure chest even when I pointed out that I couldn&#8217;t move it because it only had one strap. I mean, honestly. Do I need an antique treasure chest with one handle? I do not.</p>
<p>So the lesson learned here is that, if you want to be a true antique-er, you have to be one tough cookie. You have to negotiate, not only a deal, but your way through all the junk to find something unique. Being able to decipher what&#8217;s a treasure and what&#8217;s trash is not easy, but getting it done as an amateur is possible, take it from me. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week Science Thursday happens to be the Thursday of &#8220;Shark Week&#8221; as ordained by the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/" target="_blank">Discovery Channel</a>. How basic cable stations get to declare an entire week dedicated to a single animal, I don&#8217;t know. In the case of shark week, I don&#8217;t care.</p>
<div id="attachment_4761" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/great-white-shark-sharks-7463260-1600-12001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4761" title="Great-White-Shark-sharks-7463260-1600-1200" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/great-white-shark-sharks-7463260-1600-12001.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The reason there is no such thing as a &quot;LOLshark&quot;.</p></div>
<p>Why? Because sharks are the BAMF&#8217;s (umm&#8230; Biggest And Meanest Fish?) of the sea. When you go swimming at the beach and see the lifeguard running toward the water, you don&#8217;t suddenly strain to hear if he is yelling at some teenagers for excessive horseplay. You are listening for one word. &#8220;SHARK!&#8221; That lifeguard could be yelling at you that the doctor called and said you have a brain tumor and it would be a relief, as long as he wasn&#8217;t yelling &#8220;SHARK!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharks are nature&#8217;s perfect biological murder machine. They are the Pac Man of the sea and everything else in the ocean is an energy dot. From their flesh shredding face daggers to a digestive system that can pass a license plate they are built for one thing, kill it and eat it.</p>
<p>So without further preamble I give you:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Top 5 Reasons Sharks Rule<span id="more-4755"></span><br />
</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">5. Their Sense of Smell</span></h3>
<p>A shark&#8217;s sense of smell is definitely one of its most outstanding attributes. As the shark swims, water flows through two forward facing nostrils, positioned along the sides of the snout. The water enters the nasal passage and moves past folds of skin covered with sensory cells.</p>
<div id="attachment_4805" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-sam-142.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4805" title="shark-sam-14" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-sam-142.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It just got a lot easier for sharks to smell this diver.</p></div>
<p>These sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water. A great white shark can detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size swimming pool. Most sharks can detect blood and other animal odors from many miles away.</p>
<p>We humans, on the other hand, rely largely on our vision to process our surroundings. In the murky depths of an ocean full of sharks that becomes the aquatic equivalent of playing &#8220;Blind Man&#8217;s Bluff&#8221; in a minefield. One of these beasts could be fifteen feet away with it&#8217;s triple row mouth full of razor sharp limb cleavers wide open and ready to amputate your pelvis to get to the chewy center in your innards, and you would never know he was there unless you brought your own cello player.</p>
<div id="attachment_4777" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 406px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/jaws1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4777 " title="Jaws" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/jaws1.jpg?w=396&#038;h=380" alt="" width="396" height="380" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bringing a light, on the other hand, will just make you even easier to find.</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">4. Longevity</span></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean longevity as in, &#8220;sharks live long lives&#8221;, although they certainly do. While many shark species live an average of 30-40 years, some species can live much longer. The Spiny Dogfish Shark has been known to live for as long as 100 years, as has the Great White. Some Whale Sharks have lived for an astounding 150 years. To put that in perspective, it is possible there is a whale shark somewhere in the world right now, dying of old age, that came into existence somewhere about the time of the beginning of the Civil War. So they are a long lived species.</p>
<div id="attachment_4784" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-dentist-pg4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4784" title="Shark Dentist PG4" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-dentist-pg4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=218" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An elderly shark gets fitted for an insanely expensive set of false teeth.</p></div>
<p>When I talk about longevity though, I don&#8217;t mean an individual shark&#8217;s lifespan but rather how long they&#8217;ve been in existence as a species.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that sharks are one of the most feared creatures on Earth. They are also one of the most enduring. The oldest shark fossils found by marine biologists to date are from more than 300 million years ago. To put <em>that</em> in perspective, the age of sharks predates the the age of the  dinosaurs. The sharks however, laugh at meteor impacts and ice ages.</p>
<p>A few existing shark species, such as the horn shark, have kept the same basic physical characteristics for more than 150 million years. Scientists attribute this remarkable longevity to the shark&#8217;s superior physiological developments. Sharks are outfitted with several special characteristics that make them highly effective, both as hunters and survivors.</p>
<div id="attachment_4809" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/13657_cool_blue_shark_with_orange_spots_wearing_shades.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4809" title="13657_cool_blue_shark_with_orange_spots_wearing_shades" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/13657_cool_blue_shark_with_orange_spots_wearing_shades.jpg?w=150&#038;h=109" alt="" width="150" height="109" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What Ice Age?</p></div>
<p>So let&#8217;s do the math and a little logic assessment of what that means. Mankind has been around for roughly 150,000 years. Sharks have been around for roughly 300,000,000 years. That&#8217;s a three and <em>eight kriffin&#8217; zeroes</em>. That is roughly two thousand more times than the entirety of human existence.</p>
<p>Now while mankind has achieved much in it&#8217;s brief tenure as the dominant species on land; such as space flight, computers, and processed room temperature cheese spread in an aerosol can, the sharks have been focused for two thousand times that long on one thing. Killing. And they&#8217;ve gotten very very good at it.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">3. Their Skeletons</span></h3>
<p>Jellyfish aside, pretty much every animal on the planet has some sort of skeleton. Be it fish or fowl, reptile or primate, insect or invertebrate, almost all manner of macroscopic life has a frame of some sort on which the rest of it is supported. So what is so unique about a shark&#8217;s?</p>
<div id="attachment_4790" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/drifters-jellyfish-pictures-underwater-photos.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4790 " title="Drifters, Jellyfish pictures underwater photos" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/drifters-jellyfish-pictures-underwater-photos.jpg?w=210&#038;h=158" alt="" width="210" height="158" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not nearly as tasty as the name would imply.</p></div>
<p>Sharks have skeletons made entirely of cartilage<strong></strong>. That is the same pliable, highly flexible substance  your nose and ear bones are really made of. Cartilage is strong and sturdy but it has a much lower density than real bone. This material keeps sharks relatively lightweight, so they don&#8217;t sink in the ocean and they don&#8217;t need an air bladder like other fish.</p>
<p>So how does this marvelous, pliable skeleton make sharks scarier? Consider if you will, all the torture and torment the open sea can dish out. All the storms and tsunamis and prey vs. prey action. All the whirlpools and underground volcanoes and a million other ways to die. Now imagine being a one ton great white killing machine of a shark jumping into a feeding frenzy knowing you will bend but not break. It just isn&#8217;t fair I tell ya.</p>
<div id="attachment_4813" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/02-shark-skeleton.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4813 " title="02---Shark---Skeleton" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/02-shark-skeleton.jpg?w=550&#038;h=250" alt="" width="550" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An articulated shark skeleton, and new reason not to sleep at night.</p></div>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">2. You Can&#8217;t Sneak Up On Them</span></h3>
<p>As if the insane, borderline superpower sense of smell, the eons of evolution, and the pocket comb pliable skeleton weren&#8217;t enough to make an encounter with a shark a ridiculously one sided affair for anyone packing anything less than an eight gauge titanium cage and an 1800 psi spear gun, there are a few other advantages to being the shark in the &#8220;man meets shark&#8221; scenario. One of which is, you can&#8217;t sneak up on them. The big jerks always know you&#8217;re there. How? I thought you&#8217;d never ask. They actually have a couple of extra senses that we the shaved primates of the land don&#8217;t enjoy.</p>
<div id="attachment_4911" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 202px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.com/2011/08/04/the-top-5-reasons-sharks-rule-a-shark-week-special/spiderman/" rel="attachment wp-att-4911"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4911  " title="spiderman" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/spiderman.jpg?w=192&#038;h=155" alt="" width="192" height="155" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Uh-oh... my electroreception sense is tingling.&quot;</p></div>
<p>The first is brought about because sharks have hundreds of pores near their snouts know as the <strong>ampullae of Lorenzini</strong> and it provides the shark with a sense known as <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/fish/electroreception.htm" target="_blank"><strong>electroreception</strong></a>. Simply put it means that sharks can sense the electrical currents all living things give off when the move. Every time you move any muscle in your body, you are giving off an electrical current. Even at rest, anything with a heartbeat will give off a mild electrical charge. Open air doesn&#8217;t conduct those electrical charges very well so land species rarely develop this talent. Salt water is a marvelous conductor of electricity however and so with the three hundred million years the sharks had to play around with the program, they came up with a way to sense even the slightest current in the water around them.</p>
<div id="attachment_4932" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 202px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.com/2011/08/04/the-top-5-reasons-sharks-rule-a-shark-week-special/quint2-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4932"><img class="size-full wp-image-4932 " title="Quint2" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/quint21.jpg?w=192&#038;h=128" alt="" width="192" height="128" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Quint, from the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;, just prior to becoming a tasty shark treat.</p></div>
<p>What it means is, even if for some reason they couldn&#8217;t smell you, they would still know you were there, hiding behind that reef and quaking in your strap on fins. You could bury yourself in the mud and hold your breath and they would know precisely where to dig for a tasty treat. I would imagine it to be a bit of an Easter egg hunt for them. A good bit o&#8217; fun for the whole sharkin&#8217; family.</p>
<div id="attachment_4925" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.com/2011/08/04/the-top-5-reasons-sharks-rule-a-shark-week-special/nurse-shark-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-4925"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4925 " title="nurse-shark-4" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/nurse-shark-4.jpg?w=210&#038;h=141" alt="" width="210" height="141" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;yeah...heh heh... peek-a-boo dude... heh heh...&quot;</p></div>
<p>The other extra sense the shark gets to ensure you have nowhere to hide, is known as the shark&#8217;s <strong>lateral line</strong>. The lateral line is basically a set of tubes just under the shark&#8217;s skin. The two main tubes run on both sides of the body, from the shark&#8217;s head all the way to its tail. Water flows into these main tubes through pores on the skin&#8217;s surface. The insides of the main tubes are lined with hair-like protrusions, which are connected to sensory cells. When something comes near the shark, the water running through the lateral line moves back and forth. This stimulates the sensory cells, alerting the shark to any potential prey or predators in the area.</p>
<p>So essentially, sharks have <em>seven senses</em>. The can see, smell, hear, taste and touch, but they can also detect EM waves and unusual water movements. There is literally nowhere you could go while in their domain that they wouldn&#8217;t know you were. <em>That</em> is scary.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">1. The <strong>TEETH !</strong></span></h3>
<p>Time to talk about the teeth! Sharks have the most amazing choppers ever devised by nature and are unparallelled in the animal kingdom. While the heading says &#8220;The TEETH&#8221;, it is impossible to discuss a shark&#8217;s teeth without first talking about their (for lack of a better term) jaws. You see, unlike the jaw of most animals, humans included, the shark&#8217;s upper jaw isn&#8217;t part of its skull. It is hinged to the skull but can be dislocated and lunged forward towards the shark&#8217;s prey in order to increase it&#8217;s bite radius. So it seems the sharks used the three hundred million years to make some serious design improvements.</p>
<div id="attachment_4947" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.com/2011/08/04/the-top-5-reasons-sharks-rule-a-shark-week-special/shark-jaw-3-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4947"><img class="size-full wp-image-4947" title="shark jaw 3" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-jaw-31.jpg?w=400&#038;h=245" alt="" width="400" height="245" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM</p></div>
<p>How hard can those fantastic jaws clamp down? Why an amazing&#8230; 27 pounds of pressure. That&#8217;s right, one of the hardest biting sharks in existence is the dusky shark and it only bites down with 27 pounds of pressure.  Despite the shmancy dislocating jawbone, it only bites down with 27 pounds of pressure. It&#8217;s more than enough, because that finally brings us to the teeth.</p>
<div id="attachment_4952" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://roqoodepot.com/2011/08/04/the-top-5-reasons-sharks-rule-a-shark-week-special/shark-teeth-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-4952"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4952" title="shark-teeth-1" src="http://roqoodepot.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/shark-teeth-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=207" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Come on in man. The water&#039;s fine.&quot;</p></div>
<p>Now that we know how the jaw works it begs the question, &#8220;If the jaw is so weak, how does it do so much damage?&#8221; The answer of course is the triple to quintuple row of razor sharp, serrated, 2 to 3 inch teeth. A shark never runs out of teeth. It has as many as 3,000 teeth in its mouth at any given moment. When teeth are broken or fall out they are continually replaced for the entire life span of the fish.</p>
<p>The shark&#8217;s teeth act like a thousand mini guillotines as they are not designed to actually chew the prey so much as they are to instantly kill it so it can be swallowed whole. Only some bottom dwelling sharks have developed teeth designed for grinding open the shells of mollusks. The more active sharks need only the pure stabbing power of razor honed bone.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">So There You Have It</span></h3>
<p>The top 5 reasons sharks rule the oceans. This was clearly a humor piece as much as an informational one so I&#8217;d like to point out that there is a better chance of dying from a bee sting, getting hit by lighning, a drunk driver, an illegal handgun or choking on your Jello as there is of getting eaten by a shark. Of course I might go on to point out that for as long as those odds are, they go up substantially once you take your body and put it physically in the ocean. (To date there are no reports ever of a shark attack taking place in Kansas.) So should you decide to go where sharks live, I hope you will be aware that you may be the apple of your mom&#8217;s eye, but a shark just wants to shove an apple in your mouth and call you dinner. Have fun at the beach this summer.</p>
<h5>Many sources were referenced in this piece. None more so than <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/fish/shark1.htm" target="_blank">HowStuffWorks.com</a> that has an excellent section on sharks. If you want to learn more about sharks I suggest you start there.</h5>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1680" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 294px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_1015-e1311105365192.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1680" title="DSC_1015" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_1015-e1311105365192.jpg?w=284&#038;h=300" alt="" width="284" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Where&#039;s Willy?</p></div>
<p>The largest creature on earth looks pretty small compared to the deep, wide ocean it calls home.  This might be why Griff and Ado lost interest in the great Blue whale after it rose above the waves a few times in a gleaming, sinuous arch, its ridiculously small dorsal fin protruding like a thorn.  Flirting with a pretty Swedish medical student who lent Ado her windbreaker to keep warm was more fun.  Plus, there was a harried first mate to harangue about the cinnamon rolls and hot chocolate promised when we left the tiny port of Husavik.</p>
<div id="attachment_1681" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 301px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0101-e1311105488312.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1681" title="IMG_0101" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/img_0101-e1311105488312.jpg?w=291&#038;h=300" alt="" width="291" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Oompa-Loompa Survival Suit</p></div>
<p>The grown ups however, bobbing around off the northern tip of Iceland in bulky, blue survival suits, were transfixed by the delicate plumes that marked the giant’s passage.  Breath caught in throats at each graceful roll of grey-blue body and eyes peering through camera lenses that could never capture the moment welled with tears.  White-beaked dolphins raced off the ship’s bow like benevolent torpedos and we applauded as if they were trained at Sea World instead of putting on a show for the pure pleasure of it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1683" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0974-e1311107288315.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1683" title="DSC_0974" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0974-e1311107288315.jpg?w=300&#038;h=259" alt="!" width="300" height="259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Three-Hour Tour</p></div>
<p>Our three-hour whale watching tour, on a sea backdropped by young, unstable volcanic mountains with jagged white peaks nipping the sky, was a little magical.  But when a big swell nearly knocked Ethan off his feet, Griff bouncing around on his shoulders like a rodeo cowboy, and Ado launched headfirst into the wooden rail, I would have happily traded all sightings of majestic sea mammals for a <em>terra firma </em>view of one of Iceland’s waterfalls.  On this island, water is so abundant that it spurts out of crags, boils over stacked cliffs and pours from mountain tops until&#8211;ho hum&#8211;the spectacle can begin to seem, well, ordinary.</p>
<div id="attachment_1686" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 218px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0549.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1686" title="DSC_0549" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0549-e1311105849934.jpg?w=208&#038;h=300" alt="" width="208" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wheelchairs At The Waterfall</p></div>
<p>At <em>Seljalandsfoss</em> (<em>foss</em> means &#8220;falls&#8221; in Icelandic), what inspired awe was not the 200 foot tall water column making a ruckus in an emerald green pool, but four people in matching blue jackets watching from their wheelchairs.  Three men and one woman had rolled through mud, muck and icy temperatures to feel the waterfall’s soft mist on their faces, refusing to let a lack of working legs scratch rugged, rustic Iceland off their bucket lists.  Watching them, I could not decide which was more powerful&#8211;human nature or Mother Nature—and perhaps they are one in the same.</p>
<div id="attachment_1671" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1671" title="DSC_0001" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0001.jpg?w=300&#038;h=207" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Land Less Ordinary</p></div>
<p>Iceland <em>is</em> a land less ordinary, but you don’t have to depart the beaten path of the Ring Road to experience one of it’s most impressive features; the island’s warm, pristine public pools.  It’s worth a trip to this windswept rock just for a swim safari.  The facilities here are cleaner than any private pool and the geothermally heated, mineral rich water is rumored to cure muscle diseases and smooth the skin.</p>
<div id="attachment_1677" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0922.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1677" title="DSC_0922" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0922.jpg?w=300&#038;h=178" alt="" width="300" height="178" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big, Beautiful Bathtub</p></div>
<p>With a herniated disk nagging my neck and skin that’s aging faster than a Chia Pet sprouts hair, these benefits beckoned.  As we floated in heat-induced torpor around the Myvatn Nature Baths one afternoon, a turquoise lagoon with volcanic rocks rising above the surface and a coating of volcanic sand beneath, I watched a woman scrubbing her arms with the coarse, black grit.  Aha! I thought.  Icelandic age management!  I grabbed a handful and rubbed my face vigorously, willing the Volcano Gods to roll back the years.  But I must have angered them instead because I ending up looking like a lobster after a dip in the boiling pot.  When the redness faded, I had rolled back maybe a week.</p>
<div id="attachment_1679" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0944.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1679" title="DSC_0944" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0944.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanging With A Lovely LIttle Local</p></div>
<p>Icelanders are truly obsessed with their watering holes (try jumping in without first soaping up naked in the locker room shower and you will get the evil eye).  Even towns with populations in the dozens usually have some aquatic surprise waiting for those willing to search for it.  In the village of Drangsnes, more than a hundred kilometers down a barren peninsula, we discovered three “hot pots” (hot tubs) nestled across from a church on the ocean’s edge.  One was skin scalding hot, the second</p>
<div id="attachment_1674" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0109.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1674" title="DSC_0109" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0109.jpg?w=300&#038;h=195" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paradise, Iceland Style</p></div>
<p>merely painful, but the third was just right.  We soaked until our body temperatures necessitated a climb across sharp, spiky lava rock for a dip in the sea.  Immersed in cold, red seaweed brushing my legs, and only my family and a heavily tattooed, bearded Italian for company, my mind felt cleaner than the water that so spectacularly tumbles from <em>Seljalandsfoss</em>.  The feeling was strange, exciting, and dreamlike, as anomalous as coming home one night to find a unicorn grazing in the backyard.</p>
<div id="attachment_1678" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0932.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1678" title="DSC_0932" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0932.jpg?w=300&#038;h=184" alt="" width="300" height="184" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paradise, Ethan Style</p></div>
<p>On our last day in Iceland, we met another traveling family at Reykjavik’s largest public pool.  This faded white facility, which looks like a 1970’s Russian Olympic training facility, has the biggest waterslide on the island—an 85 meter long corkscrew tube with laser light show inside worthy of a Grateful Dead concert.  While Ethan and I waited in the warm pool at the bottom for Griff and Ado to come shooting out in dangerous contortions, we began talking to a Dutch couple with two little kids.</p>
<div id="attachment_1675" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0130.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1675" title="DSC_0130" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0130.jpg?w=300&#038;h=211" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paradise, Griff And Ado Style</p></div>
<p>“How long are you on vacation?” the woman asked.  Rhiannon and her husband Sebastian had the wide, ready smiles of people who had long ago understood that life doesn&#8217;t often grant second chances.</p>
<p>“Well,” I replied, never knowing how to answer this question, because our adventure doesn’t often feel like vacation.  “We’ve been traveling for almost a year and a half now.”  Shock, along with some amount of awe, is the standard reaction, but Rhiannon just smiled and one-upped me.</p>
<p>“We’ve been away for 2 ½ years now,” she said, “sailing around the world.”  I quickly did the math; her daughter would have been three and son just nine months old when they left Amsterdam in a thirty-seven foot sailboat.</p>
<div id="attachment_1676" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 249px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0849.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1676" title="DSC_0849" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0849.jpg?w=239&#038;h=300" alt="" width="239" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Their Boat (but you get the picture!)</p></div>
<p>“Wait a minute,” I said, shocked and awed myself now.  “You sailed by <em>yourselves</em>, with your <em>kids</em>, to <em>Iceland</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” she replied, as if I’d asked if she could swim.  From Europe to Africa, South America, The Caribbean, The United States, Newfoundland, and back across the chilly, rough Atlantic to The Netherlands.  I mentally bowed down to the courage of this fellow mom, and we talked about the risks and rewards of breaking free from the cocoon of familiarity.  And most importantly, as we neared the finish line of our journeys, the challenges of returning to it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1673" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_00741.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1673" title="DSC_0074" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_00741.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful Minds</p></div>
<p>“My mind finally feels clean,” said Rhiannon, “I don’t want to muck it up again when I get home.”  That’s the key! I thought.  No mind mucking allowed!  In September, Griff and Ado will start First Grade and pre-Kindergarten respectively at a Spanish immersion school in Southern California, so Los Angeles will be home again for at least ten months.  The specter of having unscheduled time had been haunting my thoughts a bit lately, along with the nagging question of how best to fill it.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do when <em>you</em> get home?” I asked.  Rhiannon seemed smart and ambitious&#8211;maybe I could copycat her plans!  But she was short on answers too.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” she replied.  “I guess I’ll just look for the right thing and hope I know it when I see it.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1672" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0022.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1672" title="DSC_0022" src="http://walkingpapers.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dsc_0022.jpg?w=300&#038;h=229" alt="" width="300" height="229" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Where&#039;s The Waterslide?</p></div>
<p>A small brown body hurtled out of the tube and Adrian swam over, begging me to ride the waterslide.  So I said goodbye and climbed the long, enclosed stairway to the top with my son.  The square windows of the prison-like tower were covered with different colored plastic and the light streaming in striped our goose-bumped bodies in soft rainbow colors.  A year and a half ago, it would have been the cold—not the pretty colors—that made an impression.  And twisting through a psychedelic tunnel with my kid would have seemed more chore than luxury.  This realization felt a lot like progress, and so I tried to let the worry about what to “do” when I got home float away.  Keeping my mind as clear as Iceland’s public swimming pools would be the real challenge anyway.  But if I could manage it, maybe the answer would find me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sofiveminutesago.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/wednesday-endures.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-460 alignright" title="wednesday-endures" src="http://sofiveminutesago.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/wednesday-endures.jpg?w=332&#038;h=185" alt="" width="332" height="185" /></a>Why? Advertising says so. A recent article told me that <a class="zem_slink" title="Television" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" rel="wikipedia">TV</a> producers now are putting more eggs into their Wednesday basket than their Thursday one.</p>
<p>Interesting switch-up from years past, in which TNTV (Thurs Night TV) was the bee&#8217;s knees. I remember watching (or taping, on the VCR) the <a class="zem_slink" title="NBC Universal" href="http://www.nbcuni.com" rel="homepage">NBC</a> line-up of Friends, Seinfeld, etc. and thinking that truly, TV doesn&#8217;t get better than this. Tomorrow is Friday and all my favorite shows are bringing it home.</p>
<p>But alas, those were the glory days and who watches things live anymore (well, a couple people I guess &#8212; thank you, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NBCTheVoice">#thevoice</a> and its Twittersphere following)</p>
<p>Apparently now, with Idol, <a class="zem_slink" title="Modern Family" href="http://www.myspace.com/everything/modern-family" rel="myspace">Modern Family</a>, and other silver screen gems locked into a Wednesday night time slot, Thursday has lost some of its glory. It still brings in some big names, but vaguely reminds me of<a href="http://www.greygardensonline.com/littleedie.html"> Little Edie</a> doing a final tap dance in <a class="zem_slink" title="Grey Gardens" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.93759,-72.2161&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=40.93759,-72.2161%20%28Grey%20Gardens%29&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Grey Gardens</a> &#8212; kind of sad and <a href="http://sofiveminutesago.com">so five minutes ago</a>.</p>
<p>The bigger question is for broader <a class="zem_slink" title="Culture of the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States" rel="wikipedia">American culture</a> &#8212; does this mean Wednesday is also going to overtake Thursday in terms of nights out on the town? Is Wednesday night the new cocktail night? Once people reach &#8220;hump day&#8221; do they just check out? Will it become Tuesday? Soon, will everyone just be getting sloshed on a Monday night knowing that the weekend really isn&#8217;t that far away?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of life changes. There is, perhaps, no bigger change in life than the ones you make during adolesence. I recently found my Jr. High and High School I.D.s in an old album. Check out the change over six years. I also want to be sure to point m&#8217;boy Clayton to my Junior year in high school when I was growing a righteous mullet. The only problem was that my hair was so curly when it grew out that I couldn&#8217;t get it to hang straight down the way it was supposed to. True story: When my mullet was at its longest I went to the bank one day. I opened the door for an elderly gentleman who was shuffling slowly into the bank at the same time. &#8220;Why thank you young lady,&#8221; he said to me. I got my hair cut that afternoon and never looked back. C&#8217;est la vie.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/0-caramels-0.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3398" title="Homemade Caramels" src="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/0-caramels-0.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>These are amazing caramels!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Caitlin and I were in San Francisco last month, we stopped in the <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/" target="_blank">Ferry Building</a> along the Embarcadero.  It was around 11:00 a.m. and, even though had lunch plans in an hour, we thought it would be fun to wander through the marketplace.  We shared a sorbet from the <a href="http://www.ciaobellagelato.com/" target="_blank">Ciao Bella</a> stand and then went across the hall to a small food store to find (something else) to hold me over until lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-caramels-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3399" title="Homemade Caramels" src="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-caramels-1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the checkout stand, there was a tin bin, filled with several varieties of caramels.  I can&#8217;t remember the different kinds, but I do know that we grabbed two or three to have &#8220;later.&#8221;<span id="more-3386"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we had gone to Santa Fe, I posted a cornbread recipe <a href="http://judicialpeach.com/2010/05/03/yogurt-and-blue-corn-cornbread/" target="_blank">inspired by that trip</a>.  After sampling the sourdough at <a href="http://www.boudinbakery.com/" target="_blank">Boudin Bakery</a>, I thought it would be fun to try to make my own sourdough.  Unfortunately, creating the sourdough starter seemed a little intimidating.  So, subsequent thoughts turned towards our trip through the Ferry Building.  And that&#8217;s when I settled on these caramels.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">These caramels were really easy to make and turned out so well.  They turned out so well, in fact, that I decided it was not safe to keep all twenty of them in my apartment.  The morning I rolled them, I promptly went to the Post Office and mailed Caitlin half of them, knowing that her will-power vastly exceeded my own!</p>
<h3>Homemade sea salt caramels</h3>
<p>PREP TIME: Requires a few hours of cooling<br />
COOK TIME: 20 minutes<br />
YIELD: 16 to 20 Caramels</p>
<p>WHAT TO GRAB:<br />
Vegetable oil<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
1/4 cup water<br />
1/4 cup light corn syrup<br />
1 cup heavy cream<br />
4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br />
1 teaspoon sea salt, plus extra for sprinkling<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p><a href="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/caramel-collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3400" title="Caramel Collage" src="http://judicialpeach.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/caramel-collage.jpg?w=500&#038;h=336" alt="" width="500" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>HOW YOU DO IT:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.  Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper.  Lightly brush the paper with the vegetable oil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2.  In a small pot, bring the cream, butter, and one teaspoon of the sea salt to a simmer, over medium heat.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not let it boil</span>.  Once it has reached a simmer, turn off the heat, and set it aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3.  In a deep saucepan, combine the water, corn syrup, and sugar.  Over medium-high heat, stir only until the sugar has dissolved.  Then allow the mixture to boil, without stirring, until the mixture is a warm, golden brown.  Watch very carefully, as the caramel can burn quickly toward the end.  (It can be helpful to use a wooden spoon and drip some of the caramel onto a white plate to gauge the exact color).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4.  When the sugar mixture is done, remove it from the heat and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">slowly</span> add the cream mixture to the sugar mixture.  Be careful because it will bubble up violently.  Stir in the vanilla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5.  Return the mixture to the heat and cook over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 248 degrees (firm ball), about 10 minutes.  Pour the caramel into the prepared pan.  (Don&#8217;t scrape the pot).  Refrigerate for a few hours, until firm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6.  Remove the caramel from the refrigerator and allow it to come close to room temperature.  Pry the caramel from the pan.  On a cutting board, cut the square in half.  Using parchment paper, roll each piece of caramel into a tight 8- to 10-inch log.  Sprinkle the logs with sea salt.  Cut each log into 3/4-inch or 1-inch pieces.  Individually wrap each caramel in glassine or parchment paper, twisting the ends.  Store in the refrigerator or in an air-tight container.</p>
