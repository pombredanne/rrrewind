				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You think of Chicago and you think architecture. You think bone chilling cold winters. Television buffs think of George Clooney and <em>ER</em>. You think industrial revolution. You think <em>The Jungle </em>and <em>Sister Carrie</em>. You think the mob and Al Capone. But, I certainly never thought gardens. Chicago has gardens at every other turn. You go two blocks and there’s a garden or a park. Not whimpy gardens but really fully maintained beautiful ones. With flowers bulging at the seams.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_blackboard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1371" title="MATH_blackboard" src="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_blackboard.jpg?w=454&h=633" alt="" width="454" height="633" /></a>There&#8217;s a popular NYTimes op&#8217;ed titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1">Is Algebra Necessary?</a>&#8221; which questions the need for kids to learn advanced math. The author cites that failing algebra is a large reason why many students drop out of high school and post-secondary school. Moreover, algebra is not really required for most jobs or liberal arts studies.</p>
<p>This is the wrong idea.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I hate math with a passion &#8211; mainly because I&#8217;m absolutely petrified of it. The fear of math is so common, it has a name: number anxiety. In high school calculus, I started panicking before I finished reading equations. Once, my father, a computer programmer, spent hours outside the bathroom door trying to coax me out while I bawled my eyes out after he tried to teach me basic algebra. They enrolled me in Kumon where I learned the art of cheating.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_asians.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1370" title="MATH_asians" src="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_asians.jpg?w=300&h=266" alt="" width="300" height="266" /></a>In North America, we are taught to fear math. </strong>We are told that math is the sport of geniuses and the rest of us mere mortals should be very afraid. In Asia, kids are taught that anyone can do math with practice and on average, they do better.</p>
<p>But over here, the fear transfers from parents to teachers to kids to popular culture. There&#8217;s a similar problem in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11172054">African-American community with swimming</a>. Parents who don&#8217;t swim are afraid that their kids will drown so they don&#8217;t enroll them in swimming lessons. But kids who can&#8217;t swim are at the highest risk for drowning. We can&#8217;t keep kids from learning advanced math simply because we&#8217;re afraid they will fail &#8211; doing so discourages them from ever succeeding.</p>
<p><a href="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_saying.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1372" title="MATH_saying" src="http://brokenpenguins.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/math_saying.jpg?w=169&h=300" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></a>You know what else is really, really difficult? Learning a second language. Floating on your back. Asking for a raise.</p>
<p>None of those things seemed all the difficult once you figured it out. None of these things seem particularly useful until one day, when it was suddenly crucial. Given the number of doctors, engineers and developers we need, we should be encouraging kids to embrace the difficulty of math like any other subject instead of perpetuating the fear.</p>
<p>P.S. I still suck at math but my Asia-raised parents say that I&#8217;m not so bad &#8211; I just never gave it a chance.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more proof that we&#8217;re afraid of math via Internet memes (and even more of them on my <a href="http://pinterest.com/farahng/number-anxiety/">Pinterest board</a>):</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m starting a new series on LitLib called, &#8220;Craft and Draft.&#8221; It&#8217;s going to be an out-loud, unfiltered learning experience for me that I hope others can benefit from as well. It&#8217;ll be focused on the drafting and revision process and all the crazy magic-voodoo shit I&#8217;m learning in grad school!</p>
<p>The great thing about the contextual ambiguity and synonymous nature of the words in the title is that I can use them interchangeably to talk about writing <em>or </em>beer. I am so clever.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy. These posts will be filed under the &#8220;Literature&#8221; and &#8220;Writing&#8221; categories for future reference.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am a 26 year old male and still have a childlike infatuation with Lego. I also take bubbles baths when I&#8217;ve had a rough day, almost cried when Will Smith (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/">Dr. Robert Neville</a>) had to kill his dog after it got infected, think hydrangeas are pretty flowers, and know all the lyrics to <em>That&#8217;s What Friends Are For </em>by Dionne Warwick and Friends.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>Character Counts:</strong></p>
<p>As happy productive authors, we all want to be parents to our characters, raise them up right, and teach them to hate the things we hate. But characters (and to a lesser extent personal voice in nonfiction) aren&#8217;t our children. They are our creations.</p>
<p>Authors don&#8217;t birth them and then guide them through life, letting them form their own theories and build an understanding of the universe through empirical trial and error. Hell no. We force their beliefs onto them without even asking, telling them what they&#8217;re passionate about, what they think about certain philosophical quandaries, and how they ultimately view the world.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re like Christianity, but with even crazier stories.</p>
<p>Therein lies a problem. We <em>have </em>to make these characters, and for them (and by extension our stories) to be good, they have to be believable. It is surprisingly difficult to completely flesh out a character, and new writers (like me) will often create Frankenstinian abominations where we meant to create maidens fair.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1: A Hero is born, sort of</strong></p>
<p>In your planning phase, you might make a character biography. At this point, your character sounds awesome. He&#8217;s got a dark, messed up past, his beard is just the right length to be manly without being crazy, and his story arc makes Luke Skywalker&#8217;s seem like a lazy Sunday afternoon cruising around in an X-wing.</p>
<p>You imagine your characters looking and acting like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_1549" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-22-32_140.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1549" title="2012-08-03_09-22-32_140" src="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-22-32_140.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is a rare deleted scene from the ill-fated Game of Thrones vs. Pirates of the Caribbean crossover.</p></div>
<p>But when you re-read your scene/chapter/short story/cocktail napkin notes, your protagonist seems more like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_1550" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-14-50_629.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1550 " title="2012-08-03_09-14-50_629" src="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-14-50_629.jpg?w=614&h=1090" alt="" width="614" height="1090" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I say there, Monstrosity! Do you know the times?</p></div>
<p>I mean, it is kind of identifiable as some sort of humanoid, but there are some major problems here. One: his period-inappropriate tricorn hat is on fire. Two: He has two heads, one of which is completely black and has no face. Three: He has a sophisticated breathing apparatus on his chest, but also has a wooden leg. Four: His left arm is not attached to his body.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example, but my point remains. It is very difficult to properly build your character the first time around. He&#8217;s going to come out with conflicting motivations, bad dialogue, missing limbs, and possibly even a flaming hat.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s OK! Now that you&#8217;ve got your scene, and see that your character clearly needs literary medical attention, you can work on fixing him. It is a habit of mine to dump as many details as possible into exposition, trying to give the character a voice and make him seem human. This isn&#8217;t a good idea. Learn from my mistake. The more details you have, the more there is to keep straight, and the more likely your character will seem like his brain doesn&#8217;t work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2: The Hero goes on a really boring journey</strong></p>
<p>The great thing about word processors is that we can erase with reckless abandon. After revising and simplifying, you character might look like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_1551" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-17-46_101.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1551 " title="2012-08-03_09-17-46_101" src="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-17-46_101.jpg?w=614&h=1090" alt="" width="614" height="1090" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Now he looks a little more&#8230;is that a lemon meringue pie?</p></div>
<p>He&#8217;s starting to resemble something that could possibly be confused with a human from a considerable distance!</p>
<p>The hat is still wrong, but at least it isn&#8217;t on fire. The parrot was <span style="font-style:normal;line-height:24px;">inexplicably </span>replaced by a pie. The technology in his chest still doesn&#8217;t match his wooden leg, but at least his arm is reattached.</p>
<p>Better. Closer. Warmer.</p>
<p>Still needs work, though. No one wants to read a story about a pirate/robot/pie shop owner. <em>Do they?</em></p>
<p><strong>Stage 3: The Hero descends into the underworld via a very, very long escalator</strong></p>
<p>As you continue to revise, your character&#8217;s personality and thoughts may evolve requiring that you change major plot points or key exchanges with other characters. This sucks, but you have to do it. Trying to mash a scene or piece of backstory into the main narrative just because you <em>like </em>it normally doesn&#8217;t turn out very well. Re-write, re-hash, re-calculate, revise.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably notice that your entire plot has changed along with your character. This is normal (for me at least). Run with it. Give in to your demons. Let the story do some of the work itself.</p>
<p>Something that often happens when you do a significant amount of rewriting is that completely new elements and characters get added to the story, which is simultaneously great and awful.</p>
<p>By now, your hero might look like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_1552" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-26-16_262.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1552" title="2012-08-03_09-26-16_262" src="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-26-16_262.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A midget alien, a wizard-deckhand, and a pistol wielding monkey walk into a bar&#8230;</p></div>
<p>The good news is that your hero is a believable human at this point! Some of his wardrobe choices are still a bit odd, but at least now his actions are in line with his motivations, and his dialogue is setting appropriate.</p>
<p>The bad news is that you can&#8217;t see how sweet he is becoming, because you&#8217;ve added vertically challenged aliens and sharpshooter monkeys who distract from your main hero. Supporting characters should do just that: support. They don&#8217;t need to be as in-focus as your protagonist, so feel free to cut back on them if they seem to be carrying too much word-weight.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4: The Hero returns and brought cheap, crappy souvenirs for everyone</strong></p>
<p>By now, you&#8217;re sick of revising. But revising is like running; you can&#8217;t have ripped, washboard abs if you don&#8217;t do the cardio.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve pared and simplified, your hero becomes someone readers can relate to, because he&#8217;s not a bloated ideal or a hollow husk. He&#8217;s got skills <em>and </em>flaws, and all kinds of interesting history that lends to his being a character people attach themselves to. He might not be a Jamie Lannister or a Muad&#8217;dib, but he&#8217;s a certifiable human being.</p>
<p>Well done! You&#8217;ve accomplished the hardest part of characterization: making your reader want to read because your hero is innately interesting without being archetypal.</p>
<p>Your finished product may look something like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_1553" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-33-01_125.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1553 " title="2012-08-03_09-33-01_125" src="http://literatureandlibation.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-03_09-33-01_125.jpg?w=614&h=1090" alt="" width="614" height="1090" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Simple is safe. That pistol doesn&#8217;t look very safe though.</p></div>
<p>He&#8217;s not flashy, but he doesn&#8217;t need to be. He&#8217;s complete, recognizable, relatable, and lovable (or hateable).</p>
<p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> Revise until you want to vomit. Then go vomit and revise some more. It is an idealistic pipe dream to expect your work to come out perfectly in one draft, so expel that from your mind now. Keep rewriting until you understand why your first few attempts at characterization failed so badly, so you can avoid those same mistakes in the future.</p>
<p>Rewriting counts as writing, so don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re not writing just because you&#8217;re revising. Yea. That makes sense.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My great-grandfather, Karl, was a Master Painter and Gilder in Hof, Germany. Before he founded his own workshop, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Before he went to the Academy, he attended trade school. Before he began at the trade school, he served as an apprentice in his father Johannes&#8217;s painting and gilding workshop. And before that, he learned how to draw.</p>
<p>My father gave me a portfolio of Karl&#8217;s work years ago. Here&#8217;s a look at the art my great-grandfather drew between about 1885 and 1895, just before he headed off to trade school in Munich. Karl was born in Weiden, Germany in 1875. Happily, he signed and dated most of his work.</p>
<p>This little painting has no date, but looks like an early attempt at a narrative drawing. Notice that he&#8217;s trying to draw portions of the buildings in perspective without quite understanding how perspective works, and that he makes a stab at painting in watercolor, which he then abandons. Yet he signs the work, so despite his struggles, he considers it finished.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kgriver1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-871" title="KG:River" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kgriver1.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="594" /></a></p>
<p>These two pencil drawings are from a series of undated animals sketches in a notebook. He seems to be practicing, and draws a series of five animals.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kgbull.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-864" title="KG:Bull" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kgbull.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>The final animal portrait is signed.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ram2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" title="Ram2" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ram2.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="593" /></a></p>
<p>At age 12, Karl starts learning anatomy. Now we have a signature with a date.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kganatomyearly.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" title="KG:AnatomyEarly" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kganatomyearly.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Here are two portraits by a boy who&#8217;s trying to put it all together.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kg2portrait.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936" title="KG:2Portrait" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kg2portrait.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="373" /></a></p>
<p>At 13, he&#8217;s onto the Greeks. At this age, he might have started his apprenticeship in his father&#8217;s workshop. Is he copying these from drawings? It looks like it. In his apprenticeship, he begins to learn every aspect of drawing, painting, sculpture and gilding required to eventually join the guild of Master Painters and Gilders, which will allow him to establish his own workshop.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggreek1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-868" title="KG:Greek1" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggreek1.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="696" /></a> <a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggreek2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869" title="KG:Greek2" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggreek2.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="721" /></a></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re jumping two years down the line, to 1890, when Karl is 15. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have much documentation about what happened when, so I&#8217;ve tried to piece a time line together with my father&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s help and based on a biography of Karl&#8217;s younger brother Leo, also a decorative painter and gilder.</p>
<p>Most likely, he&#8217;s still in his apprenticeship, and look at his progress! What a huge difference. He&#8217;s learned shading, modeling, creating dimension and beautiful pencil work. As one of seven sons, he was possibly working alongside his younger brother Eduard in learning his craft. Girls were not taught these skills at the time, so his four sisters were learning traditional women&#8217;s crafts, such as <a title="Embroidery post" href="http://thishandcraftedlife.wordpress.com//?s=embroidery&amp;search=Go" target="_blank">embroidery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kghelmet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-873" title="KG:Helmet" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kghelmet.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="825" /></a></p>
<p>Karl is also learning how to draw expressively. The woman&#8217;s hair in the drawing below is beautifully detailed and fluid. However, the face seems flat, and makes me think that he&#8217;s still copying the work of other artists, not working from life. This is speculation, but the angel wings on her back make me a little suspicious.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirl2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" title="KG:Girl2" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirl2.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="646" /></a></p>
<p>After his apprenticeship, it&#8217;s time for Karl to head off to Munich at age 17 to attend the first course for decorative art at the municipal trade school, a 2-year program.</p>
<p>Around this time, Karl changes his signature, and, much to my annoyance, leaves out the dates. Is this a result of starting at school? I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s happened, but his drawings begin to evolve. Now it seems as though a live model may be the subject, although he&#8217;s still much more interested in women&#8217;s hairstyles than their faces.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirlwheat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-876" title="KG:GirlWheat" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirlwheat.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="788" /></a></p>
<p>And here we are, a portrait of a little girl. Karl has learned how to breathe life into his work. Based on the natural pose, the simple design and the lack of extraneous detail, this work is believable as a portrait of a real person instead of an archetype. Although the eyes seem disproportionately large, this beautiful portrait is drawn far more realistically and simply than his earlier work.</p>
<p><a href="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-874" title="KG:Girl" src="http://thishandcraftedlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/kggirl.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="924" /></a></p>
<p>Age 20, Karl begins his mandatory 2-year military service, and upon completion, returns to the trade school for the four-year second course of decorative art study. At 26, he begins a three-year study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, completing his education around 1905 or so, at the age of 30.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting the beautiful anatomy studies and other work he completed after he fulfilled his military duties in a future post. But let&#8217;s add things up&#8230; that&#8217;s 12 years of study in order to sit for the exam that will admit him to the guild as a Master Painter and Gilder! Bear in mind, he could fail the exam. Now that&#8217;s learning a craft!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I look back at the highlights of this weirdly action-packed summer, I feel a sense of accomplishment from successfully whittling away at a bucket list….</p>
<p><em>Somebody else’s</em> bucket list.</p>
<p>There is a special sense of satisfaction, however, that comes with doing things you never intended, hoped, or signed up to do, and then doing them well.</p>
<p>If this list looks familiar, please step forward to claim it. It&#8217;s mostly done, so, you&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Be Allowed into Central America</strong></p>
<p>Every day, people go to fabulous exotic places with backpacks, sarongs, and well-worn passports. Maybe they’re off to climb a peak, or swim to a hotel room that sits on stilts in the middle of a crystal clear lagoon. Maybe they’ll pet a sloth, or drink tea with a prince on the balcony of a palace. No? That’s not what happens immediately upon crossing the border? My obvious international inexperience also extended to not knowing how to change money, or use a passport. I knew how to take a cab – but I didn’t know how to take a cab in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Nicaragua – the exotic-to-me locale where our dear, smart, hyper-educated, beautiful, world traveling friends had decided to get married. We’d known them forever, and I’d been not-so-secretly hoping they would finally get hitched.</p>
<p>But Central America?</p>
<p>What happened to getting married in Vegas? Or Palm Springs? Palm Springs is nice.</p>
<p>I thought my first trip abroad, might be to, say&#8230;. Canada. Not like faaaar into Canada – I’m not crazy &#8211; I was thinking maybe the part of Canada that touches Washington.</p>
<p>My husband John was not nervous at all. He’s traveled far more than I, and in more precarious situations than our loungey, celebratory jaunt to the Tropics.</p>
<p>John came home a few nights before we were to leave, and could see it on my face.</p>
<p>“What is it? What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been reading the Internet.”</p>
<p>“No. Why? Why would you do that?”</p>
<p>“According to the Internet, there’s a good chance we’ll be abducted by machete wielding kidnappers if we take that road from the airport at nighttime.”</p>
<p>“We won’t. Stop reading the Internet. And besides, someone visiting from Nicaragua would be scared to death if they read the Internet about coming here.”</p>
<p>Here’s what happened instead of us getting kidnapped: Our trip to Granada, Nicaragua – a Spanish provincial town from the 1500’s that smells eerily like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland &#8212; was notably machete-free. We met amazing people who’d traveled from near and far to celebrate a couple we all love; the weather was warm and the people of Granada were kind, and lovely.</p>
<p>The trip turned out fine. Not just fine, but fun. Like really, <em>really</em> fun.</p>
<p>Even the part where my hair frizzed out to three times its normal size.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-hair.jpg"><img class="wp-image aligncenter" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-hair.jpg?w=345&h=668" alt="Image" width="345" height="668" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#2 Be OK with Lizards</strong></p>
<p>After traveling safely from the airport, we settled into our Indiana Jones suite – huge vaulted ceilings, wrought iron fixtures and a mosquito netted, four-poster bed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-hotel.jpg"><img class="wp-image aligncenter" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-hotel.jpg?w=365&h=487" alt="Image" width="365" height="487" /></a></p>
<p>John, having been to Central America before, ran into the bathroom ahead of me, mysteriously asking me to wait in the hall until he emerged a moment later with a sheepish grin. “OK, here’s the deal. There’s one little green lizard in there, but he darted away. I’m sure he’ll stay hidden.”</p>
<p>He did stay hidden, and I’ve never been such a picture of efficiency in the lavatory. I stomped into the bathroom on every subsequent trip, hoping to scare away any critter that may have already called dibs on the bathroom. It was a full 24 hours before the little green lizard and I came face to face.</p>
<p>I have been known to scream and run when faced with a lizard of any size, shape or color. However, the tropical heat paired with the rum gifted to us by the bride and groom, most certainly significantly and mercifully slowed my freak-out response time. I was able to look right into the creature’s beady little eyes and see he was scared to death. He had a facial expression I did not know scaley things were capable of. As he stood frozen in the corner, his face said, “Please don’t see me, please don’t see me. Does she see me? Oh no, I think she sees me.”<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>My fear was replaced with pity as I realized he was just minding his own beeswax when he got stuck in a bathroom with a terrifying giant sorely in need of a deep conditioner and a flat iron.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Use what little Spanish I learned in college</strong></p>
<p>Each morning of the trip, John and I shuffled to the hotel dining room where Olga, whose dewy skin and bright smile belied her age, presented us with a new exotic juice, tropical fruit, and huevos-anything-you-want. She was patient with my Spanish as I said the eggs are very good, and the birds are very pretty, and the trees are very pretty, and the table is very pretty. And every day, Olga suggested to us that our family would only be complete once we had a daughter. Either that, or she was saying <em>her</em> family is complete because she has four daughters.</p>
<p>If only my college Spanish teachers, who I in no way remember, could see me now! Unlike Spanish class, not once did I get to ask someone how to get to the library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-juice.jpg"><img class="wp-image aligncenter" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-juice.jpg?w=365&h=487" alt="Image" width="365" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#4 (Almost) jump into a pool, fully clothed, at the end of a party</strong></p>
<p>Our trip to Nicaragua was a four-day fiesta punctuated by naps and mosquito bites, and of course, the tear-jerker wedding and five-hour dance party reception that concluded with grown men jumping into the swimming pool fully dressed &#8211; John included. I stood next to my college roommate as her boyfriend Jesper jumped in. Liane and I hemmed and hawed. “Should we jump in? We should, we should totally do it.  I don’t know. Yes. No. Yes, let’s do it.”  By the time we got to “OK, we’re totally doing this.” It was over, the guys were climbing out, and I did not have to transport a soaking wet dress back to the United States in my carry-on.</p>
<p>But still, I’ve never been closer to jumping into a pool while wearing a dress. So, progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-pool.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-pool.jpg?w=710" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p><strong># 5 Be glad I went to my 20-year reunion, and come to terms with the fact that high school was actually pretty OK.</strong></p>
<p>When the invite came for my 20<sup>th</sup> high school reunion, I thought, “Of course I’m going.” I spent the next months trying to change the minds of naysayer classmates who saw no value in reuniting, telling them “Come on, you have to go! It’s been 20 years! No, it’s not the same as Facebook! It’ll be fun!”</p>
<p>Sitting in the parking lot, all dressed up, with my classmates streaming into the party behind me, I realized that maybe I had jumped the gun. “Remind me why I’m doing this,” I said to John. It’s not like I was that great in high school; I was really committed to that asymmetrical haircut I had all four years. I went through a thing where I made my own jewelry. I was in a knee-brace half the time. I was a bit of a spaz. “I don’t need to be here. We have Facebook now.”</p>
<p>Buoyed by my arm-candy husband and old friends who met us in the parking lot, we went in.</p>
<p>Sure, the evening had its awkward moments – even painfully awkward moments with stilted conversation or that thing where you don’t recognize or remember someone in the slightest &#8211; but most of the moments were hilarious, sweet, fun, or wistful. Everyone had changed…but not really. While the 10-year reunion had an air of one-upsmanship, the 20-year came with the acute but unspoken sense that time was now starting to go by too fast, so we should just enjoy ourselves. Some classmates had passed away, many had moved away, and it seemed that everyone recognized we simply don’t have the luxury of time to compete, judge, be intimidated, or hang onto whatever baggage we’d brought from high school. We’re all just people, with a little bit of shared history – just like we were in high school, before we had the wisdom and sense to realize or appreciate it.</p>
<p>If given the chance, go to your reunion &#8211; it’s not the same as Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-lori1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-874" title="FC Lori" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-lori1.jpg?w=225&h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-group2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-880" title="FC Group" src="http://thefulcrumchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fc-group2.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>So there you go – what I did with my summer vacation. And now for MY rest-of the-summer bucket list:</p>
<p>Sit around and talk about the heat</p>
<p>Clean last day of school stuff out of backpacks before first day of school</p>
<p>Get DVR ready for new season of TV</p>
<p>Deep condition</p>
<p><em>*The photos at the tippy top are hopefully illustrative enough to make sense: Nicaragua. Then you&#8217;ve got reunion pics with girls I was lucky enough to grow up with. This one below? That&#8217;s my darling husband leading me through the streets of Granada. I&#8217;d follow him anywhere (almost).</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re talking about Finland.</p>
<p>Finland is so hot right now! Number one in education, chock-full of beautiful, athletic people, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/happiness-world-bhutan-meeting-denmark.html" target="_blank">close to the top of the Happiness Index</a>, boatloads of reindeer, world-class infrastructure, dominant in all those economic/health/quality of life categories; the Finns are absolutely crushin’ it.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do they do it? What are their secrets? </em></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_544" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://themightyf.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fi-lgflag.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" title="" src="http://themightyf.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fi-lgflag.gif?w=300&h=184" alt="" width="300" height="184" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Finland is just crushin&#8217; it these days! Flag via CIA Factbook, so don&#8217;t do anything weird with it.</p></div>
<p>This of course should be at the top of every U.S. politician’s agenda <em>(figuring out how to co-opt things and ideas from other countries in a way that is beneficial to us)</em> but it’s not easy to admit when you’ve been outhustled, outmaneuvered and outcoached. The truth is, we’re being out-America’d.</p>
<p>It’s time to put the pride aside America. Time to head to Helsinki, flat-billed MLB hats in hand, and say, <em>“Alright, how’d you do it?”</em> Better we do this now as opposed to a Kent Brockman-esque welcoming of our new Finnish overlords in 2085. <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs74VYDNDXE" target="_blank">“Hail, Finns!”<span id="more-541"></span></a></em></p>
<p>Now of course it is ridiculous to compare Finland to the U.S.A. – they’re about the size of New Mexico, and we’ve got 310 million more folks to deal with – but there is much to be gained by studying, and hopefully stealing from, their ways.</p>
<p>Clearly our fatcat politicians lack the initiative or vision to enact any sort of useful Finnish Extraction and Implementation strategies, so let’s break this down ourselves and make some action points to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The first thing that strikes me about Finland is how clean and majestic everything looks. Look at any pictures of Finland online. That whole dadgum country looks like a screensaver. I suppose it’s possible they just shove all their trash under the snow (unleashing a horrific river of garbage in the summertime), but the country just seems incredibly tidy.</p>
<p><strong>1a. Action Point:</strong> Stop throwing beer cans out the window, and build more majestic things like mountains, lakes, fjords etc.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The second thing I notice about Finland is that it seems cold. Could this be a secret to their success?</p>
<p><strong>2a. Action Point:</strong> Turn Florida into an enclosed Arctic Tundra, give each family a herd of reindeer, and wait for the murder rate to drop.</p>
<p><strong> 3.</strong> Last but not least, we have got to get some of that Finnish happiness, prosperity, health and overall quality of life here in the States. But how?</p>
<p><strong>3a. Action Point:</strong> This may be a bit tricky diplomatically, but I say we go to Finland and offer every teacher there 3x their yearly salary to come back and teach in the U.S. In addition to setting up Finnish schools in every  major county, we also should set up Finnish Life Institutes, where our young people can learn how to be successful in today’s world from folks who know how to get it done.</p>
<p>The way I look at it, this isn’t admitting defeat or weakness; it’s reloading. Lebron was humble enough to admit he couldn’t do it alone, and look at him now! We need to do the same as a country. America is still great, but this Finnish infusion could really help us get back on track.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Blood vs. Family" src="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/304702_483390711688768_1990559733_n.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>The other day, I was talking to a elderly internet friend of mine who&#8217;s almost like an uncle or a dad that I never had. My friends like to call him &#8220;Shiz.&#8221; Shiz and I had an interesting conversation about the internet and how more and more people are creating another life online. In American cultures and possibly other cultures around the world, the family unit is broken, backwards, and in some cases, completely destroyed. We have working parents who have no time to raise their kids or pay attention to them, some parents who have still act like they are teenagers, kids raising other kids their age, and relatives who avoid and distance themselves from other relatives. It&#8217;s not always the case with every family, of course, but many people are in similar situations with their own.</p>
<p>Although, it is often looked down upon, the internet is starting to become a more legitimate form of getting involved in the community. It is not just the local community that people can get involved in through the internet, but they can also get involved in the global community. It is not uncommon these days for people to forge friendships and develop feelings for each other over the internet. People who just can&#8217;t relate or forge a deep, meaningful relationship with those in their local community see the internet as a means for social interaction with others across the globe who they can better relate to. Some would even consider their online friends as family and go as far as to say that they know their online friends better than they know their own family. Although this idea of having an &#8220;online family&#8221; may seem comical, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if the internet is picking up the pieces and taking the concept of family to a whole different level above and beyond the traditional idea of family as relation by blood or by marriage.</p>
<p>In a free world where all people can easily travel anywhere at anytime on the globe like taking the daily commute, visiting your online family in real life may not be such a silly or impossible notion. Easy global travel often leads to less isolation and more involvement. It would make it easier to embrace and connect with all people all over the world. Idealistically, the idea of family could be extended to all different people regardless of distance, blood, or legal contract, which is almost like a radical quantum leap from what we consider &#8220;family&#8221; to be today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t come up with a good title for this article at first. I kept coming up with &#8216;Fucking Hell: This Again?&#8217;, or &#8216;Seriously Guys, Grow The Fuck Up&#8217;, or even yelling into a voice recognition program and letting whatever it translated to be the title. Then I calmed down a little, because I realized that behaving without restraint and maturity wasn&#8217;t going to get me anywhere.</p>
<p>Even if a lot of guys are complete doodyheads.</p>
<p>Okay! Moving on, the point of this article was in response to a recent internet event that sparked my interest. Specifically, an artist offered a rendering of <a class="zem_slink" title="Batwoman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batwoman" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Batwoman</a> to various noteworthies in the comix biz at San Diego Comic-Con. Their rejection of her rendering would not have been that noteworthy or anger inducing, however, were it not for the way one person in specific phrased it:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Her breasts are much too small and do not have the lift that superhero women should have. Her jawline is fat and her neck much too long. The style of her hair is clunky and does not flow in a sense that a super human would. Her hips, waist and thighs are too big and she honestly looks fat. No one is going to want to read a comic with a fat female protagonist. I honestly recommend looking at issues of <a class="zem_slink" title="Sports Illustrated" href="http://www.si.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a> to get the right anatomy. Those women are the peak of human perfection, and that is what we want in this industry.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The rest of the response to this &#8216;critique&#8217; can be found <a href="http://kxhara.deviantart.com/journal/Contest-A-quot-Fat-quot-Female-Superhero-315317673?">here.</a> needless to say, I found the idea entertaining and wanted to share this contest with my friends on the interwebs, specifically Facebook.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one among my circle of friends that responded negatively to this and posted a rebuttal. I will not recount the full argument here as it is too long, but suffice it to say it included pointing out the exceptions to the rule as proof that comics don&#8217;t hate &#8216;fat women&#8217;, and that &#8216;beauty is heroic&#8217; (except, of course, when beauty is evil) and you tend to have more confidence in heroes that look to be in their prime, physically. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like getting in fights, particularly not with my friends. But as a feminist, one that&#8217;s worked hard to see things that are self-evident to actual women and have been for decades, I feel more and more the need to speak out. So in this case I did. Maybe I could have presented my case better, but that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m still working on. In the end however, I have to draw the line on at least one point. During the argument, my friend made the following statement:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Even regular television is filled with attractive people, so why, again, shouldn&#8217;t comics? We read comics to escape the mundane and believe in a world where people are fantastic and amazing and attractive. Why would I live an average life, looking at average people, to read a comic about an average super hero who looks like an ordinary schmuck?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This argument made me think of a recent foray into the subject by <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/5950-Tropes-vs-MovieBob">Moviebob</a> &#8211; in this case addressing the recent internet assault on <a class="zem_slink" title="Anita Sarkeesian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Anita Sarkeesian</a> regarding her starting her own webshow about how women are portrayed in videogames. While Moviebob is not the best proponent of feminist issues in geek culture, he&#8217;s at least pointed in the right direction, and has plenty of good things to say. But what is comes down to is this: when comics readers say &#8216;we want to see superheroines as being physically perfect, because we want to escape mundanity, yadda yadda&#8217; what they are actually are saying is this: <strong>men</strong> want to see hot chicks kicking ass. And even the kicking ass can fall by the wayside if they just stand around showing great ass and cleavage shots, going around and looking sexy while all the men just look badass. Case in point:</p>
<p><a href="http://hikikomoiegaku.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/comixbigger.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1551" title="comixbigger" src="http://hikikomoiegaku.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/comixbigger.png?w=400" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>There are no <strong>women</strong> out there that are loudly decrying <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/">Sarkeesian</a> or <a href="http://girl-wonder.org/">Girl-Wonder.org</a> or <a href="http://womenincomics.blogspot.com/">When Fangirls Attack</a> or saying that women aren&#8217;t hyper sexualized , objectified, and disrespected in comic fandom. The bile, the dismissal, the argument that &#8216;this isn&#8217;t really a problem&#8217; is all coming from men that feel like something&#8217;s being taken away from them.</p>
<p>(sigh)</p>
<p>You know what, guys, I understand. I do. I was right there with you. I was a guy that looked at Mary Jane in the peak of the 80s and 90s, all of her hot and sexy posing as a model as drawn by <a class="zem_slink" title="Erik Larson (author)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Larson_%28author%29" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Erik Larson</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Todd McFarlane" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McFarlane" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Todd McFarlane</a>, and I was enthralled. But I also grew up. More importantly, I understand now that comics, that any media, should be about more than empowerment fantasy. Especially when there isn&#8217;t an equal playing field. When there are badass heroes, and sexy heroines, both of those things are being marketed at <strong>men</strong>. We aren&#8217;t seeing any beefcake aimed at female readers, and even if we were, that&#8217;s not the point. The point is that all characters in all media &#8211; whether comics, videogames, TV, movies, or books &#8211; should be recognized as individual people with desires, motivations and emotions that are equally important, equally real. That women don&#8217;t exist merely to be driving forces for the men, either sexual, emotional, or to take bloody vengeance for, a la <a class="zem_slink" title="Green Lantern" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Green Lantern</a> and his girlfriend <a class="zem_slink" title="Alexandra DeWitt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_DeWitt" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Alex DeWitt</a>, the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Refrigerators">Woman in a Refrigerator</a>.</p>
<p>Women are not &#8216;here for us&#8217;, any more than we are here for them. We are all people, and we cannot fall into the trap that just because they are part of a fiction, does not make them less deserving of respect. Especially when so many people seem to still have a problem with treating <strong>actual</strong> women with respect. In fact, maybe if we treated women in media better, maybe it would help teach people to treat women better in the real world. It couldn&#8217;t hurt, at least.</p>
<p>In the end though, my friend asked me: &#8216;Are you willing to stop buying/reading any mainstream comics until things improve?&#8217; To which I replied &#8216;What makes you think I haven&#8217;t already?&#8217; Any comic purchase I&#8217;ve made in the last few years have all been indie &#8211; not all of them perfect &#8211; but I have pretty much given up on DC and Marvel for the moment. Maybe, <strong>maybe</strong> on a case by case basis if a fellow feminist tells me that it&#8217;s well done. Because I want to support steps in the right direction.</p>
<p>To any other arguments made in favor of the status quo &#8211; again, all made by men &#8211; my only further response is to play <a href="http://girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/?p=66">Anti-Comics-Feminist Bingo</a>. I don&#8217;t know what else to say, except this: It&#8217;s not acceptable. It will never be acceptable, and even if it is merely a <strong>symptom</strong> of a larger problem in our culture,  I will nevertheless do my best to fight for that in the future.</p>
<p>Please do the same.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is late summer. The squash plants are still blooming but they are also bearing fruit. Their huge leaves conceal sunshine colored flowers beneath their shade and soft ripening bodies of edible delight. The choke cherry tree on the west edge of my property is weighted down with dark red berries. In the early morning, I try to get there before the birds. But the truth is that after spending hours reaching up for them, I can easily justify leaving their mouths with a feast. After all, my brain echoes, there is a drought.</p>
<p>And then another mantra begins: <em>the weather is changing</em>. The weather is changing. The weather is always changing right? I mean, that’s why they say what they say about the weather. It changes, right. But now the changes are beyond the swing and sway of the seasons. In last month’s National Geographic another article about climate appeared. I don’t want to waste time on details that any reasonable or observant person already knows but essentially, where it is cold and wet things will get more so. What is hot and dry will continue to become more severe. I live in one of those hot, dry places. I migrate to a cold, wet one for most of the year. This means floods and storms, fires and drought. Not in a far off distant future: now.</p>
<p>The article also acknowledges that this climate driven instability will in turn create social and political unrest and chaos.  The next week a local paper has their front page devoted to the “mega-drought” as they are now calling it. And sure enough, much of the article talks about farmers in the North Valley of Albuquerque who are having to fight, in courts, for their age old, generational rights to the water that has fed their trees for a decades.</p>
<p>The truth is, this is no longer an academic issue. In our state, New Mexico, water is about our very lives. I cannot say it plainly enough. The water that we use and the way that we use it speaks to the very fabric of our community and history. The acequia system in Northern New Mexico was brought here with the conquistadors and really comes from the Moors and from Africa. This unbroken and subtle line of connection across cultures and continents still sustains us. The acequia system is a community-based, community governed water network. Its power lies directly in the hands of its users who are reminded, in their participation, that they are not only neighbors but stewards of each other’s bounty. And because the rules and the rights of this water system lie in the hands of its constituents, it also lies outside of the rule or power of a state or federal government.  How many such community-legitimized systems are governance are there left in this country?</p>
<p>And when I say “us” I don’t exactly mean myself. I am interstitial here. I am an anglo, born and raised on this soil, a part of the legacy of the 1960’s back to the land movement, but I am an outsider. I do not have generations of family here and I will always be a colonizer here because of my education, values and skin color. But nonetheless, I belong nowhere else.</p>
<p>However, no matter who you are in the puzzle, water rights are a central foundation of our identity as New Mexicans. And also, because this water, which sustains crops and fields, is derived from the seasons, rainfall and the changing weather, it is all the more fragile and precious. Most people who’ve lived here for a long time, live with that knowledge. Each spring, men and women pull out their shovels and pitchforks and clean each other’s ditches, praying for enough water to get them through to the monsoons. And the last few years, the monsoons have barely arrived. The snowfalls of winter have become less and less, leaving less water in the acequias and leaving plants hungry and fighting to survive.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to speak of this connection and this culture without sounding as if I am only romanticizing. And in many ways this relationship to land and water are lovely and poetic. But, water is very serious business here as well. During a summer afternoon, a friend of mine once accidentally forgot to close his gate, which meant that he was taking more than his allotted amount of water, thereby violating the social contracts with neighbors. He was arrested. With his young son playing in the yard, they hauled him away. This may seem trivial and sure, from the outside it does. But the truth is, it is a preview of the conflicts that will continue to arise as water becomes more and more scarce here in the desert.</p>
<p>But all of this is a preamble really. I have lived in this state my entire life and I have watched things change again and again. Anyone, from any small town in any part of the world could likely say the same thing. What concerns me is not the change; it is the loss. In the scope of my lifetime I have watched the monsoons dwindle and dissipate. I have become aware that it is harder and harder to grow our own food now on this land that, yes, has always been fragile but has nonetheless been enough to sustain valleys of orchards growing peaches, apples and alfalfa and hillsides that could support some cattle, and greenbelts by the water that carry the lives of birds, insects and all manner of wild plants.</p>
<p>It’s not just the water. The people who carry the memory of the bountiful desert are dwindling. People who know that there are long rainy nights here that soak dry earth and leave the most delicious coolness and comfort behind. Folks who carry the memory of wild plants thriving by roadsides, trees bent heavy with fruit, seasons that brought both warmth and cold, wet and dry in amounts that could be trusted and that could sustain generations. There was a rightness in the seasons that is barely hanging on. It is those spaces, that perhaps my children will never know, that grieve me most. Those seasons are now just memories. Sure, changes always happen and we adapt to them. From the outside this seems simple and practical.</p>
<p>I don’t know quite why I write this. I don’t have an answer. It is not a problem-solution story. It doesn’t move forward. My mind just keeps turning it over and over, as I watch clouds fill with rain over the mountains and then dissipate before they’ve left a drop on the ground.</p>
<p>And my prayers go something like, “<em>Stay with us, dear rain. Stay with us, please, bountiful crops, just a little longer. Let the weathered faces of the men in the old trucks who lean on their fences and watch the water flow, continue to wake to lives that satisfy them. Let mothers put babies to breast under these mountains, knowing that their children will have enough, will have joy in their eyes.</em>”</p>
<p>In the front of my car, late at night with a friend in Albuquerque, my eyes well up with tears. I think about the people in Australia and how the suicide rate has skyrocketed as the drought has become severe beyond belief. He gives me a hug. It feels a little better, to cry, to be seen. This land is a part of me, and I, of it. All other places I am only visiting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ap2014-brando-on-the-waterfront1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-126" title="AP2014-brando-on-the-waterfront" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ap2014-brando-on-the-waterfront1.jpg?w=300&h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In 1952, the House of Un-American Activities Committee (which led investigations into possible pro-Communist propaganda in Hollywood) called director Elia Kazan to provide the names of people that were in the Communist party.  After initially refusing to give up any names, he relented and named eight former members of the Group Theater.  Afterwards, Kazan lost a lot of friends in the film industry.</p>
<p>So where does <em>On the Waterfront</em> come into all of this?  Some people believe that this film was Elia Kazan’s apology, or his excuse, to Hollywood for his actions in the HUAC scandal.  Whatever your opinion of Kazan is, there’s no denying that he gave us some great films (<em>East of Eden</em>, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>).  And <em>On the Waterfront</em> is absolutely one the best movies I have ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is an ex-prize fighter who finds himself working as a longshoreman for corrupt union mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), a man who uses his power to instill fear into his workers with threats of death for anyone who breaks the D &amp; D (deaf and dumb) code.  When Terry realizes that he unknowingly set up the death of a worker who was ready to testify against Friendly and his cronies, he is consumed by guilt, but is conflicted as to what to do: inform the police about the murder and put his life on the line to do the right thing or play D &amp; D and continue to allow Friendly to bestow his corrupt leadership on the docks.</p>
<p>This movie has some really great motifs, the most important being pigeons.  Pigeons in this movie symbolize a number of things, however two of these themes are sensitivity and snitching.</p>
<p>Terry Malloy, although he acts tough and masculine (he is a former boxer, after all) is actually a very caring and sensitive man.  This is portrayed in the way he takes care of the pigeons he has in a coupe.  You could also say that Terry, in a symbolic sense, is a pigeon: in those scenes, he is seen in the cage among them.  The whole talk he has about hawks and pigeons are symbolic of the situations in this movie: the hawks (Johnny Friendly and his cronies) and the pigeons (the longshoremen).</p>
<p><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/on-the-waterfront_1809489c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-117" title="On-The-Waterfront_1809489c" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/on-the-waterfront_1809489c.jpg?w=300&h=187" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>However, pigeons also symbolize being a snitch, which is the essential conflict in this movie that Terry has.  When the police come to the docks to question Terry, afterwards you hear him saying “How do you like them mugs taking me for a pigeon?!”</p>
<p>Also, the pigeon imagery is great in this movie as well.  A couple of scenes that come to mind are when the union boss throws the tag numbers into crowd of longshoremen that are desperate to work and they attack the tags like a flock of pigeons going after bread crumbs; and when Terry stands up to Johnny Friendly at the end of the movie all the longshoremen are lined up everywhere, like birds on a wire, just watching everything unfold.</p>
<p><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen_image_82531.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-120" title="screen_image_82531" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen_image_82531.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Another motif that I quite liked when I first saw this was Joey Doyle’s jacket.  Johnny Friendly kills Joey Doyle for becoming an informer for the police.  After his death, his jacket is passed onto a man named Kayo Dugan, who also becomes an informer for the police and is also killed by Johnny Friendly.  Terry is the last person the jacket is passed onto.  The jacket is like a symbol for doing the right thing in the face of corruption, even if it will brand you a snitch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/30065.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-121" title="30065" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/30065.jpg?w=232&h=176" alt="" width="232" height="176" /></a><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vintagemovieswaterfront.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-122" title="VintageMoviesWaterfront" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/vintagemovieswaterfront.jpg?w=240&h=130" alt="" width="240" height="130" /></a></p>
<p>Another thing I loved about this movie is Marlon Brando.  His acting in this is amazing.  I remember hearing someone say when you watch this movie to watch what Brando does with his hands when he delivers dialogue.  A great scene to watch out for this is the scene with Edie Doyle’s glove, which was improvised by Brando.  His body language depicts that of a masculine, but sensitive man.  Brando was completely immersed in the character of Terry Malloy, a testament to his training as a method actor.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/movies-you-should-know-about-on-the-waterfront-1954/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dHtJUWO7yeA/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This movie won 8 academy awards in 1954:</p>

<li><strong>Best Director:</strong> Elia Kazan</li>
<li><strong>Best Picture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/628x471.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-123" title="628x471" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/628x471.jpg?w=222&h=300" alt="" width="222" height="300" /></a><a href="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tumblr_lzqybyld6i1qakh43o1_500.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-124" title="tumblr_lzqybyLd6I1qakh43o1_500" src="http://hollywoodfixblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tumblr_lzqybyld6i1qakh43o1_500.png?w=238&h=300" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Elia Kazan may have meant this film as an excuse or an apology on behalf of his actions during the HUAC controversy, and the themes of “snitching” may be an indication towards his actions.  However, my interpretation of this film is this: sitting in silence while the powers that be walk all over you is not worth it when your life is at stake, and it only takes one person choosing to do the right thing to spark a movement.</p>
<p>Many people may not agree with what Elia Kazan did back in 1952, however, you can never deny his power as a director, and <em>On the Waterfront</em> delivered in 1954, and it still delivers today.</p>
