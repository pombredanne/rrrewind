            Glastonbury, a festival held at Worthy Farm in England, has become Europe's largest such gathering for music fans.  Its five-day run ended Sunday, after entertaining nearly 175,000 fans. Heavy rain and mud greeted the attendees, who paid 195 pounds (about $310) for a basic ticket compared to the 1 pound when the show began in 1970.  The next festival will take place in 2013.

        <title>Yelp Brings Local Deals To Mobile And Gives Groupon Now A Run For Its Money</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yelp Brings Local Deals To Mobile And Gives Groupon Now A Run For Its Money http://tcrn.ch/iS0qfq by @erickschonfeld
            The next phase of growth for local deals will be mobile.  Groupon knows this, and so does Yelp, which today is rolling out Yelp Deals to its iPhone and Android apps.  An update to its mobile apps that is getting pushed out today will add a new deals icon to the app.  When you click on it you can see a list of nearby Yelp Deals for discounts at restaurants, spas, and other businesses.  (These are in addition to Yelp Special Offers and Check-In Offers, which already appear on mobile).

With Yelp Deals on mobile, you can search for nearby deals when you are walking around, and they are instantly redeemable.  You get a redemption code that you can show the merchant right from your mobile phone.  This is similar to what Groupon is trying to do with its Groupon Now mobile app, which is only available in a handful of cities (fewer than Yelp Mobile has out of the gate).

            Myspace CEO Mike Jones just sent out this mass internal email and press release confirming the company's sale to Specific Media earlier this morning. Kara Swisher is reporting that the sale was for $35 million.

From what I'm hearing it's been a rocky morning at the social network, which was bought by Newscorp in 2005 for $580 million.

            You know what isn't cool? $35 million isn't cool ... So in a move that makes truth stranger than fiction, Justin Timberlake, who played Facebook president Sean Parker in a movie called The Social Network, has taken an ownership stake in a real life social network as part of the Myspace sale.

            John Lennon was a closet Republican, who felt a little embarrassed by his former radicalism, at the time of his death - according to the tragic Beatles star's last personal assistant.

            Social enterprise giant Jive is releasing a study today, called the Jive Social Business Index, which surveyed 902 US-­‐based executives at large and mid-sized companies on their views of social in the enterprise.

The study revealed that Social Business is increasingly perceived as a strategic executive imperative in the enterprise, with 78 percent of the executives surveyed admitting that having a social strategy is critical to the future success of their businesses.

            I've also been playing around with Google+ (and the neat mobile Web app) this morning and so far, I think it has some potential (not everyone agrees).

But people like me tend to use more than one social networking service, so I was happy to see someone has already built a Chrome extension that lets Google+ users push posts to Facebook and Twitter. It's a little buggy from time to time, but overall, it works as advertised.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is Google Asking The Wrong Question With Social? http://bit.ly/k70ZOJ
            Today's soft-launch of Google's new social galaxy, Google+, raises one interesting question: Can Google, a massive, multinational, cash-rich, consumer technology company with multiple successful productivity applications and services, take its dough out of the oven and bake a social network into their bread? 

Over the past year, Google has undergone some big changes. Chief Executive Eric Schmidt stepped down. Co-founder Larry Page stepped in, reshuffling the deck and tying employee bonuses to creating a successful social experience. The result seems to be a slick-looking yet potentially Wave-like confusing constellation of social

            There's no question about it: Google+ genuinely looks good. But, as thousands of people have already noted and joked about, it also really does look a lot like Facebook.

UX designer and consultant UXboy agrees, and put the two interfaces side by side to showcase just how much the entry pages of both services look alike.

            Fearful of provoking further public resistance to naked airport body scanners, the TSA has been caught covering up a surge in cases of TSA workers developing cancer as a result of their close proximity to radiation-firing devices, perhaps the most shocking revelation to emerge from the latest FOIA documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

We’re working on a project to bring you a new and improved Google experience, and over the next few months, you’ll continue to see more updates to our look and feel.

            Today, Google, the world’s largest search company, is formally making its pitch to become a major force in social networking.

            Since we began in 2007, the Data Liberation Front has been focused on one thing: making it easier for you to take your data in and out of Google. Our first step was to make it easier to get your data out of our products, one product at a time.
