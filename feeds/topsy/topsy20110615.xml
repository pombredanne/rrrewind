            apan continues to deal with the enormous task of cleaning up and moving forward three months after the 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeast coast.  Local authorities are still dealing with the damaged  Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and now the rainy season, which could increase the risk of disease as workers clear away the debris, is approaching.  Collected here are images from this past weekend marking the three-month point, as well then-and-now images of the destruction shot by Kyodo News via the Associated Press.

    A large part of my job ... http://bit.ly/kagQbD
            Last night the threat was made openly by a PR company working with 2K Games: since some of the Duke Nukem Forever reviews went "too far," some outlets could be frozen out from future review copies of games. An apology came later, but for the first time a PR firm went public with the possibility of a blacklist.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[DISCOVR LAUNCHEZ AWSUM TOOL 2 FIND AN DISCOVR NEW APPS (FINKZ INTERACTIV GRAFS) http://tcrn.ch/mITuCM BY @ripemp
            At WWDC 2011, Apple announced that there are now more than 400K apps in its app store (and that more than 500K have been approved). The Android Marketplace has around 300K apps and is growing fast. The point is: There are a lot apps out there already, and more hit app stores every day. They're going like hotcakes. But finding and discovering new apps that you actually care about? Eh, not so easy. Of course, it's not for lack of trying. There are some awesome tools out there already trying to direct the fire hose and filter the noise. 

Chomp, for example, is trying to become the Google search for apps. Zwapp, Frenzapp, and Appsfire are all bringing social to app discovery, while Heyzap is busy trying to kill game discovery. Today, Discovr adds a dy-no-mite app discovery tool to the crowd, going after the user experience problem in an awesome, though somewhat mathematical way: Interactive graphs.

            Peter Pham, the president and a cofounder of mobile social startup Color, is no longer with the company, we've heard from multiple sources. The company launched publicly less than three months ago.

Color has been controversial because it raised so much venture capital - some $41 million - and had such a lousy launch reception. The service creates proximity based social networks based on who's around you, a promising idea. But one that Color has so far failed to execute on.

In late April I criticized Color for making misstep after misstep and asked

        <title>Buy a half-gallon of sugar water at KFC, give a dollar to diabetes research | Grist</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Buy a half-gallon of sugar water at KFC, give a dollar to diabetes research http://ow.ly/5hseY
            I honestly didn't believe this one was for real at first. No way even KFC, purveyors of a sandwich that uses fried meat as a delivery mechanism for fried meat, would seriously market a soda size called the "mega jug." And even if they did, they'd never have the chutzpah to donate "mega jug" dollars to juvenile diabetes research.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Is Taking A Special Interest In RockMelt&#39;s Social Browser http://tcrn.ch/iWDcaI by @erickschonfeld
            Ever since RockMelt launched its social browser, it's been known unofficially as the Facebook browser.  Facebook chat, status updates and sharing are all built right into the browser.  Now Facebook and RockMelt are officially working together in a product partnership, and the first fruits of that collaboration can be seen in the latest release available today, RockMelt 3. 

RockMelt is still an independent browser with only a few hundred thousand active users.  Facebook made no investment in RockMelt, nor is it going to help promote or distribute the browser, at least initially.  Its product teams, however, are working closely with RockMelt to make sure that its Facebook features shine.

            As much as technology has advanced, there are still many barriers between you and the answers you’re looking for—whether you’re juggling a clunky mobile keyboard or waiting for a website to load. Today we held a media event in San Francisco where we talked about some of the latest things we’re doing to tackle these barriers on mobile, announced that we’re bringing our speech recognition and computer vision technology to the desktop, and took the next step for Google Instant—Instant Pages.

            U.S. Defense officials still cannot say what happened to $6.6 billion, sent by the planeload in cash, meant to rebuild Iraq after the start of the war.

Any company who develops products reliant on iOS spends weeks crapping their pants before WWDC. No vacation schedules allowed for weeks before or weeks after. The announcements come out in one day and then even if you survive the annual release announcements you often still have to scramble to make sure your product is ready to work on time.

It’s madness.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Why Groupon Is Poised For Collapse http://tcrn.ch/lsfu7Y
            Imagine you're a small business owner. You have to choose between two propositions:

	You can pay $62,500 for marketing. You'll get a whole lot of customers coming through your door. No guarantees if they will ever come back, but they'll come once.
	I'll pay you $21,000. You get $7,000 in about 5 days, another $7,000 in 30 days and the remainder in 60 days. In exchange, you'll give my customers cheap products for the next year.


Although they sound completely different, #1 and #2 are really the same—it's the Groupon business model.

            Last month I spoke at SAScon in the UK on the topic of getting actions from analytics. It's something that I feel quite strongly about so I wanted to write a post on here to talk about it a little and expand upon what I talked about at SAScon.The key question I want to answer is -"What key metrics should I be tracking?"I can break the answer down pretty quick...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple Nearly Worth More Than Microsoft, HP And Dell ... Combined http://tcrn.ch/lUCyFW by @robinwauters
            If you look at how Apple fares on the public markets today, compared to other tech powerhouses, you'll notice that the Cupertino computer giant is currently valued at roughly $301 billion, which is close to the sum of the market cap of three of its closest rivals: Microsoft (~$200.3 billion), Hewlett-Packard (~$72.8 billion) and Dell (~$29.3 billion).

Market cap is of course just one metric – and arguably not even the best one – to make comparisons between companies. It is, nevertheless, a most excellent trend barometer and a simple way to compare valuations.
