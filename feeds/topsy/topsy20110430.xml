            The Internet hackers group Anonymous plans to hack Iran on Sunday, according to a press release published on their website. The group wants to use International Workers' Day, which commemorates the first national general strike in the United States, as an opportunity to reignite last year's protests in Iran.

        <title>Hey Apple, Sony and Amazon: Crisis Response is Real Time Now Too: Tech News and Analysis «</title>

            The reasons for the recent screwups by Apple, Sony and Amazon were different, but their reaction was remarkably similar: a conspicuous lack of timely response. Like many others, these tech giants don't seem to have realized that crisis response has to become real-time now too.

            Quando um usuário falastrão publicar várias mensagens seguidas no Twitter, elas serão agrupadas em apenas um tuíte, para evitar que poluam a timeline. O recurso é semelhante a um já existente no Facebook.

        <title>Strike A Pose, ‘Cause Online Point Of Sale Systems Are The New Vogue</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Strike A Pose, &#39;Cause Online Point Of Sale Systems Are The New Vogue http://tcrn.ch/jJUPvH by @jasonkincaid]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Strike A Pose, &#39;Cause Online Point Of Sale Systems Are The New Vogue http://tcrn.ch/jJUPvH by @jasonkincaid
            If you've ever worked in retail or the food services industry, you're probably familiar with the Point of Sale (POS) system. It's the software/hardware combination that most people would probably call a cash register, though there's more to it than that: inventory tracking, coupons, exchanges, and pretty much everything else is done using one of these POS systems. And they're often a total pain, with myriad options and interfaces that sometimes harken back to the Windows 3.1 days.

Pose is one company (among many) that's trying to fix the POS. And instead of relying on a new hardware device, they're turning to one you already have: your web-connected computer. Everything on Pose is web-based, so you can easily set up a new terminal if one computer starts malfunctioning, and setup is obviously cheap because you probably don't have anything to buy.

            I’ve been on this earth for nearly four decades. Being in a city like Paris, where there are buildings that measure their age by the millennia, helps put that brief blink of the eye into perspective. But still, it amazes me that I’ve been around that long — I feel like I’ve barely begun.

            Earlier this week it was announced that Yahoo is selling social bookmarking service Delicious to the founders of YouTube and their new company called Avos. After the announcement was made, the companies told everyone who had ever had a Delicious account that they needed to log in and opt-in to having their data transferred over into the new company. You should go do that right now, even if you're not a big Delicious user anymore. It takes 30 seconds to do and is something good to do for yourself and for the good of the Web. If you don't, that...

            I've been in Las Vegas for most of the month and so have been out of the loop on some of the major stories rocking the world of technology and media. Stories like the startling news that, having made a sack-load of money from the sale of TechCrunch to AOL, Mike is going to begin investing in start-ups again.

Like most jealous little fucks with a Wordpress login uncompromising guardians of media impartiality, I was shocked - shocked - at the news, but unlike most of those guardians, I was reassured by the honesty of his disclosure. I also laughed at HuffPost's official statement that - well - Mike is special and that everyone should stop whining.

            WARNING: mixed sports metaphors ahead.

How many do-overs does a startup get before users give up on it for good? As far as I can remember, the answer is zero. I can't think of an example where a startup launched into the wild, flailed badly, and recovered (without completely abandoning the first product). There are lots of examples of flailing and relaunching (see Cuil, see Joost), but I can't think of anyone that managed to pull out a win.

By my count Color, the $41 million startup that promises to

            Come Monday, AT&T will begin restricting more than 16 million broadband users based on the amount of data they use a month. The number-two carrier’s entry into the broadband cap club means that a majority of American broadband users will now be subject to limits on how much they can do online or risk extra charges as ugly as video store late fees.

            This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued Energy Star ratings for large vat commercial fryers. These appliances are used by high-volume dining establishments — like fast food chains, institutional cafeterias and full-service restaurants— to make french fries, hush puppies and anything else Paula Deen would promote, in bulk.

Encouraging the industry to upgrade to more energy-efficient fryers could help reduce the overall environmental (if not health) impact of kitchens in the U.S. catering to the collective appetite for fried foods, an appetite that seems pervasive, and permanent here. One Texan cook, Mark Zable, has even invented a method to make deep-fried beer. 

According to a press statement and calculations by the EPA...

            Square founder and CEO Jack Dorsey just tweeted a photo of the company's internal dashboard, and, aside from looking very sexy, it's boasting some impressive numbers. Among them: Square has shipped 341,688 of its card readers to date and has 332,483 activated users.

As Dorsey's tweet points out, Square is also showing some very impressive growth: on March 2, Square was processing $1 million per day. Now, less than two months later, it's doubled that, with $2 million in processed payments today (and there's still some time left on the clock).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Creepiest Royal Wedding Photo Ever, Courtesy Of Color http://tcrn.ch/iUlhVl by @erickschonfeld
            Well, the Royal Wedding is over. Wasn't that wonderful? If you weren't watching on TV, there were about a million ways to participate online. Millions watched on YouTube, Livestream and elsewhere. And even those who were there uploaded their own photos and videos, including this guy.  I'll call him the masked Union Jack freak.  Is that some sort of S&M suit he's wearing?  It doesn't seem proper juxtaposed with the royal newlyweds. 

You can find pictures of him on a special Color Royal Wedding Album created by people using the iPhone social camera app and sponsored by the British paper, The Telegraph.  You remember Color, the $41 million photo app that created a huge backlash in the press and some confusion among consumers about exactly how to use the app.

            Vibrating sex toys have been around for over a century, starting out as crude steam powered devices and now resembling something very cool that you might pick up at an Apple store. Sex toys have been the source of giggles, controversy, pleasure and up until the last 5 years, were not a mainstream product. They were devices you bought and had shipped in unmarked brown packaging or slipped into a toy store late at night to buy, but were not something you'd ever imagine picking up at Nordstrom or your local Wal-Mart.

Millions of men and women use them every day and yet, it isn't something we talk about much. Considering there's a lot of tech that go into these devices these days, I think it is a topic worth exploring and definitely something we should no longer be ashamed of.

            A yearlong sting operation, including aliases, a 5 a.m. surprise inspection and surreptitious purchases from an Amish farm in Pennsylvania, culminated in the federal government announcing this week that it has gone to court to stop Rainbow Acres Farm from selling its contraband to willing customers in the Washington area.

            The speakers for Disrupt just keep on getting better and better.  Today, we are extremely excited to announce four more guests who will join us at this year's Disrupt in New York City: Marissa Mayer, David Karp, Kevin Systrom, and Tony Conrad.

Marissa Mayer joined Google in 1999 as Google's first female engineer.  She ran the search product for years and is now the VP of Local & Maps at Google.  Mayer will be one of the finalist judges at the Startup Battlefield.  She's tough, she's done it before, and we are grateful to have her back.

David Karp is the CEO and founder of Tumblr, one of the hottest startups in New York and also one of fastest-growing websites, period.  Tumblr is built on the principle that self-expression should be easy.  Karp recently raised $30 million to keep up with all the growth.
