        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Pat Robertson: Deadly Midwest tornadoes could have been stopped with prayer http://t.co/VYn9gI4Q
            Pat Robertson has a theory for why tornadoes ripped through the Midwest last week: People didn't pray enough. Right Wing Watch found a clip of the television evangelist making the claim during an episode of "The 700 Club."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Importance of Brand in an Era of Digital Darwinism: Part of an unpublished appendix for The End of Business ... http://t.co/OLwPdu3d
            Think of your favorite brand, and the first thing to come to mind is likely a logo, such as the Coca-Cola scripting, a tag-line, such as Nike’s “Just do it,” or a jingle – remember the Oscar Meyer Wiener song? These may be the aspects of a brand you remember, but they are no longer the most important aspects of branding today. Identity, persona, essence and promise, are the new kings and queens of the branding kingdom, thanks to technology and the deeper connections it opens up between brands and consumers.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Rush Limbaugh, AOL Part Ways http://t.co/0EfO62Sq
            WASHINGTON -- AOL, the parent company of The Huffington Post, has become the eighth advertiser to pull its money from Rush Limbaugh's syndicated radio program since he called Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, who spoke out in favor of contraception coverage, a "slut" and a "prostitute" last week, according to a high-level Huffington Post source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but with a distinctly Greek accent. "At AOL one of our core values is that we act with integrity," said Maureen Sullivan, an AOL spokeswoman who confirmed the decision.

            TED Talks In an engaging and personal talk -- with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks -- human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness.

            It seems like some of the basic elements of the form, such as comments, have been stuck in a model that doesn't work very well to encourage quality responses and also doesn't fit the way people do things socially online these days. Oddly, a blog comment isn't even as good a social object as a photo.

            Did we mention that our esteemed editor-in-chief hung out with President Obama last week? Because that totally happened. Just two regular guys, discussing Linsanity, Blake Griffin's jump shot, what it's like to pitch a baseball while wearing a bulletproof vest, and — as the conversation wound down — The Wire. Asked to name the greatest Wire character of all time (let it never be said that Grantland does not ask the tough questions!), the Commander in Chief didn't hesitate: "It's gotta be Omar, right? I mean, that guy is unbelievable, right?"

            On March 4, 2012, 22 year old member of Young Jewish and Proud (the youth wing of Jewish Voice for Peace) Liza Behrendt stood up at the 2012 AIPAC Policy Conference in a breakout session called "The Struggle to Secure Israel on Campus" to call attention to the silencing of Palestinians— and young Jews who support them — on U.S. campuses.
