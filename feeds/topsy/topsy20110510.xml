        <title>Google Finally Delivers On Promise Of Admin-Free Chrome Frame Installs For IE</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Finally Delivers On Promise Of Admin-Free Chrome Frame Installs For IE http://tcrn.ch/itUiKq by @parislemon
            Today at Google I/O in San Francisco, Google developers Amit Joshi and Alex Russell took the stage at a breakout session to announce an important milestone: a version of Chrome Frame that doesn't require admin rights to install.

While this might not jump out at you as a huge thing, it's big news for millions of users stuck working at offices or schools with older machines where admins won't allow them to upgrade to newer, modern browsers. And some 30 percent of these users were not even able to install plug-ins for IE. Now there's a way around that with the new dev build of Chrome Frame. You can install this within IE without needing admin access.

        <title>Android Chief Rubin Hints At A New Nexus Device In Time For The Holidays</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Android Chief Rubin: Expect A New Nexus Device In Time For The Holidays http://tcrn.ch/lBHVG7 by @parislemon
            Today at Google's I/O conference in San Francisco, a group of executives sat down the with press to answer questions about the announcements made during the keynote earlier in the day. Much of the news revolved around Android, as did many of the questions. And since Android head Andy Rubin was present, someone decided to ask about the future of Google's own Nexus brand of devices.

Google doesn't actually manufacturer these devices but instead works closely with an OEM and carrier partner to produce a device that provides users with a clean and pure version of Android. Given that Google is now working more closely with carriers and OEMs to push up-to-date Android across the board, some wondered what this might mean for the Nexus devices?

            Nuance, a company that develops imaging and voice recognition technologies, has announced the acquisition of print management and cost recovery software developer Equitrac.  Nuance is shelling out $157 million in cash for the company, and the deal is expected to close in September of this year.

Equitrac's software helps businesses effectively manage their printing environments, reduce printing costs, increase security and lessen their environmental impact. Users can print documents from their desktop as usual, then use card-swipe or log-in identification at a printer to view and select their documents for on-demand printing.  In a hospital setting for example, care providers can securely access and print standardized forms or specific patient reports from printer.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google&#39;s New Partner Android Update Initiative: Very Promising — Maybe, We&#39;ll See http://tcrn.ch/ja4u5O by @parislemon
            Today at their I/O conference in San Francisco, Google had a range of things to announce, many of them about Android. By far the most interesting thing to me was the notion that Google is finally getting their carrier and OEM partners in line with regard to Android updates.

Well, that's the plan anyway. The actual details are very thin at the moment.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Gagaville: Zynga And Lady Gaga Announce Major Branding Deal http://tcrn.ch/l3WVsE by @leenarao
            In the past, Zynga has landed a number of high-profile partnerships with musicians and entertainment companies, including Snoop Dogg, Dreamworks, Nickelodeon, The Green Hornet and others. But today, the social gaming giant is announcing its largest entertainment deal to date-with pop star Lady Gaga.

Lady Gaga has partnered with Zynga previously, when the company was raising money for releif efforts around the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. On May 17, Lady Gaga and Zynga will unveil, GagaVille – a neighboring farm on FarmVille, which is a Gaga inspired farm in-gam. GagaVille will showcase Lady Gaga’s style and themes from the album and videos (crystals, unicorns, sheep on motorcycles); and gamers will have exclusive access in Farmville to songs from the artists's new album “Born This Way” before the album is released later in the month. From May 17 to 19, players can unlock and stream a new un-released track per day. And from May 20 to 23, players can unlock and stream a significant portion of songs from the new album, plus special bonus remixes.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Q1 Online Retail Spending Up 12 Percent To $38 Billion; Number Of Buyers Up 7 Percent http://tcrn.ch/iXI8yw by @leenarao
            While online to offline buying is growing rapidly, so is e-commerce, according to comScore's latest data. The research company is reporting that online retail spending online retail spending reached $38 billion for the quarter, up 12 percent from a year ago. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth rates, says comScore. Online retail spending reached  a record $43.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 (and during the holiday season), up 11 percent from the previous year.

comScore says the 12 percent growth in the quarter was due to an increase in number of buyers (up 7 percent) and transactions per buyer (up 9 percent), but accompanied by a slight decline in dollars per transaction (down 4 percent). Additionally, one of the drivers of an increase in spending online is that online retailers are often offering lower price points than brick and mortar stores. And this quarter's growth in e-commerce spending was roughly double that observed at offline retail.

            In the wake of today's news that Microsoft is buying Skype for $8.5 billion, CEOs Steve Ballmer and Tony Bates just held a press conference to explain the deal and sell it to investors.  The reaction has ben tepid, with Microsoft shares down about 1 percent so far today.  As I've pointed out, Skype is a great company, but there are concerns that Microsoft paid too much.

In today's press conference, Ballmer did a good job couching the deal in terms of Microsoft's mission to bring people closer together through technology and make their lives better.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Annouces Plans, Partners To Guarantee Android Phones Will Get Latest Updates http://tcrn.ch/kpH1JG by @mjburnsy
            There's a new Android phone every two weeks now. That often spells bad news for slightly older phones as carriers and makers abandon their development. Not anymore.

Google just rolled out the founding partners of an inititive to keep hardware up-to-date for at least 18 months. That means these top five hardware makers and top five carriers won't forget about last year's hot device. They will eventually get the latest update although since details were a bit light at I/O, it isn't exactly clear how this will work. The only stipulation here is that the phone's hardware must support the Android build, which sort of means low-end Android devices will still be left to die before their high-end brethren.
