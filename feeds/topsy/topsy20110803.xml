            On October 6, 2010 we launched Instagram in the App Store as a way for people to easily share their lives through photos taken on their iPhones. Since then, we've seen more than 7 million people from all around the world share photos on our platform. Today, we're excited to announce that more than 150 million photos have been shared on Instagram and Instagrammers now share photos with one another at a rate of 15 photos per second. If you don't yet have Instagram, you can find it for free, exclusively in the Apple App Store.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Submit URLs to Google with Fetch as Googlebot: Webmaster Level: All
The Fetch as Googlebot feature in Webmaster ... http://bit.ly/qCuMRO
            The Fetch as Googlebot feature in Webmaster Tools now provides a way to submit new and updated URLs to Google for indexing. After you fetch a URL as Googlebot, if the fetch is successful, you’ll now see the option to submit that URL to our index. When you submit a URL in this way Googlebot will crawl the URL, usually within a day. We’ll then consider it for inclusion in our index. Note that we don’t guarantee that every URL submitted in this way will be indexed; we’ll still use our regular processes—the same ones we use on URLs discovered in any other way—to evaluate whether a URL belongs in our index.
