            About a week and a half ago, I wrote a post defending Apple against the location FUD being spread. Due to some real, but minor issues (which have already been resolved) Apple was at the center of this. Then the focus immediately seemed to shift towards Google. If Apple is

        <title>So, I’m Back On Twitter. Addiction Is A Hell Of A Thing</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I&#39;m Back On Twitter. Addiction Is A Hell Of A Thing http://tcrn.ch/lB8Zoa by @paulcarr
            Back in August of last year, with a small amount of media fanfare, I quit Twitter and every other social network.

At the time, I was in the midst of making final edits to The Upgrade as well as writing three columns a week. For someone who makes a living writing about himself, I explained, Twitter is a huge distraction from paid work. It is also, as I discovered while researching the book, fatal to good record keeping: creating a string of disconnection, context-free updates, rather than the kind of consistent narrative you might find on a blog.

To those who suggested I simply cut back on my Twitter usage, rather than quitting cold turkey, I pointed to my struggles with drinking. The slightly-pathetic truth is, I'm cursed with an addictive personality; an all-or-nothing-mindset that has been, to paraphrase Homer Simpson, the cause of and solution to all of my problems.

            Digging out from under a mountain of stuff this weekend, I'm hopelessly behind. Disclosure: I work at salesforce.com, doing amazing things I can't say anything about.  

Apparently, the tech press is abuzz with controversy about Mike Arrington's continuing success at actually saying what he thinks. Disclosure: I am a big fan of everything Mike does, and particularly his skill at reinventing the media. I should be considered completely biased in that regard, and you should discount everything I say accordingly.

            Earlier this week I issued a report about the positive changes that have recently taken place in the venture capital industry. These changes are profound and will have a lasting effect on both the venture capital asset class as well as today’s start-ups.

Much has been written about the so-called “golden age” of venture capital in the late 1990s dot-com era, when the likes of Netscape, Yahoo, Amazon and eBay were created. 

Yes, those certainly were great times for founders and early stage investors, but I will let you in on a little secret: for all of the brilliance, ambition and hard work that went into building these iconic companies, the vast majority of the capital appreciation in these businesses took place only after they went public.

            Last week I wrote a post about my current investment policy at TechCrunch, and pointing out already disclosed financial conflicts of interest. Our primary duty to readers, as I've said many times, is transparency. To that end we will (as we always have) be extremely careful in disclosing any investments I've made in startups or in venture funds. And these interests will be disclosed even when other TechCrunch writers are covering these companies.

In that post I said that there would be a lot of criticism headed our way from our competitors. And that's exactly what happened. AllThingsD calls me

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[OMG/JK: Can Google Correct Last Year&#39;s Big I/O Flops This Year? http://tcrn.ch/iUPzRm by @parislemon
            It's just about that time again. Google I/O is happening next week and just as in year's past, the company is expected to announce some big things on stage during their two keynotes on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. But what will those things be? Jason and I delve into some predictions for the event, which we'll both be covering.

But first we take some time to look back at last year's I/O which made a big splash at the time — and can now probably be best described as a big flop. Google TV, Google Music, Chrome OS. Etc, etc, etc... Will this year's be more of the same, or will Google's mouth actually be able to write checks that their body can cash this time around? Stay tuned...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon Cloud Player Quietly Begins Working On iOS Devices! http://tcrn.ch/ishfV7 by @parislemon
            Back in March, alongside the roll out of Amazon's new cloud-based music upload/player service, we noted one glaring problem: it didn't work on iOS devices. You might think this had to due with Flash or another technology that iOS wasn't compatible with, but it wasn't. It looked like something else was simply blocking it from working. Well, good news. That's no longer the case.

If you visit Amazon's Cloud Player through the Safari web browser on an iOS device, you'll see that it does in fact now work. You'll first hit a warning page telling you that your browser is not supported, but just ignore that. Click into the music in your drive and it will begin playing. It works flawlessly — even to the point where if you get a Push Notification or incoming call, the music will be paused.

            Everyone is rightly very excited about the upcoming mega-hackathon at Disrupt New York. At last count, the event will host around four hundred billion hackers, working on some eighty five trillion projects. Luckily, as at all TechCrunch events, there'll be rock-solid wifi and wired Internet for all those billions of people to use.

And yet... on the other side of the Atlantic, a merry band of hackers is proving that you don't need to attend a record-breakingly-large hackthon to produce a seriously cool app. In fact, you don't even need Internet access.

            Since 2007, you've been able to sign in to your AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) account to chat with your AIM contacts directly from Gmail. You simply login with your AIM account in Gmail and your contacts will populate your gChat list, allowing you to chat with them just like you would your Google Talk contatcs.

        <title>Why The New Guy Can’t Code</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Why The New Guy Can&#39;t Code http://tcrn.ch/jEA09X by @rezendi]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Why The New Guy Can&#39;t Code http://tcrn.ch/jEA09X by @rezendi
            We've all lived the nightmare. A new developer shows up at work, and you try to be welcoming, but he1 can't seem to get up to speed; the questions he asks reveal basic ignorance; and his work, when it finally emerges, is so kludgey that it ultimately must be rewritten from scratch by more competent people. And yet his interviewers—and/or the HR department, if your company has been infested by that bureaucratic parasite—swear that they only hire above-average/A-level/top-1% people.

It's a big problem, especially now. There's a boom on. I get harassing emails from recruiters every day. Everyone's desperate to hire developers…but developers are not fungible. A great coder can easily be 50 times more productive than a mediocre one, while bad ones ultimately have negative productivity. Hiring a mediocre or bad developer is a terrible mistake for any organization; for a startup, it can be a catastrophic company-killer. So how can it happen so often?

Like many of the hangovers that haunt modern software engineering, this is ultimately mostly Microsoft's fault.2

            In 2007, the “Facebook Class” at Stanford created free apps for millions of users. But it also fired up the careers of many students and pioneered a new model of entrepreneurship.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[A New Era Of Search Is About The Answers, Not Just The Links http://tcrn.ch/klAIIF
            Search is about to change quite radically. For more than a decade, search has been stagnant: the core product has not changed much. Users have changed radically in that time frame. Even though the kind of content users consume is different, search engines are still focused mostly on web pages. Users have become less patient and have less time on hand, while search engines still require users to dig through and extract information from the web pages to find what they’re looking for. In addition, users are spending more and more time on their mobile phones and other connected devices, which require a completely different kind of user experience for search.

            Hybrid cars have been around for a while, but one German grad student is taking the concept to the water. A new hybrid propulsion motorboat designed by Stefanie Behringer, would reduce drag thanks to its three-hull, or trimaran, form.

A jet ski attaches to either side of the main hull, helping stabilize the boat. While the jet skis are electric-powered, the 49-foot long watercraft is also powered by two diesel engines that use Audi's turbo-charged injection technology. Audi's Concept Design team in Munich worked with Behringer on the project.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Afghanistan, April 2011 http://bo.st/mow7zD
            Life expectancy in Afghanistan is but 45 years.  It has the world's second-highest infant mortality rate.  Only 12% of Afghan women are literate.   It is the world's largest producer of opium.  Soon it will have been occupied by foreign militaries for ten years, which followed years of Taliban rule, which followed years of civil war, which followed years of Soviet military occupation.  Widespread corruption mutes hopes for the immediate future.  The death of Osama bin Laden further clouds future American involvement in the country.  Gathered here in our monthly collection of photographs from Afghanistan are images of the U.S. military mission, the toll of violence on civilians, and daily life in the country of just under 30 million. -- Lane Turner

        <title>You Think Pitching Your Startup Idea Is Hard? Watch These Kids Do It</title>

            Around eighty entrepreneur hopefuls gathered at NASA AMES last week to pitch their ideas for breakthrough technological products, with the hopes of gaining the funding to make their dreams a reality. But this wasn't part of the application process for a new fangled startup accelerator program, and the teams weren't comprised of Valley visionairies in their 20s and 30s but rather high school kids between the ages of 14-18.

To compete in the Conrad Foundation's Spirit of Innovation Awards, each team of high schoolers had to create a business plan, technical report, graphical representation and elevator pitch for their product, presenting their invention to a panel of judges for 10 minutes. All in all 27 finalists competed in the Aerospace, Clean Energy and Cyber security categories to win $5,000 and the community support and mentorship to develop their product commercially.
