        <title>Apple Is Tracking You To Build Something Very Valuable: Its Location Database</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple Is Tracking You To Build Something Very Valuable: Its Location Database http://tcrn.ch/hJik2U by @erickschonfeld
            Your iPhone tracks you everywhere you go, and so do most phones these days.  You knew that already.  The reason this is a big story now is because it turns out that for the past 10 months Apple has been keeping your location data on a file in your iPhone itself where someone who knows how to get it, and has possession of your phone, could find it and figure out where you've been.  For most people this is never going to be an issue, but for anyone involved in a lawsuit or nasty divorce, it is one more thing lawyers will be getting a subpoena for.   It's bad data retention policy and Apple could and should change it with the next update to iOS.

But what is Apple doing with your location data anyway?  It needs your data to build its own locations database for use with geo-location apps and for diagnostics (it helps analyze where dropped calls happen the most, for instance).  Apple already explained all of this back in July, 2010 when general counsel Bruce Sewell responded to questions from Congress about its location-tracking policies (letter embedded below).  In that letter, Apple revealed that it had replaced the location databases it was using previously from Google and SkyHook Wireless with its own.  Apple noted in the letter:

            This story of how the iPhone and iPad are tracking the every movement of their users keeps growing. Now DC Policymakers Ed Markey and Al Franken have gotten into the act, calling on Steve Jobs for an answer to this potentially massively embarrassing story.

While I haven't had the opportunity to chat today with Steve about the situation, I did talk earlier to Robert Vamosi, a cybersleuth at Mocana and the author of the excellent new book When Gadgets Betray Us. And what Vamosi told me was pretty scary.  According to him, it's not just Apple gadgets that are betraying us.

            The newest winner in the "there's an app for that" sweepstakes has to go to the DASH, which is the heart of a system that allows surgeons to make it easier to do hip and knee replacement surgery using an iPod touch. This medical system developed by Smith & Nephew along with Brainlab, has allowed doctors at the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai to effectively perform three knee replacement surgeries.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[AWS is down: Why the sky is falling http://post.ly/1vhSU
            Amazon Web Services, "the cloud" to many people, has had a significant issue in one of their datacenters since about 1AM Pacific time April 21st.  Some huge websites (reddit, quora, foursquare) are all down or significantly impacted.

            We've all got iPhone mania in the Valley, never mind that Apple tracks our every move and won't explain why or that AT&T users can't actually make calls.

But in Asia-- and much of the rest of the developing world-- the anticipated mobile giant is Android. Android phones are just starting to hit Japan and China, and a flood of cheap new models are expected to come on the market within the next year. Expect a flood of new apps to follow that, particularly in China where venture capital is flowing like water.

The rise of Android is as close to a no-brainer prediction as you can make with always volatile and uncertain emerging markets. Combine the market size of countries like Japan, China, Indonesia and India with cheap, increasingly-sophisticated devices and a massive base of gamemakers and hackers and someone is going to make a lot of money.

            As we reported in February, betaworks and the New York Times are collaborating to launch a socialnews reader for the iPad called News.me. And we heard more details on the app as it readied for launch this week. Today, Betaworks founder and CEO John Borthwick announced that the iPad app is finally live on the App Store for your viewing and browsing pleasure (link). 

News.me, which has been in development since last August, is a social news reading iPad app that presents the news that the people you follow on Twitter are reading, and filters it based on how many times those stories are shared and clicked on overall.

        <title>Bnter Brings Conversation Sharing App To Android Phones, Launches Bookmarklet</title>

            We're big fans of Bnter, an app that allows you to share your conversations with others publicly. The same way you share photos via the web or your mobile phone, Bnter allows you to share snippets of conversations you have with friends on the web. While the startup initially focused on SMS, Bnter recently broadened its scope to allow users to share any sort of conversation, including GChat, in-person chat, email and more. Today, Bnter is launching a free Android app (which joins an existing iPhone app) and is launching a bookmarklet, and in-depth Twitter integration

The Android app (which works on OS 2.1 or higher) is similar in functionality to its iPhone cousin and the web app, and allows you to read your feed of conversations and people you are following, comment, search and add conversations. And because it is a mobile app, Bnter for Android can pull your text message stream into the app so posting is fairly easy.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[RT CSS3 vs. CSS: A Speed Benchmark http://dlvr.it/PFVHG
            I wonder how much time and money could be saved by serving a CSS3 border-radius sign-up button on a website with as much traffic as Twitter’s
