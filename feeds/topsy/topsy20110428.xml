            Facebook has removed the Ars Technica Facebook page for alleged infringement, but gave us no warning, no explanation, and no clear way to resolve the issue. Why is Facebook playing judge, jury, and executioner all in one fell swoop?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[(Fly Or Die) Can TweetDeck&#39;s New iPhone App Survive A Twitter Acquisition http://tcrn.ch/mzqTmp by @erickschonfeld
            TweetDeck's new iPhone app came out a couple days ago.  It is completely redesigned from the ground up and looks more like it's Android cousin  than the first TweetDeck for iPhone.  Instead of cramming as much as possible into an iPhone screen, TweetDeck stripped everything out but the essentials.  The result is a spare mobile stream reader that packs a lot of punch.  We take a look at the new TweetDeck for IPhone in this episode of Fly or Die, along with Soundtracking, and Zapd.  As usual, the CEO behind one of these products appears as a surprise guest during the show. 

With Twitter rumored to be negotiating a $50 million acquisition of TweetDeck to keep it out of the hands of Bill Gross' UberMedia, it is not clear whether this brand new product will survive such a deal.  After all, Twitter has its own iPhone client, among others.  It doesn't need two.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is Trump Right? How Did This President Get Into Ivy League Schools? (read to end) - DayRiffer http://t.co/34V79lD via @dayriffer
            - "The dean looked over Barack's transcript and college boards and then suggested in a kindly way that he apply to some less competitive colleges in addition to Columbia."

 - "There were no class rankings at his high school, but Barack never made honor roll even one term, unlike 110 boys in his class."

 - "His SAT scores were 566 for the verbal part and 640 for math. Those were far below the median scores for students admitted to his class at Columbia: 668 verbal and 718 math."

 - "At Columbia, Barack Obama distinguished himself primarily as a hard partier, and he managed to be detained by police twice during his university years: once for stealing a Christmas wreath as a fraternity prank and once for trying to tear down the goalposts during a football game at Princeton."

 - "Obama's transcript at Columbia shows that he was a solid C student. Although a history major, he sampled widely in the social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving some of his best grades (the equivalent of a B+) in philosophy and anthropology. The transcript indicates that in Obama's freshman year, the only year for which rankings were available, he was in the twenty-first percentile of his class—meaning that four-fifths of the students were above him. Yet at the same time that he was earning Cs at Columbia, Obama displayed a formidable intelligence in another way. At his induction into the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity, he and others were asked to name all fifty-four pledges in the room. Most were were able to name only five or six. When it was Obama's turn, he named every single one. Later he rose to become president of DKE, and he was also tapped into Skull and Bones, an elite secret society to which his father had also belonged."

And then he somehow got into Harvard for graduate school.

Oh, wait.

My bad.

I made a mistake.

Please replace the reference to "high school" with "Andover."

Please replace "Columbia" with "Yale."

Please replace "Barack Obama" with "George W. Bush."

Thanks.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[It&#39;s Face Time: Google Talk For Android Phones Gets Video Chat Support http://tcrn.ch/lI47Oz by @jasonkincaid
            If you're on an Android device, you may know that there are already plenty of ways to conduct video and voice calls using various third party applications (Qik, Fring, etc.). But that functionality has never been included with stock builds of Android (at least, not for phones), the way Apple's FaceTime has been integrated into iOS for the last year. Today, that's starting to change.

Google is currently rolling out an update to Nexus S devices that adds voice and video chat to Google Talk, which is included as part of the core set of Google applications that come pre-installed on many Android devices. The feature will work on both Wi-Fi and 3G/4G wireless networks, and allows calls between phones, tablets, and any computer with Gmail and Google Talk enabled. 

The update is gradually rolling out over the air (a process that usually takes a couple weeks), and it also includes numerous bug fixes. The Nexus One will be getting an update as well, but it won't include the video chat support (it doesn't have a front-facing camera, though it would have been nice to have a voice-only feature for VoIP calls).

        <title>Spotify Lands Major Studio Deals, Prepares To Launch Movie Service</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Spotify Lands Major Studio Deals, Prepares To Launch Movie Service http://tcrn.ch/iD9Omt by @arrington
            Spotify continues to negotiate with Facebook over its long promised U.S. launch. But that isn't the only thing the music streaming service has been up to. They've negotiated a number of deals with major movie studios to offer users streaming movies as well as music, a source in the industry tells us.

Earlier this week we reported that YouTube plans a similar service (something we first wrote about last year). As with Google/YouTube, we're not sure when Spotify will launch the new service. But our best information suggests this Fall. 

And these aren't your standard Netflix/Amazon/iTunes type movie deals, either, we've heard. Spotify is aiming to offer users much earlier access to movies. Similar to the release dates that hotel's get for premium in-room movies. They're expensive, but users can often see them just a couple of weeks after they've been in theaters.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Final Shoe Drops: Apple Now More Profitable Than Microsoft Too http://tcrn.ch/kdU8wm by @parislemon
            Just about a year ago, when Apple passed Microsoft in market cap, the Redmond loyalists were out in full force: that means nothing — look at the revenues! When Apple passed Microsoft in revenues last October, it was: who cares — look at the profits! We were looking, and we projected that this quarter just ended would be the one in which Apple passed Microsoft in that regard too.
Sure enough, they have. Easily.

Microsoft has just announced their Q3 2011 results. The numbers appear to be good, beating analysts' expectations. But with net income now at $5.23 billion, Microsoft now comes in well behind Apple, which had a net income of $5.99 billion last quarter.

            Microsoft just reported its third quarter 2011 earnings today with revenues of $16.43 billion, an increase of 13% from the same period of 2010. Microsoft’s operating income was $5.71 billion, its net income was $5.23 billion and its diluted earnings per share were at $0.61, a 36% increase.

With this report Microsoft beat Wall Street analyst expectations which were at 56 cents per share on $16.19 billion in revenue.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Accel Invests $35M. in 99designs...After Years of Trying http://tcrn.ch/iskeO5 by @sarahcuda
            Accel Partners has invested $35 million in the crowdsource design service 99designs-- a monster of a series A. Of course, 99designs is not your average early-stage startup. Born in Melbourne, Australia out of an older company called sitepoint.com, 99designs is bootstrapped, profitable and growing revenues at a rate of about 120% a year.

A few strategic angel investors also participated including Michael Dearing, Stewart Butterfield, Dave Goldberg and Anthony Casalena. Accel's Andrew Braccia and Ryan Sweeney will join the board along with Dearing.

The growth helps explain why Braccia has been courting this deal since 2009. And he wasn't alone. 99designs CEO Patrick Llewellyn says several VCs have been pinging the company, and until now, they've all been turned away. They all seem to find out about the company the same way: One of their portfolio companies uses the service to get a good, cheap logo.

        <title>The AOL-TechCrunch Investing Controversy | Kara Swisher | BoomTown | AllThingsD</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Godspeed on That Investing Thing, Yertle–But I Still Have Some Questions for Your Boss, Arianna http://t.co/1kvbU4t
            Would it surprise you to know that BoomTown doesn't really care anymore if TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington sidelines as a blogger while he makes investments in tech companies his tech news site covers? Especially after reading his post yesterday that made a good argument about who he is and, frankly, who he has always been. But that does not mean his boss, AOL content head Arianna Huffington, doesn't have some 'splainin' to do.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Investors Don&#39;t Just Like Likealittle A Little, They Like A Lot http://tcrn.ch/ihrLyJ by @parislemon
            Anytime there's a startup that has been quietly catching fire, you can always find a trail of investors warming themselves by the flames. Take LikeALittle, for example. Though they've kept it quiet, we've now confirmed with multiple sources that they raised $1 million from Andreessen Horowitz and others at some point earlier this year.

And it makes sense. LikeALittle first popped on our radar back in December of last year while we were looking into a Hacker News thread claiming that one of the Y Combinator Winter '11 startups had done 20 million pageviews in six weeks — and was growing by over 1 million pageviews a day. That startup, of course, was Likealittle, a social network for flirting started by former Googlers and Microsofties, Evan Reas, Prasanna Sankaranarayanan and Shubham Mittal.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyone Can Take Down Facebook Pages with a Fake Email Address http://rww.to/kXANwJ
            Something strange has been happening to several popular Facebook pages in recent weeks: they've disappeared. According to the affected page owners, they're victims of bogus DMCA claims. The DMCA, or Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is a piece of (arguably broken) legislation which allows copyright owners to protect their copyrighted works from infringement. Over the years, it's been used to remove content from Google's search index, from YouTube and Yahoo Video, and by entities like Major League Baseball, record labels, doctors who don't like bad reviews, software companies, and many, many others, in opposition to what most would claim is "fair use"...

            Over 200 are dead after over a hundred separate tornadoes left a trail of destruction across five states in the American South.  The nation appears headed for a record number of tornadoes this year.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been mobilized to deal with the aftermath.  Tornado watches were issued for the entire East Coast as the storm system that caused the destruction yesterday moved to new ground.

Shortly thereafter, the iPhone and Android apps hit and it was off to the races. Today it's time for the 2.0 launch which brings a couple new big features: tweets and news. The

            Yesterday we compared the recent launch of new photo and video sharing app Color to the arrival of Twitter five years ago. Like Twitter, Color is an innovative app that has intrigued early adopters and has the potential to catch on in a big way. It's also popularizing a new buzzword: proximity. Yesterday we looked at an early use case for Color: photo sharing at the premiere of a new Hollywood movie called 'Water for Elephants.' However, it wasn't clear what value the users of Color at that event got from the app. So we asked the company for more...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Kickstarter, Two Years And 20,000 Projects Later: $53 Million Pledged, $40 Million Collected http://tcrn.ch/laFYuz by @erickschonfeld
            Two years ago, crowd-funding phenom Kickstarter launched with a handful of projects. Anyone with an idea for a film, album, art project, or product could make their pitch, say how much they needed to get started, and ask for pledges. Once the minimum amount needed was pledged, the project would get started. Today is Kickstarter's birthday, and it is releasing some stats.

Over the past two years, $53 million has been pledged for 20,371 projects. Of that money, $40 million has been collected, going towards 7,496 successful projects (meaning they raised enough money to get off the ground). Over the same time period, 9,700 projects were unsuccessful  and 3,175 are still live.

That means Kickstarter projects overall have a 43 percent success rate, and 85 percent of money that is pledged ends up being collected.  The money pledged on Kickstarter is growing steeply (see chart).  In March, $7 million was pledged, up from about $5 million in February, and $4 million in January.  April will be even bigger.

            Our Choice will change the way we read books. And quite possibly change the world. In this interactive app, Al Gore surveys the causes of global warming and presents groundbreaking insights and solutions already under study and underway that can help stop the unfolding disaster of global warming. Our Choice melds the vice president's narrative with photography, interactive graphics, animations, and more than an hour of engrossing documentary footage. A new, groundbreaking multi-touch interface allows you to experience that content seamlessly.

            Silicon Valley startup Cooliris demoed the next version of its social communication and media sharing app LiveShare to me earlier this week, and I was blown away by exactly how instant the sharing of photos, videos and whatnot has become. The tool, which isn't available yet, is shown in a demo video (embedded below).

Cooliris LiveShare lets you share photos, videos, maps, articles and more with others by the tap of a button or simply by dragging content to a stream or group of people. As you can tell from the video, the sharing itself is as real-time as real-time can get.
