            Foursquare has been grown to almost 10 million users by connecting them in the present tense to their location. But the company sees a much brighter future in focusing on the future movements of its users, said Dennis Crowley, who spoke at the Where 2.0 conference.

            Perhaps the most powerful phone on the market, the G2x is certainly impressive technically, but physically it's uninspiring, and a lack of compelling HD and gaming content compatible with Android makes its greatest assets (large screen and powerful processor) underwhelming. And where's my Gingerbread?

Read on for our full review.

            Over the last 3 months (December 26th, 2010 - March 26th, 2011), Apple pulled in a grand total of 24.6 billion dollars. Now, what percentage of that do you think is from the iPhone? 10%? 25%?

Get this: 50%. Yep. According to Apple's latest earning report, an entire half of Apple's quarterly revenue is coming in from the iPhone and iPhone-related products.

            With the Internet has come a new breed of worker: the telecommuter. A business owner, employee, or freelancer, someone who telecommutes is able to work from home rather than from a designated office building. According to the latest American Community survey data, about 2% of Americans - some 2.8 million people - say that their home is their primary place of work But to say that the telecommuter only or always works at home doesn't quite paint the full picture. An estimated 20 to 30 million people work from home at least one day a week. And with the rise...

            A log file on your 3G-enabled iPhone or iPad shows nearly every place you've been worldwide, whether you were using GPS or not. Ars explores the implications of this very disturbing discovery that tracking data generally revealed only by court order is available to anyone with the right tools.

            Obama spent a considerable amount of time preaching to the choir at today's Facebook townhall event, first bringing up Intel founder and Hungarian immigrant Andy Grove as an example of the kind of immigrant the US should be focused on retaining, in a response to a question about Immigration Reform and the Dream Act Education.

            Thanks to CSI and every action movie ever using it as a plot device, everyone knows that cell phones make you easier to track. Between cell tower triangulation and remote GPS pinging services, you're trackable to the nth degree as soon as your shiny new smartphone slips into your pocket.

But here's a twist: what if your phone not only kept a record of where you are, but also where you've been? According to research announced today, that's exactly what the iPhone has been doing for months.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cuba looks back - and forward http://bit.ly/eLrAOL #photography
            Cuba this week concluded two events, one looking back, and one - ostensibly - looking forward.  The 50-year anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion was observed with parades and speeches.  Victory in the three-day war against a covert US operation to overthrow Fidel Castro, the then-new leader of revolutionary Cuba, is celebrated every year.  But 50 years on, a stagnant economy and calls for political reform from a younger generation were an undercurrent during the first party congress in 14 years.  What real change will come, and when, remains to be seen.  Collected here are some archival images from the invasion, scenes from the congress and political process, and daily life on the island.

            Hundreds of Libyans are reported killed in clashes between rebel forces and the Libyan army in the city of Misurata - a conflict that international press is working hard to keep in the light of international attention. Today news has emerged that one member of the press has lost his life in the conflict. Tim Hetherington, taking photos for Getty, was among a group of press struck by fire from Libyan forces. Two of Hetherington's colleagues are in grave condition. Why are we writing about this tragic event on a technology blog? Because I thought it was notable that...

            There are a lot of things that go into operating a successful business. But, when it's all said and done, the thing that really matters most is building relationships. Sure, your customers are concerned about price, quality, service, etc., but the most successful businesses are those that work to create some kind of strong rapport with both their customers and potential customers alike.

            It is difficult to understate what a run Apple is on right now.  Look no further than the  blowout earnings Apple reported today for its second fiscal quarter ended in March.  Revenues were up revenues up 83 percent to $24.7 billion, and profits grew even faster, up 95 percent to $6 billion.  Growth was strong across the board (with the exception of iPad sales which suffered from supply constraints and built up

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Charlie Rose Comes Back To Disrupt NYC With Ron Conway, Roelof Botha, And Arianna Huffington http://tcrn.ch/fuw3PJ by @elinblesener
            At last year's NYC Disrupt, we had a star-studded lineup. Ron Conway, Tim Armstrong, Carol Bartz, Jack Dorsey, Dennis Crowley, Yuri Milner, and Sean Parker, just to name a few. This year promises another awesome cast of speakers, and we can't wait to tell you who will be there. Beginning today, we will announce new guests each week until we name them all.

For starters, Charlie Rose, who interviewed legendary VC John Doerr last year, will be back.  Nobody gets big-name subjects to open up like Rose.  Disrupt in New York City wouldn't be the same without him.  We are also ecstatic to welcome back super angel investor Ron Conway of SV Angel and super VC Roelof Botha of Sequoia Capital.  Both are in the business of finding and funding the most disruptive startups out there, which is what the conference is all about.  And joining us this year for the first time will be our own Arianna Huffington, who knows a thing or two about shaking up staid industries.

That's not all we are excited to announce today. Disrupt NYC is so big this year, we have taken over a whole Pier in New York City.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[From Check-Ins To Recommendations: A Glimpse Into The Future of Foursquare http://tcrn.ch/g05U3U by @ripemp
            Today, at the Where 2.0 Conference in Santa Clara, man-about-town Robert Scoble spoke with Foursquare Co-founder Dennis Crowley about future plans for the hot location-based service. According to Crowley, the future of Foursquare is going to focus squarely on what its users are going to do, not what they are doing. See what I did there? It's all well and good to track the realtime movements of its more than 8 million users, but the startup wants to make use of the loads of data it's collected on these realtime movements (600 million check-ins) to help users plan what they should do next.

            It's that special time of the season, when Apple fans and investors alike get to gloat over just how much money the tech giant in Cupertino is raking in: Quarterly Earnings. The company had a blockbuster Q1 — will it be able to continue its winning streak?

Apple just pushed its press release detailing the stats for this quarter. It reports $24.67B in revenue and $6.40 EPS, beating the street   consensus  of an Earnings Per Share of $5.36 on $23.34 billion in sales. Apple's (typically conservative) guidance was $22.00 billion in sales and a $4.90 EPS.

            Having survived many dangerous photographic missions in his life, as well as repeated trips to the lethal Restrepo outpost in Afghanistan--now abandoned by U.S. military--where he shot Oscar-nominated doc Restrepo with co-director Sebastian Junger, British photojournalist and Vanity contributor Tim Hetherington, 41, has reportedly died during fighting in Misrata between Muammar Gaddafi's soldiers and Libyan rebels, along with photographer Chris Hondros.   Photographer Andre Liohn wrote from Misrata on his Facebook page: Sad news Tim Hetherington died in Misrata now when covering the front line. Chris Hondros is in a serious status. Michel Brown and Guy are wounded but fine. He later writes that this news is confirmed, that he is 'at the hospital now.' The BBC can confirm 'one western journalist has been killed and three injured a mortar attack' during heavy fighting in Misrata.  Vanity Fair is monitoring the situation and writes that Hetherington's status is 'uncertain' and provides links to some of his portfolios and articles.  Hetherington's last tweet read:, Thompson on Hollywood

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Of Reggae Roads and Blood Diamonds: The Dawn of Tech in Liberia and Sierra Leone http://tcrn.ch/ed71ii
            Earlier this month, I traveled with a bevvy of women in tech (including former Etsy CEO Maria Thomas and Twitter's Jessica Verilli) through the capital cities and upcountry stretches of Liberia (pop. 4M) and Sierra Leone (pop. 6M) , two small countries pressed together along the Western coast of Africa.

We were all part of the Women's Technology Delegation, an unusual State Department mission formed to understand how technology can play a role in alleviating poverty, bridging the gender gap, and keeping the peace in two of the world's most fragile nations.

Below are some highlights and interesting stats from our interviews with Liberia and Sierra Leone's political and business leaders.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Socialcam 2.0 Lands on The iPhone http://tcrn.ch/dXkKxN by @jasonkincaid
            Back in Feburary we took an in-depth look at Socialcam, the mobile video app for iPhone and Android that was built by Justin.tv. The app is easiest to describe as an 'Instagram for video' — fire it up and you'll see a stream of videos recently recorded by your friends. And when you record a video, it's very easy to quickly tag your friends using Facebook Connect.

Since launching in March (just in time for SXSW), the app has racked up over 250,000 downloads in its first month, 75% of which were on iOS devices. And today they're launching an update to the app (iPhone only for now, with Android's update coming) that makes some nice tweaks. I sat down with Justin.tv CEO Michael Seibel and President Justin Kan, who walked me through some of changes. You can download the update right here.

        <title>X PRIZE Visioneering and The Mother of All Business Plan Competitions</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[X PRIZE Visioneering and The Mother of All Business Plan Competitions http://tcrn.ch/etbjPE by @vwadhwa
            I’ve participated in dozens of business plan competitions over the years.  I concluded that they are a lot fun, but that they do little more than educating students on the fundamentals of starting a business.  They create a lot of heat and light but hardly any motion.  There are few competitions winners who have made it big.

I spent the weekend, however, participating in a competition that was really different and that promises to change the world.  There were so many great ideas that emerged from this that judges said they would fund some of the losers themselves.  This was at the X PRIZE Visioneering Workshop, in Beverly Hills, CA.  The participants weren’t MBA students; they were a hundred of the greatest engineers, scientists, and thinkers in the world.  Many had already built billion-dollar businesses.  The attendees included Eric Schmidt (Google), Dean Kamen (Segway inventor), Ratan Tata (Tata Group), Simon Worden (NASA), Aneesh Chopra (U.S. CTO), and Carl Bass (Autodesk)—and some entertainment-industry celebrities such as James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic), Will I Am (Black Eyed Peas), Jim Gianopulos (Fox Studios), and Ali Velshi (CNN).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[How PayPal Can Help Where Close The Loop From Mobile Intent To Purchase http://tcrn.ch/hzplM2 by @erickschonfeld
            Why is eBay buying Where.com?  It's all about trying to link mobile ads directly to payments.  Where will fall under PayPal.  The geo-location service and mobile advertising company already has millions of active users across many mobile platforms (it is stronger on Android than on the iPhone).  Where serves up both recommendations for nearby places to places to eat, drink, play, or shop and geo-targeted ads.  Its WhereAds run across more than 350 mobile apps and publishers, and reach 50 million people with 3 billion impressions a month.

A few months ago, I had a pretty in-depth conversation with Where CEO Walter Doyle.  He hinted at the direction he wanted to take Where.
