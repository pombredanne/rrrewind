            Members of the House of Representatives considerably outperform the stock market in their personal investments, according to a new academic study. Four university researchers examined 16,000 common stock transactions made by approximately 300 House representatives from 1985 to 2001, and found what they call "significant positive abnormal returns," with portfolios based on congressional  trades beating the market by about 6 percent annually.

            Zynga is poised to file for its initial public offering, according to sources close to the situation, as early as this week, or next week at the latest. The San Francisco-based online gaming company's valuation in its last round of funding was $10 billion, but it is likely to price itself higher in an offering, given the recent series of strong IPOs for Internet companies.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Kohort Is Group Management Done Simple, Yet Robust http://tcrn.ch/lAjjQ9 by @parislemon
            Groups are all the rage right now. Facebook is focusing on them. Google is thought to be focusing on them. GroupMe, Beluga, etc. The fact that so many companies are focusing on them shows a common belief that they're extremely important. Kohort, a new service launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, believes this as well. They just believe that everyone else has failed at them so far.

One reason is that Kohort believes the grouping features for most of these services are tacked-on. With Kohort, it's the central feature. And it goes deep.

            CatchFree is making its formal debut at Disrupt today with the unveiling of a social platform that allows people to discover and sharing the best free(mium) software and services online. The startup just raised $5.5 million in funding from top notch investors such as Index Ventures, First Round Capital, True Ventures, Polaris and 500 Startups.

Combining the power of social networking with freemium, the CatchFree platform wants to make it easier for people to find and share great freemium services by linking them together, enabling each service to draw off the growth experienced by other freemium products.

        <title>Tracks Is Sort Of Like Color For Normal People</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tracks Is Sort Of Like Color For Normal People http://tcrn.ch/j95aih by @parislemon
            Of all the things written about the heavily funded Color, there is no denying that it's confusing to a lot of people, at least at first. Updates have helped this a bit, but the app relies so much on technology in the background, that it almost seems as if you're doing something wrong when you're using it. Tracks, a new app launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, offers similar photo clusters done on the fly. But it's much, much easier to understand.

The examples the team gives for uses range from a pub crawl with friends to a family vacation. You and the people with you (who have to be explicitly invited into a group, rather than Color's automatic method) create picture albums on the fly. These are called Tracks. And these tracks are then viewable both in the app and on the web in a beautiful, optimized experience.

            InvoiceASAP, which launched at TechCrunch Disrupt today, is a cloud-based invoice app that allows you to easily create and send professional invoices, estimates, sales orders and receipts. The app provides easy-to-use menus on your mobile phone, and swiftly guides the user through the setup and invoicing process, making your device a powerful tool for business management. 

InvoiceASAP is all about taking its service mobile, but offering the full suite of services a Web app would provide as well. So, the startup provides invoicing that integrates with accounting software, so that a user's invoices, estimates, sales orders and receipts can all sync with accounting. You or your sales team can add new accounts from the field that are simultaneously created in accounting as well.

            Digital piracy. It's an illicit activity undertaken by college students in their dorm rooms or by teenagers in their parents' basements, right? Wrong, according to a recent survey by the British law firm Wiggin. Or wrong when it comes to digital piracy at least. According to the firm's annual Digital Entertainment Survey, one in 8 women over age 35 who owns an e-reader admits to having downloaded an illegal version of an e-book. That compares to just one in 20 women in the same age group who admits to having pirated music....

            A little “I’ll show you mine, if you show me yours” seems to be going down between handset makers Samsung and Apple during their ongoing patent battle, only Apple has become that kid that never ends up showing theirs. In mid-April, Apple filed a lawsuit claiming that Samsung infringed on copyright patents with regards to the design of its products.

            The pitch behind Madbrook Publishing's first product is pretty amazing. It seems like it should for sure be a joke. But it’s not. It’s Everything Butt Art.

No, that’s not a typo. The product is not “Everything But Art”, it’s “Everything Butt Art” — two “t’s”. Butt. As in, the thing you sit on. That’s the basis for the product. And it's launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York.

            Tracking the success and productivity for sales reps can be a challenge for any organization. Foretuit, which launches today at TechCrunch Disrupt, maps sales employees’ business behavior and determines patterns in order to provide predictive outcomes for sales operations.

Foretuit says that the sales process is inefficient because of compliance (sales reps don't actually put data in CRM applications) and reps don't leep data current. Fortuit's application for the Salesforce CRM helps solve this problem.
