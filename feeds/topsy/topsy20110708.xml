        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Rep. Ryan Tastes The Grapes Of Wrath http://t.co/oRjVhVf via @tpm
            Earlier this week, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), a leading voice on shrinking entitlement spending and privatizing Medicare, spent Tuesday evening sipping $350 of wine with two economist friends. He paid for one of the bottles himself after another diner at the posh eatery Bistro Bis scolded the table for consuming the equivalent of a two-income working family's weekly budget in one sitting.

        <title>Google To Buy Mobile Loyalty Card Startup Punchd</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Google To Buy Mobile Loyalty Card Startup Punchd http://tcrn.ch/pz9E3J by @alexia]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google To Buy Mobile Loyalty Card Startup Punchd http://tcrn.ch/pz9E3J by @alexia
            We've just gotten word that that Google plans on acquiring digital loyalty card service Punchd. The team, which consists of developers Reed Morse, Xander Pollock and Niket Desai (and formerly Grantland Chew), will most likely still be working on Punchd within Google according to our source. While our original source pegged the deal at a low seven figures, a second source pegged the acquisition price at more than $10 million.

Punchd, which is basically the digital equivalent of the “Buy 10 Get One Free Card” offered by coffee shops and supermarkets, is part of Dave McClure’s first 500 Startups brood. The acquisition makes complete sense for Google considering how much the NFC and deals space is heating up and the recent Google Wallet announcement.

            Your next job application could require a social media background check. Odds are, you have no clue what that means. Nobody does. It's new and scary and probably scours the Web for pictures of you puking on the beach.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[LinkedIn Surpasses Myspace For U.S. Visitors To Become No. 2 Social Network; Twitter Not Far Be.. http://tcrn.ch/oXxEM6 by @leenarao
            Professional social network Linkedin surpassed Myspace in terms of traffic to become the No. 2 most visited social networking site in the U.S. in June. LinkedIn, which has seen a resurgence of traffic after its IPO in May, reached an all-time high of 33.9 million unique visitors in June compared to Myspace, which saw 33.5 million unique visitors (that's down from 34.9 million in May). Hopefully Myspace's new owners can recharge the troubled social network. 

Twitter posted record U.S. traffic, with June as the first month the site saw over 30 million unique visitors. Twitter.com had 30.6 million unique visitors in June, compared to 27 million unique vistors in May. The increase in traffic is actually a big win for Twitter, which splits traffic between its own mobile clients and the many third-party clients that are used to access the network.

            With Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and countless other options, blogging isn't quite what it used to be. I wanted to know what the future of blogging is so I emailed Twitter's Evan Williams. Here are some of the things he told me.

        <title>Heads Up! TechCrunch Will Look A Little Different Next Week</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Heads Up! TechCrunch Will Look A Little Different Next Week http://tcrn.ch/nwNF6p by @arrington
            Next week we'll be rolling out significant enhancements to TechCrunch. A new design and a new logo will be the first thing you'll notice. But behind the scenes we've made significant changes to the other end of TechCrunch as well - the admin system that we spend all day typing into. We are particularly focused on speed and efficiency. Pages should load much more quickly now than they have, and content should be much easier for our writers to create and publish.

We're also going to fold some of our sister sites into TechCrunch. CrunchGear, MobileCrunch, and TechCrunch IT will all be under the TechCrunch domain. The old URLs will redirect, and readers will be able to see the content from those same writers via filters and topics on TechCrunch. TechCrunch EU, TechCrunch France and TechCrunch Japan will remain separate sites on the TechCrunch.com domain.

This has been a big project. We began last summer before the AOL acquisition. After the acquisition Dave Feldman, Director of Consumer Experience at AOL, took over and brought in additional resources.

            I learned that Johann Hari was a journalist who was better at attention-seeking than truth-telling when a small American journal asked me to reply to his review of What’s Left, a book of mine on the dark forces in liberal-left politics.

            After discontinuing the production of cassette Walkmans last year, Sony is now about to kill another one of their original inventions: the MiniDisc Walkman. And as Japanese business daily The Nikkei is reporting today, Sony plans to pull the plug on the production as early as this September - obviously because nobody is buying MiniDisc Walkmen anymore.

            Google has re-enabled the invitation system for current Google+ users looking to invite friends, so if you have a friend who's made it into Google+, now's the time to ask for that invite. The Google engineers have requested that we avoid mass invites, so we won't be maintaining the Google+ Invite thread. Good luck!
