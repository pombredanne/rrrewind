        <title>Zipments: The Zaarly Of Courier Services Arrives In NYC And Chicago | TechCrunch</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Zipments: The Zaarly Of Courier Services Arrives In NYC And Chicago http://tcrn.ch/pY46ul by @jasonkincaid
            Back in March we wrote about Zaarly, a startup that lets you post an odd job and find someone to complete it for a modest fee. It, and similar services like TaskRabbit, have honed in on a key idea: there are a lot of intelligent, hardworking people who have some spare time and would love to make a few bucks during their off hours. And there are also plenty of people who would love to skip running to the dry cleaners when they have a report due the next morning by 7AM.

Now there's a startup called Zipments that's offering a similar service with a slightly different twist: they're focusing exclusively on courier jobs (or, as they call them, logistics). Need something delivered in a jiffy? Fire up Zipments, set a price, and someone will (hopefully) be ready to deliver it within the hour.

In short, Zipments is looking to create a crowdsourced courier service that lets you send things across town on the cheap. The service has been live in Grand Rapids, Michigan since May, and starting today it's expanding to Chicago and New York City.

        <title>PayPal VP: Supporting Payments In The Physical World Is Critical For PayPal | TechCrunch</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[PayPal VP: Supporting Payments In The Physical World Is Critical For PayPal http://tcrn.ch/p7SAvG by @leenarao
            eBay owned PayPal has been making some interesting acquisitions over the past few months that clearly show the direction of the company in capturing payments flow from digital goods, and physical products at a local level. The company bought local payments and advertising company Where for over $100 million in April, snapped up mobile payments company Fig Card and most recently shelled out $240 million for mobile payments company Zong. The payments company is serious about mobile and local payments and is buying its way into commanding the space. In terms of future strategy, PayPal believes that by 2015 digital currency will be accepted everywhere in the U.S., from local businesses to large chains. 

Of course, this ambitious goal is easier said than done. Considering that PayPal is a digital product and doesn't have automatic reach to local businesses with point of sale systems, scaling to the local level is going to take a significant amount of work. We were able to chat with Sam Shrauger, VP of global product and strategy for PayPal about the company's future strategy to dominate the 'digital wallet.'

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Twitter Ecosystem Is Now One-Million Apps Strong, Launches New Developer Portal http://tcrn.ch/nWrfrM by @leenarao
            Twitter has just published a blog post reporting that the platform is currently supporting one million registered third-party apps, built by more than 750,000 developers around the world. And a new app is registered every 1.5 seconds. Furthermore, since December 2010, more than $500 million has been invested in companies in the Twitter ecosystem companies, and more than a billion dollars has been paid out in acquisitions.

These are impressive stats for Twitter's developer ecosystem, considering that the platform only supported 150,000 apps a year ago. Today, the company is also unveiling a new developer portal, which aims to create a more centralized platform for third-party developers.
