        <title>LinkedIn Is Sending Us Far More Referral Traffic Than Twitter.com Now</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Twitter Who? LinkedIn Is Sending Us Far More Referral Traffic Now http://tcrn.ch/ivWodr by @parislemon]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Twitter Who? LinkedIn Is Sending Us Far More Referral Traffic Now http://tcrn.ch/ivWodr by @parislemon
            If I asked you which of the major social sites you thought sent us the most traffic, you might think it was Twitter. After all, the TechCrunch Twitter account has over 1.7 million followers. When you compare this to the (just under) 250,000 fans our Facebook TechCrunch page has, it should be no contest, right? Wrong.

The truth is that if this were October of last year, you would have been right in thinking that Twitter was our top referrer in terms of social websites. But since that time, Facebook has far surpassed Twitter in terms of traffic coming our way each month. In fact, Facebook.com is now sends nearly double the traffic that Twitter.com does. This is probably due to the fact that last November, we added Elin, our excellent community manager, who curates and engages with people from our feed on Facebook. I also suspect it has to do with the rise of the Like button. Ever since it was released last year, Facebook has been steadily referring more readers our way.

But this info, while interesting, isn't all that surprising. After all, Facebook is by far the largest social network in the world. With over 750 million active users, it still dwarfs Twitter. The really surprising thing is that Twitter isn't even our number two social referrer in terms of websites anymore. As of this month, that distinction goes to LinkedIn. And it's not even close.

            Social news viewing app An update to social news viewing app Flipboard goes live in the app store today, with a new souped up 1.5 version that optimizes the reader experience even further. Earlier this week we had the chance to sit down with Flipboard CEO Mike McCue and did a demo of the new features, above.

McCue tells me that the redesign focused on three core points.

1. People can now navigate to an infinite number of feeds.
2. Navigation through content is much more efficient via a Content Guide.
3. Users can follow their LinkedIn graph through added LinkedIn integration.

        <title>Google Now Lets Website Owners Measure The Power Of +1 (And Any Other Social Widget)</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Now Lets Website Owners Measure The Power Of +1 (And Any Other Social Widget) http://tcrn.ch/lKIm1G by @jasonkincaid
            Back in March, Google officially started rolling out the +1 Button in its search results, allowing users to vote up the pages they found most useful. Two months later, on June 1, it launched a widget that lets website owners integrate the button into their pages, just like they do with Facebook's 'Like' and Twitter's 'Tweet' buttons.

But, err, it wasn't really clear what the point was. People kept clicking the button, but the effect — better search results for our friends — isn't really tangible. And it isn't really clear to site owners how much of an impact the button's having, either.

Today, that changes: Google has just announced that +1 data will be displayed in Google's Webmaster tools, allowing site owners to see exactly how much of an effect +1 is having.

        <title>Yahoo Study Shows Online Video Watching Shifting To Primetime</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Yahoo Study Shows Online Video Watching Shifting To Primetime http://tcrn.ch/iuRSCw by @erickschonfeld]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yahoo Study Shows Online Video Watching Shifting To Primetime http://tcrn.ch/iuRSCw by @erickschonfeld
            A new study by Yahoo (embedded below) shows that online video watching habits are shifting.  People are watching longer videos and watching more at night during primetime.  The chart above shows when people watch videos online.  The blue line is today (2011) and the dotted line is two years ago (2009).  The two lines show more than a 30 percent divergence during primetime.

So what changed? Peak online video viewing today is during prime time, between 6 PM and 9 PM.  Only two years ago, prime time showed the biggest dip in online video viewing as people turned off their computers and turned on their TVs.  But now, more people are streaming TV shows and movies from services like Netflix and Hulu, and they tend to watch those videos during the same time period they previously watched regular TV. While people may not yet be cord cutting, this data suggests that online watching does encroach upon regular cable and satellite TV watching.

            Handling your company’s social presence is far from something to be taken lightly. We’ve seen stories, time and again, about how social media can help to make or break a business, so needless to say that we’re far beyond the point where it needs to start being a concern.

            That didn't take long. Tons of people haven't even gained access to the Google+ field trial yet, but that hasn't stopped Chinese authorities from blocking Google's brand new social networking project, reports Ren Media.

Indeed, Just Ping and the Greatfirewallofchina.org website both confirm that plus.google.com is not accessible from mainland China.

            Team Lifehacker has been playing around with Google+ all morning, and so far the coolest innovation we've seen—particularly from a productivity standpoint—is the Hangout feature, which creates rooms for you to hang out with your friends, coworkers, or any of your social circles. It's great.

            Waiting for a Google Plus invite? Google is rolling out the service in waves and you can expect it to become a ubiquitous social option in the coming months. We have been playing with the service since getting invites yesterday and there are a lot of things to like about Google's new social initiative. Unlike Google's last big invite-only rollout of a social initiative - Google Wave - users will not be confounded on just what the heck you are supposed to with the service when signing up for the first time. From Friendster, Friendfeed, MySpace and Facebook, users are...

            Glastonbury, a festival held at Worthy Farm in England, has become Europe's largest such gathering for music fans.  Its five-day run ended Sunday, after entertaining nearly 175,000 fans. Heavy rain and mud greeted the attendees, who paid 195 pounds (about $310) for a basic ticket compared to the 1 pound when the show began in 1970.  The next festival will take place in 2013.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yelp Brings Local Deals To Mobile And Gives Groupon Now A Run For Its Money http://tcrn.ch/iS0qfq by @erickschonfeld
            The next phase of growth for local deals will be mobile.  Groupon knows this, and so does Yelp, which today is rolling out Yelp Deals to its iPhone and Android apps.  An update to its mobile apps that is getting pushed out today will add a new deals icon to the app.  When you click on it you can see a list of nearby Yelp Deals for discounts at restaurants, spas, and other businesses.  (These are in addition to Yelp Special Offers and Check-In Offers, which already appear on mobile).

With Yelp Deals on mobile, you can search for nearby deals when you are walking around, and they are instantly redeemable.  You get a redemption code that you can show the merchant right from your mobile phone.  This is similar to what Groupon is trying to do with its Groupon Now mobile app, which is only available in a handful of cities (fewer than Yelp Mobile has out of the gate).

            Myspace CEO Mike Jones just sent out this mass internal email and press release confirming the company's sale to Specific Media earlier this morning. Kara Swisher is reporting that the sale was for $35 million.

From what I'm hearing it's been a rocky morning at the social network, which was bought by Newscorp in 2005 for $580 million.

            Replace the Oxford comma with the Yale comma. It's not as prestigious but still gets the job done.
