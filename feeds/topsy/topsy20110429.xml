        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Shed A Tear: The Age of Broadband Caps Begins Monday  http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/att-broadband-caps/
            Come Monday, AT&T will begin restricting more than 16 million broadband users based on the amount of data they use a month. The number-two carrier’s entry into the broadband cap club means that a majority of American broadband users will now be subject to limits on how much they can do online or risk extra charges as ugly as video store late fees.

        <title>Can I Get Some Sustainability With That Shake?</title>

            This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued Energy Star ratings for large vat commercial fryers. These appliances are used by high-volume dining establishments — like fast food chains, institutional cafeterias and full-service restaurants— to make french fries, hush puppies and anything else Paula Deen would promote, in bulk.

Encouraging the industry to upgrade to more energy-efficient fryers could help reduce the overall environmental (if not health) impact of kitchens in the U.S. catering to the collective appetite for fried foods, an appetite that seems pervasive, and permanent here. One Texan cook, Mark Zable, has even invented a method to make deep-fried beer. 

According to a press statement and calculations by the EPA...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey Shares Some Big, Square Numbers: 341,688 Readers Shipped, $137M Total Flow http://tcrn.ch/m8Asb7
            Square founder and CEO Jack Dorsey just tweeted a photo of the company's internal dashboard, and, aside from looking very sexy, it's boasting some impressive numbers. Among them: Square has shipped 341,688 of its card readers to date and has 332,483 activated users.

As Dorsey's tweet points out, Square is also showing some very impressive growth: on March 2, Square was processing $1 million per day. Now, less than two months later, it's doubled that, with $2 million in processed payments today (and there's still some time left on the clock).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Creepiest Royal Wedding Photo Ever, Courtesy Of Color http://tcrn.ch/iUlhVl by @erickschonfeld
            Well, the Royal Wedding is over. Wasn't that wonderful? If you weren't watching on TV, there were about a million ways to participate online. Millions watched on YouTube, Livestream and elsewhere. And even those who were there uploaded their own photos and videos, including this guy.  I'll call him the masked Union Jack freak.  Is that some sort of S&M suit he's wearing?  It doesn't seem proper juxtaposed with the royal newlyweds. 

You can find pictures of him on a special Color Royal Wedding Album created by people using the iPhone social camera app and sponsored by the British paper, The Telegraph.  You remember Color, the $41 million photo app that created a huge backlash in the press and some confusion among consumers about exactly how to use the app.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaking of… sex toys with Ethan Imboden from Jimmyjane [TCTV] http://dlvr.it/Q82nP
            Vibrating sex toys have been around for over a century, starting out as crude steam powered devices and now resembling something very cool that you might pick up at an Apple store. Sex toys have been the source of giggles, controversy, pleasure and up until the last 5 years, were not a mainstream product. They were devices you bought and had shipped in unmarked brown packaging or slipped into a toy store late at night to buy, but were not something you'd ever imagine picking up at Nordstrom or your local Wal-Mart.

Millions of men and women use them every day and yet, it isn't something we talk about much. Considering there's a lot of tech that go into these devices these days, I think it is a topic worth exploring and definitely something we should no longer be ashamed of.

            As we saw from retailer JC Penney's recent downfall in search rankings, using 'black hat' SEO tactics and gaming search is considered deceptive and 'tantamount to cheating' by Google. J.C. Penney said that it had no idea that this was happening and fired its SEM agency right away. But the retailer's search ranking had already been

            A yearlong sting operation, including aliases, a 5 a.m. surprise inspection and surreptitious purchases from an Amish farm in Pennsylvania, culminated in the federal government announcing this week that it has gone to court to stop Rainbow Acres Farm from selling its contraband to willing customers in the Washington area.

            The speakers for Disrupt just keep on getting better and better.  Today, we are extremely excited to announce four more guests who will join us at this year's Disrupt in New York City: Marissa Mayer, David Karp, Kevin Systrom, and Tony Conrad.

Marissa Mayer joined Google in 1999 as Google's first female engineer.  She ran the search product for years and is now the VP of Local & Maps at Google.  Mayer will be one of the finalist judges at the Startup Battlefield.  She's tough, she's done it before, and we are grateful to have her back.

David Karp is the CEO and founder of Tumblr, one of the hottest startups in New York and also one of fastest-growing websites, period.  Tumblr is built on the principle that self-expression should be easy.  Karp recently raised $30 million to keep up with all the growth.

            The Ars Facebook page has made its triumphant return to the Internet, but Facebook has left many questions about its DMCA takedown system unanswered. We have some suggestions for improvement, and are told that Facebook is "considering the results" of its investigation to see how it can make the process less frustrating.

            The speakers for Disrupt just keeps on getting better and better.  Today, we are extremely excited to announce four more guests who will join us at this year's Disrupt in New York City: Marissa Mayer, David Karp, Kevin Systrom, and Tony Conrad.

Marissa Mayer joined Google in 1999 as Google's first female engineer.  She ran the search product for years and is now the VP of Local & Maps at Google.  Mayer will be one of the finalist judges at the Startup Battlefield.  She's tough, she's done it before, and we are grateful to have her back.

David Karp is the CEO and founder of Tumblr, one of the hottest startups in New York and also one of fastest-growing websites, period.  Tumblr is built on the principle that self-expression should be easy.  Karp recently raised $30 million to keep up with all the growth.

            The number of people who have registered accounts on Twitter has now surpassed 200 million a representative of the company said publicly yesterday. Katie Stanton, Twitter's Vice President of International Strategy, said at the Guardian Activate conference in New York that there are now more than 200 million Twitter accounts worldwide and more than 70% of all Twitter's traffic comes from outside the US. That means Stanton's job is very important and whatever her International Strategy is, it seems to be working. Roughly 25% of all tweets come from Japan alone, she said. Twitter said last month that it was...

            Under cool, gray skies billions watched from outside Westminster Abbey and on television worldwide as 1900 invited guests inside witnessed as Prince William and his longtime girlfriend Kate Middleton were married in one of the largest events in London in decades. A little over an hour after they arrived at the Abbey to be married, the couple emerged on a red carpet and onto the streets to a peal of bells and into a horse-drawn carriage, heading toward Buckingham Palace.  The prince had married what the British call a commoner; now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (titles granted by Queen Elizabeth II).  The couple stepped out onto a balcony a short time later to greet the enormous crowd along the Mall - a tradition at royal weddings.  They kissed for the first time in public as a married couple as a cheer went up from the crowd.  -- Paula Nelson

            Just to add more fuel to the conflict of interest fire we have raging over at TC HQ today, TechCrunch Israeli correspondent and Soluto Head of Product Roi Carthy has decided to build a startup. You'd think being a TechCrunch writer would make Carthy shy away from doing something as hackneyed as a Groupon clone, but Carthy's daily deals site has a twist!

            If you're a mainstream Apple fan, you probably got all hot and bothered on Thursday when an e-mail hit your inbox saying the "amazing iPhone 4" is now available in white. Previously the phone only came in black, and tech blogs have been drooling over the possibility of this white whale of a phone for months.

        <title>Over 50 political accounts deleted in Facebook purge | UCL Occupation</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[New post: Over 50 political accounts deleted in Facebook purge http://bit.ly/mPVz0J #solidarity
            There appears to be a political purge of Facebook taking place. Profiles are being deleted without warning or explanation. In the last 12 hours, Facebook has deleted around 50 sites. The UCL Occupation account is still up for the moment, but for how long we don’t know. It may well be that these groups are technically in violation of Facebook’s terms of agreement, but the timing – on the royal wedding and May day weekend – is deeply suspicious. We don’t know for certain, but this purge of online organising groups could be linked to the wider crackdown on protest by authorities in Britain. Either way, it is a scandalous abuse of power by Facebook to arbitrarily destroy online communities built up over many months and years. Ultimately, the anti-cuts movement in the UK will need to start organising through self-hosted, open source platforms to avoid reliance upon the very corporate power structures we are aiming to challenge. In the meantime, we will look into the origins of this and do our best to have these accounts restored. Please join the anti-censorship Facebook page, spread the word and message people in extant groups to warn them. Tell them to get on your email list or Twitter account instead.

Banner Ads. They first started in 1994 and are therefore almost as old as the Web itself. They were very effective back then, with the original ad garnering a 78% click-through rate (CTR)!  I guess from there we had nowhere to go but down.

Nowadays banner ads get on average 0.2% CTR meaning for every 1,000 ads that are served up only 2 people click on them. And as Jon Steinberg of Buzzfeed points out, the CTRs for social media banner ads are just 0.08%.

Holy Shiitake!

Banner ads aren't effective because of a condition known as

            It's not often (well, ever) that I consider the possibility someone might be from the future, but maybe Roger Fiddler was. The Paleofuture blog points to the video below, where Fiddler and his team at Knight-Ridder describe an electronic newspaper running on what might as well be an iPad... way back in 1994.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nokia Siemens Closes $975M Acquisition Of Motorola Solutions&#39; Wireless Network Assets http://tcrn.ch/lKNzoh by @leenarao
            Nokia Siemens has closed the acquisition of the wireless network infrastructure assets of Motorola Solutions today. The company reports that it paid $975 million in cash for the assets and approximately 6900 employees will transfer to Nokia Siemens Network from Motorola. The finalization of the deal come after China regulators approved the acquisition a last week. The full release is paste below. 

As of April 30 2011,  the company says that responsibility for supporting customers of Motorola Solutions’ GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, WiMAX and LTE products and services transfers to Nokia Siemens Networks. Part of the approval is due to the fact that Motorola reached an agreement with Chinese manufacturer Huawei over a pending patent lawsuit relating to the assets being acquired. In January, Huawei filed a lawsuit to prevent Motorola from giving Nokia Siemens  Huawei's IP information.

            Sharing what mobile apps you have in a social network has been tried various ways. Appsfire hit on the idea of socialising apps. 

Zwapp is coming at it from a slightly different angle. Its iPhone app (iTunes link) auto-discovers what apps you have on your iPhone and connects up your contacts, Facebook and Twitter friends. You then follow people who's opinion's you respect when it comes to apps. It even has a live feed where you can see what apps your friends are using and downloading (privacy is now most definitely over it would seem).
