        <title>NYC Disrupt: Back in Hack</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[NYC Disrupt: Back in Hack http://tcrn.ch/lJjfwx
            The TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon is back May 21st and 22nd in NYC. Signup now!

Our goal is to create and expose opportunities for great developers and startups in New York. We want to help grow the burgeoning NYC tech scene by creating the premier hacking event in the Big Apple. The 24 hour Hackathon will happen the weekend before Disrupt at the gigantic Pier 94.

The Hackathon is free. There will be great food, fast wifi and each presenting team will get tickets to the full conference. Teams will be judged by an audience of tech luminaries. Winners will present on Wednesday, May 25th on the Disrupt main stage.  The TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon promises to be one of the best attended hacking events of the year—if you’re a developer/hacker/maker this is a do-not-miss opportunity. Last year, GroupMe was born at the Disrupt Hackathon.  Will another great startup will emerge from this year's pack?  Will it be yours?

            O livro "Triângulo Rosa" traz o relato de um sobrevivente gay de um campo de concentração nazista. Ele diz que até héteros acabavam transando com outros homens. Se você fosse um prisioneiro em um campo nazista, você faria sexo com uma pessoa do mesmo sexo?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[12 uncomfortably sexual company logos.  http://tiny.ly/ocWU
            A logo is the graphic representation of a brand, but for these companies, "graphic" is an understatement. It's actually pretty remarkable how many of these unsubtle innuendos slipped past the companies who approved them. They clearly need to hire more perverts. Speaking of perverts, if you guys see any more of these raunchy corporate emblems out there, send them our way.

            Now that companies offering digital coupons for essentially any consumer product or service you can possibly think of are starting to make up an online industry of their own, it's apparently time for SMB-targeting local deal sites to emerge. The first startup I've come across that will try its hand on a 'Groupon for local business-to-business offers' is NYC-based MarketSharing.

The company may be brand new, but its management team certainly bursts with experience, and the startup has just secured over $1 million from K2 Media and App Fund.

        <title>Facebook, It’s Time For An iPad App</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Facebook, It&#39;s Time For An iPad App http://tcrn.ch/eQt4EN by @parislemon]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook, It&#39;s Time For An iPad App http://tcrn.ch/eQt4EN by @parislemon
            The other day I was browsing through the App Store on my iPad when I noticed something: both the top free and top paid applications for the device were apps for accessing Facebook. And as I kept going down the top apps lists, I kept seeing Facebook apps. In fact, of the top 40 apps (free and paid combined), a full 7 of them were ways to use Facebook on the iPad.

In other words, nearly 20 percent of the top apps being downloaded for the iPad are apps that allow you to use Facebook on the device. And not one of them is actually made by Facebook. Because they refuse to make their own iPad app for some seemingly illogical reason.

Facebook, it's time.

            When the news was leaked last fall that Yahoo was planning on "sunsetting" the bookmarking service Delicious, you could hear the hearts of a million geeks breaking. As ReadWriteWeb co-editor Marshall Kirkpatrick wrote in beautiful requiem to the site, "R.I.P. Delicious. You Were So Beautiful To Me." For its part, Yahoo later clarified that "sunsetting" didn't mean "axing," it meant selling. Today we now know who the buyers are: YouTube founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen....

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Exclusive: Apple CEO Steve Jobs on How the iPhone Does and Doesn’t Use Location Information http://t.co/BECWg6G
            In an interview, Apple's CEO reiterates that Apple hasn't been tracking anyone and that the file that some have assumed was their personal location information was actually a cache of crowdsourced information and not tied to their exact location. Jobs did say the company plans to make some changes to how it handles that data and said the industry needs to do a better job of educating people about the complexities of location-based services.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Go the Fuck to Sleep: a storybook for exhausted parents http://bit.ly/hdW8oo
            Go the Fuck To Sleep is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don't always send a toddler sailing off to dreamland. Honest, profane, and affectionate, Adam Mansbach's verses and Ricardo Cortés' illustrations perfectly capture the familiar--and unspoken--tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night, and open up a conversation about parenting in the process.

            There have been many studies examining the most popular and ideal names for CEOs and professionals. But what's better than examining the actual data from over 100 million professionals from around the globe? Professional social network LinkedIn has done a deep data dive on the top CEO names, and most popular names by industry and country.

LinkedIn contrasted CEOs  with the average LinkedIn professional to find the top names that are over-represented among CEOs. The top CEO names found on the network, in order, are: Peter, Bob, Jack, Bruce, Fred, Deborah, Sally, Debra, Cynthia, and Carolyn. One trend LinkedIn highlights is that the most over-indexed CEO names for males tend to be either short or shortened versions of popular first names. Female CEOs, on the other hand, use their full name to project a more professional image, reports the network.

            1. Why is Apple tracking the location of my iPhone?

Apple is not tracking the location of your iPhone. Apple has never done so and has no plans to ever do so.

We don't know where you take your iPhone. We're not Google evil.
