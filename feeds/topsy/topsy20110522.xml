        <title>May 21 'Judgment Day' Believers React To Being Alive On May 22</title>

            'Judgment Day' came and went on Saturday, and John Ramsey hasn't been able to sleep. The 25-year-old Harrison, N.J. resident had rearranged his life in recent months to devote himself to spreading a fringe California preacher's prediction that May 21 would bring worldwide earthquakes and usher in a five-month period of misery before the world's destruction.

            Here's why I'm glad I was wrong about RSS being dead. The latest evidence of that comes from Jesse Stay who reported a week or so ago that both Facebook and Twitter had discontinued RSS streams or something like that. I really didn't bother to read up on the details since it's now years since I gave up on the stuff. These days I obsess about Lady GaGa and whether Brian Wilson's version of Good Vibrations is better than the one with Mike Love and when Ustream is finally going to stream live to the iPad and why some apps only stream audio over AirPlay and turn the AirPlay icon blue instead of white.

And then Jesse Stay apparently convinced his friends at Facebook to reconsider and reinstate RSS. In so doing, Facebook instantly removed any further conversation about RSS. This includes no further references to the famous Monty Python dead parrot sketch, the Franco is still dead SNL running gag, various tech dead memes (Office, Notes, Windows, links, FriendFeed, Sun, FlipCam, PointCast, the ASP model, laptops, podcasting, TV, email), and all synonyms, most importantly Toast

            Bullying and suicides of gay and lesbian teenagers are in the headlines, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy has been repealed, and the debate over same-sex marriage continues to divide the country. Against this backdrop, many L.G.B.T. youth wonder how accepting society will be.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch The Demos That Pwned The Distrupt Hackathon http://tcrn.ch/mEGyWg by @alexia
            So you think you have what it takes to build a ground breaking app that will change the world? Do you have what it takes to accomplish that in just a little under 24 hours? Starting yesterday, 500 hackers and the like spent 24 hours on Pizza, Pop Chips and Red Bull trying to come up with the next big thing, or at least something that people want. The competition was rough, and the pitch format was brutal, as you had to explain your idea in just under 60 seconds.

Not everyone made the cut, and in the end there could be only four (six if you count the honorable mentions).  So congrats to Gilt-ii, Docracy, Doach, Dispatch IO  and JoystiCC and Venture Crapital who earned honorable mentions. We've posted a montage of the award winning demos above.

            A 5:45 this morning, a man told another man to walk into traffic blindfolded. Using an iPhone app connected to their service, joysti.cc, Jarod Reyes moved Jon Gottfried trough light traffic in what amounted to a real-life game of Frogger. While I often think that we'd be better off if most start-up founders went to play in traffic, I never meant that they had to do it in real life, yet these two actually pulled it off and without killing anyone.

            Former DoubleClick CEO, Kevin Ryan led the company through a period of explosive growth in the late '90's. He took the ad-targeting company from a handful of employees to more than 2,000 in just 4 years before selling to Google for $3 billion.  However, as Ryan discusses in this episode of Founder Stories with Chris Dixon, the dot.com bust threatened to wash it all away.

Ryan says during the downturn,

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet This 14-Year-Old Self Taught Hacker  http://tcrn.ch/jeykhM by @leenarao
            In case you missed it, hackers were busy building new ideas and products at TechCrunch Disrupt's Hackathon in New York last night. Fueled by RedBull, coffee, and massive quantities of junk food, hackers burned the midnight oil last night, preparing to show off their designs to the judges, who included VC Jeff Clavier and Canv.as founder Christopher Poole, and Google VP of Product Bradley Horowitz.  

We had a chance to sit down with the event's youngest hacker; fourteen-year-old Jake Essman. Essman, a New York native, teamed up with fellow engineers Jesse Leone, William Li, and Feliks Beygel to create buyby,  a shopping search engine. BuyBy is fairly simple—you use the site to find where a product is located at a store. So you could search for a 'white t-shirt' and the search engine will not only show you a list of online stores that have that product, but it will also show you stores that sell the product nearby your location.

            As if rising ticket prices and chatterbox patrons weren’t enough, moviegoers in the Boston area are being left in the dark thanks to the regular misuse of the lenses on new digital projection equipment at many of the region’s major theater chains. But almost no one at the theaters or their corporate headquarters is willing to talk about it.

            For over a decade now, you’ve been able to store your music on a server in the cloud and stream it to yourself on computers and even mobile devices – but until now, that was mostly the domain of geeks and folks like me whose job it was to test the stuff.

            It's been a whirlwind twenty-four hours: yesterday, hundreds of talented coders poured into New York City's Pier 94 for a marathon session of coding that ran through the night. At 9:30 AM this morning, they pushed their last lines of code. And beginning at 10:30 AM, each of them took the stage for a rapid-fire series of quick pitches showcasing what they'd built. Now it's time to announce the winners.

The top four teams will each get a chance to show off their app during the third day of TechCrunch Disrupt (there are also two honorable mentions). Congratulations to the winners, and to all of the extremely talented hackers who made it through the night and built some very cool apps.

The Winners

	Taking the Judge's Choice award is Gilt-ii, the ingenious browser bookmarklet that lets you create auctions around Gilt sales. You can see our full overview of this nifty app right here.
