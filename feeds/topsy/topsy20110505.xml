            Earlier today, AOL's Head of AIM Products Jason Shellen sent an email to the entire company urging people not to share its contents with people outside of the company. Even though we're a part of AOL, we didn't get that email. Well, that is until someone was kind enough to leak it to us. Hey, we are not outside of the company so that's fair right? And since we didn't technically get the email, I have no problem sharing it.

Anyway.

AOL is on the verge of launching a

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Calls Out Rivals&#39; Web Benchmark Tools, Rebuilds Them To Better Gauge Chrome http://tcrn.ch/kmOQxY by @parislemon
            When it comes to Chrome, Google has long been addicted to speed. And for many tasks on the web today, that speed is related to how fast your JavaScript engine is. Google has long held that their's is the fastest. But it's hard to know for sure because there are a few different benchmark suites to test such speeds — and the most popular ones are made by companies with stakes in the game: Apple, Mozilla, and yes, Google.

In a post yesterday on their Chromium, it's pretty clear that Google feels their V8 benchmark suite is the best. In fact, they directly call our their rivals' suites, noting bugs and saying that they must evolve. And then they go one step further: providing links to versions of the rivals' suites supposedly perfected by Google!

            Is the man who live-tweeted the bin Laden attack a "citizen journalist?" Some argue that he is not, but the reality is that what we call journalism is being unbundled into its component parts, and anyone can now perform some or all of those functions.

            An early read of the materials seized from Osama bin Laden's compound has not yet produced evidence of a specific, imminent terror plot against the U.S., but does show the group continues to have murderous aspirations and considered a train attack on the anniversary of 9/11, ABC News has learned.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Zin.gl Mines Social Network Data To Help Singles Find Their Perfect Match http://tcrn.ch/m4Ewwo by @robinwauters
            The online dating industry majors rely on a fundamentally broken model, which may be good for their short-term balance sheets and providing people with meaningless entertainment but, as matchmaking service providers, severely limits them in offering people a genuinely optimal way to find that special someone, Zin.gl founder Alexander Dresen told me in a recent meeting.

In that meeting, I was given a preview of the new version of Zin.gl (now live), Dresen's take on the perfect online matchmaking service. Zin.gl was designed not to appeal to masses of users, most of whom sign up for online dating sites only to get disappointed by those services when they fail to find a genuinely good match anyway.

Zin.gl instead aims for quality, not quantity, having developed a way to mine existing social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Foursquare for valuable 'dating information', and then feeding that wealth of data into its 'social matching' systems, all in an effort to connect singles with others when they have common interests, live nearby, and so on.

        <title>Bought Your Child An iPhone? Stalk Them With Footprints</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bought Your Child An iPhone? Stalk Them With Footprints http://tcrn.ch/k8Rzq9 by @roi
            When we think of smartphones and geo-location the two main use cases that come to mind are mapping and check-ins. These are fine and dandy, but what if you could use smartphones to keep tabs of where your child is? Footprints lets you do just that.

The new app (iTunes link), available for both iPhone & iPad, tracks the location of the device and shares it with family and friends. These can then know in real-time a person's exact location. The app can have several use cases, but the parent/child one seems the most compelling.

What about privacy? With more and more parents shelling out the cash to equip their tweens and teenagers with iPhones, I don't see why a basic requirement couldn't be running Footprints in the background. As my father put it when I grew up, our household was run as a totalitarian democracy. Ergo, he buys my iPhone, he gets to run whatever app he likes in the background. Parenting rocks.

            A draft transportation authorization bill includes a proposal to tax automobile drivers based on their mileage. The Obama administration has floated a transportation authorization bill that would require the study and implementation of a plan to tax automobile drivers based on how many miles they drive.

            It’s not surprising that a photo of a terrorist with a bullet hole in his face would turn Sarah Palin on. The way she asks for it to be released though, is an interesting bit of dishonesty.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mobile Ad Network Jumptap Closes $25 Million Funding Round http://tcrn.ch/m4bXRN by @leenarao
            As we reported a month ago, mobile ad network JumpTap has raised a round of new funding. The company confirmed this today, announcing a $25 million financing round from AllianceBernstein, General Catalyst, Redpoint Ventures, Summerhill Ventures, Valhalla Partners and WPP, as well as several new investors, who are not being disclosed. This brings the company's funding to over $90 million.

JumpTap is one of the largest remaining independent mobile advertising networks, in addition to Millennial Media, 4INFO, InMobi and others (another remaining network Greystripe was just acquired).  Jumptap’s data-driven technology promises highly targeted advertising and the company partners with digital and media agencies, publishers, wireless carriers and brand advertisers to serve an array of mobile advertising solutions.

            Twitter struggles with retention of new users and communicating its value to non-early would-be adopters. Few things are as valued as communication between mothers and children, though. Que the Mothers' Day Twitter tape! Twitter just posted a charming video (below) of staff members and others talking about their moms' use of Twitter and a blog post offering some friendly responses to your mom's most likely objections ("I don't have anything to say!"). Allusions are made to how some people are embarrassed when their parents join social networks but the company doesn't make the two most important argument: unlike Facebook, your...

            Today at the Social-Loco conference in San Francisco, Google VP of Product Marisa Mayer announced the newest addition to Google Places and Street View - Google Business Photos.

            Content platform Demand Media reported its first quarter 2011 results today, reporting revenue of $79.5 million, an increase of 48% compared to $53.6 million in Q1 2010, beating analyst expectations of $69.49 million in Q1 revenue.

In a statement, CEO Richard Rosenblatt said: “We reported better-than-expected results in Q1 2011, driven primarily by continued momentum from our owned and operated sites...We also continued to invest in Demand Media’s long-term success, enhancing our consumer offerings through new partnerships with Rachael Ray, Tyra Banks and Getty Images. We believe our publishing platform is the most comprehensive and effective of any online publisher and our focus on delivering relevant, valuable content that makes consumers’ lives better will continue to drive our success.”

            Is HTC working on an Android-based device designed just for women? That's the scoop the ex-Engadget team has over on their temporary new home, This is My Next. According to their source, the upcoming HTC Bliss, a cross between the HTC Desire S and Desire Z, is being built with the needs of the female demographic in mind, from its "calming" sea green tones to its dangling charms. It even has diet and shopping apps. Oh no....

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Brings Street View Inside Businesses, Unveils Google Earth For Android Tablets http://tcrn.ch/imGxk3 by @jasonkincaid
            Today at Social Loco, Google's Marissa Mayer gave a keynote presentation outlining some of Google's recent advances with its local products. She also unveiled two new features related to Local: a tablet version of Google Earth for Android, and a new extension of Places called Business Photos (which is essentially 'Street View' for business interiors).

Back in March at SXSW, Mayer announced that 40% of Maps usage was coming from mobile phones. Today, she announced that the number is now up to over 50% (she qualified this by saying the stat is for weekends, but it sounds like the weekday trend isn't far behind). Next, Mayer announced that Google has now racked up some 5 million ratings and reviews in its database of Places, thanks in part to its successful (and oddly named) Hotpot project.

The keynote then turned to some product launches. The first is Google Business Photos, which will allow users to explore the interiors of select businesses.

        <title>Confirmed: IGN Buys UGO, Hearst Gets Equity In New Venture That Will Soon Spin Out</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Confirmed: IGN Buys UGO, Hearst Gets Equity In New Venture That Will Soon Spin Out http://p.ost.im/p/7ksga
            News Corp's IGN gaming and entertainment property has just acquired Hearst's gaming and entertainment property UGO, we've confirmed with the company. And yes, the move is step one towards News Corp. spinning out IGN as its own property sometime relatively soon, we're told. This news was first reported by MediaMemo a few days ago as the deal was still being finalized.

I got the chance to talk to IGN President Roy Bahat about the news and he wanted to reiterate that while there's been a lot of talk about News Corp. trying to ditch properties that are underperforming (*cough* MySpace *cough*), this is not the case here. Instead IGN is doing really well, Bahat says, and making money. They will bring in north of $10 million in profit this year, and that number is expected to be significantly higher next year, he says. He also notes that ad revenue is up 30 percent year over year.

            Dogs have been fighting alongside U.S. soldiers for more than 100 years, seeing combat in the Civil War and World War I. But their service was informal; only in 1942 were canines officially inducted into the U.S. Army. Today, they're a central part of U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan -- as of early 2010 the U.S. Army had 2,800 active-duty dogs deployed (the largest canine contingent in the world).
