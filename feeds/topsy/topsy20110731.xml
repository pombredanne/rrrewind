            At the end of last year I was saying that the smartphone boom was a tide that lifted all boats. That is no longer the case.

        <title>Summer Camp? Antisemitic Indoctrination Training Center - Atlas Shrugs</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Summer Camp? Antisemitic Indoctrination Training Center: &quot;Some of my friends tried to stop him by talkin... http://bit.ly/qXsVlO #israel
            "Some of my friends tried to stop him by talking to him. Many people thought that it was a test ... comparing it to how it is to live in Gaza." Eyewitness statement the day of the shooting. (ABC News) The day of the Norway shooting, I was blindsided by one of the survivor's statements to the press immediately after the shooting (see above). It was so outside the box, I thought it was the kneejerk response of an anti-semite in shock. I didn't blog on it because I thought it anecdotal, badly anecdotal. But the more that is revealed about that youth indoctrination center, the more grotesque the whole story becomes. Of course, the genocidal leftists will twist what I write here; I am not condoning the slaughter in Norway or anywhere. I abhor violence (except in regard to self defense). But the jihad-loving media never told us what antisemitic war games they were playing on that island. Utoya Island is a Communist/Socialist campground, and they clearly had a pro-Islamic agenda. Only the malevolent media could use the euphemism summer camp and get away with it. The slaughter was horrific. What these kids were being taught and instructed to do was a different kind of grotesque. There is no justification for Breivik's actions whatsoever. There is also no justification for Norway's antisemitism and demonization of Israel. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE NORWAY LABOR PARTY PALESTINIAN AFFILIATION The Anti-Mullah Labour Youth League summer camp at Utøya got the Labour Party’s young hopefuls a visit by Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store. The Palestinians “must have their own state, the occupation must end, the wall must be demolished and it must happen now,” said the Norwegian Foreign Minister to cheers from the audience. The main activity at the Utoya Island Meeting were mock “Break the Israel blockade” games. One event was Palestinian aide boats would try to break the Israel blockage. The sign says “defeat the blockade” (opphev blokkaden – Gaza) Utoya camp was not Islamist but it WAS something not much more wholesome (by our standards, at any rate). It was a summer indoctrination camp run by Norway’s ruling Labor Party for up-and-coming children of the ruling elite. Glen Beck was not far off when he compared it to the Hitlerjugend or Young Pioneers. It’s so the junior members of the aristocracy can be properly told what to think and can network with each other in preparation for their brilliant careers ruling over the peasants. I saw at least one article that had photos of previous summers with the little dearies and their handlers assembling Israel-bashing displays. We Americans had similar traditions further back in the twentieth-century. The likes of David Horowitz and Ronald Radosh have written of the red-diaper summer camps their parents sent them to. There are still institutions such as the “Midwest Academy” where budding labor activists go get schooled in labor and community organizing over the summer. Not to mention the many religiously-oriented summer camps that have long...
