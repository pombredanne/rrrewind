            Everyone says small startups require focus. Say “no” to anything that distracts from your goal, your vision, your strategy, tempting though it is to explore all opportunities, hoping each time that this is the one that will catapult you from Mixergy listener

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[How to track Social Media within Google Analytics http://tnw.to/17xK1 by @MountainDan
            For all the information and insight Google’s powerful Analytics tools can provide, they’re still only providing some top level figures, primarily Direct, Search and Referral traffic. Think, “Traffic is traffic?” well think again, as more and more marketers and private individuals are drilling deeper to gain a better understanding of what social media actions are resonating well with their communities, and which aren’t.

            Whoops.

Looks like The New York Times has a little embargo breaking situation on their hands. (Which we love — chaos!) They've just put up a story with the URL: http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/latest-rival-to-groupon-livingsocial-facebook-embargo-till-midnight/ (bolding mine). That page is obviously no longer found, but it was live for a bit. And it is a big one: Facebook's Groupon/LivingSocial

        <title>Google Acquires TalkBin, A Feedback Platform For Businesses That’s Only Five Months Old</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Acquires TalkBin, A Feedback Platform For Businesses That&#39;s Only Five Months Old http://tcrn.ch/gZjUZu by @jasonkincaid
            It's been a good day for Y Combinator. Hot on the heels of news that YC portfolio company Wufoo landed a $35 million exit, YC alum TalkBin has just announced that it's been acquired by Google — less than five months after the company was founded.

TalkBin offers a platform that lets customers give immediate feedback to local businesses (users submit their opinions and critiques via mobile applications, and it looks like the businesses can read and respond to them from a web app). TalkBin's homepage shows screenshots of both Android and iOS applications, but I can't find them on either marketplace (I'm not sure if the apps were pulled or if they simply haven't been released yet).

The mostly-stealthy Montain View-based company was founded in December 2010 by Qasar Younis, Michael Ma, and Sunny Dhillon.

        <title>Yammer Finally Works And Makes Work Possible On The iPad</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yammer Finally Works And Makes Work Possible On The iPad http://tcrn.ch/eXynSX by @parislemon
            Our love affair with Yammer is pretty hot and cold. On one hand, they launched at and won TechCrunch50a few years back. And they seem to be kicking ass on the business distribution front. On the other, the apps they put out there (which we use for TechCrunch day-to-day business) are often very buggy and more or less infuriating day in and day out. iPhone, Android, Web, AIR — they all have issues.

But issues are one thing. For the past year or so, I simply have not been able to get Yammer to work on the iPad — at all. It would launch and then crash. I tried this on four different iPads (both the first and second generation). Same result.

Today. Finally. They have released a native iPad app. And it works!

            Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, whose outspoken libertarian views and folksy style made him a cult hero during two previous presidential campaigns, will announce on Tuesday that he's going to try a third time.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Breakthrough in Quantum Computing http://rww.to/feSHCz
            Researchers have made a significant breakthrough on the road to quantum computing. Quantum computing is the use, largely theoretical so far, of quantum mechanical operations to move information. If it works, it will be history-alteringly fast, which explains IBM's five year mission to do just that. But to make it work, engineers will need to make quantum teleportation succeed on a large scale. Quantum teleportation is the instantaneous relocation of coded energy from one place to another. If it sounds as fanciful as a trip to Oz, well, it's funny you should mention it....

            How many apps does it take to recharge a vehicle? Apparently, one is not enough. Several companies offering mobile apps to drivers — to help them find a place to charge up or refuel in an environmentally sustainable way — made product and milestone announcements around Earth Day. Here's the run down. 

ECOtality (NASDAQ: ECTY) — a San Francisco company that's building electric vehicle (EV) technology and infrastructure in the U.S. and China— unveiled its Blink Network mobile app (screenshot, above) to help users find and reserve a nearby, available charging station at the Electric Drive Transportation Association conference in Washington D.C. Reservation and status-update features made ECOtality's app distinct from other charger-finders for about a minute. 

On Monday, however, Coulomb Technologies announced an upgrade to the ChargePoint app, including similar functionality...

            An airborne virus is rapidly turning people into zombies. Two-thirds of humanity has been wiped out. Scientists desperately look for a cure, even as their own brains deteriorate and the disease robs them of what we consider life.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Uploading Files to Google Docs Just Got Easier http://rww.to/gFsUS4
            Last fall, Google Docs users gained the ability to drag and drop files from the desktop to the upload page. Now Google has announced that it will be rolling out a few more features to make that process of uploading any file to Google Docs even easier. The first new feature will help those who tend to upload a lot of documents: Google has added the ability to upload folders, not just individual files. This upload will actually preserve the folder structure, which means that folders within folders will also be uploaded....

        <title>Netflix Earnings Up 88 Percent, Adds 3.6 Million Subscribers</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Netflix Earnings Up 88 Percent, Adds 3.3 Million U.S. Subscribers http://tcrn.ch/haedjj by @erickschonfeld
            Netflix just released its first quarter earnings. Earnings per share were $1.11, up 88 percent (3 cents above the consensus estimate of $1.08). Revenues came in at $719 million. And Netflix added 3.3 million U.S. subscribers in the quarter, plus another 290,000 interantionally, to end at 23.6 million.  The 3.6 million new subscribers is slightly below the 3.7 million analysts were hoping for, but still double the growth from a year ago.  Depending on how many subscribers Comcast reports this quarter, Netflix might surpass it to become the largest entertainment subscription business in the U.S.  Netflix ended the quarter with 22.8 million U.S. subscribers, exactly the same number of subscribers Comcast reported at the end of 2010.

Net income was $60 million, and free cash flow in the quarter was $79, a 55 percent increase from the fourth quarter.  Netflix saw a rise in domestic operating margins to 16 percent, from 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter, largely due to an increase in streaming-only subscribers and price increases on hybrid subscriptions. Margins should fall back to around 14 percent as streaming and marketing costs continue to rise (offset by declines in DVD shipping).

            Over the past year, we've become accustomed to using Facebook's "Like" button for a variety of reasons - to show approval, to agree with a sentiment, to follow a brand and to share content. For this last function, however, the "Like" button can be a bit of a blunt tool when what's really needed is a precision instrument. Today, Facebook announced the "Send" button. By using "Send," Facebook users will be able to share content with specific groups of friends, rather than everyone on their friends list, giving them the precision sharing tool they've needed all along....

        <title>Chernobyl disaster 25th anniversary - The Big Picture - Boston.com</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/04/chernobyl_disaster_25th_annive.html
            On April 26, 1986, reactor number four at the Chernobyl nuclear power facility in what is now Ukraine exploded.  The largest civil nuclear disaster in history led to mass evacuations, and long-term health, agricultural, and economic distress.  The nearby city of Pripyat has been abandoned, and a 19-mile radius "exclusion zone" established where radiation contamination makes continued habitation dangerous.    Collected here are archival pictures of the catastrophe, as well as more recent images of the area.  In addition, two photographers who've made extensive studies of the aftermath have been gracious enough to share their work with us here.  Diana Markosian documented the lives of pensioners Lida and MIkhail Masanovitz, who continue to live in the abandoned ghost town of Redkovka, Ukraine.  Her work is found here in photographs 13 through 16.  Michael Forster Rothbart has produced one of the most extensive records available of life near Chernobyl.  His work is found here in photographs 23 through 29.  Links to the websites of both photographers can be found below.

        <title>Energy in America: EPA Rules Force Shell to Abandon Oil Drilling Plans - FoxNews.com</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[US: Energy in America: Oil Drilling Denial http://fxn.ws/dEXlu3
            Shell Oil Company has announced it must scrap efforts to drill for oil this summer in the Arctic Ocean off the northern coast of Alaska. The decision comes following a ruling by the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board to withhold critical air permits. The move has angered some in Congress and triggered a flurry of legislation aimed at stripping the EPA of its oil drilling oversight.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bike Messengers Pedal Past Bandwidth in Data Race http://t.co/UYBl4Jp
            Digital files, cloud computing and accelerating broadband have long put bike messengers on the endangered species list. But, oddly, technology is also what keeps them around. A central headquarters is now obsolete and profit-sharing employees take turns dispatching and making runs.

        <title>Facebook Launches ‘Send’ Button For More Selective Sharing, Announces 50 Million ‘Groups’</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Facebook Launches &#39;Send&#39; Button For More Selective Sharing, Announces 50 Million &#39;Groups&#39; http://tcrn.ch/ggASd7 by @jasonkincaid]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Launches &#39;Send&#39; Button For More Selective Sharing, Announces 50 Million &#39;Groups&#39; http://tcrn.ch/ggASd7 by @jasonkincaid
            Facebook's increasingly ubiquitous 'Like' button is getting a new friend: the Send button. Click on a webpage that has the Send button integrated, and you'll be prompted to share it with any of your Facebook Groups, your Facebook friends, or any standard email address. In other words, where the Like button is designed to let you quickly share content with all of your Facebook friends, the Send button is for sharing with a subset of them.

Site designers are groaning right now (they have yet another sharing widget to integrate), but it's a logical step for Facebook — there are certainly times when you want to share links with a handful of friends instead of your News Feed, and this gives you one less reason to fire up your non-Facebook email account. 50 sites are launching with the feature.

In addition to the new Send button, Facebook is adding a handful of features to its existing Groups product, which was overhauled last October. First is the introduction of photo albums for Groups.

        <title>Microsoft, Yahoo Vet Starts Clipboard: “Social Media With A Purpose”</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft, Yahoo Vet Starts Clipboard: &quot;Social Media With A Purpose&quot; http://tcrn.ch/faj3HZ by @robinwauters
            This morning, an SEC filing revealed that Gary Flake, a former Overture vet who went on to found both Yahoo Research Labs and Microsoft's Live Labs, raised $1.39 million in funding for a stealthy new startup dubbed Clipboard (I'm not the only one who noticed).

Flake informed me that he wanted to avoid any publicity for now, but since Geekwire already posted on this: Flake is the sole founder of the fledgling Bellevue, Washington-based company, which is apparently building 'social media with a purpose' (which is still vague, admittedly). 

Flake said he wouldn't disclose the names of the investors at this point, as some would like to be kept out of the spotlights, but we've learned that there are a little over a dozen investors involved, ranging from large institutional funds, mid-size seed VCs and angel groups, as well as a few individual investors.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Not Serious About Online Gaming? This Job Offer Suggests Otherwise http://tcrn.ch/fWx8h0 by @robinwauters
            Remember back in July last year when we reported that Google quietly invested $100 million in Zynga in preparation for a new product dubbed Google Games?

They even recruited gaming industry vet Mark DeLoura (formerly of Ubisoft, Sony Computer Entertainment America, Nintendo and others) as developer advocate for game-related products, though he quit after only 4 months on the job (he's now a VP at THQ).

This morning, a job offer surfaced on Google's LinkedIn profile that suggests the search and online advertising juggernaut is finally about to put its stake in the digital games ground.

            Youwho, an Internet startup very much in stealth mode, has secured $5 million in funding, an SEC filing reveals.

We don't know anything about the startup whatsoever at this point, apart from what we were able to piece together from a couple of Internet searches:

- One of the co-founders is Andre Brummer, former SVP Product at MyFamily.com

            SurveyMonkey, the quiet but profitable and fast-growing Web survey company, is buying online forms start-up Wufoo. While the terms of the transaction for the Tampa, Fla.-based Infinity Box--makers of Wufoo--were not disclosed, sources said the price was $35 million in cash and stock.

        <title>Yahoo Moves Fast — Real Fast — To Scoop Up IntoNow For $20 – $30 Million</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yahoo Moves Fast — Real Fast — To Scoop Up IntoNow For $20 - $30 Million http://tcrn.ch/h3QZgK by @parislemon
            This past January, upon seeing a demo of IntoNow, we noted that the media check-in game just changed. Apparently, Yahoo agreed — they've just acquired the company for something in the range of $20 to $30 million, sources with knowledge of the deal tell us.

There are a couple fascinating layers here. First of all, IntoNow launched just 12 weeks ago. That's $0 to $30 million (roughly) in just under three months. Second, Yahoo moved fast — really fast — to get this deal done. And they had to — Facebook and Twitter were interested as well, we hear.

        <title>Another Y Combinator Win: WuFoo Exits For $35 Million, After Raising Only $118,000</title>

            Online forms are not sexy, but every Website that wants to collect information or payments from visitors needs them.  Today, SurveyMonkey acquired online form maker WuFoo to its growing bevy of tools for $35 million in cash and stock.  I've confirmed the price with a source. 

What's really great about this story is that WuFoo is another Y Combinator win.  The startup launched way back in 2006 with only $118,000 in angel money (Paul Bucheit, who is now a partner at Y Combinator, was one of the investors). The company never needed to raise money again.  It added payment processing options a couple years later, and now more than $100 million in transactions have been processed through its forms.
