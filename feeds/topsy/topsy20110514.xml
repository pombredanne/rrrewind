            It was when they pulled out the machetes that I started to worry.

I'd seen men with machetes in Africa before, but they were rusty, practical tools used for clearing away brush by the side of the highway. These were long, shiny and housed in decorative sheaths, pulled out ostensibly so the men could sit down more comfortably, but done with a clear, understated flair. They were more like sultan swords than jungle tools.

The kicking in my six-month pregnant belly had gone eerily silent since we entered the vigilante court at Alaba.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lockitron Lets You Unlock Your Door With Your Phone http://tcrn.ch/lsAmJl by @alexia
            Ever wish you could just call your keys? Well the Ycombinator-backed Lockitron aims to replace physical keys entirely by letting you control your door lock with your phone. The Lockitron  web app and hardware package are as of today available for general users, for a one time fee of between $295 to $500.

Instead of using relatively unreliable wifi, the service works by utilizing a plug server and ethernet cable tied to an electronic lock. Your smartphone talks to the server controlling the lock via the web which means that you can control the lock from wherever you are. Lockitron also has an NFC option if you've got a Nexus S or are planning on buying a iPhone 5 if/when NFC happens. The system works with both deadbolt and handle locks.

            A company called PunchTab wants to test their new contest entry system, appropriately-named the PunchTab widget. To that end, they've offered us the ability to give away a black 16GB Apple iPad Two (was there ever an iPad One?), some sort of new tablet computer for people who like that sort of thing. All the kids seem to want one, like the Teddy Ruxpin.

So here's where it gets a little weird.

            As everyone in the Bay Area will know, this Sunday is the annual Bay to Breakers run/boozefest. The 12k run normally goes from the bay (in the city) to the breakers (at the ocean), hence the name. But Uber is going to do the opposite.

As they've just announced to customers via email, starting at 10AM and going through 4PM, they'll be going breakers to bay, picking up weary runners/pukers in their cars. If you happen to be in the Golden Gate Park area in that timeframe, there will be limos there waiting for those who use the app. And those limos will be

            Para usar um termo em voga nos últimos dias, o foco de Ed Motta desde quarta-feira, 11, é a "gente diferenciada". O cantor, lembrado por alguns hits que emplacou nos anos 1980 e 1990, fez de seu perfil no Facebook uma verdadeira metralhadora giratória.

            Last week I wrote about Computer Village, where many of the gadget-hounds in Lagos go to get their gadgety fix. But what about new technology being developed in the country? The city's tech entrepreneur scene is small, but several people are working on changing that.

Oo Nwoye--  or @oothenigerian as he's known on Twitter-- is one of the more enthusiastic champions of this nascent scene. (That's him on the left.) I met him two years ago in London, where he cornered me at an event and made a case for me going to Nigeria, so he was one of the first people I contacted when I finally did.

Since then, he'd moved back home. He's working on a to-be-determined startup and spending the meantime trying to galvanize a startup community. He organized a fantastic demo day to give me a taste of what people are working on.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Keen On: Can The New Intimacy Economy Save The Music Industry? (TCTV) http://tcrn.ch/kyfNaK by @ajkeen
            Should music artists be like the authoritarian Steve Jobs? Is it their responsibility to know what their fans want better than they do? Evan Lowenstein, the successful singer-songwriter and the current CEO of StageIT, certainly seems to think so.  In a recent article tantalizingly entitled “The Artist to Fan Relationship: Dating, Love, Texting and Marriage”, Lowenstein argues that “as an artist, it is our responsibility to know what our fans want better than they do.” But, as I found out when I interviewed Lowenstein this week at the excellent SFMusicTech event this week, Lowenstein isn’t quite as dismissive of his fans as he initially appears.

            This is your last chance to win a free ticket to this year's Disrupt in New York City! The conference is from May 23rd to May 25th, a little over a week away, and has an incredible lineup of guest speakers and judges. You can read all about our speakers here, and you can take a peek at our three day agenda, as of now, here.

We still have a couple other little surprises that we will be announcing. Some very special guests have confirmed and we will be revealing them shortly. Since this is your last chance to win a free ticket, we wanted to throw in something extra to make it special. A couple of weeks ago, Alexia wrote about a company named Talkatone. They were generous enough to give us a free iPod Touch with Talkatone already installed, so we thought it would be nice to give it away to one of our readers. So, the winner of this giveaway will win a free ticket to Disrupt, a ticket valued at around $3,000, and an iPod Touch, courtesy of Talkatone.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Faces Lawsuit Over Unauthorized Sharing Of User Data With Advertisers http://tcrn.ch/j4NTsp by @robinwauters
            A judge yesterday threw out most of the claims made in a lawsuit against Facebook, in which two California individuals, David Gould and Mike Robertson, accused the social networking giant of sharing their names and other private information with some advertisers in direct violation of its own privacy policy.

That said, the judge also ruled the lawsuit will not be dismissed in its entirety either, as Facebook had pleaded.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Blogger is back http://ff.im/-DirJp
            What a frustrating day. We’re very sorry that you’ve been unable to publish to Blogger for the past 20.5 hours. We’re nearly back to normal—you can publish again, and in the coming hours posts and comments that were temporarily removed should be restored. Thank you for your patience while we fix this situation. We use Blogger for our own blogs, so we’ve also felt your pain.

        <title>Disrupt NYC: The Full Agenda</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Disrupt NYC: The Full Agenda http://tcrn.ch/kG1otc by @erickschonfeld
            In about a week, Disrupt NYC will begin.  We will launch over two dozen new startups in our Startup Battlefield and bring together the smartest people in tech to discuss how the Internet is disrupting industry after industry—from media (print, TV, music, gaming) and social commerce to payments and transportation.  

We've steered away from unwieldy panels, and instead tried to pair up interesting speakers to foster deeper conversations.  Fred Wilson, Dennis Crowley, Arianna Huffington, and Ron Conway will kick things off in a series of talks on Monday morning.  Gilt Groupe CEO Kevin Ryan and Kleiner Perkins VC Aileen Lee will delve into the shifting world of social commerce. Charlie Rose will interview Paul Graham on Tuesday.  Betaworks CEO John Borthwick (who recently launched News.me) will talk tablet publishing.  We've already announced many of the speakers, but the full agenda is below.  You can still buy tickets, or try to win one.
