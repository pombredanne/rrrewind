            TechCrunch Disrupt winner Qwiki launched its iPad app in the App Store a less than a week ago and after 11 days has hit the quarter of a million downloads milestone. This is notable for an iPad app, especially when compared to other highly publicized iOS app milestones; It took iPhone app Instagram six days to hit 100K, SoundTracking two weeks to hit 250K and FourSquare a whopping seven months to get to 60K users.

Qwiki PR rep CeCe Cheng tells me that Qwiki.com has

            Peer-to-peer education startup Skillshare, which just launched in April, raised a $550,000 angel round, according to an SEC filing.  Investors in the New York City startup include Founder Collective, SV Angel, Collaborative Fund, David Tisch, and Scott Heiferman.  

Skillshare is a community where people can offer classes to other members. People sign up online, and meet in person for real classes for everything from how to bake cupcakes to how to get startup funding.  People can charge for the classes and Skillshare takes a 15 percent cut.  Co-founder Michael Karnjanaprakorn used to be head of product at Hot Potato (since acquired by Facebook), and co-founder Malcolm Ong was the product manager at OMGPOP.

            If you have even the slightest hint of a creative streak, you may be interested in COLOURlovers, a startup whose products let you easily express yourself using shapes and colors, even if you aren't particularly good at it. The Y Combinator-backed company has built up a community around creating color palettes, a matching iPhone app, and even a tool for sprucing up your Twitter profile. And now the company has closed its first seed round.

COLOURlovers has raised $1 million from investors including Atlas Venture, Morado Ventures, Founder Collective, Charles River Ventures, 500 Startups, Seraph Group & Zelkova Ventures, Matt Mullenweg, Alexis Ohanian, Don Hutchison, Dharmesh Shah, Jared Friedman, and Shawn Bercuson (the startup says it got in touch with many of them via Angel List).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Netflix CEO Reed Hastings: In Ten Years, &quot;We Will All Have A Gigabit To The Home&quot; http://tcrn.ch/je76VN by @erickschonfeld
            Netflix is blowing the doors off its business, with $3 billion in annualized revenue and a $12 billion market cap driven by the transition to streaming online video.  In terms of hours watched, streaming surpassed DVDs for Netflix in the fourth quarter, but CEO Reed Hastings has been preparing for this moment for more than decade.  The name Netflix itself always held the promise of movies delivered over the Internet.  The problem, says Hastings in an interview today at the Wired business conference, was that back then they couldn't stream movies over 56K modems.  

But there was Moore's Law and improvements in bandwidth which could be plotted, and that is exactly what Hastings did.

            Screengrab from Sean Bonner. But this is not a joke! In a company blog post today, Yahoo reported that two-thirds of people searching for "Who is Osama Bin Laden?" today were teenagers. Yes, that's right, a non-insignificant number of teenagers in America do not know who Osama bin Laden is.

            After a day of international exaltation over the death of Osama bin Laden, questions remain about who might take over his terrorist group and whether a trove of material gathered from bin Laden's compound might tip off U.S. officials to other al Qaeda leaders and plots.

            While the world might never know exactly how Google makes its hiring decisions, former CEO Eric Schmidt gave a little more insight into the process during a recent McKinsey conference in Washington D.C. Schmidt expressed the company’s preference for employees that don't need much managing.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyone Wanna Buy A Mobile Twitter Site On The Cheap? http://tcrn.ch/k4efF2 by @robinwauters
            Long before Twitter launched a proper mobile website with enough bells and whistles to be actually worth using (December 2009) there was Slandr, a mobile website that allowed Twitter users, even those with feature phones, to access the service on the go. ReadWriteWeb gushed about the site back in May 2008, calling it the best (non iPhone) mobile Twitter app available. And I did use it at one point.

Fast forward to today and it looks like Slandr developer Roeland P Landegent wants to give someone else a go at running the site. The Slandr mobile site is currently up for sale on Flippa, and if you want to 'buy it now' you'll have to cough up $25,000.

            A middle-aged nonentity, a political failure outstripped by history – by the millions of Arabs demanding freedom and democracy in the Middle East – died in Pakistan yesterday. And then the world went mad.
