            Representative Anthony D. Weiner told MSNBC news he “can’t say with certitude’' that a lewd photo sent from his Twitter account does not depict him, though he said he was not the one who sent it.

            I owe an incredible debt to my readers, particularly one who comments under the sobriquet "milowent." We may be very close to a resolution of this case.

        <title>‘ONE’ iPhone App Allows You To Call Your Senators To Instigate Change</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[&#39;One&#39; iPhone App Allows You To Call Your Senators To Instigate Change http://tcrn.ch/iSFcD1 by @alexia
            If you're like me you're probably too preoccupied to get political on a daily basis, even though you are passionate about social activism and causes like education reform. But what if an app made it easier for you to get informed and take political action on the issues you care about? Would you get involved then?

Launching in the app store today is ONE, an iPhone app that attempts to modernize political call to action, by making it easy to stay up to date on issues and take actions that actually might cause actual social change from within the app itself. The app basically gives you information about various advocacy movements like funding childhood vaccines for kids that can't afford them and then lets you call a senator, sign a petition or join up with a real life rally for causes in order to raise awareness.

        <title>Google Places Now Borrowing Yelp Reviews Without Attribution In iPhone App</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Places Now Borrowing Yelp Reviews Without Attribution In iPhone App http://tcrn.ch/k0CZgy by @erickschonfeld
            Google Places is at it again, brazenly borrowing reviews from Yelp.  But this time it's in their iPhone app and they are not even bothering to link back to Yelp or attribute where they are getting the reviews.  Yelp and Google have a love-hate relationship.  Yelp loves when its listings and reviews show up in natural search results, but they hate it when Google scrapes their reviews to populate its own local listings in Google Places.  

This tension between the two has been playing out for a long time with various ups and downs.  It's become a running joke.  But Google appears to be pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable once again with its mobile app.

            Microsoft revealed a radical overhaul of its flagship operating system that borrows much from the design of Windows Phone 7. The goal of the new Windows was to create a "no compromises" operating system equally at home on an 8-inch tablet, a laptop or a desktop connected to a huge monitor, Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky told AllThingsD in an interview.

        <title>Bids For Social.com Domain Start At $5 Million. You Could Have Bought It For $50,000 In 1997</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bids For Social.com Domain Start At $5 Million.  You Could Have Bought It For $50,000 In 1997 http://tcrn.ch/lkysGG by @erickschonfeld
            How much is the domain Social.com worth?  We are about to find out.  The domain will be auctioned off on June 8 at DOMAINfest Barcelona with an opening bid of $5 million, according to Moniker. Moniker and SnapNames will be jointly selling the domain on behalf of Scott Carter, the original owner who first registered the domain back in January, 1995.  Back then, he had to pay $100 a year to Network Solutions and all the paperwork had to go through the mail.  

Depending on how high the bidding goes, Social.com could very well end up being one of the most expensive domain sales of all time.  The current record-holder is Sex.com, which sold for $13 million in April.  Bidding for Sex.com started at $1 million.  And Social.com is arguably sexier right now.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Big news on the @nancyscola front. http://bit.ly/iXCPlv
            A few years back, as a Washington DC transplant eager to make the move from a life working in politics to the writing life, I met Micah Sifry and, shortly after that, Andrew Rasiej. They took me into this exciting little organization called Personal Democracy Forum, and charged me with writing day-in and day-out about how people were using technology to shape the world around them. At every step of the way, they've encouraged me to follow my own intellectual curiosity and honesty. And for that, I am more grateful to them than I suspect they'll ever really

            Today, Twitter launched a personalized search experience to help our users find the most relevant Tweets, images, and videos. To build this product, our infrastructure needed to support two major features: relevance-filtering of search results and the identification of relevant images and photos. Both features leverage a ground-up rewrite of the search infrastructure, with Blender and Earlybird at the core.

            Groupon, as everyone knows by now, is growing like crazy.  How crazy?  CEO Andrew Mason just revealed at the D9 technology conference that he now employs 8,000 people, which is up from 1,500 a year ago.  That means it grew headcount by 433 percent.

About half of its employees are sales people.  Signing up local businesses to offer group discounts requires a lot of hand-holding and sales calls across many local markets.  Groupon is now in 46 countries.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Meu post de hoje: CQC anti-amamentação, vai pra PQP! http://bit.ly/iSyRB7 #lolaescreva
            Rafinha, que nunca viu um rocambole, engasga ao dizer mamaço Eu não vejo CQC, mas leitoras me contaram da última do programa da Band em geral, e do Rafinha Bastos (que adora contar piadas sobre estupradores merecerem um abraço) em particular. Dá pra ver aqui. Raf começa lendo carta de uma leitora que lhe pede pra falar sobre o mamaço, a manifestação promovida em frente ao Itaú Cultural depois que uma mãe foi impedida de amamentar seu bebê em público. Note como ele diz mamaço, com a maior cara de asco. Não fica claro se seu nojo é pelo ato de amamentar ou pela audácia de pessoas protestarem. Ele exemplifica falando do beijaço, que seria “pra promover o beijo, sei lá”. É, é pedir demais que um carinha, numa concessão pública que é a TV, se informe minimamente antes de falar diante das câmeras. Beijaço não é pra promover beijo. É uma arma do povo LGBTTT para lutar contra a homofobia. Porque, assim como pessoas como Rafinha não aceitam ver uma mulher amamentar em público, também acham horrível um casal gay se beijar. Do jeito que Raf menciona beijaço e mamaço, ele deixa transparecer o que acha de protestos: ativistas são pessoas fúteis sem nada pra fazer na vida além de reclamar. Revolucionário e profundo é o

        <title>At 1.6 Billion Queries Per Day, Twitter Finally Aims To Make Search Personally Relevant</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[At 1.6 Billion Queries Per Day, Twitter Finally Aims To Make Search Personally Relevant http://tcrn.ch/kkWwEh by @parislemon
            While much of the talk leading up to today was about Twitter's move into the photo game, the bigger news is actually what they've done to their search product. They've completely rebuilt it. And while it may not be immediately apparent, the product should be much, much better than before.

Twitter details the project in a long post on their Engineering blog today. Notably, they go into the backstory of Twitter Search, which evolved from the Summize purchase in 2008. While that product worked well for a while, the technologies behind it would not allow it to scale to the level that Twitter eventually needed. So things had to be re-written — on the fly.

Twitter detailed some of this last October. But it wasn't until this past April that they were able to replace the old Ruby on Rails front-end with the newly-built Blender. At the time, Twitter said this made search 3x faster and gave them 10x throughput. This is important since they're now seeing 2,200 tweets-per-second on average and serving up 18,000 queries per second — 1.6 billion queries per day. That's up from 1 billion last Ocotober.
