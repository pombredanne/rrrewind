            Great ideas only come around every so often, but some of us simply lack the ambition to bring these concepts to life. The startup business is a cutthroat world full of forceful competition, and the entire experience of attempting to build your company from the ground up can definitely be an intimidating one. Fortunately, Foursquare Co-Founder Dennis Crowley was able to part with a bit of welcome advice duringnterview with angel investor Kevin Rose.

            Chinese censors have tried to block an excoriating article by the dissident-artist Ai Weiwei published this week in an American news magazine, tearing out the "offending" pages before allowing it to hit newsstands in China.

            The number of Americans receiving food stamps dropped in June from declining disaster assistance, but there’s still little sign of waning demand for the food assistance program.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tell @whitehouse to dump Monsanto Mike Taylor at FDA not family farms http://t.co/e2H1xRu @food_democracy Please RT
            When Barack Obama ran for President he promised to end the “revolving door” between agribusiness lobbyists and government and to “regulate” factory farms. Unfortunately Obama's decision to appoint Monsanto super lobbyist Michael Taylor as FDA Food Safety Czar broke the trust that the American people had placed in him during his campaign. Now Michael Taylor is heading up undercover investigations at the FDA into small raw milk dairy farmers that end in armed raids while the worst factory farm violators are getting away. It's time for President Obama to stand up for real food safety and put an end to the assault against family farmers producing healthy food.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[A love story for Friday afternoon: navigating a proposal with Google Maps for mobile http://t.co/GbR94nj
            I recently decided to propose to my girlfriend, Faigy. I knew I wanted to do something meaningful and —yes—a little over the top, so I decided to put my software engineering skills to work to create the ultimate romantic scavenger hunt. On the road to “The Big Question,” I wanted Faigy to visit places around New York City that were filled with memories of our relationship. My plan was to construct a map of the route and get my girlfriend from one destination to the next, all with the element of surprise. Google Maps gave me the tools I needed to make the magic happen.

            The dissolution of the Netflix-Starz relationship is a meaningful loss to both companies as well as their customers. Without Starz’s participation as an early partner and its access to popular brand-new movies from Disney and Sony, it’s doubtful that Netflix Watch Instantly would ever have become popular. Additional exposure on Netflix gave Starz and its content more visibility than it ever had competing on cable with HBO and Showtime.

            In earlier Foursquare days, you had to use the "@" sign before a venue name to "check in", where an exclamation point before your message represented a "shout".

            Algeria said this week that it had allowed a two-vehicle caravan of Col. Muammar Khadafi's relatives, including his second wife and three of his children, into the country.  The flight of his relatives provides new evidence of surrender by the Khadafi clan as rebels tighten their hold on Tripoli, the capital.  Khadafi's wife, Safiya, daughter Aisha and two of his sons, Mohammed and Hannibal, all crossed into Algeria.  The spouses of Khadafi's children and their children arrived as well.  This post gives us a glimpse of how those family members lived while in power in Libya.  The value of these images isn't in their artistry or aesthetic, but in their storytelling information as we seek to uncover more behind the scenes of the Khadafi regime that spanned forty-two years. --Paula Nelson
