        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Quiet, everyone. David Simon is speaking. http://t.co/XLb7TC6E
            I was on an airplane last night as the election was decided.   As the plane landed after midnight on the East Coast, I confess that my hand was shaking as I turned on my phone for the news.  I did not want to see dishonesty and divisiveness and raw political hackery rewarded.  It is hard enough for anyone to actually address the problems, to move this country forward, to make the intransigent American ruling class yield even a yard of the past to the inevitable future.  But going backwards last night would have been devastating.  I read the returns in silent elation;  a business trip had me traveling in business class and the gnashing of corporate teeth around me precluded a full-throated huzzah on my part.  I abhor a gloat.

            Diane Sawyer was definitely probably drunk tonight during ABC's election coverage.  She slurred every other word, rambled about the lack of music, and asked a correspondent if the exclamation point in the Obama slogan represented the direction he truly wanted to go with his presidency.

            While the country debated (and voted, and debated some more) about whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney should be president, a 20-year-old woman on the other side of the world had come up with a way to unite the two forever. On Wednesday morning, Millicent Owuor, gave birth to twins in south-west Kenya.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Chris Matthews: &quot;I&#39;m So Glad We Had That Storm Last Week&quot; http://t.co/D14rVXVs
            CHRIS MATTHEWS: I am so proud of the country. To reelect this president and overcoming -- not because of the partisanship or even the policies. Here's an African-American guy with an unusual background -- part immigrant background, part African-American background -- with all this assault on him from day one. From Mitch McConnell, from the clowns out there that will never be elected, never will be to anything. 

And the way he took it, as someone said, with coolness and charm and dignity and took it and took it and kept moving forward and doing his job. And the American people, and I know we look at these percentage, 40% of white vote. Fine. That's about right among Democrats in the last couple cycles, three cycles or four. Good work for them. Good work for him. A good day for America.

I'm so glad we had that storm last week because I think the storm was one of those things. No, politically I should say. Not in terms of hurting people. The storm brought in possibilities for good politics.

            The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 250 points in the first hour of trading on Wednesday morning, the day after President Barack Obama won re-election to a second term in office. News of poor economic forecasts in Europe also drove the steep decline; the European Union is now predicting that it will slide into recession. European markets had actually greeted the Obama win with a brief rise, before economic reality set in.

            Today I pledge 1 million dollars to New York & The American Red Cross for Hurricane Sandy Relief. If it wasn't for NYC: the Lower Eastside, Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn, I would not be the woman or artist that I am today. New York is relentless ambition, a drive to succeed, a place where there is a natural pursuit of diversity through compassion. Please accept this gift on behalf of myself, my parents Joe and Cynthia, and my sister Natali; with our deepest gratitude New York for raising us. Thank you for helping me build my spirit. I will now help you rebuild yours. Sincerely, Lady Gaga and The Germanottas
