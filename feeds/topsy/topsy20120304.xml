        <title>Did you know there is a war on women? Yes, it’s true. Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, Bill Maher, Matt Taibbi, and Ed Schultz have been waging it for years with their misogynist outbursts. There have been boycotts by people on the left who are outraged that these guys still have jobs. Oh, wait. Sorry, that never happened. Boycotts are reserved for people on the right like Rush Limbaugh, who finally ++apologized++ [http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/03/03/limbaugh-apologizes-for-slut-remark.html] Saturday for calling a 30-year-old Georgetown Law student, Sandra Fluke a “slut” after she testified before congress about contraception. Limbaugh's apology was likely extracted in order to stop the departure of any more advertisers, who were rightly under pressure from liberal groups outraged by the comments. Let it be shouted from the rooftops that Rush Limbaugh should not have called Ms. Fluke a “slut” or as he added later, a “prostitute” who should post her sex tapes. It's unlikely that his apology will assuage the people on a warpath for his scalp, and after all, why should it? He spent days attacking a woman as a &amp;quot;slut&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;prostitute&amp;quot; and refused to relent. Now because he doesn't want to lose advertisers, he apologizes. What's in order is something more like groveling -- and of course a phone call to Ms. Fluke -- if you ask me. But if Limbaugh's actions demand a boycott -- and they do -- then what about the army of swine on the left? During the 2008 election Ed Schultz said on his radio show that Sarah Palin set off a ++“bimbo alert.”++ [http://palinsexismwatch.blogspot.com/2008/09/radio-host-ed-schultz-bimbo-alert.html] He called Laura Igraham a “right wing slut.” (He later apologized). He once even took to his blog to call yours truly a “bimbo” for the offense of quoting him accurately in a New York Post column. Keith Olbermann has said that conservative commentator S.E. Cupp should have been aborted by her parents, apparently because he finds her having opinions offensive. He called Michele Malkin a “mashed up bag of meat with lipstick.” He found it newsworthy to discuss Carrie Prejan’s breasts on his MSNBC show. His solution for dealing with Hillary Clinton, who he thought should drop out of the presidential race, was to find ++“somebody who can take her into a room and only he comes out.&amp;quot;++ [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/25/keith-olbermanns-idea-for_n_98557.html] Olbermann now works for uber-leftist and former Democratic Vice President Al Gore at CurrentTV. Left-wing darling Matt Taibbi ++wrote++ [http://trueslant.com/matttaibbi/2009/04/15/teabagging-michelle-malkin/] on his blog in 2009, “[W]hen I read [Michelle Malkin’s] stuff, I imagine her narrating her text, book-on-tape style, with a big, hairy set of balls in her mouth.” In a Rolling Stone article about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he referred to her ++“flabby arms.”++ [http://www.observer.com/2008/04/erica-jong-and-matt-taibbi-in-heated-huffpo-flabflap/] When feminist writer Erica Jong criticized him for it, he responded by referring to Jong as an “eight hundred year old sex novelist.” (Jong is almost seventy, which apparently makes her an irrelevant human being.) In Taibbi’s profile of Congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann he labeled her “batshit crazy.” (Oh, those “crazy” women with their hormones and all.) Chris Matthews’ sickening misogyny was made famous in 2008 when he obsessively tore down Hillary Clinton for standing between Barack Obama and the presidency, something that Matthews could not abide. Over the years he has referred to the former First Lady, Senator, presidential candidate and now Secretary of State as a “She Devil,” “Nurse Ratched,” and“Madame Defarge.” Matthews has also called Clinton &amp;quot;witchy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;anti-male,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uppity,&amp;quot; and once claimed she only won her Senate seat because her ++“husband messed around.”++ [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/7961.html] He asked a guest if &amp;quot;being surrounded by women&amp;quot; makes &amp;quot;a case for commander in chief -- or does it make a case against it?&amp;quot; At some point Matthews was shamed into sort of half apologizing to Clinton, but then just picked up again with his sexist ramblings. Matthews has wondered aloud whether Sarah Palin is even “capable of thinking” and has called Michele Bachmann a ++“balloon head”++ [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/chris-matthews-michele-bachmann-balloon-head_n_814033.html] and said she was “lucky we still don’t have literacy tests out there.” Democratic strategist Jehmu Greene, who is the former president of the Women’s Media Center ++told++ [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-01-31/entertainment/30080416_1_michele-bachmann-chris-matthews-bully] Fox News Megyn Kelly in 2011 that “[Matthews] is a bully and his favorite target is women.” So why does he still have a show? What if his favorite target was Jews? Or African Americans? But the grand Pooh-Bah of media misogyny is without a doubt Bill Maher – who also happens to be a favorite of liberals – who has given $1 million to President Obama’s SuperPAC. Maher has called Sarah Palin a “dumb twat” and dropped the ++C-word++ in describing the former Alaska Governor. [http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-calls-sarah-palin-the-c-word-during-his-stand-up-act/] He called Palin and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann “boobs” and “two bimbos.” He ++said++ [http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/06/bill-maher-michele-bachmann-is-a-crazy-girl-with-mean-ideas/] of the former vice-presidential candidate, “She is not a mean girl. She is a crazy girl with mean ideas. He recently made a joke about Sen. Rick Santorum’s wife using a ++vibrator++. [http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2012/02/18/bill-maher-makes-joke-about-rick-santorums-wife-using-sex-toy] Imagine now the same joke with Michelle Obama’s name in it and tell me that he would still have a job. Maher said of a woman who was harassed while breastfeeding at an Applebees, “[D]on't show me your tits!” as if a woman feeding her child is trying to flash Bill Maher. (Here’s a way to solve his problem: don’t stare at a strangers breasts). Then, hiscoup de grace: “And by the way, there is a place where breasts and food do go together. It's called Hooters!” Liberals – you know, the people who say they “fight for women” – comprise Maher’s audience and a parade of high-profile liberals make up his guest list. Yet have any of them confronted him? Nope. That was left to Ann Coulter who actually called Bill Maher a misogynist ++to his face++, [http://jezebel.com/5819653/ann-coulter-calls-bill-maher-a-misogynist-to-his-face] an opportunity that feminist icon Gloria Steinem failed to take when she appeared on his show in 2011. This is not to suggest that liberals – or feminists – never complain about misogyny. Many feminist blogs now document attacks on women on the left and the right including Jezebel, Shakesville, and the Women’s Media Center (which was founded by Gloria Steinem.) But when it comes to high-profile campaigns to hold these men accountable – such as that waged against Limbaugh -- the real fury seems reserved only for conservatives while the men on the left get a wink and a nod as long as they are carrying water for the liberal cause. After all, if Limbaugh’s outburst is part of the “War on Women,” then what is the routine misogyny of liberal media men? It’s time for some equal opportunity accountability. Without it, the fight against media misogyny will continue to be perceived as a proxy war for the Democratic Party, not a fight for fair treatment of women in the public square. - The Daily Beast</title>

            Everybody who has watched any of The Terminator films knows about Skynet, the insidious computing system that becomes self-aware and decides to eliminate humans from the face of the earth. In the movies, a battle plays out, both in the present and the future, between humanity and this fearsome self-aware AI system.

            Last month, I tweeted about one of my recent projects, the Hacker News mobile web app. It's a simple little app to read Hacker News' stories and comments in Mobile Safari. It started out as an experiment for me to try one of the new CSS extensions introduced in Mobile Safari in iOS5, -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch which uses native-style scrolling in an overflow: scroll element.
