        <title>Lockitron Lets You Unlock Your Door With Your Phone</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lockitron Lets You Unlock Your Door With Your Phone http://tcrn.ch/lsAmJl by @alexia
            Ever wish you could just call your keys? Well the Ycombinator-backed Lockitron aims to replace physical keys entirely by letting you control your door lock with your phone. The Lockitron  web app and hardware package are as of today available for general users, for a one time fee of between $295 to $500.

Instead of using relatively unreliable wifi, the service works by utilizing a plug server and ethernet cable tied to an electronic lock. Your smartphone talks to the server controlling the lock via the web which means that you can control the lock from wherever you are. Lockitron also has an NFC option if you've got a Nexus S or are planning on buying a iPhone 5 if/when NFC happens. The system works with both deadbolt and handle locks.

            A company called PunchTab wants to test their new contest entry system, appropriately-named the PunchTab widget. To that end, they've offered us the ability to give away a black 16GB Apple iPad Two (was there ever an iPad One?), some sort of new tablet computer for people who like that sort of thing. All the kids seem to want one, like the Teddy Ruxpin.

So here's where it gets a little weird.

            As everyone in the Bay Area will know, this Sunday is the annual Bay to Breakers run/boozefest. The 12k run normally goes from the bay (in the city) to the breakers (at the ocean), hence the name. But Uber is going to do the opposite.

As they've just announced to customers via email, starting at 10AM and going through 4PM, they'll be going breakers to bay, picking up weary runners/pukers in their cars. If you happen to be in the Golden Gate Park area in that timeframe, there will be limos there waiting for those who use the app. And those limos will be

            Para usar um termo em voga nos últimos dias, o foco de Ed Motta desde quarta-feira, 11, é a "gente diferenciada". O cantor, lembrado por alguns hits que emplacou nos anos 1980 e 1990, fez de seu perfil no Facebook uma verdadeira metralhadora giratória.

            Last week I wrote about Computer Village, where many of the gadget-hounds in Lagos go to get their gadgety fix. But what about new technology being developed in the country? The city's tech entrepreneur scene is small, but several people are working on changing that.

Oo Nwoye--  or @oothenigerian as he's known on Twitter-- is one of the more enthusiastic champions of this nascent scene. (That's him on the left.) I met him two years ago in London, where he cornered me at an event and made a case for me going to Nigeria, so he was one of the first people I contacted when I finally did.

Since then, he'd moved back home. He's working on a to-be-determined startup and spending the meantime trying to galvanize a startup community. He organized a fantastic demo day to give me a taste of what people are working on.

            Should music artists be like the authoritarian Steve Jobs? Is it their responsibility to know what their fans want better than they do? Evan Lowenstein, the successful singer-songwriter and the current CEO of StageIT, certainly seems to think so.  In a recent article tantalizingly entitled “The Artist to Fan Relationship: Dating, Love, Texting and Marriage”, Lowenstein argues that “as an artist, it is our responsibility to know what our fans want better than they do.” But, as I found out when I interviewed Lowenstein this week at the excellent SFMusicTech event this week, Lowenstein isn’t quite as dismissive of his fans as he initially appears.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[TechCrunch Giveaway: Last Free Ticket To Disrupt NYC, Plus Free iPod Touch #TechCrunch http://tcrn.ch/kncPnr by @elinblesener
            This is your last chance to win a free ticket to this year's Disrupt in New York City! The conference is from May 23rd to May 25th, a little over a week away, and has an incredible lineup of guest speakers and judges. You can read all about our speakers here, and you can take a peek at our three day agenda, as of now, here.

We still have a couple other little surprises that we will be announcing. Some very special guests have confirmed and we will be revealing them shortly. Since this is your last chance to win a free ticket, we wanted to throw in something extra to make it special. A couple of weeks ago, Alexia wrote about a company named Talkatone. They were generous enough to give us a free iPod Touch with Talkatone already installed, so we thought it would be nice to give it away to one of our readers. So, the winner of this giveaway will win a free ticket to Disrupt, a ticket valued at around $3,000, and an iPod Touch, courtesy of Talkatone.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Faces Lawsuit Over Unauthorized Sharing Of User Data With Advertisers http://tcrn.ch/j4NTsp by @robinwauters
            A judge yesterday threw out most of the claims made in a lawsuit against Facebook, in which two California individuals, David Gould and Mike Robertson, accused the social networking giant of sharing their names and other private information with some advertisers in direct violation of its own privacy policy.

That said, the judge also ruled the lawsuit will not be dismissed in its entirety either, as Facebook had pleaded.

            What a frustrating day. We’re very sorry that you’ve been unable to publish to Blogger for the past 20.5 hours. We’re nearly back to normal—you can publish again, and in the coming hours posts and comments that were temporarily removed should be restored. Thank you for your patience while we fix this situation. We use Blogger for our own blogs, so we’ve also felt your pain.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Disrupt NYC: The Full Agenda http://tcrn.ch/kG1otc by @erickschonfeld
            In about a week, Disrupt NYC will begin.  We will launch over two dozen new startups in our Startup Battlefield and bring together the smartest people in tech to discuss how the Internet is disrupting industry after industry—from media (print, TV, music, gaming) and social commerce to payments and transportation.  

We've steered away from unwieldy panels, and instead tried to pair up interesting speakers to foster deeper conversations.  Fred Wilson, Dennis Crowley, Arianna Huffington, and Ron Conway will kick things off in a series of talks on Monday morning.  Gilt Groupe CEO Kevin Ryan and Kleiner Perkins VC Aileen Lee will delve into the shifting world of social commerce. Charlie Rose will interview Paul Graham on Tuesday.  Betaworks CEO John Borthwick (who recently launched News.me) will talk tablet publishing.  We've already announced many of the speakers, but the full agenda is below.  You can still buy tickets, or try to win one.

            Last year,  OpenFeint launched the private beta of OpenFeint X (OFX), which offers indie developers the ability to create Zynga-like free-to-play games including microtransactions and virtual goods. Until now, the platform has only been available for iOS devices, but today, the company is expanding to Android phones with the private beta launch of OFX for Android.

OFX allows developers can create social games with a chat wall where players can interact with each other, a newsfeed showing recent in-game activity, and game nudges. OFX also offers the ability to build and run a full virtual goods store, stocking and selling virtual currency and goods, access detailed analytics, and include a game-specific currency wallet.

            The Taliban, the ultra-conservative Islamist group that ran Afghanistan while it acted as a host to Osama Bin Laden, have a Twitter feed. Called @alemarahweb (Mostafa Ahmedi), the website attached to it is described as belonging to the "islamic emirat of afghanistan" (sic). The Taliban have usually been described, rather euphemistically, as "medieval" in outlook and they have not had a public relationship to communications technology, unlike the late Bin Laden. However, the group has been tweeting since December 19 of last year. In that time, they have posted 773 tweets. They have 2,970 followers but only follow 12. So...

            Japan's largest mobile operator NTT DoCoMo and Twitter have announced a partnership that allows the operator access to Twitter's database. As a part of the deal, users will be able to tap phones in order to follow each other on Twitter. The operator will also integrate Twitter updates and other related content in its feature phone portal called i-mode and on its smartphone portal, the DoCoMo Market. In total, the new integrations will reach 58 million NTT DoCoMo customers in Japan. Although not part of the press release, a Twitter-based location-based alerting service is in the works too, according to reports....

            What a frustrating day. We’re very sorry that you’ve been unable to publish to Blogger for the past 20.5 hours.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Samsung announces 2560 x 1600 display, could pave the way for iPad 3 http://dlvr.it/RXJv1
            Samsung will demonstrate an all-new 10.1-inch display at the SID Display Week 2011 International Symposium next week. Samsung's new display will have a 2560 x 1600 resolution, far in excess of anything on the tablet market today. At 300 dpi, the display also compares favorably with the Retina Display resolution of Apple's iPhone 4; meanwhile, Samsung claims the PenTile technology used in the display allows it to operate while drawing 40 percent less power.

            The librarians are guilty of nothing except earning salaries the district feels the need to cut. But as they're cross-examined by determined Los Angeles Unified School District attorneys, they're continually put on the defensive.

        <title>Native Apps Or Web Apps? Particle Code Wants You To Do Both</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Native Apps Or Web Apps? Particle Code Wants You To Do Both http://tcrn.ch/kRhdRJ by @ripemp
            When it comes to app development for mobile devices, cross-platform implementation is the new hot thing. Developers have long struggled with fragmentation across operating systems, when they want to just be able to create one app and blast it out on every platform imaginable. Businesses like Heroku and Appcelerator, and gaming versions like Game Closure (and many others) collectively make creating, hosting, and deploying games a more manageable endeavor. But today, a startup is launching that hopes to make development of mobile apps even easier.

Palo Alto-based Particle Code is building a platform that enables mobile developers to write mobile apps and games once, deploy both HTML5 and native apps across platforms and devices -- all from within a single codebase. Particle Code is built on the Eclipse IDE, an environment and suite of tools for Java developers, and supports development in a wide array of languages including Java, C# and ActionScript3. This means millions of additional programmers can now enter mobile app development in a way that is scalable to reach a whole bunch of devices. And, as a potentially interesting aside, here's TIOBE's ranking of the most popular programming languages this month.

            A high school sophomore from New Jersey is challenging Rep. Michele Bachmann to a debate on civics and the U.S. Constitution. In an open letter to to Bachmann, Amy Myers of Cherry Hill, N.J., said, I have found quite a few of your statements regarding The Constitution of the United States, the quality of public school education and general U.S. civics matters to be factually incorrect, inaccurately applied or grossly distorted.

Gary Vaynerchuk dropped by our TechCrunch TV studio in New York City with a bottle of red to discuss his new book, The Thank You Economy with TechCrunch Co-editor, Erick Schonfeld. “Context is the new battleground for business” says Vaynerchuk when asked to give the Twitter version summary of book.

In essence, businesses need to better understand how to use social media and how to apply an authentic human touch while doing so. Vaynerchuk thinks current efforts are abysmal. “

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Huckabee teases &quot;VERY important announcement coming on Saturday.&quot; 2012? http://abcn.ws/kUiN87
            Former Arkansas governor and potential presidential aspirant Mike Huckabee is telling a radio audience on Friday that he plans to make “a very important announcement” over the weekend. “This weekend be sure to catch my Fox News television show,” Huckabee says. “A very important announcement coming this Saturday.” The Note, authored by ABC News' Amy Walter and Michael Falcone, covers politics, the White House, Congress, Democrats, Republicans, and all latest political campaigning for the 2012 presidential race.  Washington's first and most influential tipsheet, The Note will detail the administration of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and influential Cabinet members such as Secretary of State and former 2008 campaign rival Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration's relationship with former President Bill Clinton.  ABC News' The Note keeps track of Washington controversy, scandal and the major issues facing the nation: the economy, recession, taxes, bailout, health care, social security and financial crisis.  And, as the race for 2012 presidential campaign heats up, The Note tracks all of the major political players: Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich and more.

            Netflix previously all but ignored Android, leaving users confused and annoyed by the lack of love. All that changed yesterday when the app dropped on the Nexus S and several HTC devices. But that's the catch. Only a select few devices currently support the streaming service, so the fun is only for those rocking the HTC Incredible, HTC Nexus One, HTC Evo 4G, HTC G2, and Samsung Nexus S -- unless you're comfortable following a few lines of instructions!
