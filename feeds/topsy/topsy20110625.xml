        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nevada is now the 1st state to legalize driver-less cars. #Google http://j.mp/kGy7fa
            A state bill with new rules for self-driving cars just passed, allowing Google's fleet of hybrid vehicles to hit the road in Nevada soon. Google had been lobbying for the bill for weeks, saying they're safer than human-driven cars.

        <title>NY Post downplays NY gay marriage vote - On Media - POLITICO.com</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Post was the only NY daily not to lead with the NY gay marriage vote story. Some staffers are appalled. http://is.gd/OD3e6A
            Last night, New York became the biggest state in the country to approve gay marriage. For a paper with “New York” in its name, you might think this would be big news, whatever its stance on the issue. But this morning, the New York Post stood alone among New York papers in choosing not to blast the vote across its front page – preferring only a small strip across the bottom. Some at the Post say they are shocked and appalled at the decision.
New York Times went for the all-caps, double-decker, six-column headline “NEW YORK PASSES SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, BECOMING LARGEST STATE TO PASS LAW.” The New York Daily News went for the single word, “HISTORY!”
Beyond New York, the Washington Post put the story on its front page, above the fold. The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post’s News Corp-owned sibling, put the story on page A17.

            Journalists are not public officeholders, nor do they manage public funds. But they do hold, precariously, a public trust. And at the foundation of that trust is the pledge to tell the truth, or at least to get as close to it as they can.

            While the story of this title appearing on Mark Zuckerberg’s early Facebook business cards has been around outside the company since at least 2009, when Ben Mezrich’s The Accidental Billionaires was released, it really exploded into legendary status last year. That’s when the Acadmey Award-winning film, The Social Network (based on Mezrich’s book), launched the phrase into pop culture by having Justin Timberlake’s Sean Parker utter it as the exclamation point at the end of a key speech meant to inspire Jesse Einsenberg’s Zuckerberg.

            After several years languishing in the backwoods of Google's server farms, Google Health got its plug pulled today.  Why did the ambitious project to record your health record online and help you research your every ailment fail?  I asked this to Adam Bosworth, the former Googler who originally created Google Health, a few weeks ago when he was in the TCTV studio to talk about his new health startup Keas.

In a sentence, he said,

            The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, Phil Windley, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — celebrated the news that apps are moving past web sites as the default architecture of the planet. I say celebrate because I think the trend is one that will continue, and even accelerate, as iOS notifications make interoperation between apps more useful. In the process, as @windley notes, notifications and the processes that are triggered, become the focal point of what used to be known as the operating system.

What that means for Windows is cloudy at the moment, pun intended. Though many analysts suggest Windows Phone 7 will gain significant penetration alongside iOS and Android, it will only be possible should important apps drive that adoption. @scobleizer is dubious, and @kevinmarks suggests the locus of power in notification has moved away from OS to Facebook and Twitter. @stevegillmor has his money on @mentions, where social and Web meet in a native wrapper too tasty to ignore.

        <title>Stop The Hate: Daily Deals Aren’t All Bad, And Here’s Why</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Stop The Hate: Daily Deals Aren&#39;t All Bad, And Here&#39;s Why http://tcrn.ch/loMpOi]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Stop The Hate: Daily Deals Aren&#39;t All Bad, And Here&#39;s Why http://tcrn.ch/loMpOi
            There's a lot of hate out there these days from the press when it comes to the daily deals industry. I'm looking at you, TechCrunch. Sure, Groupon has become the whale in this industry, but that doesn't mean Groupon constitutes the entire industry. Sure, while Groupon may sometimes structure lousy deals for merchants, it doesn’t mean the entire daily deal business model isn't sustainable or beneficial for small businesses. When done right, the daily deal can actually be very lucrative for everyone involved: Merchants, customers and the daily deal sites themselves.

So why should you take my word for it? It's true, I've got my biases.  But so many people have quickly elevated themselves to “experts” on this space that it’s hard to filter truth from the noise. My company, KASA Capital, started Crowd Cut in May 2010. We are now a top player in our markets, generating eight figures of profitable revenues. So, when I talk about the daily deal space, I do so with direct experience. I talk to merchants and customers every day. I have numbers to back my claims. I’m a player in this game, not a self-proclaimed expert who sits on the sidelines.

            The passage of same-sex marriage was about a Republican Party reckoning with a changing power dynamic, where a strategic governor, Wall Street donors and gay-rights advocates demonstrated more might than an ineffective opposition.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Inspired By Wikipedia, Quora Aims For Relevancy With Topic Groups And Reorganized Topic Pages http://tcrn.ch/mvMD3z by @alexia
            Quora has just announced a redesign of its Topic Pages and the introduction of Topic Groups, aiming to make information discovery and navigation on the site a little bit easier. The motivation behind these changes is a thrust towards ease of search and content relevancy on Quora, as there is currently a ton of content on the site that people need to figure out how to navigate.

Now instead of a chronological stream on Topics Pages (which you can get to via the tags in questions), users will see Best Questions, Open Questions as well as Featured Questions and Frequently Asked Questions depending on the topic.
