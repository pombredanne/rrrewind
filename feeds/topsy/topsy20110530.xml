            There are literally hundreds of thousands of iPhone, iPad and Android apps to choose from, and yet finding good apps is far from easy.   App discovery and recommendations is a fertile niche where a few startups are fighting for mindshare.  After being downloaded more than 2 million times, app discovery startup Appsfire closed a $3.6 million series A, led by French VC firm IDinvest.  (Appsfire is based in Paris and Tel Aviv, and was co-founded by Ouriel Ohayon, who used to be the editor of TechCrunch France).

Appsfire crossed 1 million downloads in February, and then the 2-million mark in May.  Ohayon says its various apps for the iPhone, Android, iPad, and kid's apps is generating 3 million leads to app developers each month.  Appsfire lets you share your favorite apps with your friends via the web, your mobile device, or Facebook.

            Twitterは、外部サービスとして許容する範囲をずっと示し続けている。TwitterのPlatform部門のリーダーであるRyan Sarverは、Twitterのサービスの主眼であるクライアント向けサービス部分を模倣したり複製したりすることのないようにと述べてきていた。 このSarverの言葉をそのまま捉えるならば、TwitpicsやYfrogsは新たに入ってきたニュースに青ざめているところかもしれない。複数の情報源によれば、Twitterが独自にTwitpic風サービスを提供することにしたというのだ。順調にいけば明日にもサービスが公開されるらしい（情報が漏洩したことでスケジュールに変更があるかもしれない）。

            Maybe Microsoft's multi-billion dollar deal for Skype wasn't such an outlandish deal after all. Because according to a recent poll conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, the popularity of Internet phone calls has jumped dramatically, with 5% of Internet users placing a VOIP phone call on any given day. The survey found that almost a quarter of American adult Internet users (24%) have placed a phone call online. That's 19% of all American adults....

            Twitter will launch its own photo sharing feature very soon, according to a purported scoop by Alexia Tsotsis today at TechCrunch. After years of struggles to stay online and apparently giving up any hope of retrieving archival messages in text for its users, a move into photo hosting and sharing would be another show of confidence by Twitter in its newfound architectural stability. But would you trust Twitter to host your photos? Twitter, the network for fleeting thoughts, in short form?

            Ashton Kutcher started dabbling in tech startups a few years ago, but he is no longer a dabbler, as his his Disrupt interview with Charlie Rose last week made clear.  Kutcher is an investor in a dozen tech companies, including Skype, Foursquare, Path, and Kevin Rose's Milk.  In this backstage interview with Sarah Lacy, he reveals that he is also an investor in AirBnB (whose CEO Brian Chesky was also at Disrupt) and why he thinks the company is different.

Kutcher talks about his approach to investing in startups.  At first it was very much a leraning process for him.

            We're hearing from multiple sources that Twitter is in talks to acquire Y Combinator-backed key word bidding platform AdGrok for a deal that is less than $10 million. It's still unclear where exactly the deal is in the closing process or whether this is a tech acquisition or an acqui-hire.

AdGrok itself automates the process of bidding on contextual keywords on Google AdWords, perhaps Twitter could find some use in this for their own promoted trends?

            A few days ago, Facebook held a tech talk at their headquarters. The topic of the talk was pushing changes — bug fixes, new features, product improvements, etc. Every day, Facebook engineers push hundreds of these; some big, some little. Most of the 600 million-plus users never notice a thing. And apparently, we're even less likely to notice changes due to a special feature Facebook has. The

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Pew: A Quarter Of American Internet Users Have Placed Phone Calls Online http://tcrn.ch/kqadou by @leenarao
            Pew Internet, a think tank that regularly publishes research reports about technology, has released a new study today showing the steady growth in using VoIP and phone services online. According to the organization's report, a quarter of American adult internet users (24 percent) have placed phone calls online. That amounts to 19 percent of all American adults. On any given day 5 percent of internet users are going online to place phone calls, says Pew. 

And Pew says that usage has grown significantly from a few years ago. For example,  Pew found in February 2007 that 8 percent of internet users (6 percent of all adults) had placed calls online and 2% of internet users were making calls on any given day. At various points during the 2000s, Pew held similar surveys and found that at most about a tenth of internet users had ever used the internet to place calls and the daily figure never rose above 1 percent of internet users.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Silicon Milkroundabout: How London Startups Took Hiring Back Into Their Own Hands: 
This is guest post by Ian H... http://tcrn.ch/jxLATu
            This is guest post by Ian Hogarth, co-founder of Songkick, relates how 45 startups in London's East End got tired of being over-shadowed by the financial sector in London and created their own event to lure wanna-be startupers.

Sunday 15th May was a significant event for the London start-up community. 45 start-ups from across London gathered in one room with a single purpose – preventing banks and consultancies hiring the best UK engineering and computer science talent.
 
In the Bay Area the biggest recruitment challenge start-ups face is how to stand out from the crowd, with so many start-ups and a hiring boom. In London the start-up ecosystem has a different problem – developers aren’t aware start-ups exist. Most UK graduates in computer science assess their options via the ‘Milkround’, a giant careers fair held every year on university campuses across the UK. Banks, consultancies, Google, Microsoft and others spend tens of millions advertising to graduates and without the density of Silicon Valley, smaller start-ups are drowned out.

        <title>Behind The Scenes: Making Spotify More Convenient Than Piracy</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Behind The Scenes: Making Spotify More Convenient Than Piracy http://tcrn.ch/iP3a1b by @jasonkincaid]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Behind The Scenes: Making Spotify More Convenient Than Piracy http://tcrn.ch/iP3a1b by @jasonkincaid
            If you're in the United States, you're probably tired of hearing about Spotify, the on-demand music service that lets you to listen to any of 13 million tracks as often as you'd like on both your PC and mobile phone. The service still hasn't managed to close deals with the major music labels over here, but it has developed quite a following in Europe, with over 10 million users and 1 million paid subscribers. And when it finally does come stateside it might turn into an even bigger hit.

And it all started with one main business idea: make a music service that's more convenient than piracy.

That's one of the highlights from a presentation given by Spotify engineer Gunnar Kreitz at KTH Royal Institute of Technology last month (many of Spotify's engineers came from KTH). Unfortunately I'm not seeing a recording of the presentation anywhere online, but Kreitz has posted the slides to his website, which you can find embedded below. The slides outline some of the key technical attributes that make Spotify what it is, many of which revolve around one key factor: speed.

        <title>Airbnb Has Arrived: Raising Mega-Round at a $1 Billion+ Valuation</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Airbnb Has Arrived: Raising Mega-Round at a $1 Billion+ Valuation http://tcrn.ch/lktxaV by @sarahcuda]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Airbnb Has Arrived: Raising Mega-Round at a $1 Billion+ Valuation http://tcrn.ch/lktxaV by @sarahcuda
            According to several sources Airbnb is in the process of closing a whopper of a funding round: $100 million or more at a $1 billion-plus valuation. The round is being lead by Andreessen Horowitz, and includes participation from DST, say our sources.

That's a big increase from the company's last funding round of $7.2 million, which included Sequoia Capital, Greylock, SV Angel, Ashton Kutcher and Youniversity Ventures (Kutcher broke the news that he's an investor in AirBnB at TechCrunch Disrupt last week). The company, which launched via Y Combinator, has raised just $7.8 million to date.

No surprise, it was a hotly contested deal. The service has exploded, growing more than 800% last year and booking 1.6 million night stays in other people's homes to date. On any given night in New York there are more people staying in homes via Airbnb than there are rooms in the biggest hotel in Manhattan.
