        <title>Instagram Adds Bios, Grid View For Profile Pages</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Instagram Adds Grid View For Profile Pages, Bio Option http://tcrn.ch/lglFwu by @alexia
            If you're like me Instagram has become a service you check the first thing you wake up in the morning, alongside Twitter and Facebook. My addiction has seriously gotten to the point where I anticipate the app's bi-monthly updates (Tilt Shift is the best thing to happen to photo sharing addicts since sliced bread).

So what's new in Version 1.7 (which just got dropped into the App Store?) The most obvious change is that when you click on someone's photo history, the app now shows you a grid view instead of a laborious feed. Users also now have the option to add a bio to their profiles, upload a profile picture from Twitter and Facebook and drill down into which profile notifications they actually want to receive.

            It's no secret that eBay has been pushing a significant mobile strategy of late, and today the company is rolling out a new app in its mobile family—an eBay Motors iPhone app. 

eBay said it made sense to launch a dedicated app for the Motors vertical (one of the company's strongest auction place verticals) , which sells cars, parts and accessories, because the volume of purchases made via eBay's main mobile apps. Currently, 90,000 parts and accessories and 2,000 cars are purchased per week globally from eBay's general mobile apps.

            In this episode of Founder Stories with host Chris Dixon, Hashable founder and CEO Michael Yavonditte delves into the conventional (lack of) wisdom, power plays and power players that helped shape paid search as we know it today.

Yavonditte, who sold advertising startup Quigo to AOL for $360 million, started his career running business development at AltaVista.  Back then, Yavonditte notes “we used to have more queries than anyone else.” Unfortunately it was during a time, as Dixon points out that “the thought was you cannot monetize search.” Like most other search engines back then, Yavonditte and company got caught up in the trendy portal wars which turned out to be “a great lesson in failure” says Yavonditte.

        <title>Chrome OS 12 — AKA: The Shipping Version — Hits Beta</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Chrome OS 12 — AKA: The Shipping Version — Hits Beta http://tcrn.ch/iSjlee by @parislemon
            Last week, just prior to day one of Google I/O, we noted that some updates in the Chrome OS code and forums indicated that a formal unveiling was likely very close. Sure enough, on day two of I/O, Google unveiled the first Chromebooks, the first shipping products running Chrome OS. But Google also noted that the first orders wouldn't start until June 15, about a month away. One reason: Chrome OS still needed a tiny bit more work. And an update today brings it very close.

Google has just updated the Chrome OS beta channel to R12, aka Chrome 12. The version, which has been in the dev channel for a couple of weeks, will now be further tested in beta for a couple of weeks before it becomes the first version of Chrome OS to go stable. Expect this to happen slightly before the June 15 date.

            Ashton Kutcher will be on stage next week at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York. The actor, entrepreneur and investor will talk with Charlie Rose on Tuesday morning, and joins what is clearly our most impressive list of speakers at any TechCrunch event to date.

His talk with Rose will be entirely focused on his new job starring in CBS's Two and a half Men.

Ok, hopefully not really.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Which Startup Is Cleared For Launch As Europe’s Next €100+ Million Exit?: This is a guest post by Monty Munford... http://tcrn.ch/mp0sNG
            This is a guest post by Monty Munford, blogger at Monty's Outlook and freelance  Mobile/social consultant is (also a Bollywood actor, next movie out April 2011). He tweets @montymunford. 

Eighteen entrepreneurs from around the UK recently spent a week on the West Coast of the US as part of Webmisson. As part of the visit, the group attended the TechCrunch offices in San Francisco and were part of an impromptu Q&A with TechCrunch's Sarah Lacy.

In a good-natured discussion, the question was posited to Lacy that perhaps business people in Europe, and especially London, were ‘nicer’ than their Silicon Valley counterparts. Lacy, somewhat witheringly, replied that maybe that was so, but which London-based companies had $10+ billion valuations?

            I sat down with Case on Friday at the TiE Silicon Valley conference to discuss how he's advocating for entrepreneur-friendly policies at a governmental level. Entrepreneurs, meanwhile, should focus on building companies they're passionate about, rather than looking for a money-making "quick flip," he said.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Geolocating Bribery http://rww.to/j4co9l
            Bribespot has developed a geolocation app that is unfortunately useful. It allows users to note attempts at bribery by public officials and pin it to a location. An international outfit headquartered in Estonia, it is unsurprising that the Baltic country responsible for Skype would lead the score sheet so far, with the rest spread around the world. But it is less than a month old so the data is not thick on the ground yet. In time, though, it has the potential to be a very interesting and useful tool for everyone from travelers to policy makers....

            Three years after founding bitly as a home-grown startup inside betaworks, John Borthwick is passing the reigns to a new CEO, Peter Stern.  Borthwick will remain CEO of betaworks and concentrate on new products and investments.  

Stern comes most recently from Zenbe, a webmail platform and mobile that went through a Facebook talent acquisition last November.  Stern, who was a co-founder, didn't go to Facebook.  He's more a New York kind of guy.  Back in the 1990s, he founded Datek, one of the original online brokerages.
