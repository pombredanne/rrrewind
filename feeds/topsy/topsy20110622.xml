        <title>PopCap Games To Be Acquired For $1 Billion+</title>
        <description><![CDATA[PopCap Games To Be Acquired For $1 Billion+ http://tcrn.ch/kkUS4v by @jasonkincaid]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[PopCap Games To Be Acquired For $1 Billion+ http://tcrn.ch/kkUS4v by @jasonkincaid
            Huge news in the gaming world: PopCap Games, the company behind such hits as Plants vs Zombies and Bejeweled, is in the process of being acquired — and we're hearing from multiple sources that the price is over $1 billion.

The question now is who the buyer is. The obvious possibility is Zynga, which has made a string of game-related acquisitions over the last year. But we're hearing they're out. Our sources say that Zynga did indeed kick the tires hard on a potential acquisition, but it looks like the company couldn't get comfortable with the price PopCap was asking for.

Popcap's revenues are in the range of $100-150 million, we hear — and a price of over $1 billion would have put the deal at a possible 10x multiple, which may have been too rich for Zynga's blood. So who else could it be?

            HTML 5 and the mobile web are supposed to be the great unifier across platforms, but we might not need such a solution. For the first time ever, Flurry Analytics says people are using apps more than they're using the mobile web on smartphones and tablets.

            Sprite Cow helps you get the background-position, width and height of sprites within a spritesheet as a nice bit of copyable css.

            Earlier today the WordPress team noticed suspicious commits to several popular plugins (AddThis, WPtouch, and W3 Total Cache) containing cleverly disguised backdoors. We determined the commits were not from the authors, rolled them back, pushed updates to the plugins, and shut down access to the plugin repository while we looked for anything else

        <title>That Apple Television Is Coming This August Alongside The iPhone Nano (And Santa)</title>
        <description><![CDATA[That Apple Television Is Coming This August Alongside The iPhone Nano (And Santa) http://tcrn.ch/kSq7IR by @parislemon]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[That Apple Television Is Coming This August Alongside The iPhone Nano (And Santa) http://tcrn.ch/kSq7IR by @parislemon
            I really wanted to do the headline without the Santa bit, but I didn't want to be that much of an ass.

Regardless, let's see how many people report this as fact just from the headline. In other words, let's catch who doesn't bother reading beyond the headline — or even the entire headline. In other words, let's see who is an idiot that should be fired or stripped of their right to blog.

But wait, my headline does have a point beyond being a (weak) trap. My point is that if you believe an Apple Television is coming later this year, I have a nice iPhone nano to sell you. Catch my drift yet?

            The Mountain View company aims to bring out a camera later this year, using a new sensor that offers a number of advantages over traditional photography, including the ability to refocus a picture after it is taken. Revolutionizing the industry won't be easy, but the company has raised $50 million in financing over the past several years to finance its ambitious goal.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is weather becoming more extreme? http://dlvr.it/X6gQs
            Extreme weather events have always been with us, and always will be.  One can't point to a single severe storm, or even an entire harsh winter, as evidence of climate change.  But a trend of weather intensity, and oddity, grows.  Droughts linger longer.  Hurricanes hit harder.  Snowstorms strike long after winter should have ended.  World record hailstones fall.  China endures a crippling drought, and then punishing floods.  Millions are displaced in a flood of historic proportion in Pakistan.  The U.S. sees the Mississippi River reach historic flood crests, and then sees the largest wildfire in Arizona history.  None of these events on their own mean anything.  Collectively, do they mean we're seeing the earth's climate change before our eyes?

            Yesterday we made a code update at 1:54pm Pacific time that introduced a bug affecting our authentication mechanism. We discovered this at 5:41pm and a fix was live at 5:46pm. A very small number of users (much less than 1 percent) logged in during that period, some of whom could have logged into an account without the correct password. As a precaution, we ended all logged in sessions.

            We've always put a heavy emphasis on performance at Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Not just because we're performance wonks (guilty!), but because we think speed is a competitive advantage. There's plenty of experimental data proving that the slower your website loads and displays, the less people will use it.

        <title>Joe Hewitt’s First Post-Facebook Web Gift: Inertial Scrolling For All</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe Hewitt&#39;s First Post-Facebook Web Gift: Inertial Scrolling For All http://tcrn.ch/jGPJRQ by @parislemon
            Back in early May, developer Joe Hewitt surprised a lot of people when he abruptly announced he was leaving Facebook after nearly four years. Hewitt had been vital to everything from the social network's iPhone app (the most popular app of all time) to (supposedly) the don't-call-it-a-phone secret phone project. But he apparently wanted to return closer to his pure web roots (he was an early developer of Firefox and built the still widely-used Firebug dev tool). And today we're seeing the first fruits of that journey back.

Hewitt has just announced a new site, Up on a Hill, a photo blog he made in collaboration with his girlfriend, Laura Copeland. The site itself looks great, but the real key (at least from the tech perspective) is Hewitt's use of Scrollability, the native scrolling framework he created for mobile web apps.

            People using Facebook in work is a huge problem for employers and some go as far as banning it completely for all their employees in a fruitless bid to increase productivity. Well a new app from Diesel is seeking to solve that problem and allow you to access Facebook all day long without anybody being the wiser that you are social networking instead of working on tiresome documents.

            Google, Google, Google … I don't know if it’s that you just don't understand the intricacies of intrapersonal relationships or if getting the social stuff right is just extremely difficult. Whatever the cause, it looks like you’ve made another faux pas with your innocent Father’s Day reminder to give Dad a call via Gmail for Father’s Day, which offended the sizable number of people who for one reason or another weren’t able to call their fathers yesterday.

The backlash, taking place primarily in this support thread in Google's Voice Chat forum, Twitter and Hacker News, refers specifically to the note under Chat in Gmail that said “Reminder: Call dad” all day.
