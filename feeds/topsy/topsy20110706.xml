        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Remember When Twitter Was A Joke? No One Is Laughing Anymore. http://tcrn.ch/rk0RsY by @parislemon
            I recall a time a few years ago when Twitter was scoffed at. It was the blogosphere's punching-bag. It was the stupid little service that no one in their right mind would ever use. It was for people who wanted to share the mundane bits of their lives — that no one else wanted to read. It was for egomaniacs. Or losers. It would never catch on.

And then it did.

I was thinking about this today as I stood in the East Room of the White House (#humblebrag). Why was I there? To see Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey moderate a Q&A session with President Obama. Yes, the President of the United States was answering questions that were coming entirely from Twitter, the formerly stupid service that was a joke, remember?

            Google is the company that started out with a simple mission – don’t be evil. I think they meant it when they started. They have grown to be one of the biggest companies on the planet. I am not so sure they remember their original mission. Their image search feature allows them to profit from other people’s work without compensation. Their TOS (terms of service) allows them license to images — that I find concerning. Why am I bringing all this up now?

        <title>Why Mark Zuckerberg’s First Public Response To Google+ Is The Right One</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[RT @TechCrunch: Why Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s First Public Response To Google+ Is The Right One http://tcrn.ch/rubL6c
            Editor's note: This guest post is written by Tom Anderson, the former President, founder and first friend on MySpace.

Today at the Facebook news conference, a reporter asked Mark Zuckerberg what he thought of Google+.  Zuckerberg responded by saying that lots of companies are going to build things like video chat, but Facebook competitors also have to build up their social graph first. Facebook's job is to just keep innovating. It's a perfectly reasonable response, and of course, he's exactly right—the challenge is to get the user base, and make it easy for them to use your product. Done and done for Facebook. The integration looks great. 

Some pundits are complaining that the technology is not new, but that's besides the point. Case in point: at MySpace we launched what Zuckerberg is announcing in 2007 (try googling

        <title>Facebook Launches Skype-Powered Video Calling</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Launches Skype-Powered Video Calling http://tcrn.ch/qMvUUb by @jasonkincaid
            Confirming our report last week, Facebook has just announced a major new feature that it's launching in tandem with Skype: video calling.

It's a feature that's been rumored for quite a while, and it's one that Facebook is putting a lot of weight behind. Now, whenever you browse to a friend's profile, you'll see a new button nestled between the 'Message' and 'Poke' buttons that says 'Call'. Click that, the other user will see a popup asking if they want to accept a call, and you'll be immediately connected (you'll need to install a small plugin the first time you use the service).

You'll also see video calling integrated into Facebook's Chat product. Really, you can't miss it — Facebook is launching a new chat sidebar today that by default it takes the entire right side of the screen, and the first time you click on any user you'll see a prompt asking if you'd like to make your first video call.

        <title>If Google Buzz Is A Black Hole For Sharing Traffic, Google+ Is The Big Bang</title>
        <description><![CDATA[If Google Buzz Is A Black Hole For Sharing Traffic, Google+ Is The Big Bang http://tcrn.ch/nymUH1 by @parislemon]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[If Google Buzz Is A Black Hole For Sharing Traffic, Google+ Is The Big Bang http://tcrn.ch/nymUH1 by @parislemon
            Back in March of last year, we noted that Google Buzz, Google's shiny new social network at the time, was getting smoked in terms of referral traffic sent our way, by a dead man, FriendFeed. It turns out, Google's own Analytics service was undercounting Buzz because it resides in Gmail, which uses HTTPS, which strips out referral information. In other words, most Buzz traffic could only be inferred, not seen. Still, after months of looking over the data, I'm not convinced that Buzz actually sends any amount of meaningful traffic whatsoever. The same is not true of the newly launched Google+ so far.

Yes, it has only been out for a week at this point (and is still only available to a very limited number of users), but based on what we're seeing, the social network is already sending a large amount of traffic our way.
