            We couldn't wait any longer to announce another batch of special guests for this year's Disrupt in NYC. We had around 80 speakers last year and we have even more this year. 

We are pleased to announce that Tim Armstrong, Mary Meeker, Dennis Crowley, and Chris Dixon will all be with us on stage at Disrupt NYC. They will join the guests we announced yesterday—Charlie Rose, Ron Conway, Roelof Botha, and Arianna Huffington. As you can see, we are not messing around. We said Disrupt would be big this year and we meant it.

Tickets are still on sale and you can find the best deals here. As we said before, make sure you purchase them as soon as you can since prices will go up as we get closer to the event. We are giving away 1 free ticket each week, and our giveaway for this week started this morning at 10am PST. We will be picking the winner tomorrow, so if you want to enter make sure you do so soon!

            Here is another chance to win a free ticket to this year's Disrupt in NYC. We have confirmed some incredible guests and speakers, a few of which we announced yesterday. We will continue to announce more as we lead up to Disrupt, along with a few special surprises as well.

We also announced some other exciting news yesterday. Disrupt NYC is so big this year, we have taken over a whole pier in New York City. We will be holding this year’s Disrupt NYC at Pier 94—overlooking the Hudson River in west Midtown Manhattan. At over 133,000 sq. ft., this venue is by far the largest venue we’ve ever had and will make for an amazing event. A special congratulations to Matt MaCarty for winning last week's giveaway.

This promises to be our biggest Disrupt yet. If you want a chance at winning this free ticket, all you have to do is follow the steps below.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Android Phones Track Your Location, Too http://rww.to/fQ8wMv
            Researchers have discovered that smartphones running Google's Android operating system are tracking users' locations and storing that data in files on the phone. This news comes only days after the discovery of a similar file on Apple's iPhone, which also logs a complete history of users' travels by way of timestamped latitude and longitude coordinates. The iPhone tracking file was revealed by data scientists Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden at O'Reilly's Where 2.0 conference in Santa Clara this week, raising serious enough privacy concerns to attract the attention of U.S. senators....

            At this year's overcrowded and overhyped SXSW conference in Austin, one of the few startups to break through the noise was group text messaging app GroupMe.  How did GroupMe win SXSW?  Grilled cheese.  The company rented an outdoor food shack for something like $10,000 and turned it into the GroupMe Grill with free grilled cheese sandwiches and beer.  The grilled cheese, says co-founder Steve Martocci in this episode of Founder Stories, was

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[How to Spot a Social Media Faker in Ten Seconds http://bit.ly/hInTqY
            As time goes by and I spend more time on Twitter, two things seem to be happening. On the one hand, I am finding that the number of great people and amazing relationships I build on a daily basis, is only growing. As more people join Twitter and the micro blogging service hits the mainstream, I am regularly meeting new folks that are not necessarily part of the “early adopter” community, and that is great.

            The Cloud is ‘down’ this morning and it’s all over the news. Amazon is having problems in one of their co-los and of course it’s the most popular one, US-East in Virginia. Inevitably pundits all over the web are nodding sagely opining that yes, the cloud is all very good and well but you see this is the problem, when it goes down you’re toast.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[With Bridg.me The Conference Calls You http://tcrn.ch/hsakAU by @alexia
            Yes the headline here is actually this startup's trademarked tagline, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to feature a Yakov Smirnoff reference on TechCrunch (yes, I know, I'm old).

In the same conference calling space as Zipdx and Lippt, the idea for Bridg.me was pitched at last week's NYC Startup Weekend by Justin Isaf and created by Justin Heilman and Jagdish Repaswal that day. Basically the gist is that current conference call platforms, with their dial in systems and unwieldy PIN access codes, are way too complicated to be productive. Being able to arrange such a call should be as simple as posting an event in your Google calendar.

            The economy is bleeding by the side of the road. We are bombing another oil-rich Muslim country. The planet is hotter now than it has been for three million years. And I want to talk today about why we should vote to change the voting system here in Britain next week. No! Wait! Don't lapse into a coma! Stab cigarettes into your arm to stay conscious! Stay with me! We only get to do this once in a generation.

            Oscar-nominated British film director and photographer Tim Hetherington (L) climbs from a building in Misurata on April 20, 2011.  Getty Images photographer Chris Hondros walks in Misurata on April 18, 2011. Both men, 41, were killed and two other Western journalists were wounded in a mortar attack on April 20, 2011, in the western port city of Misurata. Hetherington and Hondros were the second and third journalists killed in Libya during the two-month-old war between rebels seeking to overthrow Moammar Gaddafi and forces loyal to the strongman, who has ruled for 41 years.

            Xtify, a mobile app platform that provides publishers with custom tools for push notifications (even when the app is closed), is launching its Retain product today.

If you're like me you probably have about 20 to 30 apps on your phone you never use.

            Groupon has a fever, and the only prescription is more funding. According to this SEC form, the daily deal giant has received yet another infusion of capital, this time at just over $6 million. This comes on the heels of Groupon's recent $16.2 million round as well as its unprecedented $950 million round back in January.

The funding, it seems, is directly related to its recent acquisition of Pelago. According to the filing,

            Kiva.org, one of the pioneers in micro-lending to international entrepreneurs, has expanded into a new vertical today— Kiva Green Loans.

Green Loans, which can be accessed from a new module on the lend tab, is a new vertical that allows the Kiva community to make loans towards green businesses and individuals who are helping make the transition to cleaner and more efficient sources of energy. Kiva Green Loans include both business and personal loans that contribute towards reducing energy expenditures, minimizing waste and pollution, recycling, or re-purposing used materials.
