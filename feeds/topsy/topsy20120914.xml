        <content:encoded><![CDATA[BREAKING: Wisconsin judge strikes down state&#39;s controversial law that limits collective bargaining http://t.co/sFkxOdKs
            MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin judge on Friday struck down nearly all of the state law championed by Gov. Scott Walker that effectively ended collective bargaining rights for most public workers. Walker's administration immediately vowed to appeal, while unions, which have vigorously fought the law, declared victory.

            President Obama's apologies to jihadists and his lack of response to attacks in Libya and Egypt are reminiscent of the naive policies of President Jimmy Carter.

            Today, President Obama released the long-awaited “sequestration report,” detailing the cuts the White House would make to the budget under last year’s Budget Control Act if no deal is reached in Congress. And there, buried on page 136, is the White House’s proposed cuts to “Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance.” $129 million. That’s a full 8.2 percent of the possible sequestrable amount. It’s a massive slash of the budget for our embassies, consulates, and security abroad.

            Three of the state's top elected Republicans on Thursday determined they lacked sufficient evidence of President Barack Obama's birth records to decide whether to remove the Democratic nominee from the November ballot in Kansas.The State Objections Board comprised of Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Attorney General Derek Schmidt and Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer postponed until Monday action on a complaint filed by a Manhattan resident pending review of a copy of Obama's birth certificate from Hawaii.

            TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Violent protests outside the U.S. embassy in Tunis were met with tear gas and gunshots Friday, leaving two people dead, 29 others injured and waves of black smoke wafting over the city.Several dozen protesters briefly stormed the U.S. Embassy compound in Tunisia's capital, setting fire to cars and raising a flag with the Muslim profession of faith on it as part of the protests against an anti-Muslim film.Earlier, several thousand demonstrators had gathered outside the U.S. embassy, including stone-throwing protesters who clashed with police, according to an Associated Press reporter on the scene. Police responded with gunshots and tear gas.The state news agency TAP, citing the health ministry, said both of those killed were demonstrators, while the injured included both protesters and police.A Tunisian employee of the U.S. embassy who had an injured leg was taken out on a stretcher to an ambulance. It wasn't immediately clear if there were any other injuries. Embassy spokespeople did not respond to calls and emails.Protesters also set fire to an American school adjacent to the embassy compound and prevented firefighters from approaching it. Thick columns of black smoke wafted through the neighborhood.The group that breached the U.S. embassy's outer wall was eventually pushed back outside by police and special forces. As night fell, the crowd of protesters outside the embassy dwindled to a handful.Crowds angry over an anti-Muslim film ridiculing the Prophet Muhammad have assaulted U.S. embassies across the Middle East.

MITT ROMNEY:  Thank you, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: Boy, there has been quite a controversy in the last couple of days, since those killings in Libya, the chaos in the Middle East.  And we heard some of that at your event today. President Obama has stepped in as well.  He said your comments on Tuesday night displayed a tendency of yours to “shoot first and aim later.”  What’s your response? MITT ROMNEY: Well, early on, with…

        <title>Telephoned bomb threats send campuses scrambling</title>
        <description><![CDATA[University of Texas issues evacuation order &quot;due to threats on campus&quot;: http://t.co/Y3Rm8VL5 -SC]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[University of Texas issues evacuation order &quot;due to threats on campus&quot;: http://t.co/Y3Rm8VL5 -SC
            AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Separate bomb threats Friday on college campuses in Texas and North Dakota ended as false alarms after thousands of people followed urgently worded evacuation orders, one of which some worried didn't come fast enough.The FBI was working to determine whether the phoned-in threats to the University of Texas and North Dakota State University were related. No explosives were found, and both campuses reopened by early afternoon.Both campuses emptied at quick but orderly paces when the initial alerts were issued, though students acknowledged an air of confusion about what was going on. The threats coming as violent protests outside U.S. embassies in the Middle East also stirred nervous tension among some students, and Texas officials acknowledged global events were taken into account.The first threat came around 8:35 a.m. to the University of Texas from a man claiming to belong to al-Qaida, officials said. The caller claimed bombs placed throughout campus would go off in 90 minutes, but administrators waited more than an hour before blaring sirens on the campus of 50,000 students and telling them to immediately "get as far away as possible" in emergency text messages.Authorities said they started searching buildings for explosives before the alert was issued. UT President Bill Powers defended the decision not to evacuate sooner."It's easy to make a phone call ... the first thing we needed to do was evaluate," Powers said. "If the threat had been for something to go off in five minutes, then you don't have the time to evaluate, you just have to pull the switch."Not everyone agreed."What took so long?" student Ricardo Nunez said. "It should have been more immediate."North Dakota State University President Dean Bresciani said about 20,000 people left the Fargo school's campuses as part of an evacuation "that largely took place in a matter of minutes." FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said NDSU received a call about 9:45 a.m. that included a "threat of an explosive device."Police and school officials said the evacuation was as organized as could be expected, with one campus employee describing people as "being North Dakota nice" while driving away."Nobody was panicked and nobody was trying to speed or run over anybody," said Juleen Berg, who works at the NDSU heating plant. "Everybody was waiting their turn."Graduate student Lee Kiedrowski of Dickinson, N.D., said he was walking on the NDSU campus when he got a text message telling him to evacuate within 15 minutes."The panic button wasn't triggered quite immediately," Kiedrowski said. "But there was definitely the thought that we live in a different world now, and with everything that's going on with the riots at the U.S. embassies in the Middle East, your brain just starts moving. You never really know what's going on."The UT president acknowledged officials in Texas also considered the current political climate."Certainly the global situation would be part of what we look at when we evaluate any threat," Powers said.Sirens wailed on the Austin campus and cellphones pinged with text messages when the initial alert when out. Students described more confusion than panic as they exited the sprawling campus, where police blocked off all roads heading in as lines of cars sat in gridlock trying to get out.The evacuation also created logistical concerns for the 14th-ranked Texas Longhorns football team. Inside a police station across from the football stadium, executive senior associate athletics director Ed Goble asked about getting the athletics complex building cleared because the team had to leave for a Saturday game at the University of Mississippi. The team's locker room is inside the building.Goble later said he wasn't asking that the team be made a priority. Shortly after 11 a.m., while the rest of campus remained almost deserted, Goble said police had given players permission to go into the athletic complex to pack for the game."All building managers are notified at the same time and all are expected to move as rapidly as possible," said Gary Susswein, spokesman for the UT president's office, noting there was no priorities list for what buildings were to be cleared first.With rain falling, students stood under awnings and overhangs and inundated nearby off-campus restaurants and coffee shops as they waited for updates.Abby Johnston, a production and special editions coordinator for Texas Student Media, said she received the first text message from the university while thinking about what she would publish in the next day's paper. Then the sirens blared."We do the siren test once a month and so at first people thought maybe it was just a test, and then we started to tell everybody, 'No actually we have to get out of here pretty immediately,'" said Johnston, 22. "There was definitely a little bit of nervous tension."Tania Lara, a graduate student at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said she was at work inside a central campus academic building when she got a text message to get as far away was possible."It was calm but nobody knew what was going on," she said, describing a crush of students heading for the exits. "No one was yelling 'get out of here' or anything like that."Also Friday, Valparaiso University in Indiana increased security and posted a warning to students on its website after a vague threat was discovered scrawled in graffiti. The school said the threat claimed "dangerous and criminal activity" would occur during the university's daily chapel break.The FBI and local authorities searched the campus but found nothing suspicious and university spokeswoman Nicole Niemi said classes and other regular activities would go on.___Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Austin, Ramit Plushnick-Masti in Houston, Nomaan Merchant in Dallas; Paul J. Weber in San Antonio; Dave Kolpack in Fargo, N.D.; and Ashley M. Heher in Chicago contributed to this report.
