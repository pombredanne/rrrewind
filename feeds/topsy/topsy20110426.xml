            I still don't particularly like the fact that Google decided to bundle Adobe Flash with their Chrome web browser about a year ago. Apple preference aside, the last thing I want is the buggy, often insecure, and performance killing plug-in shoved in my face. More importantly, I think it's a maneuver that will only serve to slow the transition to HTML5. But Google has their reasons. And today, we see one of the good ones.

Google has maintained since they started bundling Flash that it was mainly to ensure they could make it more secure for their Chrome users. They do this by both sandboxing it and auto-updating it when the security patches regularly appear. But a new feature has just hit the Chrome dev builds which also now allows users to easily clear Flash cookies from within the browser.

        <title>Milk Completes $1.5 Million Angel Round, Packed with Valley Names</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Milk Completes $1.5 Million Angel Round, Packed with Valley Names  http://tcrn.ch/dLApni by @sarahcuda
            Kevin Rose has completed a hefty $1.5 million angel round for his new mobile development lab, which we first reported in March, Milk. Rose went for the more-is-more approach, pulling in a wide-syndicate of Valley elites, including TechCrunch's Michael Arrington.

Other angels include Ron Conway, Tim Ferriss, Dave Morin, Philip Rosedale, Evan Williams, Shervin Pishevar, Joshua Schachter, Anthony Casalena, Ashton Kutcher, Philip Kaplan, Chris Sacca, Gary Vanyerchuk, Tony Hsieh, Chamath Palihapitiya, Matt Mullenweg, Matt Williams, Tony Conrad via True Ventures, and Rob Hayes.

As we predicted, the list is rounded out by Floodgate's Mike Maples and Greylock's David Sze, two of Digg's biggest investors who are betting on Rose again. Missing from the list are a few other Digg angels like Reid Hoffman and Marc Andreessen, but it's an impressive mix of VCs, angels and Web personalities.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Survey: 39 Percent Of Smartphone Owners Use Their Devices In The Bathroom http://tcrn.ch/fWnkE8 by @leenarao
            Google recently commissioned a survey (in partnership with market research firm Ipsos OTX) to gain insight into the usage and behavior of U.S. consumers with regard to their smartphones. According to Google, the goal of the research was to understand how smartphones are used in consumer’s daily lives and specifically how it has influenced how consumers search, shop and respond to mobile advertising.

The study confirms what most of us already know. The report finds that in terms of general usage, 93% of smartphone users use their phones at home; 81% browse the Internet and 77% search on their phones, 72% of smartphone users use their phones while consuming other media. One-third of smartphone owners use their phones while watching TV. And 45% of smartphone consumers use their phones to help them to manage and plan activities, such as for dinner plans, travel arrangements and finances. Google says that 39% admit to having used their smarpthone while going to the bathroom and one in five users would give up their Cable TV in order to keep using their smartphones.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon Will Add At Least Nine Fulfillment Centers In 2011 To Meet Demand  http://tcrn.ch/i8kVfs by @leenarao
            Amazon reported earnings today, posting strong sales results but missing on net income. Sales came in at $9.86 billion in the first quarter, which is up 38 percent from the same quarter in 2010. On the earnings call CFO Thomas Szkutak said that Amazon is planning to open at least nine fulfillment centers to meet growing demand in sales across the globe.

Amazon's fulfillment centers enables the company and third-party merchants to store inventory and fulfill orders. He says that at least one of the nine fulfillment centers is currently operational, and another one should be up and running imminently. He expects seven more to open this year, and Amazon may add more if demand grows. Amazon currently has over 50 fulfillment centers across the globe.

            Sony has finally come clean: the hackers have successfully compromised PSN security, and they have the personal information of every user. While it's still unclear whether credit card accounts have been stolen as well, Sony asks that you be safe, rather than sorry.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s Sales Up 38 Percent To $9.86B in Q1, Net Income Down 33 Percent http://tcrn.ch/ekDI4g by @leenarao
            E-commerce giant Amazon just reported first quarter 2011 result, posting $9.86 billion in the first quarter, which is up 38 percent from the same quarter in 2010. 

Unfortunately, Amazon's net income decreased 33% to $201 million in the first quarter, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with net income of $299 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in first quarter 2010.  Amazon says that excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales would have grown 36% compared with first quarter 2010. Analysts expected 60 cents per share, on sales of $9.53 billion.

            Sad news for astronomy and for alien research, and even worse news if there is in fact intelligent life out there wanting to contact Earth. The SETI Institute, which operates the Allen Telescope Array in northern Californa (made famous in the Jodie Foster film Contact), says that due to government budget cutbacks, it no longer has the funds to maintain its search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nielsen: Consumer Desire For Android Grows, Unlike iOS And Blackberry http://tcrn.ch/eoK9Dr by @robinwauters
            Nielsen ran monthly surveys of mobile consumers in the United States from July to September 2010, and said back then that 33 percent expressed interest for an Apple iPhone, while slightly more than a quarter (26 percent) said they desired a device with Android and 13 percent said they wanted a Blackberry device. 

This morning, Nielsen posited that those same surveys for January 2011 to March 2011 now show that 31 percent of consumers who plan to get a new smartphone indicated that Android was now their preferred OS. Apple’s iOS has slipped slightly in popularity, to 30 percent.

            Lawson Software, a global provider of enterprise software this morning announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by GGC Software Holdings, an affiliate of private equity investment firm Golden Gate Capital and Infor. The transaction has a total value of approximately $2 billion.
 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Lawson will receive $11.25 per share in cash, a premium of about 14 percent to Lawson’s closing share price on March 7, 2011, the last trading day prior to news reports speculating about a potential deal brewing.
