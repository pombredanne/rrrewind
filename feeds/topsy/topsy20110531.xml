        <title>Google’s Eric Schmidt: We Just Renewed Maps Partnership With Apple</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Google&#39;s Eric Schmidt: We Just Renewed Maps Partnership With Apple http://tcrn.ch/mEcGHL by @jasonkincaid]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google&#39;s Eric Schmidt: We Just Renewed Maps Partnership With Apple http://tcrn.ch/mEcGHL by @jasonkincaid
            Today during a keynote interview at AllThingsD's D9, Google Executive Chairman (and former longtime CEO) made a key announcement: Google has recently renewed its partnership with Apple over mapping and search. In other words, don't look for a new version of Maps on iOS at next month's WWDC.

So, why is this important? Apple has long shipped every iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad with a Maps application powered by Google. It's great (though arguably not as good as its Android counterpart). But Apple and Google are competing fiercely in the mobile market, and every time someone runs a search using Maps from an iOS device, Apple is handing Google a little more data that could be used to further improve their local products.

            You may know Vudu as the startup bringing high definition movie rentals and rent-to-own services to set-top boxes like PlayStation 3 and the Boxee Box. And most TVs and Blu-ray players. Vudu recently became the second streaming service to receive its own dedicated button on Vizio's remote controls, following Netflix. 

You may also know Peter Gabriel, the British rocker who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of Genesis. The man responsible for Sledgehammer. What you may not know is that Gabriel is the front man and lead investor in a rapidly growing recommendation service called The Filter. Or that today The Filter is officially announcing that it has been tapped by Vudu to power its recommendation engine.

            Cyberattacks are part of the defense landscape and have been for a while. Among the more high-profile instances in the last year are the Stuxnet attack by the U.S. and Israel on Iranian nuclear facilities, the attacks by the Chinese government on Google and even a hack of a Pentagon project. Now, the Wall Street Journal says a soon-to-be-released Pentagon policy document will announce officially that a cyberattack can be a jus ad bellum, or act of war....

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Study: 60% of Generation Y Leaning Toward Cutting the Cord http://rww.to/l93SsN
            A survey released today aims to show cable providers how they can keep losing their and influential viewers from cutting the cable. Ideas and Solutions, a Los Angeles-based consultant group for media and technology companies, says that 60% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 were either leaning towards or seriously considering giving up paid television. The Ideas and Solutions report, which is greatly skewed to the point of view of the paid television operators, puts the so-called Generation Y demographic of 70 million TV watchers into three groups - "loyalists," "leaners" and "at-risk." Not surprisingly, the "at-risk"...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Twitter Photo Storage and Account Integration in iOS 5: http://df4.us/hpq
            We’ve heard from multiple sources that Twitter is likely to have a big-time partner for such a service: Apple. Specifically, we’re hearing that Apple’s new iOS 5 will come with an option to share images to Twitter baked into the OS. This would be similar to the way you can currently share videos on YouTube with one click in iOS.

            There were a lot of stellar startups at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC last week, and unfortunately, there could only be one set of finalists and one winner. Of course, that doesn't mean that those companies that didn't make the final heat aren't worthy of some love. 

The Daily followed the entrepreneurs behind three Disrupt NYC battlefield competitors, SpotOn, Spenz, and Madbrook Publishing through their unique experiences at Disrupt. They came by plane, train, and automobile, fought some nerves, endured some ups and downs, but in the end were exposed to a host of eyeballs and launched successfully.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Zynga Channels Settlers Of Catan In New Social Combat Game Empires &amp; Allies; Debuts In 12 L.. http://tcrn.ch/mQclu3 by @leenarao
            Social gaming giant Zynga is launching its latest game tomorrow—Empires & Allies, the company's first strategy combat game. Zynga is going big with this launch, debuting the game on Facebook in 12 languages (CityVille only launched  in 5 languages). Zynga says this is the gaming company's most social title to date. 

Empires & Allies, which is the company’s first title to be launched out of Zynga's Los Angeles studio, is set on a sprawling multi-island game board. The game itself is a cross between FarmVille and CityVille in terms of the layout and overall feel. There are two main parts to the game. First, players aim to build a island-nation by arming themselves against enemy forces and preparing for battle. Second, throughout the game, players build army units, recruit friends, and encounter allies and villains as fight their way across enemy-held territories on the quest to defeat the final villain. It's sort of like Risk meets CityVille meets Settlers of Catan.

            I'll admit I haven't been on Quora as much recently, in large part due to being unceremoniously blocked by the company for subscribing to an excessive amount of RSS feeds (but that's another story). However, today, I stumbled across a great Quora thread started by tech insider Robert Scoble. The question: "Which tech startups currently (June 2011) need and deserve angel funding?" Of course, the resulting list is a lot of self-serving posts from startups hoping to cash in on Scoble's influence, but frankly, I don't care. I'm obsessed with this thread and the startups that keep appearing there, minute...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Path Lands Another Ex-Facebooker To Run Ops http://tcrn.ch/mfJ5pJ by @parislemon
            It's something that Dave Morin isn't too quick to talk about, but it's impossible to ignore: his new startup, Path, is becoming quite the gathering ground for ex-Facebook employees. Of course, Morin's reluctance to establish the connection probably has to do with the fact that he used to be the head of Platform there, and still has close ties to the company. But the small startup just hired its fourth ex-Facebooker today. And the latest is a pretty big one, considering he had been at Facebook over four years.

Matthew Welty will be Path's new Head of Operations, Morin tells us. Welty had been an operations engineer at Facebook for the past four-plus years. For some perspective on how long he had been there, when he joined in April 2007, Facebook had 20 million active users. Today, they're about to hit 700 million active users.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[YouTube&#39;s New Strategy: Create a Network Of Networks http://tcrn.ch/mxrEnn by @erickschonfeld
            YouTube is now showing approximately 3 billion videos a day.  A growing proportion of those are shown with ads—more than 2 billion a week—and YouTube as a business is expected to pass $1 billion in revenue next year.  

But when it comes to making money, some videos do better than others. For YouTube, it is all about scale, and networks of loosely aligned online video producers scale better than individual shows and viral-video phenoms.  In fact, there is a brand new department inside YouTube called Networks.  The purpose of the department is encourage the formation of these outside networks which then use YouTube as their distribution channel.

            VMware has acquired social communications platform Socialcast. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. 

Socialcast, which raised nearly $10 million in funding, combines a corporate activity stream that ties into CRM and ERP systems with social bookmarking, Outlook and SharePoint integrations, mobile (iPhone and Blackberry) and desktop (Air) apps, and analytics. Co-workers can share knowledge and updates in a semi-private setting. The company, which has over 7000 customers, offers both hosted and behind-the-firewall options.
