Is Twitter like a spoken conversation, the kind you ... http://bit.ly/l4yENz
            Is Twitter like a spoken conversation, the kind you would have with friends in a bar? Or is it like a written discussion? One of the things that can make Twitter hard to define is that it can be both of those at the same time.

        <title>When Facebook Captured Beluga, They May Have Harpooned It In The Head</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[When Facebook Captured Beluga, They May Have Harpooned It In The Head http://tcrn.ch/jOxAF9 by @parislemon
            When Facebook acquired Beluga this past March, it was an interesting deal for them. Interesting, because they previously had only done deals for talent. But this deal, they told us, was for both talent and assets. In other words, they were also interested in the technology behind Beluga. More importantly, the plan was to keep Beluga running. And they have. Sort of.

Over the past several weeks, users of Beluga have probably noticed some major reliability issues. These range from the mobile apps missing messages because they're unable to connect to the service, to the service's website being totally down. Last night, Beluga was totally down for a few hours. There was no indication why it was down, even after it came back. This has been happening more frequently. Not good.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[OMG/JK: iCloud, gWallet, and tPhotos http://tcrn.ch/kqHC5o by @parislemon
            In this week's episode of OMG/JK, Jason and I start off with a preview of what may be coming at Apple's WWDC event next week in San Francisco. Then we get into what Google unveiled at their NFC event in New York City last week. And finally, we talk about Twitter's move into the photo space.

All three topics have a bit of controversy surrounding them. First of all, WWDC will not feature a new iPhone for the first time in several years. Second, it took PayPal a matter of hours to sue Google after Google Wallet was announced. And third, the Twitter developer ecosystem is up in arms again after Twitter has moved to fill another hole. Well, at least TwitPic is, for sure.

            We thought we had seen every type of app and interactive billboard campaign under the sun until we came across this brilliant one from Mcdonald’s that the company ran in Sweden recently. The concept is a simple one in that users get to control the billboard and turn it in to a personal game. By completing the game in 30 seconds win coupons for free food in the nearest Mcdonald’s restaurant.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hornik on Blippy: &quot;Apparently I Was More Interested in Sharing Credit Card Purchases than the A.. http://tcrn.ch/mRWLdK by @sarahcuda
            Let's be honest: One of the reasons David Hornik actually agreed to be on camera at All Things D is that he didn't have a startup about to file to go public any second. So we talked about some of his more high profile investments that haven't always lived up to the hype.

Hornik explains why reports of Blippy's death have been greatly exaggerated, and why he says the investment still wasn't a mistake. What's more he dishes (sort of) of the nine-figure annual revenues of another portfolio company Say Media-- the love child of VideoEgg and SixApart. And he tells us about an enterprise software company that's a budding sleeper hit.

More broadly, he argues the immediate-hit-or-it's-a-failure misses the point of venture investing. (A philosophy Reid Hoffman might agree with after a decade-long slog at LinkedIn.)

        <title>David Hornik: Why Real Entrepreneurs Aren’t in it for the Money (TCTV)</title>

            We haven't done Ask a VC for a while thanks to my hectic travel schedule, so I pulled David Hornik out of the hallway at D to catch up on his thoughts on his portfolio and the industry.

But first, we chat about the highlights from the All Things Digital conference. Or we started with that and then talked about how the motivation for starting companies is changing in Silicon Valley, given the soaring valuations and ease of raising money.

And Hornik explains why he's not a fan of Peter Thiel's 20 Under 20 Program, although he admits he still hasn't paid off his own law school education.

        <title>Gillmor Gang 6.04.11 (TCTV)</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Gillmor Gang 6.04.11 (TCTV) http://tcrn.ch/iA6ltM by @stevegillmor
            The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, John Taschek, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — shuddered with expectant glee at Apple's presumed iCloud announcement at next week's WWDC event. It's clear from all the leaks, most interestingly from Apple itself, that the record companies are finally healthy enough to move into the new streaming era. With Lady Gaga selling five times as many records as the next entry on the album charts, the numbers have strongly tipped from retail to downloads.

Amazon helped by subsidizing over a million copies at $1 a sale (8 bucks to Lady Gaga), but by next time, the market will have moved almost completely online. This gives Apple the leverage to get the TV/cable networks and the movie studios on board, with Netflix playing the Amazon role in stoking demand for streaming. Live events are last, probably following the heavyweight boxing matches of Ali and Tyson via pay-per-view but direct to Apple TV and its competitors, of which there are none. iCloud is the moment when the bits stay where they are, and the checksum becomes the value point. See you Monday for a special Gillmor Gang extra.
