            Hot dogs. Juicy, succulent, mouth savoring meat. A pink mixed mash of deliciousness. See hot dog, want hot dog, eat hot dog. That's what I think, at least. I might have to think twice though. Some truly disgusting stuff is sometimes found in a hotdiggity.

            It’s been a general consensus in the EdgeRank community that 3rd party APIs (HootSuite, TweetDeck, etc) are punished in Facebook’s EdgeRank algorithm. We ran a study across our entire data set to provide evidence that our hypothesis is true. The result of our study was quite conclusive. Using a 3rd party API to update your Facebook Page decreases your engagement per fan (on average) by about 70%.

            We knew in July that Apple had passed the imploding Nokia for the global smartphone unit lead by manufacturer. However, today Digitimes forecasts that by year end Apple will have sold 86.4 million iPhones by year which will easily best Nokia’s once insurmountable lead (Nokia had over double Apple’s share just last year).

            Customer service, by definition, is about serving people; it should be genuine, personalized, and compassionate—or, simply put, human. For most organizations, customer service is an afterthought. And since servicing customers is primarily viewed as a cost center, customers are often treated as a liability. Yet, customers are a valuable resource: their feedback is integral to shaping your product and building your brand. Customers are not shy about exercising their clout, shouting their experiences—good and bad—to the world.

http://t.co/1q3EUVG
            Orson Scott Card has rewritten Hamlet. The back of this slim novella boasts that once we have read this "revelatory version of the Hamlet story, Shakespeare's play will be much more fun to watch—because now you'll know what's really going on." The author has previously updated other Shakespearean plays, rendering them more intelligible to modern audiences while supposedly retaining the “flavor” of the originals.
