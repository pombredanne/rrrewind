            New York City Mayor Bloomberg calls for major immigration reform:

The Mayor proposed green cards for graduates with advanced degrees in essential fields; a new visa for entrepreneurs with investors ready to invest capital in their job-creating idea; more temporary and permanent visas for highly skilled workers...The Mayor also announced the results of a study conducted by the Partnership for a New American Economy – a bipartisan group of business leaders and mayors from across the country – that found more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants and those companies employ more than 10 million people worldwide and have combined revenues of $4.2 trillion.

        <title>Behold: Facebook’s Secret Photo Sharing App</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Behold: Facebook&#39;s Secret Photo Sharing App http://tcrn.ch/jEcXMF by @parislemon]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Behold: Facebook&#39;s Secret Photo Sharing App http://tcrn.ch/jEcXMF by @parislemon
            Last night, something very interesting came our way. Something massive — documents and images outlining what appears to be a new Facebook iPhone app built around photo sharing. We teased what we had with a single image last night. Now, as promised, here's the rest.

A few notes: the images we have suggest that while polished, this still may be a work in progress. It's clear that some of these mock-ups are older than other ones, given a few documents we have as well. Also, some images make it seem as if the service will eventually reside within the existing Facebook iPhone app, while others seem to showcase an entirely new app (or a completely redesigned Facebook app). It's entirely possible that both will be correct. It would make a lot of sense for Facebook, which is by far the largest photo service on the Internet with close to 100 billion photos, to make their own dedicated photo app. The space is exploding with popularity right now as Instagram and others are gaining millions of users quickly. Regardless, Facebook's focus on mobile photos going forward is very clear.

            apan continues to deal with the enormous task of cleaning up and moving forward three months after the 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeast coast.  Local authorities are still dealing with the damaged  Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and now the rainy season, which could increase the risk of disease as workers clear away the debris, is approaching.  Collected here are images from this past weekend marking the three-month point, as well then-and-now images of the destruction shot by Kyodo News via the Associated Press.

    A large part of my job ... http://bit.ly/kagQbD
            Last night an explicit threat was made by a PR company working with 2K Games: since some of the Duke Nukem Forever reviews went "too far," some outlets could be frozen out from future review copies of games. An apology came later, but for the first time a PR firm went public with the possibility of a blacklist.

        <title>Discovr Launches Awesome Tool To Find New Apps For iOS (Think Interactive Graphs)</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[DISCOVR LAUNCHEZ AWSUM TOOL 2 FIND AN DISCOVR NEW APPS (FINKZ INTERACTIV GRAFS) http://tcrn.ch/mITuCM BY @ripemp
            At WWDC 2011, Apple announced that there are now more than 400K apps in its app store (and that more than 500K have been approved). The Android Marketplace has around 300K apps and is growing fast. The point is: There are a lot apps out there already, and more hit app stores every day. They're going like hotcakes. But finding and discovering new apps that you actually care about? Eh, not so easy. Of course, it's not for lack of trying. There are some awesome tools out there already trying to direct the fire hose and filter the noise. 

Chomp, for example, is trying to become the Google search for apps. Zwapp, Frenzapp, and Appsfire are all bringing social to app discovery, while Heyzap is busy trying to kill game discovery. Today, Discovr adds a dy-no-mite app discovery tool to the crowd, going after the user experience problem in an awesome, though somewhat mathematical way: Interactive graphs.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Troubled Startup Color Loses Cofounder Peter Pham http://tcrn.ch/mg5oIS by @arrington
            Peter Pham, the president and a cofounder of mobile social startup Color, is no longer with the company, we've heard from multiple sources. The company launched publicly less than three months ago.

Color has been controversial because it raised so much venture capital - some $41 million - and had such a lousy launch reception. The service creates proximity based social networks based on who's around you, a promising idea. But one that Color has so far failed to execute on.

In late April I criticized Color for making misstep after misstep and asked

            Pakistan’s detention of five C.I.A. informants, including a Pakistani Army major, is the latest evidence of the fractured relationship between the United States and Pakistan.

            I honestly didn't believe this one was for real at first. No way even KFC, purveyors of a sandwich that uses fried meat as a delivery mechanism for fried meat, would seriously market a soda size called the "mega jug." And even if they did, they'd never have the chutzpah to donate "mega jug" dollars to juvenile diabetes research.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook Is Taking A Special Interest In RockMelt&#39;s Social Browser http://tcrn.ch/iWDcaI by @erickschonfeld
            Ever since RockMelt launched its social browser, it's been known unofficially as the Facebook browser.  Facebook chat, status updates and sharing are all built right into the browser.  Now Facebook and RockMelt are officially working together in a product partnership, and the first fruits of that collaboration can be seen in the latest release available today, RockMelt 3. 

RockMelt is still an independent browser with only a few hundred thousand active users.  Facebook made no investment in RockMelt, nor is it going to help promote or distribute the browser, at least initially.  Its product teams, however, are working closely with RockMelt to make sure that its Facebook features shine.

Today we held a media event in San Francisco where we talked about some of the latest things we’re doing to tackle these barriers on mobile, announced that we’re bringing our speech recognition and computer vision technology to the desktop, and took the next step for Google Instant—Instant Pages.
