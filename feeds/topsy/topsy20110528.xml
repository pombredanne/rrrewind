        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Big move in Apple / Samsung -- Samsung&#39;s lawyers have demanded to see the iPhone 5 and iPad 3. http://t.co/Nfbkuav
            We always knew the Apple / Samsung lawsuit would produce some major fireworks, and Samsung just lit off a corker: the company filed a motion Friday night asking Apple to turn over the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 as part of the discovery process. Seriously! Samsung claims that it needs to see Apple’s future products because devices like the Droid Charge and Galaxy Tab 10.1 will presumably be in the market at the same time as the iPhone 5 and iPad 3, and Samsung’s lawyers want to evaluate any possible similarities so they can prepare for further potential legal action from Apple. It’s ballsy, but it’s not totally out of the blue: the move comes just a few days after the judge ordered Samsung to hand over pre-production samples of the Droid Charge, Infuse 4G, Galaxy S II, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 so Apple could determine if those products should also be part of the lawsuit and potentially file a motion to block them from the market.

        <title>Urban Outfitters - Blog - Urban Outfitters Responds to False Allegations by Necklace Designer</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Hey everyone, please read our statement regarding the I Heart Destination Necklace. http://urbout.co/kqdecK]]></description>    
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, please read our statement regarding the I Heart Destination Necklace. http://urbout.co/kqdecK
            Urban Outfitters unequivocally denies copying independent jewelry maker Stephanie Koerner.  One of Urban Outfitter’s core missions is to provide a platform for emerging talent in design, art and music. You can see this in the products we sell, the people who work in our company, even the music we play. This deep commitment to emerging talent has perhaps found its fullest expression over the last three years in our series of Designed By: collaborations. The main goal of this program is not profit, but giving emerging designers access to our resources and helping them to build their businesses by reaching a wider audience.   We have also been supporting the Etsy community for years, buying wholesale from numerous independent Etsy designers including Yokoo, CelaPiu, Loyalty and Blood, We Dream in Colour, Laura Lombardi, Erica Weiner, Species by the Thousands, and others, giving them much needed exposure on our blog and marketing.   In her recent blog post and on Twitter Koerner claims that Urban Outfitters stole her designs or was inspired in some way by the items in her Etsy shop for our I Heart Destination necklaces. In fact, a quick search on Etsy for ‘state necklace’ reveals several other sellers with similar products (as seen here on Regretsy) who offered their wares as much as a year earlier than Ms. Koerner.   We are not implying that Koerner stole her necklace idea from one of these other designers, We are simply stating the obvious—that the idea is not unique to Koerner and she can in no way claim to be its originator.   Normally we would not respond publicly to Koerner’s allegations, but we believe the media response to her campaign is threatening to impact the dozens of independent designers we work with on a daily basis. For many of them, having their work sold at Urban Outfitters is a very positive turning point in their careers, and we will not allow their hard work and commitment, or ours, to be undermined by these false allegations.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Oren Jacob, CTO of Pixar, joins August Capital as EIR http://tcrn.ch/il42Tq
            August Capital recently announced that Oren Jacob, CTO of Pixar has joined as their newest entrepreneur in residence. After a few weeks on the job, I got a chance to interview Oren and ask him how his new gig was going. In short, he has new-found respect for venture capitalists and button down shirts.

Oren had no idea how many meetings back to back were in store for him and how hard it can be to put on a fresh face and high level of excitement for each pitch. However challenges like that - and a bad case of entrepreneurial itch - were exactly why he decided to leave Pixar.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is There A Peak Age for Entrepreneurship? http://tcrn.ch/lDWPG8
            Editor's note: Adeo Ressi, is the founder of The Founder Institute and TheFunded.com In this guest post he argues against ageism when it comes to to entrepreneurs. Ressi is 39.

The recent articles proclaiming that 25 is the peak age for entrepreneurship deserve a considered and factual response. The demographic and racial profiling that has plagued venture capital and tech entrepreneurship has a new friend—ageism. This has to stop.

            Advocates of pulling oil from packed rock say it could raise the nation’s oil output by 25 percent within a decade, but evidence is mounting that the extraction technique, known as fracking, threatens water supplies.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Developer Creates Tool to Bring RSS Back to Twitter http://rww.to/ln1rjo
            Earlier this month, entrepreneur and blogger Jesse Stay noticed that both Facebook and Twitter had completely removed support for RSS from of their websites. After much outcry from the tech community, Facebook relented and re-added an RSS link to Facebook Pages once again. Twitter, however, did nothing. But now, one developer has taken it upon himself to build a tool that uses Twitter's API (application programming interface) to create RSS feeds. The code, called "Twitter API 2 RSS," is now available on GitHub here....

            Robotic probes launched by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and others are gathering information for us right now all across the solar system. We currently have spacecraft in orbit around the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Saturn; several others on their way to smaller bodies; and a few on their way out of the solar system entirely. On Mars, a rover called Spirit has just been officially left for dead, after two years of radio silence from it -- but its twin, Opportunity, continues on its mission, now more than 2,500 days beyond its originally planned 90-days. With all these eyes in the sky, I'd like to take the opportunity to put together a photo album of our Solar system -- a set of family portraits, of sorts -- as seen by our astronauts and mechanical emissaries. [38 photos]
