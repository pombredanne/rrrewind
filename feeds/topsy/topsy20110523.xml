            Remember lonelygirl15? But of course you do (and if not, Wikipedia and YouTube search are your friends). 

Either way, it looks like some of the creators behind the interactive Web-based video series, which attracted worldwide attention, are raising $3.5 million in funding for their production and software company EQAL - at least according to this SEC filing.

            Google has made an acquisition today—Sparkbuy, a 'kayak for electronics.'

Sparkbuy, which has raised $1 million in funding, is a high-powered product search engine and comparison shopping site. You enter which criteria are important to you, and the site will give a listing of laptops that it thinks you’ll like best. You could also use in-depth filtering options to break down results. At launch last year, the startup was only focusing on laptops.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Weotta: Find Something To Do Tonight In Three Clicks Or Less http://tcrn.ch/jJaRnS by @jasonkincaid
            Looking for something to do this weekend without having to sift through your newspaper or scour the web for a fun event? Weotta, a new startup launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt, is looking to help (say the name out loud).

The service offers a very easy 3-step process for making a plan: first, tell it what kind of outing you're embarking on (Business, Dating, Family, Friends, or Solo). Next, pick the mood. Finally, hit the generate button, and you’re good to go.

Once you’ve  hit ‘Generate’, the service will present you with a handful of itineraries, each of which provides an at-a-glance overview of the event, with pins marking the venues and small icons depicting the atmosphere, time of day, and more (the icons are reminiscent of the ones you’d find in a hotel guide).

            At least 116 people died in a massive tornado that left a path of destruction nearly a mile wide through the heart of Joplin, Missouri, on Sunday. The cyclone destroyed hundreds of homes and vehicles, as well as a high school and a hospital. Rescue teams have been working hard to find and assist as many people as possible, even as another storm system passes through region today. Tens of thousands are now living without power around this small city, where an estimated 30 percent of the structures were flattened or damaged by the massive storm. Collected here are some images of the aftermath in Joplin as residents and rescue workers survey what remains. [38 photos]

            Once you've built an empire of funny cat pictures and other user-generated comedy ephemera, what do you do next? Ben Huh, CEO of the sprawling Cheezburger network of comedy websites, has begun discussing a side-project hobby he's working on called The Moby Dick Project. The Project's aim is to rebuild online media in a format that's suited for a changed media world. "Why are we still consuming news like it's 1899?" Huh asks in a blog post this morning. "I want to rethink how we read breaking news," he told me by phone today. He's talking with a small group...

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Judgment Day predictor Harold Camping speaks out on radio show HuffPost is Live Blogging  http://huff.to/kjWt8F
            Harold Camping, the California preacher who via his multimillion-dollar Christian Family Radio stations had convinced a few thousand followers that the Rapture would happen on May 21, is scheduled to speak at length for the first time Monday evening since his failed prediction. Camping, who was silent over the weekend besides giving a short interview with a newspaper reporter in which he said he was "flabbergasted" about unrealized prophesy, is scheduled to speak at 8:30 p.m. on his Open Forum call-in show.

            Like a combination Tango, Skype and Facebook and Chatroulette (or a Chatroulette for Facetime), Karizma is a location based video chat messenger that banks on the theory that people want to video chat with people who are geographically close to them. Karizma allows you to call people who are in your proximity, not just your current contacts.

            Twitter has just notified its users via a Tweet that it will begin notifying them that someone they follow has retweeted or favorited one of their tweets. The new notifications will apparently be delivered in the same manner that current notifications about direct messages and new followers are sent. Updated.

            It's no secret that e-commerce is growing like gangbusters. Last year alone, consumers spent a $142 billion on online retail spending.  SneakPeeq, a startup launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt, aims to capitalize on this booming market, but adds a social twist.  

SneakPeeq gets high end fashion brands to sell in season or upcoming items on the site, and somewhat aims to replicate the experience of shopping for items in a retail store. So similar to the way you flip over a price tag to look at the cost of at item at a store, SneakPeeq doesn't tell you the price instantly when you visit a product's landing page. You click a

            There’s little question that the iPad is one of the best media consumption devices ever. It's also been a hotbed for innovation around content recommendation, with apps like Flipboard giving you a visual way to browse an array of articles you might be interested in, using Facebook and Twitter as data sources.

Today, the iPad is getting another great way to consume content, and this time it's all about video. Meet Deja, a very nice looking application launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt. The app will go live later today on the iTunes App Store (we'll add a link as soon as it is).

            The TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley audience choice winner today is Happy Toy Machine, which allows you to design and create plush toys online. 

The site allows adults and children to customize their plush toys by colors, size, body parts, shape, type, build and more. When you are satisfied with your design, you can actually have your creation built and sent you. It's sort of like the Build-A-Bear on steroids.

            When Omar Hamoui  left Google a few months after selling AdMob to the search giant for $750 million, he set up shop with mobile engineer Mike Rowehl as Churn Labs.  Today at Disrupt NYC, we get to see the first product churned out by the labs: Gnonstop Gnomes. 

Gnonstop Gnomes is part social game, part mobile photo app.  You take pictures with your iPhone or Android camera and insert an image of  a gnome into the picture.  The app marks the location of each picture and you can follow where the gnome has been.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[What Should a Digital Public Library of America Look Like? http://rww.to/liaUJc
            The public library may be one of this nation's most important cultural and civic institutions. Yet it faces a number of threats - budget crises at the state and local level and the shift in the publishing industry from print to digital books. Of course, the library is more than just a repository for books - paper or otherwise. And even as libraries move to embrace more digital content, the local library will (hopefully) persist as a community center and as a portal to Internet resources. But efforts are underway to create a DIgital Public Library of America, an online...

            Nike+ is about to turn five years old and they are celebrating by giving their Nike+ GPS app away for free for a limited time.
