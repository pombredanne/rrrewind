      <title>Toward a simpler, more beautiful Google</title>
      <description>More than 170 million people have upgraded to Google+, enjoying new ways to share in Search, Gmail, YouTube and lots of other places. It's still early days, and there&#8217;s plenty left to do, but we're more excited than ever to build a seamless social experience, all across Google. A critical piece of this social layer is a design that grows alongside our aspirations. So today we&#8217;re introducing a more functional and flexible version of Google+. We think you&#8217;ll find it easier to use and nicer to look at, but most importantly, it accelerates our efforts to create a simpler, more beautiful Google.Navigation you can make your own One of the first things you&#8217;ll notice is a new way to get around the stream. Instead of static icons at the top, there&#8217;s a dynamic ribbon of applications on the left. This approach comes with lots of perks, but some of our favorites include:You can drag apps up or down to create the order you want You can hover over certain apps to reveal a set of quick actions You can show or hide apps by moving them in and out of &#8220;More&#8221; Taken together, these powers make it easier to access your favorites, and to adjust your preferences over time. We've also built the ribbon with the future in mind, giving us an obvious (and clutter-free) space for The Next Big Feature, and The Feature After That. So stay tuned.Conversations you&#8217;ll really care about Once you&#8217;ve upgraded to Google+, it&#8217;s easy to share with your circles from just about anywhere. We&#8217;re dreaming bigger, though. We're aiming for an experience that fuses utility with beauty&#8212;one that inspires you to connect with others, and cherish the conversations that unfold. Today&#8217;s update is an important step in this direction, including:Full bleed photos and videos that'll make you really proud to post A stream of conversation "cards" that make it easier to scan and join discussions An activity drawer that highlights the community around your content Simply put, we're hoping to make sharing more awesome by making it more evocative. You know that feeling you get when a piece of art takes your breath away, or when a friend stops by with unexpected gifts? We want sharing to feel like that, every single time.A new home for hanging out Google+ Hangouts uses live video to bring people together, and the results range from heartwarming to breathtaking to music-making. Today we're adding a dedicated Hangouts page that creates even more opportunities to connect in person, including:An always-updated list of invitations from the people in your circles Quick access to every public and On Air hangout, for those times when you want to meet someone new, or watch a live broadcast A rotating billboard of popular hangouts, pro tips and other items you don&#8217;t want to miss By highlighting all the hangouts you can join, all over the world, it&#8217;s now easier to spend time together&#8212;even be there for each other. And with efforts like hangout apps already underway, you can expect more hangouts in more places in the future.Getting there from here Today's Google+ update extends beyond navigation, the stream and hangouts. For instance: there's a new Explore page that shows what's interesting and trending across the network. And a new profile with much bigger photos. And a new chat list that puts your friends front and center. And a whole lot more. We're rolling out all of these improvements over the next few days, so please check back if you don't see them yet. In the meantime, you can visit this overview to learn more. By focusing on you, the people you care about, and the stuff you&#8217;re into, we&#8217;re going to continue upgrading all the features you already know and love&#8212;from Search and Maps to Gmail and YouTube. With today&#8217;s foundational changes we can move even faster&#8212;toward a simpler, more beautiful Google.Posted by Vic Gundotra, Senior Vice President</description>

      <title>5 Tips for Managing Your Community on Google+</title>
      <description>Posted by jennita The day Google+ opened up brand pages, I anxiously refreshed my Gmail inbox all day long until I finally got the email inviting me to create a company page. I knew that by creating the page under my personal account that I&#8217;d be the only one able to manage it for the near future. But I really didn&#8217;t care; I was just so giddy to get the page set up. Remember that feeling? I bet you ran out and did the same thing, right? But then what happened? Are you still as excited about it as you were back then, or do you now dread having to go in there? I mean not only do you have to keep up with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Quora, HackerNews, and [insert social platform here], but you have to have a strategy for Google+ as well. Calgon, take me away! Ok, so we know that having a Google Plus strategy is important and we know all the ways that we should optimize our brand page for SEO purposes, but are we managing our G+ community? Here at SEOmoz, we&#8217;ve been working hard on making sure that Google+ isn&#8217;t thought of as just a third sock, but as an important part of our social (and search) strategy. Today I want to show you five ways you can use Google+ to engage more with you community, all the while helping your site and brand page show up more in searches. Sound good? Now, let&#8217;s walk through some of these tactics. One thing to remember is that with any kind of social strategy, what works great for us, may not be the best for you. So test things out and see if they work. Now, on with the tips! 1. Check your notifications &amp; respond You probably want to slap me in the face right now, right? I mean come on, OF COURSE you check your notifications&#8230; but do you respond? Every single morning when I log into Google+ the very first thing I do is check notifications. I start with the oldest and work my way forward and I respond to as many of them as possible. Don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to let people know you&#8217;re out there and that you care about what they&#8217;re saying. Here are a few examples you can take advantage of: Someone shares your post. Take the opportunity to thank them! Someone shares a post with you. They probably did it for a reason, look at the post and respond if it makes sense. Someone mentions you in the comments. Read the post and jump into the comments as well. (Sometimes people freak out when you actually respond, that always makes my day.) Someone adds you to a circle. Take this time to go through your new adds and add people them to circles if it makes sense. (When the next notification you get is someone excited that you&#8217;ve added them to a circle, you&#8217;ll enjoy that smile it puts on your face.) But don&#8217;t end your interactions with notifications, as these only show up when someone specifically adds the +brand in a post. What about those mentions that weren&#8217;t direct? 2. Search for your brand/name/keywords &amp; respond The next step in making sure you&#8217;re interacting with the community is to see what people are saying about you. Running a search will show you people, pages, posts, hangouts, etc. But I usually filter to only show me Google+ posts so I can see what people are talking about. Bingo! I ran a simple search for &#8220;seo tools&#8221; and the very first post to come up is a big ol&#8217; Open Site Explorer logo as part of a post called 31 Essential SEO Tools and Resources and they were nice enough to mention us. This is a great example of when you can reach out and thank someone for sharing a post. Another example is to simply search for your brand name. If you watched my recent webinar or follow me on Twitter, you likely know that I have a small obsession with cupcakes (ok it&#8217;s a big obsession&#8230; moving right along). Let&#8217;s use a local cupcake shop as an example. Sadly, they don&#8217;t have a Google+ page but lots of people are talking about them here. This is such an awesome opportunity to reach out to your community. What is your community saying about you that you didn&#8217;t even realize was happening? 3. Check the Ripples for your latest content When Ripples first came out, Casey Henry wrote a great post about using Ripples to connect with influencers. This still holds true today, but the even better part is that Google has added some upgrades to Ripples since then. Now you see all the shares for the specific page you shared, not just the individual share&#8217;s Ripples. These are the Ripples for a post from The Next Web that SEOmoz shared. So let&#8217;s say you see that you have 26 Google+ shares but you only have three shares from your own post, you simply check the Ripples on your post and voila, you can see them all. Additionally, you can add any URL to check and see the Ripples. From there, the sky is the limit. You could track your posts' Ripples to see who your consistent influencers are. On the Ripples page you can see the top influencers for each post. These are influencers and stats from three different posts, as you can see, that Rand Fishkin guy is fairly influential. :) I may want to reach out to him more! But seriously, this is a really great way to see who's sharing your content (or your competitor's content!) and gives you easy access to reach out to them and make content. You can use this information for link building, for community management, for brand management, so. much. win. 4. Mention other brands and people directly Just as you're looking for posts mentioning your brand, other companies are doing the same thing. So if you want to be noticed, you need to do it as well. The same goes for people, be sure to link directly to blog authors, community members, speakers at events, etc. When someone gets a personal notification that they've been mentioned, how much do you want to bet that they'll reshare the post, or comment or +1 it or take some sort of action? I'd bet a lot! We recently linked to all of our speakers for MozCon and many of the direct shares, comments and +1's came from the speakers themselves. It's nice to see your name "in lights" and the more you link out, the more they link in. Google+ makes this so easy to do since you don't have to be in circles with people or brands in order to link to them (unlike Facebook). You can do this when you post or even when you comment on someone else's post. So what are you waiting for? 5. Start a chat or Hangout One thing that I love about Google+ is that interacting with other people is quick and easy since they make it so simple to link directly to someone (see above). In turn, this makes it a great place to start a chat or something along those lines. I love what SEER has been doing with their page, they've been having Q&amp;A sessions on Google+ and their team jumps in and answers questions. GENIUS! Believe me, we'll be stealing that one soon enough for the SEOmoz page. :) In addition to using chats/Q&amp;A sessions to reach out to your customers/community, you can always hold a hangout. We have attempted it several times but unfortunately the limit of 10 people has made it pretty difficult for us as we get too many people trying to jump in. However, check out what My Community Manager is doing with hangouts. First, they hold the Hangout every week at the same time so people know when to expect it. After the Hangout, they write a post talking about the main topics. How do you think you could leverage Hangouts and other kinds of chats with your community in Google+? Your Turn! I've given you five great tactics to help you manage your Google+ community and interact with your clients, audience, fans, etc. I know there are a ton of other things you can do, but I really wanted to focus on ways to keep your community motivated and engaged (the dreaded word.. ENGAGE). I see lots of people doing similar things on Twitter and Facebook but Google+ is getting somewhat ignored. With its importance in search, it's important to know how to use it to your advantage. Now it's your turn. Have any questions or additions you'd like to make to this list? Sign up for The Moz Top 10, a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

      <title>Google+ Rolls Out New Look</title>
      <description>Google announced on Wednesday that it is rolling out a significant redesign for its social networking platform Google+, which will allow users to create a more customized experience on the site. The company said it will introduce a variety of new features to the site in the next few days, from customizing apps and the navigation bar to more flexibility with profile pages and pictures. In addition, the update introduces a new Explore page that posts what&#8217;s interesting and trending across the site. Google also noted that the social network now boasts more than 170 million users since it&#8217;s 2011 launch. Google+ will now offer profile pages that will include bigger photos, a la Facebook&#8217;s Timeline, and feature a chat list that puts friends front and center on your page. Another major update involves how users can navigate around the news stream. Instead of static icons at the top, there&#8217;s a ribbon of apps on the left. The ribbon allows users to drag apps up or down to create the order, hover over certain apps to reveal a set of quick actions and show or hide apps by moving them out of the section. &#8220;Taken together, these powers make it easier to access your favorites, and to adjust your preferences over time,&#8221; Google senior vice president Vic Gundotra wrote on Google&#8217;s Official Blog. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also built the ribbon with the future in mind, giving us an obvious (and clutter-free) space for The Next Big Feature, and The Feature After That. So stay tuned.&#8221; A dedicated Hangouts page has also been added to the site, so people can have quick access to public and On Air video chat hangouts. This will allow Google+ users to meet new people and watch live broadcasts, as well as enter new rooms via a rotating billboard of Hangouts. &#8220;It&#8217;s still early days, and there&#8217;s plenty left to do, but we&#8217;re more excited than ever to build a seamless social experience, all across Google,&#8221; Gundotra said. What do you think of the redesign? Do you think Google+ will ever be able to compete with Facebook? Let us know in the comments.

      <title>YouTube Lets You Make Money from Pay-Per-View Videos</title>
      <description>Next time you have guests at your home for a live TV event, you might be streaming it from YouTube. Just don&#8217;t expect it to be free. YouTube announced it would add the option for partners to monetize on YouTube Live, its year-old streaming service, with advertisements or other paid options. In a blog post, YouTube Partner Product Manager Varun Talwar joked they considered renting a bouncy castle or hiring a magician to celebrate YouTube Live&#8217;s first birthday. &#8220;Neither of these seemed just right to celebrate the millions of you who&#8217;ve seen live videos,&#8221; Talwar wrote, &#8220;so we went with our favorite gifts: new features from our tireless engineers.&#8221; YouTube Live lets viewers watch live events, while companies and brands grow their following &#8212; and now, make a profit. This means live content will be accessible through a pay-per-view option. &#8220;A live event can be claimed in the new video manager like any other video and monetized with in-stream ads or paid options where you can set price by country,&#8221; Talwar writes. You can also preview live events before they actually go live, and view real-time analytics that show at-the-moment viewers according to geography and format. New Wirecast software lets YouTube partners produce and stream professional-quality live events directly from a desktop. Add files, images and other overlays to enhance the program. For those who are livestreaming enabled, simply download Wirecase for YouTube. What do you think about this new feature? How much would you pay to watch a big, live television event on YouTube?

      <title>5 Ways to Market Your Brand With Location-Based Networks</title>
      <description>Brian Honigman is the digital marketing manager at Marc Ecko Enterprises. He is a part of Ecko&#8217;s marketing and ecommerce team, ensuring a polished brand experience across all channels. Follow him on Twitter @Brian_Honigman. Between the rise in location-based social networks, like Foursquare, and the mobile market&#8217;s meteoric growth, a new marketing avenue has opened up. Location-based marketing is a nascent frontier, and marketers are clamoring to take advantage of it. Already, about 30% of smartphone owners access social networks via their mobile browser, and that figure will continue to grow, according to an infographic by Microsoft Tag. So, if your marketing plans include location-based networks, below are five ways to get started. 1. Push Notification Integration One of the big reasons people don&#8217;t use location-based apps like Foursquare or SCVNGR is simply because they forget. Integrating push notifications into a location-based app is a great and simple fix. Marketers often use these notifications to highlight activity, specials, announcements, and to further promote the app as well as the business. Allowing users to alter these notifications is an important way to give your audience some power. That ensures your messaging makes it to their phone without being a burden. 2. Loyalty Programs Giving rewards to loyal customers for continuing to check in via a location-based networks is a great option. Arby&#8217;s marketing team did this on Foursquare by offering special reserved seating to their Foursquare mayors at 30 restaurants and 50% off on purchases. Ideas like these drive competition and increase use, which leads to greater exposure for the business being marketed on these networks. 3. Geofencing Geofencing has been around for some time, but it&#8217;s increasingly becoming incorporated in more location-based networks. For those who aren&#8217;t familiar, geofencing is a virtual boundary set around a location, like a store. One way marketers are using geofencing on location-based networks is by sending messages to users who&#8217;ve opted in to a particular service. Lets use Starbucks as an example. If a person crosses a Starbucks geofence, they will receive a message from their location-based app highlighting an offer, coupon, or just a reminder to stop by. This is similar to the idea of a push notification, except it&#8217;s only triggered by a person who comes into a geofence around a specific location. This messaging is more relevant to a user and more effective for a company. 4. Mixed Media Apps like GetGlue and Foursquare both give you the ability to check in and incorporate other media. For instance, GetGlue allows a user to check in and share a favorite book, song or TV show. Optimize your content and forge partnerships with companies like GetGlue as a way to extend your reach among users that are more likely to view your content if recommended by their friends. 5. Better Content As the king of the location-based space, Foursquare helps set the tone for innovation in this industry. Recently at South by Southwest, Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley spoke about the future of location-based apps and how the company&#8217;s focus is shifting from checking in to other features that their audience uses more and that will help the company become more mainstream. For instance, Foursquare&#8217;s &#8220;explore&#8221; feature is fairly new and allows a user to discover food, nightlife, shops, and more based on broad categories. It aggregates suggestions based on your checkin history as well as information available on the network about a location. This is why any content you add to Foursquare and similar sites should be optimized.

      <title>The Internet Is Ruining Your Brain [INFOGRAPHIC]</title>
      <description>Admit it: As you&#8217;re reading this, you have tunnel vision &#8212; that feeling that the world is closing in on you after surfing the Internet for eight straight hours. Web dead head (yes, I made that up) is a growing concern for today&#8217;s connected generation, which collectively spends 35 billion hours on the Internet every month. But we&#8217;re not just talking one online shopping experience at a time. Often, we have four tabs open, cycling between emails and shopping, tweeting and word processing. Such multi-tasking actually raises stress levels and lowers creative thinking overall, according to the research compiled by ForensicPsychology.net. SEE ALSO: Your Desk Job Makes You Fat, Sick and Dead [INFOGRAPHIC] Turns out, multi-tasking online doesn&#8217;t positively exercise our brains or mental state. Heavy Internet users are 2.5 times more likely to be depressed. And web addiction reduces the white matter in our brains, basically the transmitters responsible for our memory and sensory abilities. Scared? Tell us about it. Thumbnail courtesy of iStockphoto, Firstsignal More About: features, Google, health, infographic, Social Media, trending, web</description>
