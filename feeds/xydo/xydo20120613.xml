      <title>Who Are the Real Online Influencers? [INFOGRAPHIC]</title>
      <description>As the web's capacity for pageviews increases, marketers are becoming less interested in reaching as many people as possible, and more interested in reaching the right people. According to Deanna Brown, the CEO of Federated Media, that's why context is so important -- the ability serve high volumes of advertising continues to expand, but the real value for a brand is to surround its message with the right context so that it reaches the most influential people among customers. Yet, while most marketers agree that reaching influencers is important, they question how to measure influence and how to determine the most influential people online in the first place. Are you influential if you&#8230; Continue reading... More About: Business, influencers, infographics, Marketing</description>

      <title>Mass Relevance Gets Sporty With TaylorMade, MLB</title>
      <description>Major League Baseball and golf brand TaylorMade both introduced powerful Twitter curation tools this week designed to assemble relevant tweets for baseball fans and golf fans following the US Open. MLB's 140 Club tracks and compiles fan and player tweets relevant to the sport's hottest topics, and provides a feed from the official @MLB account. TaylorMade's US Open social destination similarly aggregates fans tweets for the tournament that begins Thursday and includes some more explicitly marketing oriented features. Both tools are the result of collaborations with Mass Relevance, Twitter's official social curation and integration partner. Mass Relevance CMO Matt Corey tells Mashable&#8230; Continue reading...

      <title>Samsung TecTiles: Wireless Stickers With Secret Phone Powers</title>
      <description>Near-field communication (NFC) is joined at the hip with the concept of mobile payments, or buying things via cellphone. But the tech actually has many more applications, and Samsung wants owners of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone to discover -- and perhaps even create -- some of those novel uses of NFC with a product called TecTiles. TecTiles are tiny little stickers with a simple NFC tag inside. Although they look identical, each one is unique, letting users "program" the sticker to have a specific response whenever any device with an NFC chip is floated over it (NFC only works at extremely short ranges). How does one do that? Users can program TecTiles via an app th&#8230; Continue reading... More About: nfc, samsung, Samsung Galaxy S III, TecTiles</description>

      <title>Pinstagram Arrives for iPad, Before Instagram, Pinterest [EXCLUSIVE]</title>
      <description>Pinstagram, a mashup launched last month combining hot Internet properties Instagram and Pinterest, has launched its app for iPad. The app beats both startups it builds upon to launch an iPad app. Pinstagram presents your Instagram feed in Pinterest's signature waterfall layout. It also lets you pin your favorite Instagram photos to your Pinterest boards. Co-creator Pek Pongpaet told Mashable they opted for the web and now the iPad, rather than the iPhone, because those are the platforms where Instagram is missing. "If people are already using Instagram on their iPhones, it would be duplicating Instagram's effort," Pongpaet says. "We'll never be a better Instagram than Instagra&#8230; Continue reading...

      <title>Apple Introduces &#8216;Radical&#8217; MacBook Pro in New Ad [VIDEO]</title>
      <description>It's been a while since Apple devoted a TV spot to a Mac product, but the company has now decided to give the star treatment to its new MacBook Pro with Retina display. The ad, by longtime Apple ad agency TBWA|Media Arts Lab, features the usual product-as-hero theme common to many Apple ads. "The radical new MacBook Pro with Retina display," narrator Peter Coyote says over a shot of the MacBook Pro displaying high-res photos of waves and other colorful images. Then the camera reveals the laptop's thin silhouette to set up the double-entendre: "Innovation in every dimension." Interested? Well, first you'll have to get at least $2,200 together. We're sure that that won't be a proble&#8230; Continue reading... More About: Advertising, apple, Macbook Pro</description>

      <title>Facebook Engagement is Actually Up, Despite Reuters Poll</title>
      <description>Although a poll circulated the web last week that found one-third of Facebook users are using the social network less than six months ago, statistics show site engagement is actually up. A survey conducted among 1,032 Americans by Reuters and research firm Ipsos found that 35% of Facebook users said they are less engaged on the social network than they have been in the recent past and only 20% of members are spending more time on the site. However, both comScore and Nielson traffic data shows members are accessing Facebook just as much -- if not more -- than six months ago. According to comScore, behavioral data shows that engagement for users is actually up 4% from 364 minutes spe&#8230; Continue reading... More About: engagement, Facebook, poll</description>

      <title>Sweden Twitter Experiment Goes Painfully Awry</title>
      <description>The Swedish government has been handing over the @sweden Twitter account to a different citizen each week, and this week's owner is steering the car right off a social media cliff. The project began in December, but an article in The New York Times brought the story to a new level of prominence Monday after a series of questionable tweets. Tuesday, the current Swede behind the account doubled down on the controversial tweeting, as seen below. When the project began as a means to promote Sweden as a tourist destination, Thomas Br&#252;hl, CEO of VisitSweden, told Mashable &#8220;No one owns the brand of Sweden more than its people. With this initiative we let them show their Sweden to th&#8230; Continue reading... More About: Marketing, Social Media, sweden, trending, Twitter, viral, World</description>
