      <title>Facebook Election Is a Bust: 0.00038% of Users Voted on Privacy Change</title>
      <description>The online poll to determine which Facebook policies will be put into place on the social network closed this morning after one week of voting -- and a serious lack of user interest. Out of 900 million users, a mere 342,632 voted on which privacy policy would govern the site. That's roughly 1 in every 2,600 users -- or 0.00038% of Facebook. Facebook's call to action last Friday asked users to read and vote on which Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and Data Use Policy they preferred to use.

      <title>iOS6 Confirmed by Early Hanging Banners</title>
      <description>Your idevice is about to get a whole lot better. iOS 6 banners have started go up at San Francisco's Moscone Center, indicating that the next version of the operating system is in fact on its way next Monday. Originally spotted by 9to5 Mac earlier today, we were still able to snag our own photos of the banners this afternoon. The keynote for Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference is set to take play in the Moscone Center Monday morning. Beyond iOS 6 &#8211;- which we can now consider all but confirmed by the banners -&#8211; Apple is rumored to be announcing new Macs and possibly even a TV. Apple is traditionally pretty tight-lipped about all of its announcements, so little is curre&#8230; Continue reading... More About: apple, iOS 6, iPhone 5, wwdc</description>

      <title>Twitter Confirms Facebook Integration of Usernames, Hashtags, Photos</title>
      <description>Twitter has quietly tweaked the way usernames, hashtags, photos and more are cross-posted to Facebook. &#8220;The updated Twitter for Facebook integration now includes additional rich media experiences related to the first photo, URL, @mention or #hashtag in the cross-posted tweet,&#8221; Twitter spokesman Robert Weeks told Mashable on Thursday night. &#8220;This update is available for everyone.&#8221; Twitter&#8216;s Help Center also notes the changes, which Weeks says rolled out at the end of May: &#8220;We have fixed many issues with the Twitter for Facebook integration, including the ability to post to Facebook Pages, and added some new features!&#8221; Users who don&#8217;t see the integration working can disconnect their Twitter and Facebook accounts in their Twitter profile settings and then reconnect their accounts in their Twitter profile settings. SEE ALSO: Twitter Rewind &#8212; Big Highlights From 2012 to 2006 Facebook user Damien Basile tipped Mashable off to the changes (see examples above).

The movie was made in 1989 by famed director Hayou Miyazaki, who also directed Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. During one point in televised broadcast in 2011, viewers joined forces, sending tweets at the same time to symbolically help the movie's characters cast a spell.

      <title>Triple Crown Hopes Dashed for &#8216;I&#8217;ll Have Another,&#8217; the Tweeting Horse</title>
      <description>The racehorse I'll Have Another has pulled out this weekend's Belmont Stakes due to injury and will miss a chance at the sport's highest achievement. But his popular Twitter feed lives on. I'll Have Another, a three-year-old colt, won the Kentucky Derby in May as a 15-1 longshot, then the Preakness Stakes two weeks later. Winning Saturday's Belmont would have made him just the 12th horse to win horse racing's elusive Triple Crown since 1919. Instead, fans will have to settle settle for more sassy, humorous tweets from the @Ill_HaveAnother Twitter account.

      <title>Canon Finally Adds Continuous Video Autofocus in T4i DSLR</title>
      <description>Canon just updated its top camera in the entry-level Rebel DSLR line, finally adding a feature that's been on equivalent Nikon's for a while: continuous autofocus while shooting video. The EOS Rebel T4i will keep your subject in focus while recording video, and it does so in an intelligent way. As long as you have one of Canon's new Stepping Motor lenses, the continuous autofocus is said to be whisper-quiet (noise has been a complaint on some other models). The Hybrid CMOS AF system has a nine-point sensory array and works with the 3-inch touchscreen's "fingertip" controls. Did we mention this is Canon's first DSLR with a touchscreen? The Touch Focus will instantly put the subject&#8230; Continue reading... More About: Canon, DSLR, video cameras</description>

      <title>Follow Mashable mRank to Track NBA Finals Social Buzz</title>
      <description>Kevin Durant and the precocious Oklahoma City Thunder have already punched their tickets to the NBA Finals, which begin next Tuesday. The Boston Celtics and Miami Heat will battle Saturday night in a do-or-die game for the right to take on the Thunder for the coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy. Thunder-Heat or Thunder-Celtics, this season's finals will feature one of the NBA's most intriguing championship match-ups in recent history. And, as has become the modern sports standard, casual and hardcore hoop-heads alike will take to Twitter, Facebook and blogs to analyze, recap and talk trash throughout the best-of-seven series. With so much chatter, it can be hard to discern which team an&#8230; Continue reading... More About: Facebook, features, mrank, Social Media, sports, Twitter</description>

      <title>The unforgiving arithmetic of the funnel</title>
      <description>One percent. That's how many you get if you're lucky. One percent of the subscribers to the Times read an article and take action. One percent of the visitors to a website click a button to find out more. One percent of the people in a classroom are sparked by an idea and go do something about it. And then! And then, of that 1%, perhaps 1% go ahead and take more action, or recruit others, or write a book or volunteer. One percent of one percent. No wonder advertisers have to run so many ads. Most of us ignore most of them. No wonder it's so hard to convert a digital browsing audience into a real world paying one--most people are in too much of a hurry to read and think and pause and then do. The common mistake is to reflexively come to the conclusion that the only option is to make more noise, to put more attention into the top of the funnel. The thinking goes that if a big audience is getting you mediocre results, a huge audience is the answer. Alas, a huge audience is more difficult than the alternatives. A few ways to deal with the funnel: Acknowledge that it's there. Don't assume that a big audience is going to easily convert to action. Work to measure your losses. Figure out where in the process you're losing interest and clicks or the other behaviors you seek. If you can, remove steps. Each step costs you dearly. Treat different people differently. If you alter the funnel to maximize interest by the wandering masses, you may very well miss the chance to convert the focused few.</description>

      <title>Pest control</title>
      <description>Your doctor now spends more of her time doing more non-medical tasks than ever before. Dealing with insurance companies, lawsuits, other doctors, partners and yes, marketing. My doctor's office probably has a special button on the phone system for each of these (okay, not lawyers, but you get the idea). Just about all of us face the same thing when we engage with the world. The world wants to engage back! Every interaction leads to a response, maybe three. Every marketing effort leads to the expectation that there will be other efforts. The next thing you know, there's no time left to actually get work done. That's not news to you. What might be surprising is the logical conclusion: A big part of doing your work is defending your time and your attention so you can do your work. No one is going to do it for you and it's not easy or fun. It's work. But worth it.</description>

      <title>Facebook Will Disappear by 2020, Says Analyst</title>
      <description>Facebook&#8216;s sliding stock price has at least one hedge fund manager predicting a dismal decade ahead for the social network. &#8220;In five to eight years they are going to disappear in the way that Yahoo has disappeared,&#8221; Ironfire Capital founder Eric Jackson told the CNBC show Squawk on the Street on Monday. &#8220;Yahoo is still making money, it&#8217;s still profitable, still has 13,000 employees working for it, but it&#8217;s 10% of the value that it was at the height of 2000,&#8221; Jackson added. &#8220;For all intents and purposes, it&#8217;s disappeared.&#8221; So how exactly does Jackson see Facebook&#8217;s power eroding by decade&#8217;s end? He says it will be the continued emergence of the mobile web &#8212; and Facebook&#8217;s struggle to adapt to that paradigm shift. &#8220;The world is moving faster, it&#8217;s getting more competitive, not less,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think those who are dominant in their prior generation are really going to have a hard time moving into this newer generation. &#8220;Facebook can buy a bunch of mobile companies, but they are still a big, fat website and that&#8217;s different from a mobile app.&#8221; Facebook bought the wildly popular mobile photo-sharing app Instagram &#8212; which some saw as a potential rival &#8212; for $1 billion in April. Still, the company has acknowledged mobile as a potential stumbling block for sustained growth. In its required initial pre-IPO disclosure of 35 &#8220;risk factors&#8221; released in February, the company admitted that as mobile use of Facebook and the web in general continues to expand, its ad-free mobile platform will become more problematic. In an amended filing in May, the company underscored that challenge again. Facebook stock officially went on sale on May 18 at $38 per share. It closed Monday at $26.90. Jackson sees Facebook as a member of the second of three generations of modern Internet companies. The first generation, highlighted by businesses such as Google and Yahoo, served as portals that organized and aggregated the web&#8217;s wealth of information. The second generation, most notably Facebook, capitalized on an emerging social web. The third generation is made up of companies whose sole goal is leveraging and monetizing mobile users. &#8220;When you look over these three generations, no matter how successful you are in one generation, you don&#8217;t seem to be able to translate that into success in the second generation, no matter how much money you have in the bank, no matter how many smart PhDs you have working for you,&#8221; Jackson says. &#8220;Look at how Google has struggled moving into social, and I think Facebook is going to have the same kind of challenges moving into mobile.&#8221; What do you think Facebook&#8217;s status will be in five years?
