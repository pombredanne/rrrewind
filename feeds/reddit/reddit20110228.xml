They should realize the possible &lt;em&gt;PERMANENT&lt;/em&gt; side effects and help ban this drug, until they find out what is causing these devastating side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you ask about the side effects to Merck (the maker of propecia), they will tell you that the side effects wear off. Not for everyone. There's an entire community of sufferers who have this condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is linked to finasteride based drugs. Not only propecia. But it is what I took&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took propecia less than one month when I was 20 years old. Since then, I have lost my old sex drive of getting erections on a daily basis. I basically have a refactory period (how long it takes your sex drive to come back after having sex,masterbating,etc) of about a week or two to start feeling &quot;normal&quot; again. Normal is just the way I feel, the spontaneous erections come back once and a while after &quot;abstaining&quot; from sex/masterbating/etc for about a week or two and take high doses of vitamin D/C and testerorone boosting foods(eggs,cholesterol,etc).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's been linked to possibly be an adrenal gland/thyroid issue that needs treatment. Still very foggy and many possibilities are out there because doctors don't think it's a problem and Merck is just making so much money from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just want to say I'm not an expert on what is going on. This is just what happened to me and I want to warn people of the possible permanent side effects of what can happen. It has happened to many people, not only me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want more &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;. Here it is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.propeciasideeffects.com/&quot; &gt;http://www.propeciasideeffects.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is obviously propecia that is causing the issues, the side effects are well documented (they are similar to extreme hypogonadism but can not be treated by adding testosterone...there is no cure known at this time) but the drug company is lying through their teeth to cover it up. Doctors who aren't following the news surrounding this drug know only what &lt;em&gt;the drug company has told them&lt;/em&gt;--and they believe it. There are some specialists out there that are starting to publish the truth. Even with that said, the medical world is finally starting to wake up to the issues Propecia is causing and new side effects have been listed by the FDA. Also, many men don't start experiencing side effects until they stop taking the pill. Or, until many years after they have been taking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; A lot of people are posting in here claiming that I'm false and I don't know what I'm talking about and it's extreme to try to ban this drug when it worked so well for people. Well guess what? It's not the same for everyone. Blood tests don't lie. Go on the forums at, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.propeciahelp.com/&quot; &gt;http://www.propeciahelp.com/&lt;/a&gt; and read about people's blood tests and hormone levels. &lt;em&gt;THEY ARE NOT NORMAL&lt;/em&gt;. Our lives were stripped away from us because of this drug. That is why I'm posting this to let people know about it. Imagine being 22 and having no desire for sex or to have a girlfriend. Just because the BIG drug corporation is saying that everything is okay, DOESNT MEAN ITS TRUE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example of a drug company messing up, similar to propecia&lt;/em&gt; -- Roche selling accutane It is basically the exact same sequence of events as propecia (not same symptoms, same situation). It was cleared by the FDA, then kids started killing themselves and reporting depression symptoms etc. At first Roche covered it up, and a lot of people thought it was &quot;jsut in the sufferers heads, maybe they are depressed because they have acne not because of the drug they took.&quot; It took the medical industry 25 YEARS to finally get Roche to admit the truth and remove it from the market. Propeciea is on year 14 now and people are finally starting to wake up about it...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA approved it and for years everyone laughed and said &quot;accutane isn't causing depression, these pizza faces are already depressed because they are ugly.&quot; Then as more and more people killed themselves Roche was finally forced to accept the fact that it was their drug causing &quot;a wide range of life-threatening side effects, including psychiatric problems.&quot; THIS TOOK 25 YEARS and thousands of lives were ruined. That is how slow the medical industry is at responding to issues like the propecia one link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=aRyzfbTsj3h8&quot; &gt;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=aRyzfbTsj3h8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit - what people need to understand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;from 12yawaworht:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nobody seems to understand that the issue isn't that he developed side effects, it's that he developed PERMANENT side effects which they definitely don't mention as a risk. Furthermore, many people here are arguing that there is no proof the drug caused his low libido... it's a pretty well documented effect. The problem here is that for every 1 person who got screwed by propecia there are 99 more to clamor in about how wonderful it worked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/DontTakePropecia&quot;&gt; DontTakePropecia &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fuhxi/iama_22_year_old_male_who_suffers_from_permanent/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fuhxi/iama_22_year_old_male_who_suffers_from_permanent/"&gt;[632 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why does Reddit rage when Larry the Cable Guy gets a show on History Channel, but rejoices when Firefly gets picked up by the Science Channel?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fuexy/why_does_reddit_rage_when_larry_the_cable_guy/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fuexy/why_does_reddit_rage_when_larry_the_cable_guy/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2011 17:30:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's face it, there's nothing even remotely scientific about Firefly.

The last video game he ever tried was Wolfenstein 3D when we got our first PC in the early 90's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to now, I still had not succeeded. During the Steam holiday sale, I picked up Company of Heroes, and my first thought was &quot;my dad would love this&quot;. Authentic WW2 stuff with strategy elements. After a long phone conversation of convincing, I managed to get him to not only purchase the game, but also a new 1 gig ATI card so he could run it well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We played last night for the first time, and my dad was laughing hysterically at the amount of fun he had. He picked up on the gameplay well, and we ended up playing together for 4 hours and already made plans to play again tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although we live across the country and see each other maybe once a year, it was nice to finally sit down and play a game with my dad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Wow! Didn't expect this to get so big, let alone make the front page. Thanks so much for all the nice comments, and for posting your &quot;video game parents&quot; stories. Reading all of the comments has made me have such a great day so far. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/EvilClownMafia&quot;&gt; EvilClownMafia &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&quot;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fu9o5/finally_convinced_my_father_to_play_a_video_game/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fu9o5/finally_convinced_my_father_to_play_a_video_game/"&gt;[1256 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Guy standing behind Fox News anchor with &quot;Fake News&quot; sign.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fug4z/guy_standing_behind_fox_news_anchor_with_fake/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fug4z/guy_standing_behind_fox_news_anchor_with_fake/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2011 18:19:55 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/redditdigger&quot;&gt; redditdigger &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/aasP3&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fug4z/guy_standing_behind_fox_news_anchor_with_fake/"&gt;[120 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Boycott all of this.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fuot2/boycott_all_of_this/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fuot2/boycott_all_of_this/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 00:34:51 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fuot2/boycott_all_of_this/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fuot2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Boycott all of this.&quot; title=&quot;Boycott all of this.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/DorthyMantooth&quot;&gt; DorthyMantooth &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/&quot;&gt; pics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/z5cd7&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fuot2/boycott_all_of_this/"&gt;[472 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Boycott all of this.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fuot2.png" /></item><item><title>Bolts being screwed into window frames and the heads being removed after to prevent protesters at the Wisc Capital access to fresh air, food and... a safe exit.
