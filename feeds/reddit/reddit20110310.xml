They were wearing them in response to the pro life day of silence that some other students were engaging in today. It is a Catholic school and as far as I know has the right to do so under the constitution, however it is not a private school, as it receives public funds. Now, just because they can doesn&#39;t mean they should or mean that it is right. I&#39;m asking you to please contact them (contact information is available at the link above) if you deem it worthy of your effort and voice your displeasure. It would mean a lot to me and the suspended students, as well as countless other students, teachers and parents. Thanks guys and girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Publically funded Catholic school suspended a large number of people for wearing wristbands stating their pro choice opinions. Please work some reddit magic and help us out. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tbnewswatch.com/news/Default.aspx?cid=136109&#34; &gt;News coverage&lt;/a&gt;. 35 suspended, 100 sent home, or possibly much fewer. My mistake on the numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, there seems to be some confusion regarding the public nature of the school. Yes, it is a Catholic school, however they are guaranteed certain rights constitutionally dating back to confederation, so they receive public funds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I think this needs more context, as not enough people are reading the news article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a planned event in which pro life students wore red tape with the word &#34;life&#34; written on it and refused to speak for the day in a symbolic gesture. In response to this a number of students wore green tape reading &#34;choice.&#34; This is a public school board, yes. It is NOT private. It is however also a Catholic school. The reasons for this date back to the formation of the country, however for purposes of this discussion you must realize it is not the same as private schools elsewhere. Also, the public school board in Thunder Bay is in many ways an inferior education system to the Catholic board, that is why I myself (I should note I no longer attend, and am of voting age) attended it despite not being Catholic and why many others choose to do so. It is not always so simple as to switch boards if you aren&#39;t Catholic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to this specific event there is no argument that the school violated any rules, as they did not. The official reason for sending the students home was that they had not requested permission to wear the tape prior to the event, and as such the tape constituted a uniform violation. Those wearing red tape were not reprimanded because it had been requested prior to the actual day. However that shouldn&#39;t stop people from expressing their opinions on this if they think it is unjust. If your opinion amounts to &#34;dem&#39;s da breaks&#34; then that is fine, however I am making an appeal here to people who think that just because they can do it doesn&#39;t mean it was the right thing to do in this case. To draw an analogy, the Republican government in Wisconsin seems to have found a legal way to bust the unions, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it is the right thing to do and that you should sit by simply because they can do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, I&#39;d like to thank everyone who has contributed to this one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/nerdor257&#34;&gt; nerdor257 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/&#34;&gt; reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/comments/g1hzg/reddit_today_roughly_100_people_were_suspended/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/g1hzg/reddit_today_roughly_100_people_were_suspended/"&gt;[574 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>IAmA member of the Tosh.0 staff.

If you have and I missed it I apologize but in all the episodes I have seen I have heard no mention about his torture and I’m sure that had I missed it someone on Reddit would have posted a link for all to see but so far there is nothing… only silence. You don’t have to call for his release. You don’t have to say if he’s innocent or guilty. All you have to say is that as we dehumanize Manning we dehumanize ourselves as well. That regardless of guilt or innocence no society can claim to be civil or just if we treat others in such a fashion. There is no excuse or justification of what has been and is still being done. Both of you command impressive audiences and you have used that to bring attention to so many wrongs in American society but recently I have heard nothing about the treatment of Bradley Manning from either of you. I can only speculate as to why you have been silent but it must stop. You must call for the end of this torture. You must call on President Obama to end this travesty and you must do so soon before this carries on any further either destroying Manning or before others are treated the same way regardless of what they are accused of. One of greatest problems with America today is the fervent belief that the ends justify the means. That it doesn’t matter who gets hurt or what rights are infringed upon so long as you get what you want. That belief has been spreading through America like a cancer causing more and more people to see others not as brothers or sisters but rather as obstacles. If someone disagrees with you or does something you don’t like then it doesn’t matter how they are treated so long as you get what you want. This belief will be the end of America as every principle and every right is compromised or ignored. When you stand for nothing.. You are nothing. If you do not want to speak out for the sake of Bradley Manning then at least speak out for the sake of America and for yourselves. For if America continues down this path it will one day perish from the Earth like every other empire before it. When that day comes you will have to ask yourself… Did I do enough to stop it? If you remain silent you can not look yourself in the mirror and honestly say “Yes“.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/TheoJones&#34;&gt; TheoJones &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&#34;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/comments/g1e2c/dear_jon_stewart_and_stephen_colbert_if_you_were/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/g1e2c/dear_jon_stewart_and_stephen_colbert_if_you_were/"&gt;[524 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Danish artist Nadia Plesner paints an African child holding a bag and a chihuahua, resembling Paris Hilton.

Guy sends an iPhone to his sister, insures it for $300. UPS leaves it on their front porch and inevitably someone steals it. So we submit a claim on behalf of the customer, UPS approves it, customer provides his receipt as proof of value. UPS&#39;s insurance company (Crawford I believe) looks over the receipt and decides that the value of the phone is only worth what the customer &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; at the time ($49.99 with a 2 year service agreement, which he can&#39;t use), not what it would cost to &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; (new, about $475). Nevermind that the customer is locked into a service agreement he can&#39;t use since UPS lost his phone, and would have to pay to get out of (perhaps I can submit an &#34;early termination fee&#34; adjustment to the claim).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m wondering what the hell I can do. I&#39;ve butted heads with these guys before, but this is the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. Waiting on a call back from a supervisor. IANAL, so I&#39;m wondering what legal standing this guy has. Or if he is boned, what the methods of publicly shaming UPS/Crawford are? I have no financial stake in this matter at all, but am taking a personal interest in it because it&#39;s incredibly fucked up and really want to help this dude out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is too person alarmy for /askreddit, just steamed right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #1&lt;/strong&gt; Spoke with a UPS claims supervisor and explained the difference between the deposit amount and the phone replacement value. I faxed UPS a receipt from the AT&amp;amp;T Store for the replacement cost of the phone. They said they will verify and submit to Crawford for approval. I&#39;ll wait until we receive the check before declaring victory, but before their rather smug and unhelpful claims rep Nathanial wouldn&#39;t allow us to even make an adjustment (&#34;I have an iPhone and I know how these things work&#34; was what he told me), so it&#39;s definitely headed in the right direction.

I had it set to private but I fixed that so it should work for everyone now! Thanks for suggesting this! &lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&#34; &gt;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2: everyone loved the first song he produced for my sister, here&#39;s another: &lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-out-of-this-world&#34; &gt;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-out-of-this-world&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start off by saying that I&#39;m a long time lurker, first time poster (I actually never made an account before now).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad is a supermarket manager at a regional supermarket chain (I don&#39;t want to say the name in case this somehow gets him in trouble). He started as a teenager packing out groceries to the shelves for his local supermarket of said chain when he was 16. In 4 or 5 years he worked his way up to store manager. So, since he was about 20 until now, (he&#39;s 45), he&#39;s been working as a supermarket store manager for this chain. They send him to the worst store in the area, have him fix it up, then send him to the next one (because he&#39;s very good at what he does).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that his job is slowly killing him. He hates it. He hates it so much he doesn&#39;t even like to talk about it. His bosses give him shit about everything and work him to the bone. He works 6 days a week for 13-14 hours. His blood pressure is continually rising, he&#39;s developing heart problems and he never sleeps from the stress and, most importantly, though I don&#39;t openly mention this to him, I think he really doesn&#39;t even want to be alive anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The important part: my younger sister has the voice of an angel. There will be a link below to a cover she sang. My dad has been trying to get her &#34;noticed&#34; since she was let&#39;s say maybe 13.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But just recently he REALLY got into it - he&#39;s very musically talented and he&#39;s spent about $15k in the last year on recording equipment in an attempt to help my sister get a record deal or whatever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&#39;s really important is that in this process he&#39;s become an absolutely astounding producer. He can produce album quality material with sub-standard equipment. And now, it&#39;s basically become his dream - to produce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a 13 hour day of work he comes home and immediately goes down into his studio and spends the next 6-7 hours working on perfecting songs my sister has sang and researching how to get great vocals and the best equipment for each scenario. Then he gets maybe 1-2 hours of sleep on the couch and goes to work again. Just witnessing it makes me want to cry every single day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what I&#39;m asking is if anyone on reddit has any ties to anyone important in the music industry that they could maybe get him a job or at least a shot at a job being a music producer. He is really good. I mean damn good. Again a link of a cover song he produced for my sister (it&#39;s karaoke of course in the background but anyone who knows a lot about music production knows how hard it is to get perfect vocals and he&#39;s gotten really good at this).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If nothing else, does anyone on LI want some music produced? Really any opportunities will count here. My dad needs a change. He needs to be a producer or at least be involved in something musically important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Link to sister singing: &lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&#34; &gt;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: took pics out, they werent relevant idk why i put them sorry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For what it&#39;s worth, he has an Avedis MA5 preamp, a Buzz elixir (I believe) compressor, and a custom $1300 microphone and he uses Logic Pro 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*Edit: thanks for the responses: here&#39;s a link to soundcloud: &lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&#34; &gt;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*SOUNDCLOUD LINK: &lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&#34; &gt;http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;thanks for whoever put that up there&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit 2: still nothing particularly helpful or any opportunities but many very great comments and good advice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to anyone saying &#34;why bother it&#39;s impossible to make it&#34; im sorry i just cant tell my dad that. he already basically knows that, any further pessimism will just be a slap in the face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested in more from my dad, please message me and I&#39;ll gladly send an e-mail you can ask him for more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
