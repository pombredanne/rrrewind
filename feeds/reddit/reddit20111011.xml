I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, believing that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached four of the highest peaks on all seven continents, including Mt. Everest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HISTORY &amp;amp; FAMILY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was a successful businessman before running for office in 1994. I started a door-to-door handyman business to help pay my way through college. Twenty years later, I had grown the firm into one of the largest construction companies in New Mexico with over 1,000 employees. .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m best known for my veto record, which includes over 750 vetoes during my time in office, more than all other governors combined and my use of the veto pen has since earned me the nickname “Governor Veto.” I cut taxes 14 times while never raising them. When I left office, New Mexico was one of only four states in the country with a balanced budget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was term-limited, and retired from public office in 2003.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, after becoming increasingly concerned with the country’s out-of-control national debt and precarious financial situation, the I formed the OUR America Initiative, a 501c(4) non-profit that promotes fiscal responsibility, civil liberties, and rational public policy. I&#39;ve traveled to more than 30 states and spoken with over 150 conservative and libertarian groups during my time as Honorary Chairman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have two grown children - a daughter Seah and a son Erik. I currently resides in a house I built myself in Taos, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve scaled the highest peaks of 4 continents, including Everest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve competed in the Bataan Memorial Death March, a 25 mile desert run in combat boots wearing a 35 pound backpack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve participated in Hawaii’s invitation-only Ironman Triathlon Championship, several times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve mountain biked the eight day Adidas TransAlps Challenge in Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, I finished a 458 mile bicycle &#34;Ride for Freedom&#34; all across New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE INFORMATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information you can check out my website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.GaryJohnson2012.com/&#34; &gt;www.GaryJohnson2012.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subreddit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/GaryJohnson&#34; &gt;r/GaryJohnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/GovGaryJohnson&#34;&gt; GovGaryJohnson &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&#34;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/l8utx/iama_entrepreneur_ironman_scaler_of_mt_everest/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/l8utx/iama_entrepreneur_ironman_scaler_of_mt_everest/"&gt;[2576 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Oh, You just graduated?

I have made another thread on Reddit, that hopefully all of you will read. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l8z9h/a_message_to_all_of_you/&#34; &gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l8z9h/a_message_to_all_of_you/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Oct. 11&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At around 12 AM this morning, I heard of the police raids on Boston at the “Occupy Wallstreet” protest. Within three hours of the first raid, over four more demonstrations were raided. People were beaten, their possessions taken and thrown away. The demonstrations&#39; aid, housing and food tents were all also destroyed by local police forces. A brazen demonstration of censorship by our government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within hours of all this happening, the internet caught fire with the news of these atrocities. Millions of people were outraged, calling for justice over our governments wrong-doings… Including myself. I, personally am outraged. We as a nation have been sheeped and lied to. We have been brainwashed into thinking that our government is for our people. That they will protect us, and take care of us. People are starting to realize that we have been lied to, for too long. Our government no longer upholds its word to protect us. Their brutality towards us is proof enough that we don’t have the rights we once did. We as a body of people are slowly becoming more and more censored. Today has been a great example of censorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve finally hit a true nerve by protesting against the one entity that rules every aspect of our lives: Wall Street. What the majority of America doesn’t realize, or refuses to realize, is that people in Wall Street control our media. Our government. Our Jobs and markets. Everything. We are in a depression because of Wall Street’s shady dealings. People in our government are paid by major corporations to promote ideas that benefit said corporations. Not the people. Personally, I feel like we as a nation can trust no one but ourselves now. Our government has given into the power of the all mighty dollar. I feel as if even my fellow citizens are misguided about what’s going on. News media does not tell the whole truth on what happens in our country and world. We know only what they choose to show us. News casters and reporters for CNN, FOX news and other outlets like them label these protesters as “Anarchist”, “Crazy” and “Clowns”. Let me ask you this question: What’s crazier? People fighting wall street to reform it’s policies because we as a nation are becoming more crippled economically day by day; or one man having the net worth of over a billion dollars because he manipulated our markets and got away with it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We as americans, as brothers and sisters of our country, need to open our eyes to the truth. We can only ignore our problems for so long before it comes to a head. The way things are going right now, there will be riots in the streets, and we will see how quickly our government reacts to protect their interests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of you will disagree with me. I’m sure some of you will think of me as being crazy and radical. I expect that. But can any of you really deny that there is something very wrong going on in our country? There is a great social unrest in this country, and people are starting to act upon it… Whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s time for revolution, and where will you stand? With the people who lie to you on a daily basis? Or the voices of reason? This isn’t a matter of race, sex or political affiliation. It’s a matter of national stability. A matter of regaining what it means to be America and American. If you agree with what I say, then join the cause. Make our world a better place. Stand up for what is right. If you don’t agree with me, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can promise you that change will come. Whether anyone wants it or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All across the world, there are riots, protests, and wars going on under the same premises of our problems. It is more than America. It is the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone is starting to see how led astray we’ve been for so many years by our governments. You cannot expect us as a body of people to idly sit by any longer and put up with the mistreatment of our families and communities. There has to come a time where we have to say enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That time is now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I’ll ask you again. Where will you stand when it’s you against our government? Where will your allegiances lie?With your country or your government?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This message is bigger than Wall Street protests. These demonstrations are but a mere catalyst for what’s to come. Now is not the time to be afraid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Proof of internet censorship bill: [1] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804Videos&#34; &gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804Videos&lt;/a&gt; on the bill: [2] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb1UQgujPyg&amp;amp;feature=related&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb1UQgujPyg&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt; Mandelson&#39;s Internet Censorship video: [3] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sgUaPBvDlA&amp;amp;feature=related&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sgUaPBvDlA&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt; Bradley Manning Mistreatment: [4] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GX4XUGQ434&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GX4XUGQ434&lt;/a&gt; Discussions of Wall Street undermindings: [5]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgdG-al5Azw&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgdG-al5Azw&lt;/a&gt; [6] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_D2Sg7YjA&amp;amp;feature=related&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_D2Sg7YjA&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt; Federal bailout discussions: [7] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYvv2xT8yI&amp;amp;feature=related&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYvv2xT8yI&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt; More information will be provided later. This is just a bit of the basis of where I&#39;m coming from. We are actively trying to be censored by our government. We deal with shady dealings from wallstreet, even when we bailed these companies out. Bradley Manning&#39;s case is another case of censorship. ALSO! I want this to be a message spread around to anywhere you guys see fit. I want people to add to this, to make it the voice of the people, not just the voice of a person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: I just realized that I put Detroit. I fixed it to Boston. I&#39;m starting to realize that a small chunk of you are not even pointing out anything except my grammatical errors. I used the wrong &#34;There or Their&#34; a few times. If your sole purpose for being here is to worry about minor grammatical errors, then you&#39;re not here for the right reasons. I do realize that this is very vague, and it needs work.. but its the overall message that should matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PLEASE DON&#39;T LET THIS DIE! It needs to be seen by as many people as possible. All of you who are asking how to help, this is how. Spread the word. Words can have more power than anything else in this world if enough see it as truth. For those who don&#39;t see it that way, it just causes more fuel to the fire for what we stand for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: Someone was nice of enough to edit this posting for me. I have reposted this completely updated to be correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, Funny how my personal life is being brought into this now. Some people will do whatever they can to discredit a person because of something in a persons past. I do have my GED, I am 19. I have made mistakes, I have gone through my fair share of grief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, I find all that irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also like to thank the people who have gotten me reddit gold, and sending me PM&#39;s. I appreciate everything you guys are doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A NEWLY RELEASED MESSAGE FROM ANONYMOUS: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZA3y05Dcz8&#34; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZA3y05Dcz8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello world, hello protestors. This is a message from anonymous. This is a message to the 99 percent. This is a message to the American Autumn. It is clear that from the beginning of this movement we have been censored. Despite the fact that, massive demonstrations, were planning to occupy wallstreet, we were ignored in the media. Despite the fact that the protestors were flocking from every corner of the nation to join the protest they remained silent. However, the era of the internet is upon us. The power to circumvent the mass media has become trivial. You are paper tigers, and we are a scorching wildfire. The elites have been forced to recognize the movement, they have been forced to stand against us. And so began the campaign to mock us. We are dirty, homeless, unAmerican, stupid, voiceless, disorganized, violent. We are a mob, we are young, foolish, liberal, unemployed. We are leeches, parasites, anarchists, brainwashed. We are communists, dangerous, untrustworthy, rabble rousers, terrorists. However, despite the frantic and desparate moves by the elites to slander this movement, despite their vain efforts to curtail and skew our image, we have shattered through ther lies. The truth was spread, the lies were snuffed out. We will not be set aside by mere insults and disgusting propaganda. We are the people, and this is what democracy looks like. The elites now are being pushed up against the walls. They are resorting to their trump cards, and the strong arms have arrived. The camps of boston have been raided. The camps of San Francisco have been dispersed. The protests in New York have been violently curtailed and beaten. The protests in Seattle are on the verge of being raided by riot police. This is the final step in our strategy. A famous man once said that at first they will ignore you. Then they will mock you. Thirdly they will fight you. And then you win. There is nothing you can do. There are no more moves to make, this is checkmate. The game is over wall street. You fell into our trap, you repeated history. You planted the seeds for civil dissent, and now you will watch as what you reap is sowed, you will watch as the entire country blossoms and you are consumed. All the dominos are falling, and you will watch as one by one we prevail. The protestors have won. Stop your vain efforts, the wildfires are all around you. Stop preparing for revolution. Its upon you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do not want to read this post, then this is not a place for you. I won&#39;t summarize this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/BigTayTay&#34;&gt; BigTayTay &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&#34;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l8k0u/if_you_are_outraged_about_whats_going_on_all_over/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l8k0u/if_you_are_outraged_about_whats_going_on_all_over/"&gt;[2936 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIL there are a slew of hidden tools in MSPaint, including the ability to create your own brushes (Ch. 2)</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l8mn6/til_there_are_a_slew_of_hidden_tools_in_mspaint/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l8mn6/til_there_are_a_slew_of_hidden_tools_in_mspaint/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2011 19:29:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l8mn6/til_there_are_a_slew_of_hidden_tools_in_mspaint/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l8mn6.png&#34; alt=&#34;TIL there are a slew of hidden tools in MSPaint, including the ability to create your own brushes (Ch. 2)&#34; title=&#34;TIL there are a slew of hidden tools in MSPaint, including the ability to create your own brushes (Ch. 2)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/SunnyApples&#34;&gt; SunnyApples &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/&#34;&gt; todayilearned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/tutorial/mspaint&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l8mn6/til_there_are_a_slew_of_hidden_tools_in_mspaint/"&gt;[272 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>TIL there are a slew of hidden tools in MSPaint, including the ability to create your own brushes (Ch. 2)</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l8mn6.png" /></item><item><title>The Avengers - First Proper Trailer [HD][Official]</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l8aat/the_avengers_first_proper_trailer_hdofficial/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l8aat/the_avengers_first_proper_trailer_hdofficial/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2011 14:14:19 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l8aat/the_avengers_first_proper_trailer_hdofficial/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l8aat.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Avengers - First Proper Trailer [HD][Official]&#34; title=&#34;The Avengers - First Proper Trailer [HD][Official]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/GHawke&#34;&gt; GHawke &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&#34;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDV-t5sgDgI&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l8aat/the_avengers_first_proper_trailer_hdofficial/"&gt;[1552 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>The Avengers - First Proper Trailer [HD][Official]</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l8aat.png" /></item><item><title>What's the most 'forever-alone' thing you have ever done?

She was pretty attractive, and she was really outgoing and fun to be with. So after the night of getting to know this woman, I was infatuated with her so I decide to ask her on a date. She said &#34;sure.&#34; So, we went on this &#34;date&#34; which she decided would be fun. She drove me to a huge bridge outside of the loop in Chicago and I was a little confused. I asked her what we were going to do and she said just wait. So I waited in silence for about a minute when she took my hand and squeezed it harder than the fucking Hulk and started screaming and crying about how she wanted to die and give up on life. I tried to comfort her but she just said I was an ass for not seeing that she was depressed earlier so she ran in her car and drove away, leaving me three miles from apartment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR Met a girl at a party, asked her on a date, she took me to a random bridge and flipped out at me for being depressed and took off without me leaving me to walk home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 1: HOLY SHIT FRONT PAGE!?!?
