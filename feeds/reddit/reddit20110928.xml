I am 25 my wife is 24. I have been in the air force for 6 years and I just got back from a 7 month deployment. We live on base and a year ago on base housing recently started letting civilians move into the houses as well. my neighbor is a civilian in his late 20s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few days ago the kids were playing in the front yard when my wife came back from the store and tells me she thinks she saw my 5 year old son walking out of our neighbors house (I was inside with our 3 year old and 8mo so I wasn&#39;t watching). My wife is really creeped out by this guy and I have to admit he IS socially awkward, but creepy doesn&#39;t make you a child molester and I don&#39;t want to ruin this guys life just because he is creepy. I also don&#39;t want to take any chances because it only takes one time for my sons life to be changed forever and to be honest I would pick my son over a random stranger any day of the week. My wife knocked on the guys door to talk to him but he didn&#39;t answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So anyways, I sat my son down and asked him if he went into the neighbors house. He said no. I then asked him what his living room looked like. He said that his living room was cleaner than ours and that he had kids movies. I asked him what his upstairs looked like and he said that he hadn&#39;t been inside his house but that his neighbor told him that he had bunk beds and kids toys for sleepovers. I asked him how he knew what was in the living room and he said that his neighbor had told him. And that was the end of the conversation. My wife talked to him again today and he said the same story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So i&#39;m thinking my son could be lying but I have no way of knowing for sure. Some of my friends are telling me to call the cops and just ask them for advice. I am really at a crossroad right now and I could use some fresh ideas on how to handle this situation. Any help is appreciated, thanks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also, the neighbor hasn&#39;t told us any of this and I am still trying to catch him home so I can talk to him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT2: Well, thanks to someone for showing me this website: (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.familywatchdog.us&#34; &gt;http://www.familywatchdog.us&lt;/a&gt;). I checked it and while there are quite a few sex offenders within a 5 miles radius none of them are near where this guy lives. Thanks for all the comments, I think I am just going to man up and knock on this guys door every 30 minutes or so until he answers and confront him with what my son said. If he denies it I don&#39;t really know where to go from there (Do I take his word over my sons?). Should I ask to see inside his house just to be sure? It is so hard for me to see this from my neighbors perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/Zao_SC&#34;&gt; Zao_SC &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&#34;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kud4u/my_5_year_old_son_says_my_neighbor_told_him_he/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kud4u/my_5_year_old_son_says_my_neighbor_told_him_he/"&gt;[2122 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>This guy is a fucking genius.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku871/this_guy_is_a_fucking_genius/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku871/this_guy_is_a_fucking_genius/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 16:43:10 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku871/this_guy_is_a_fucking_genius/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_ku871.png&#34; alt=&#34;This guy is a fucking genius.&#34; title=&#34;This guy is a fucking genius.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/Smorgo22&#34;&gt; Smorgo22 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&#34;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FX_84iWPLU&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku871/this_guy_is_a_fucking_genius/"&gt;[358 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>This guy is a fucking genius.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_ku871.png" /></item><item><title>TIL: There's a town under a lake in Italy, and the church tower can still be seen above the surface.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/kuf3f/til_theres_a_town_under_a_lake_in_italy_and_the/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/kuf3f/til_theres_a_town_under_a_lake_in_italy_and_the/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 19:49:01 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/kuf3f/til_theres_a_town_under_a_lake_in_italy_and_the/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_kuf3f.png&#34; alt=&#34;TIL: There&#39;s a town under a lake in Italy, and the church tower can still be seen above the surface.&#34; title=&#34;TIL: There&#39;s a town under a lake in Italy, and the church tower can still be seen above the surface.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/cursemyvestigialarms&#34;&gt; cursemyvestigialarms &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/&#34;&gt; todayilearned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reschensee&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/kuf3f/til_theres_a_town_under_a_lake_in_italy_and_the/"&gt;[253 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>TIL: There's a town under a lake in Italy, and the church tower can still be seen above the surface.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_kuf3f.png" /></item><item><title>Pakistani Family Refuses to Kill Daughter Who Was Raped, Drawing Anger</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ku0tg/pakistani_family_refuses_to_kill_daughter_who_was/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ku0tg/pakistani_family_refuses_to_kill_daughter_who_was/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 12:39:46 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/kafka201&#34;&gt; kafka201 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&#34;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/09/pakistani-family-refuses-to-kill-daughter-who-was-raped-drawing-anger/245691/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ku0tg/pakistani_family_refuses_to_kill_daughter_who_was/"&gt;[1883 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>I was sued for over $1.2 million unknowingly and now I am being bullied by Craigslist.org and their lawyers.

As you can imagine, I was shocked to hear this and immediately began searching online for case documents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Craigslist&#39;s lawyer, Mr. Hennessy stated in one document that I was &#34;personally&#34; served, as in a process server handed documents directly to me. They are now saying that I was &#34;sub-served&#34;, as in served through a friend. I was never served anything and haven&#39;t seen any legal documents regarding this until recently. I have the document where Hennessy says I was personally served that I got online about a month ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are currently fighting my &#34;Motion to Vacate&#34; the default judgment (to have the judgement reversed because I was not served) by saying I was actually sub-served.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Craigslist&#39;s efforts are pointless but their lawyer said they are only doing this &#34;to make an example&#34; out of me. By now they are aware that I don&#39;t have anything of value because they have gone through everything during collection, yet they continue to bully me. I have 10 month old twin infants and it is difficult to deal with this and be a parent at the same time. Craigslist is aware of what they are dealing with at this point and they have made it very clear that they simply don&#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TechDirt has gone into more detail about everything which you can read here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110922/02372216046/craigslist-trying-to-destroy-life-someone-who-made-posting-to-craigslist-easier.shtml&#34; &gt;Craigslist Trying To Destroy The Life Of Someone Who Made Posting To Craigslist Easier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there is any interest, please AMAA. If you need proof then I suppose I could scan my drivers license and send it over to the mods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tl;dr - Craigslist won a &#34;default judgment&#34; against me for over $1.2 million and don&#39;t care that I was not actually served. I did not have the opportunity to respond and defend myself. They are currently bullying my broke ass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe i have answered most of the questions that have been asked so far. I had no idea I would make the front page. I am currently trying to stay on top of this AMA and my twins who are all over the place.

Money must be put outside of politics, or politicians will continue to pander to those who contribute the most to their campaigns, rather than their own constituencies. Specifically, we abhor the decision by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC. Corporations are NOT people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt;True Shared Sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While corporate profits have been skyrocketing and the wealthy have been getting wealthier, the average worker’s income has dramatically dropped. While the cost of living has exponentially increased, wages have not followed. It has been shown time and time again that tax cuts for the wealthy are NOT effective. Taxes on those who practice greed should be raised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3.&lt;strong&gt;Equality in Justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This great nation was founded on liberty, but also, on equality. When the balance of justice is swayed in favor of those with wealth, the very fabric of this nation is torn apart. The decision of a judge should not be based upon the race, creed, or wealth of an individual, but rather, the content of the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4.&lt;strong&gt;The End of the Revolving Door &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Obama administration was supposed to bring change and hope to our country, but instead, brought us into despair and insecurity. Those working in his administration are the very people whom we are fighting against. Those who enter Washington should not be representatives of the elites, but representatives of the people. One cannot simply enter an administration, reap its benefits, and simply exit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: spelling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/TransparentBicycle&#34;&gt; TransparentBicycle &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&#34;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kunyb/ive_been_at_occupy_wall_street_since_day_1here_is/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kunyb/ive_been_at_occupy_wall_street_since_day_1here_is/"&gt;[91 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>This is the only time a video game has ever triggered a personal fear to the point I shuddered</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kuarr/this_is_the_only_time_a_video_game_has_ever/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kuarr/this_is_the_only_time_a_video_game_has_ever/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:53:51 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kuarr/this_is_the_only_time_a_video_game_has_ever/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_kuarr.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is the only time a video game has ever triggered a personal fear to the point I shuddered&#34; title=&#34;This is the only time a video game has ever triggered a personal fear to the point I shuddered&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/jeanlucdickhard&#34;&gt; jeanlucdickhard &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&#34;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/Z6Xn1.jpg&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kuarr/this_is_the_only_time_a_video_game_has_ever/"&gt;[602 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>This is the only time a video game has ever triggered a personal fear to the point I shuddered</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_kuarr.png" /></item><item><title>The perfect reaction to this commercial.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku9va/the_perfect_reaction_to_this_commercial/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku9va/the_perfect_reaction_to_this_commercial/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:30:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku9va/the_perfect_reaction_to_this_commercial/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_ku9va.png&#34; alt=&#34;The perfect reaction to this commercial.&#34; title=&#34;The perfect reaction to this commercial.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/turdmalone&#34;&gt; turdmalone &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&#34;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUGYBXJ2bMY&amp;amp;feature=related&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ku9va/the_perfect_reaction_to_this_commercial/"&gt;[71 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>The perfect reaction to this commercial.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_ku9va.png" /></item></channel></rss>
