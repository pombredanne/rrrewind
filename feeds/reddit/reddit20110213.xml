We exchanged information and decided to hang out the next day. I get all gussied up and he picked me up in the same clothing he was wearing at the park. Red flag right there, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he had many pairs of the same sweats, guys always have many white tee's, etc. So, we start driving and I ask what was the plan, where were we going to go and he tells me that he is kind of low on cash but thought it would be fun if we went back to his place and watched movies.....see NOW I know what that means but as a 16, 17, or 18 year old (can't remember exact age) I thought, oh alright, he is older maybe he had to pay rent or something as I look into his big green eyes. I halfheartedly agree and we head over to his place. I walk in and he begins to tell me that he lives with his mom and his ex-girlfriend moved out a while back. He takes me to his room, and I immediately am taken aback. He has pictures all over his bedroom of him and his ex-girlfriend. I understand this is like the third red flag but I begin to rationalize this by saying to myself, &quot;Aww he is so heartbroken about his ex-girlfriend he cannot bear to take the pictures down! I will heal his heart!&quot; Women are stupid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, we start talking as he put some movie on and he asked me 3 questions about myself. As I begin to answer question number three, he stops me and says, &quot; I have heard and learned enough about you. I really like you and I think it's time for us to have sex.&quot; He proceeds to take out his DICK, flops it out and POINTS at it. I get up, grab my bag and RUN, literally run, out of there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I look back, I know it was a stupid move and I could have been raped or murdered but teenagers are stupid and I'm glad I am alive to tell the tale and share it on Reddit.

I've had this problem since the age of 12, so I haven't had any friends since then, as a result of which I'm socially inept. Months of practice have given me the ability to seem interested by responding with algorithmically generated questions; I ask different people the same set of questions with the chronological sequence randomized to a limited extent. This works for getting people's contact information (career networking, not flirting). But I'm unable to cultivate this link for more than a couple of meetings due to my inability to hold an extemporaneous conversation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if a person tells me what they do for a living, my internal rule-based question generator recognizes the pattern and spits out &quot;do you enjoy it?&quot; and &quot;what got you into it?&quot; as two possible questions. But their answer to any of these questions leaves me with a mixture of bafflement, &quot;cool story, bro&quot; and &quot;what the fuck am I even doing here?&quot;. If someone says that they find something awesome, my internal response is &quot;well that's nice&quot;. I'm essentially a walking chatbot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do I fix this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/trappedlunatic&quot;&gt; trappedlunatic &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fko6s/how_do_i_become_genuinely_interested_in_people/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fko6s/how_do_i_become_genuinely_interested_in_people/"&gt;[360 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>I love you like a MadCatz controller...</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fkpxo/i_love_you_like_a_madcatz_controller/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fkpxo/i_love_you_like_a_madcatz_controller/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2011 21:13:27 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fkpxo/i_love_you_like_a_madcatz_controller/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fkpxo.png&quot; alt=&quot;I love you like a MadCatz controller...&quot; title=&quot;I love you like a MadCatz controller...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/pfohl&quot;&gt; pfohl &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&quot;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://1kteeth.blogspot.com/2011/02/valentines-day.html&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fkpxo/i_love_you_like_a_madcatz_controller/"&gt;[60 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>I love you like a MadCatz controller...</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fkpxo.png" /></item><item><title>Guy has oral sex with two girls who are over the age of consent.
