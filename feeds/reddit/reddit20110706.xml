Places lived: California and Virginia (very young), Paraguay, Venezuela (yes, while Chavez was in power), Argentina, Washington state (college, where I had culture shock). I can tell you a lot about why people hate americans, and how lucky Americans are to live in this country&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;VERIFICATION: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/VrRNF.jpg&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is my passports, along with my state department id. i didnt have enough evidence of countries ive lived in, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/TDfbI.jpg&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a picture of my jerseys. i know this is sucky evidence. im trying to find more stuff to take pictures of, will be up very soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;VERIFICATION EDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/44Xdo.jpg&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a picture of my most current visa to argentina, and a recent dip visa to work over the summer in guetemala. i had my passport updated in 2008, so im searching for my old passports to verify venezuela and paraguay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT1: I'm sorry for the use of the term 3rd world, your advice was helpful in suggesting to use 'developing' instead. i didn't mean to offend anyone or misuse the term 3rd world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm also not looking for pity! It's /r/IAmA. The reason I posted this was for relevant issues such as people who had questions about Foreign Service, or the countries in particular that I've lived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To clear things up, people calling bullshit on me saying there was physical abuse for being American, it's really like that in some places. It's not common, but it happens. It only happened to me in 3rd and 4th grade, it wasn't like I've been beaten my whole life. Paraguay was known for its violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I should have added that I understand that I'm extremely priviledged and that I didn't have to go through what I saw a lot of close friends go through. I was never starving, I never was worried about money, and I lived in a beautiful home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: as requested, a couple interesting stories... People say I must have hid in my American bubble, so I'll explain how I went around that. In Buenos Aires there's a train called the TBA. Me and my friends went to a rich private school and were sick of the people there, so ew took the train to different areas of town, and literally walked the streets in search of kids our age. We made a lot of friends in a neighbourhood called Virreyes in particular. look it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;a funny drunk story.. let's see... AH! one time me and a friend met some local argentines at a mall called Unicenter, and they invited us to a party. we were ecstatic, of course(especially at the mention of free booze). the they told us we had to walk a lot to get to the party. No biggie, I like walking. So after walking through some pretty shady neighbourhoods for maybe an hour we finally get to the party house. the place was so run down there was only two windows still intact. There wasn't a dear. it was more just like a giant slab of concrete. well, we go into the backyard and the place is PACKED with people. the 'bar' (a plastic table where they served drinks) was only serving one drink... beer mixed with wine out of a box in a giant plastic flowerpot with a straw. XD it was digusting. id never seen anything like it. well, we sucked it up and drank it. and here was my favourite part about the whole thing: as run down as everything was, they still had the most AMAZING dj setup id ever seen in a house. im talking state of the art turntables, club lasers, amazing speakers.. it was pretty great. well ew hung out at this party, met a lot of interesting people, it was a lot of fun. i guess its not much of a story, more just an account of an interesting experience.. but still. go ahead and tell me its fake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/thing1and2&quot;&gt; thing1and2 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/ii6h6/iaman_american_diplomats_son_and_grew_up_in_third/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ii6h6/iaman_american_diplomats_son_and_grew_up_in_third/"&gt;[1804 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Powerful 7.8 earthquake hits New Zealand</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iie8q/powerful_78_earthquake_hits_new_zealand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iie8q/powerful_78_earthquake_hits_new_zealand/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 20:10:35 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/from_the_sea&quot;&gt; from_the_sea &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/quake-pacific-idUSN1E7651IT20110706&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iie8q/powerful_78_earthquake_hits_new_zealand/"&gt;[214 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>I am from Bosnia, and during the war in the 90s I visited a concentration camp Trnopolje Twice.

I left Banjaluka in 1994 and went to Croatia for 12 days and after that I went to Germany and lived there for about 4 years.
