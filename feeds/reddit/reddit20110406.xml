Too mind-fucked over this and have a few friends on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backstory: So my mom has been single for years. She's been divorced a total of 3 times (a 1-year marriage when she was 18; married to my dad for 10 years; then remarried my retard stepdad almost another 10) and her last relationship was probably 8+ years ago that was also to another waste of space, but she didn't marry that one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently, she started dating online, and myself and my older brother and younger sister have been supportive of this. We understand she wants to meet someone and she deserves it too. She's been relatively cautious up until now, and has been using a background check program on anyone she meets. She's turned away a number of scammer-type guys she's met (one she literally nicknamed &quot;Nigeria&quot;) and hasn't been easily duped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So she meets &quot;Jeff&quot; on another site (she had been using Match.com, where she met all the scammers; he came up on another site that isn't as well known). Jeff is a wealthy Russian businessman that has lived in the US since he was 23. He's got a daughter going to school in England, and owns a construction company and is planning to retire soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeff and Mom have been talking for a grand total of 3 months. The first month she even admitted she didn't talk to him much, since she was talking to all sorts of people when she first joined these dating sites, so really, let's call it 2 months. She's told me a few times before now that she &quot;really, really likes him,&quot; but that's been it thus far. She texted me Saturday night saying just that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, she calls me. After the usual pleasantries, she drops the bombshell on me: Her and Jeff are in love. He asked her to marry him. She said yes. The wedding is over the summer. He's visiting her in PA next week. When he leaves PA, she's going with him. (This, all over the phone; they haven't met face-to-face yet.) She's not sure how to tell her boss, whom she's worked for for almost 9 years, that's she's quitting, but he sure as hell isn't getting 2 weeks' notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeff &quot;wants to take care of her.&quot; She doesn't need her car. He'll &quot;take care of it (she owes too much to sell it yet).&quot; He calls her his &quot;world.&quot; He's got money and doesn't want her to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mom has always struggled with money (and obviously, men). This guy comes along with a fairy-tale story and wants to give her everything she could want. And she's hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reddit, WHAT. THE. FUCK. This is how 20/20 specials start. I'm so incredibly worried about her, and can't make any sense of this situation. Yes, there is always the possibility that this guy is completely legit and he just wants to sweep her off her feet and make her happy for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then again, if anyone told you they had met a wealth Russian living in Florida who was about to retire on millions and wanted to do nothing more than just take care of them, would would call that a fairy tale, and who would call it a scam?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additional details:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom's not an American citizen; she has a green card and moved here from Australia about 20 years ago. I don't know if he's a citizen or not, but if this is what it's about, the jokes on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond whatever she might have in a life insurance policy and a little retirement (neither of which I have any idea of, but which I don't believe to been significant) she really has no assets. My brother bought a house and moved her in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother and sister are in PA, but I moved to Florida and will (thankfully) be only about 2.5 hours from where she is planning to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been cautiously supportive. I told her my main reservation is that she's leaving with him immediately. If he's got so much money, take a few months and actually &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt;, then decide to move down there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I text her today asking for Jeff's last name and the name of his company. Her response was &quot;I don't feel like talking today. Love you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Mom met a guy online 3 months ago and is ready to get rid of her car, quit her job, and move to Florida with him next week. Sounds so incredibly scammy it makes me sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: formatting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Thank you, Reddit.&lt;/strong&gt; I haven't spoke to my mom yet, but you guys have given me a ton of great advice. Needless to say, I'm more concerned than before, but that's only going to motivate me to really make her aware of just how shady this sounds, and how worried I am. I've got to get some work done for now (and have needed to all day, but oh well), but I'll update you on this thread periodically, as well as later on when &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3&lt;/strong&gt; I know you guys are dying for details, and people have sent me some really helpful links. Right now though, I don't have his picture (so no TinEye or luck searching RomanceScam.com), no last name (so no Pipl.com or unleashing the hordes of the internet on him) or anything else at the moment. I spoke to my mom briefly a bit ago, who is, unfortunately, at the hospital with my sister who is apparently going through a ruptured appendix. Mom claims she was just &quot;cranky&quot; when I texted her earlier, and that we'll talk tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it's been a shitty couple of days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mom did say we would talk later, but for the time being, I really can't get any details about this guy. As soon as I know more, or anything has actually happened, I'll post details. But thank you again, Reddit. The support, advice, links, and wealth of terrifyingly similar stories has been hugely helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 4&lt;/strong&gt; FYI, just to clarify: I'm a daughter, not a son. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 5&lt;/strong&gt; Reddit, you've been amazing. Thank you for all the feedback, suggestions and kind words. At this point, there's nothing I can do tonight. My sister is undergoing an emergency appendectomy (of all fucking days, seriously?), and my mom is with her at the hospital. It's not exactly an ideal time to be pressing her about this guy. I'm definitely going to get details on him tomorrow, as I do believe she won't try to withhold that information. But until then, I can't offer anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you all again. I've received some really incredible PM's about people with heavy-duty resources, and will definitely be following up with them, especially as soon as I have more info. Good night to you all. Much love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/WTF_Mom&quot;&gt; WTF_Mom &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt;

I'd rather not have this turn into a feature request thread for Minecraft, so please avoid asking things about the game directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/xNotch&quot;&gt; xNotch &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/gjrf4/iama_indie_game_developer_who_made_a_commercially/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gjrf4/iama_indie_game_developer_who_made_a_commercially/"&gt;[2485 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Glenn Beck to End Daily Fox News Program</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gk0kh/glenn_beck_to_end_daily_fox_news_program/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gk0kh/glenn_beck_to_end_daily_fox_news_program/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 16:39:46 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/misterAction&quot;&gt; misterAction &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/glenn-beck-to-end-daily-fox-news-program/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gk0kh/glenn_beck_to_end_daily_fox_news_program/"&gt;[753 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cracks me up every time.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gkdhe/cracks_me_up_every_time/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gkdhe/cracks_me_up_every_time/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2011 01:36:29 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/michaelburns&quot;&gt; michaelburns &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/&quot;&gt; funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Ytgxe.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gkdhe/cracks_me_up_every_time/"&gt;[26 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hey Sheen.

Back when I was about 6 years old my family bought a big fish tank with a lot of expensive fish in it. I personally chose one from the store and named him Batman. After a couple months I noticed the tank was a little dirty, I decided that I would clean it because a badass like Batman needs a clean tank. So I pulled up a chair next to the tank and dumped a bottle of dishsoap into it. The next day my parents told me that they decided to put the fish back into the ocean but I realised several years later that I killed every single fish with my attempt at cleaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Killed Batman with dishsoap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/1r2e3w4q&quot;&gt; 1r2e3w4q &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/gjyz6/whats_the_stupidest_thing_youve_done_as_a_child/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gjyz6/whats_the_stupidest_thing_youve_done_as_a_child/"&gt;[2047 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Billy grown up</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gk4tn/billy_grown_up/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gk4tn/billy_grown_up/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 19:23:45 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/dietsoda&quot;&gt; dietsoda &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/&quot;&gt; funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/fnRUq.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gk4tn/billy_grown_up/"&gt;[107 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>One guys solution to his girl taking his fries...
