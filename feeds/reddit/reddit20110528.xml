We'll call him 'Jack'. Jack has always been a strange guy, and we banded together in our younger years as a couple of like-minded gamer kids, and bonded over our similar social ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Overtime it became clear that he wasn't maturing at a normal rate, and while I began to grow up, he continued to lag behind. Turns out he had ADHD and he struggled with it, going many years at a time without medication because of his low-income family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Back to last night though. Jack was dropping me off at home, and before I could get out of the car, our idle conversation took a turn for the serious. He told me that he'd been struggling with an internal demon for as long as he can remember, and has a strong desire to kill. He's gutted a cat, killed a dog, and forcefully drowned one of the mice that lives in the walls of his house while talking to it. Telling the mouse exactly what he was doing to it, step by step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He enjoys this. It's a release for a desire he's kept largely within himself for years and years. He has had many thoughts of killing humans before, and is concerned he might lose control some day and murder someone. He is not a bad person. In fact, before last night, I wouldn't have pegged him as someone capable of hurting a mouse, much less killing a dog. He is a loving, caring, kind person who has been put through a whole hell of a lot of circumstantial bullshit in his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I'm worried he is going to break soon. He's one of my best friends, I want to do something to help him, but I don't know what to do. We discussed psychiatric help, but he is having trouble with money right now, as am I. He doesn't want to talk to his mom about his secret, because his only brother is now a meth addict, and struggling with life and Jack doesn't want to worry his mom. I told him he needs to talk to her anyway, that she'd do anything in her power to help her son, but I can't force him to talk to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Should I talk to her behind his back? Should I wait and see if maybe now that he's finally told someone about his problem that he might find the strength to tell her himself? I'm really worried Reddit. I need some help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Minor typos, grammar issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPDATE 1: I'm going to do my best to keep you all updated on what happens with this. I'll be hanging out with Jack soon, and I'm going to have another long talk with him. Would you guys recommend showing him this thread? It seems like it might be a terrible idea, but it also might be helpful for him to see that he really does need to get some help. Guh, my brain is fried. Thank you all for your advice and sincerity. Reddit is amazing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 2: I know I need to do something about this asap, but I want to talk to him again before I make any decisions. I won't have a chance to do that for a day or two. Lots of you will tell me that I need to go and make a decision right now, but I can't do that without talking to him again. As his closest friend, I know him well enough to know that he isn't going to do anything totally crazy right now, and I know many of you will call bullshit on that. Yes he needs help, but he is a more put together, capable person than I made him sound. I'm taking every comment to heart, and am pretty sure I can convince him to go with me to a treatment center. He wants the help. Thank you all again for your thoughts. I'll update again when I talk to him. Things will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Versick&quot;&gt; Versick &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/hmchh/reddit_my_long_time_friend_is_convinced_he_is_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hmchh/reddit_my_long_time_friend_is_convinced_he_is_a/"&gt;[1142 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Third Brazilian environmentalist killed in a week in Amazon Rainforest region</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hm804/third_brazilian_environmentalist_killed_in_a_week/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hm804/third_brazilian_environmentalist_killed_in_a_week/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2011 13:31:35 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/maxwellhill&quot;&gt; maxwellhill &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90852/7393665.html&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hm804/third_brazilian_environmentalist_killed_in_a_week/"&gt;[236 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>This show is disgusting.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hmik2/this_show_is_disgusting/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hmik2/this_show_is_disgusting/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2011 23:41:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hmik2/this_show_is_disgusting/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_hmik2.png&quot; alt=&quot;This show is disgusting.&quot; title=&quot;This show is disgusting.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Psychicthriller&quot;&gt; Psychicthriller &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/&quot;&gt; pics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/pyZ92.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hmik2/this_show_is_disgusting/"&gt;[174 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>This show is disgusting.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_hmik2.png" /></item><item><title>I'm looking for tips on passively annoying the two people I'm sitting between on my flight.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hmieo/im_looking_for_tips_on_passively_annoying_the_two/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hmieo/im_looking_for_tips_on_passively_annoying_the_two/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2011 23:31:55 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im currently 30 minutes into a 2.5 hour flight. Right before take off, and young mom on crutches and her 4 year old son, were the last 2 people onto a nearly full flight. The row infront of me had 2 empty seats. One directly in front of me(middle seat), and an isle seat on the opposite side. The flight attendents asked the ladies in front of me if they would shuffle around. They said theyre sisters, and under no circumstance would they move.. even though there's an empty seat between them. The flight attendents were all running around trying to figure something out. I decided to say to them that if they moved they could sit next to eachother, or across from eachother in the isle. The nastier one turned, and told me that thy both have &quot;flying issues&quot; and they need those specific seats, and for me to mind my business. Judging by their behavior thus far, if they do have flying issues, theyre well controlled. So this poor little 4 year old ends up sitting between these two wonderful women, on his first flight. The moms across the isle, holding back the tears, trying to calm him from accross the isle, and over the witch between them. During taxi and take off, i make a few snide comments to the lady next to me, loud enough for them to hear. Just after take off, i suggest to the lady next to me, if she moves to where mom is, and i sit between the 2 kind women in front of us, then mom and child can have our seats. She agees, we all switch, and now im sitting between 2 sisters that quite rude, and dont like me. What can i do to make their flight as akward as possible? The nastier one is working on a laptop, and the other reading a book. i've already been watching here every move on her laptop. Ive also spent some time mimicing her hand motions and movements. My breath is going downhill, but instead of the gum in my pocket, im trying to direct my hot breath towards them. I think ill order a coke, they give me gas. Im controlling both armrests.. what else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/smitsmat&quot;&gt; smitsmat &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt;
