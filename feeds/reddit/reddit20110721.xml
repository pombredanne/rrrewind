After fishing for around an hour, drifting out around two to three kilometers in near perfect overcast conditions we anchored on the inside of a reef one kilometer off the coast and about five hundred meters off a small uninhabited island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within about twenty minutes of fishing I felt the kayak sharply move to the left several meters and shrugged it off as tidal movement. Seconds later we felt a massive thud directly underneath us. My first hope in that horrifying moment was that it was a whale. However, I knew in my heart the only whale close by was near the horizon. Within the single attack from beneath it lifted us a foot, then as we went over it's head came out and took a massive chomp of the kayak right where my father was sitting. If his arm was protruding it would have been taken. I looked directly into it's eye as we went over and the beast's jaws had so much power we were thrown approximately a meter out and into the ocean. All I could think was that we would be chomped in half like the others taken from our waters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All my life I had been a 'fish', unafraid of the water, surfing, freediving, fishing and swimming I had only seen smaller sharks like ten feet long tiger sharks. But this was something else, a head over a meter in diameter and a dark eye of pure predation close enough to poke in that split second. Now we were swimming with death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both of us had wetsuits on but folded down at the waist with heavy coats on our top half and Dad had a life jacket on. This made it extremely difficult for me to scramble back onto my upside down kayak. However, I managed to get up quite fast but couldn't see my father or the shark anywhere. There was no blood, that was of some comfort so far, but still no Dad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, after the longest few seconds of my life, he surfaced completely terrified by the look on his face but still no blood (turns out he came face to face with it while coming up underneath the kayak)! I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and dragged him aboard the now sinking kayak. It had a hole from one tooth that found it's way through the tough plastic! I did not tell my father this as by that time he was screaming for help and waving to no avail. We were one kilometer off shore with a ten knot offshore wind, no one would hear. we were alone, wet, waiting and terrified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Battling panic I managed to regain a thread of calm somehow and decided to paddle with our hands towards the paddle that was drifting away from us fast. We spent about two minutes attempting that when I realized the anchor was still down! After deliberating to myself about if I should pull it or cut it I decided to pull it in case the wind started to blow us out to sea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ok, now we were free and drifting toward breaking waves with no paddle and a massive hungry shark somewhere close by. Dad kept yelling and waving despite me telling him to save his energy. So I told him to take off his life-jacket and wave that being the brightest thing we had. Very unsure but seeing the logic he reluctantly took it off and waved it in the air while still yelling for help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it I decided we had waisted our time to much already and we had to make a break for it. We hadn't seen the shark since the initial attack and I needed to feel dry ground. We both started to paddle with our hands to get to the island but we had a problem, panic had set in and my Dad was having a hard time keeping co-ordinated. I told him we needed to paddle the kayak backwards because being upside down meant the nose would dig into the water otherwise. His instant reaction was to paddle backwards but he was kneeling backwards so he ended up paddling forwards while I, lying forwards with my head between his knees, paddled backwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After about a minute of this and some circles we had it worked out, but there were other problems. The kayak was sinking fast. With an inch wide hole in the hull my little vessel was going down and so were we! Trying to keep the balance would tip us over due to the water in the hull washing around and over we went. Back in with that beast over and over several times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About to suggest we strip off our coats, pull over our wetsuits and2;make a swim for the last three hundred meters to the island I looked up and saw a small dinghy thirty meters off coming for us. The driver stopped ten meters away and asked if we were ok. &amp;quot;Shark! Hurry!&quot; I yelled as he pondered our predicament. As soon as he was close enough I grabbed the side a tried to pull myself in. I couldn't, it was to much after everything. Jumping into the water I swam around the back and tried that but still needed help, I was exhausted. My father yelling &quot;NO&quot; to me the whole time about me swimming was still clutching the kayak and wouldn't dream of going in there. The fisherman grabbed one arm and one leg then tried to flip him over onto the boat. He was having a hard2;time so I stepped over and tried to help, almost capsizing the dinghy with my effort! &quot;Get to the other side he yelled as I took Dad's arm and got to the other side with it dragging him over and into safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turned out that a woman on the beach looking for her fisherman husband with binoculars saw us waving. Then, after Dad waved his life jacket around she knew we were in trouble. So using the binoculars she started looking for someone to help. There was a man on the next beach who just packed up his boat and was helping some young guys get out of the bog so she jumped in her car and drove up around the hill toward the next beach intercepting him at a cross road on his way home. He ended up being a friend of hers and she managed to talk him into re-launching his boat and driving out to save us!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Wording and structure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gee guys why all the downvotes? I'm just sharing my experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry people it is time for work.
