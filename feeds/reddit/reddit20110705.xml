She was found hung from her bed. She's almost 6 feet tall, just turned 21 and was the most positive person you'd ever meet in your whole life. She spoke all the time about loving life. Here's how the story goes, as best as I can recall it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The night of her death, her (Sky) boyfriend Abdu Solam (sp?) calls Sky's best friend and says he can't get ahold of Sky. When Abdu finally gets into the apartment he finds Sky hanging from a taikwando belt from their bed. He calls 911 and in the conversation says he's been gone for 5 hours (repeats this many times) and asks if he can cut her down. They ask if the body is warm, he says yes and reiterates he was gone for 5 hours. They say to cut her down, but instead he begins knocking on neighbors' doors yelling for them to call 911. The operator even asks him why he's doing that and to give Sky CPR. Abdu asks the operator to walk him through it, even though he already knows CPR and told me before that he's performed it. Her cell phone goes missing and service was cut off that very night. Sky spoke to her mother hours before the incident. In the crime scene photos you can see her phone twice, in two different locations. When it is returned to police 3 days later the contacts and messages have all been deleted. When they went to question Abdu two days later and found him in a club with his new girlfriend. Police ruled suicide and left it. There's no internal damage to her throat and there's strange bruising on other parts of her body. He has not spoken to any of Sky's friends or family and has not offered any additional information. The medical examiner says there's no way that she could've tied the knot herself that was used to hang her, even if you ignore the fact that the taikwando belt isn't consistent with the bruising around her neck. Perhaps she was suffocated and then set up with the belt around her neck at a later time. It's inconsistent. Police refused to open the case or respond to calls. The first time they get ahold of police, the captain tells Sky's father on the phone that even if Abdu admitted to murder that very day they wouldn't press charges. There's much more to this, but it's not all necessary to get my point across. Most of this is NOT in her investigation file. The police refused to re-exam the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I need is advice on how to get a criminal attorney and investigator willing to pursue this incident. Sky was fun-loving and super spirited. I live in Alaska so I can't just go into attorneys' offices and give them a picture with a name and another bleeding heart tale. Who should I talk to? Her family has been trying to get things rolling, but they don't know how to either. Alaska is very secluded from the lower 48, practically another country. I'd also like to look into funding for the family because they had to pay 1,500 USD just for a video surveillance tape that shows Abdu at a club at times when he said he wasn't there. Evidence is expensive, reports are expensive, the emotional toll on her family is expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please upvote so we can get enough attention for good advice, hopefully some attorneys or legal representatives will have some good ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*In addition: The police allowed the scene to be tampered with tremendously. The sheets were removed from her bed and cleaned. The next day Abdu allowed friends to come and take things from the apartment, such as clothes, collectibles, jewelry, etc.. Some of them returned things after they found out what happened, some didn't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://juneauempire.com/local/2011-04-09/juneau-high-school-graduates-death-seattle-under-investigation&quot; &gt;VERIFICATION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL:DR Friend was murdered, medical examiner ruled out suicide, police closed case as suicide and won't re-open case. Officials refuse to help. How can I get a criminal investigation started? Family has no funds for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Added tl;dr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Removed first line to remove negative attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 3: *In addition, above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 4: Verification&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 5: Due to verification, removed Mr. Miss names.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 6: Is it possible for a mod to remove all karma gained from this post?
