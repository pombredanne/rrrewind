I just start collecting a paycheck at the end of the month. I just moved into an apartment last weekend. In fact I still have everyone's money untouched. I've said repeatedly it's not a scam and I'm not a scammer. I doubt a scammer would have met more than 25 redditors IRL in two different countries. I'm not going to respond to any questions in this thread because I am sure it's all been said already. Please understand this is still happening. Thanks and I appreciate the concern, fellas. And thanks to ImKumarYo for calling me and telling me about this thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also sent me a private message. He was very polite but told me that the reason he didn't reply to me was because he was busy IRL. That's cool that he's busy and I understand that he just moved or whatever but he's been posting regularly on Reddit and he managed to have the time to make several comments to some things I said on a thread over in /r/Japan. Clearly whatever was keeping him busy IRL wasn't so important that he had to stop talking about how to pick up Japanese girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that he got my messages so that says to me that he ignored me for whatever reason. I hope this is a lesson that when you take people's money they will remember and they'll want to know what happened. What TofuTofu should have done is as soon as he realized he wasn't going to reach his goal is make another post explaining the situation and his intentions. I mean does he still want to pay for Rob to come to Japan even though TofuTofu is no longer here? What's he doing? Just take two seconds to submit a post updating the people who were good enough to get behind you on your venture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also asked me to delete this thread as he doesn't want a witch hunt to take place. I don't think that's what's going on and if it hasn't happened yet I don't think it will. Most people are most likely going to forget about this by tomorrow anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for showing up to the witch hunt. Hopefully TofuTofu and Rob will get together and make a donation. Please leave your unused pitchforks at the collection box by the exit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3&lt;/strong&gt; Going at the top so people see it. I've seen a few people comment saying to go after TofuTofu and spam him demanding answers and such. I think that's a bit extreme. For now I think this has gotten enough attention that he'll probably see it and say something. No need to fuck with the guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 4&lt;/strong&gt; Going to sleep (I'm still in Japan and it's way fuckin late here). It'll be interesting to see what's become of this in the morning. Thanks to a lot of you, there are some hilarious comments here that have been a lot fun reading. To the people who think I'm an idiot, I can see that, I see where y'all're coming from. To Rob of C&amp;amp;H, thanks for being a mensch and updating us with your end of things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 5&lt;/strong&gt; User Shut_Up_Asshole posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hbyjm/i_am_dave_one_of_the_creators_of_cyanide/c1u988x?context=3&quot; &gt;this response from TofuTofu&lt;/a&gt; about 2 months ago addressing the situation. OK, now I really am going to bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months ago another redditor started trying to collect money to bring the creators of Cyanide and Happiness to Japan to deliver a plush doll. After lots of discussion this got changed to raising money to bring the C&amp;amp;H guys to Japan to then donate about $2,000 to charity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I donated a small amount to this cause because I thought it sounded fun and because I thought maybe it's make a good story. I sent the OP an email asking him to keep me up to date with what happens because I'm in Japan and would like to be there to see this all unfold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months and I never heard anything. That's fine I thought, they probably didn't have time to respond to everyone who wrote them a message. But I wanted to know what happened so I started looking for anything about C&amp;amp;H and Japan and I found nothing. I checked the OP's submission history and all I could find was a final post pushing for donations in April and then a few weeks later a bunch of posts about going away parties for him as he was apparently moving back to the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, I posted on /r/reddit.com about all of this and someone suggested I contact this guy directly so I did that. I sent him two emails over the course of a week and never heard back. I checked out his profile and saw that he was still being rather active. I even commented on a comment of his and he replied to that so the only thing I can figure is he is ignoring my messages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, this may seem like a lot of fuss over something that really isn't all that important. But in his last post he said that he'd raised almost $1,200. Now either that was a lie to get more people to donate, or this guy's got roughly $1,200 of various redditors' money. OR I suppose a 3rd option is he refunded most of that money and just didn't get to me. Or possibly the C&amp;amp;H guys did come out here and just never posted anything about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As far as I'm concerned, I don't care about the money. I just don't like being ignored when I have a legitimate question and it's just the principle of the whole thing. There's principalities in this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Reddit. What's my next move?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; OK well since tryingulate already said the guy's username (TofuTofu), here's some links for the whole story so you don't have to go digging for more info:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/gu6bj/til_cyanide_and_happiness_offer_personal_deliver/c1qbpme&quot; &gt;Original thread that started it all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gua7r/cyanide_happiness_offer_worldwide_personal/&quot; &gt;TofuTofu's first thread about getting C&amp;amp;H to come to Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gut06/reddit_weve_done_it_again_thanks_to_you_and/&quot; &gt;When it changed from fun prank to charity cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ih1xz/so_whatever_happened_to_the_guys_from_cyanide/&quot; &gt;My initial post asking about what happened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; TofuTofu and some other redditors solicited donations to bring C&amp;amp;H guys to Japan as a prank. Turned into a charity. People donated money and then nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit 2&lt;/strong&gt; Just to be clear I do not care what happened to my portion of the money. I was really just curious what happened and I politely asked TofuTofu about it. He could have lied to me and said that they just ended up donating the money and that would have been the end of it. But he didn't, he ignored me and so I came here to bring it up and see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If he ran off with the money, fine, I really don't have any problems with that. Other people might, and I hope that if someone else gave him money and wants it back that they might see this and be able to do something about it, but that's not where I'm coming from. I just wanted to know 1) If anyone else sent him money and 2) What happened (was it just too much trouble, was it all really a scam, did he forget?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/pawnzz&quot;&gt; pawnzz &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/iqho3/whats_my_next_move_should_i_just_drop_this/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iqho3/whats_my_next_move_should_i_just_drop_this/"&gt;[681 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Post !
