I just went over to pick her up at the designated time. I talked to her mom for a while since she was still getting ready, her mom had to go help her after a few minutes, I may have waited 20 mins altogether before she was ready. She was a bit shy, but that was only around her mom, understandably. Her mom was a bit embarrassing too, she was like &quot;don't get him too drunk, he needs to get you home by 3.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told her we should go to a live music bar and have a few drinks and see where we go from there. She agreed, I went home to park my roommates car that I borrowed, and then poured a few drinks for both of us while we talked. She was a bit nervous, laughing at every awful joke I was making. We walked downtown which was 20 mins from my house, was a good walk getting to know each other more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There surprisingly isn't anything out of the ordinary versus any other date I've been on. She's pretty much a regular girl, she does have some vision, but of course it's very limited. She walked by herself fine for most of the time, occasionally having to swat around to just make sure of the location I was in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She didn't really do anything out of the ordinary, except maybe holding onto her drinks the whole time. It was fun but kind of loud and I did want to talk to her more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personality wise she's like a lot of 19 year old girls, except she doesn't get out as often as she wants and from what I can tell she's a bit depressed about it. Her closer friends went off to universities hours away. She's taking distance courses from some other university, and is trying to just get good grades so maybe she can get a scholarship and go to some school with good sight impaired support. She dated some guys in high school for a while, but this is was her first time in a while going on a date. She said it was awkward, but her mom has been going on for a while about how great of a person I am, and how hot I am, so she finally caved in and gave her support to ask me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn't really ask her any questions about being blind, because it really never came up in my mind, to me she was just a normal person, and it was great because I'm usually a bit awkward with eye contact but she couldn't tell. It was good too because I was completely staring at her body a few times and she couldn't tell. I'm still curious as to how she does her schoolwork, but I'll ask that some other time, and I'm guessing the answer is very mundane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only bad thing that happened was when I asked her to dance at the bar, and she got embarrassed and said that she couldn't. Then she looked sad and tried to apologize for a while about it. I was like it's no big deal, I wouldn't want you to see what an awful dancer I am either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that we walked around for a while, it was a nice breezy night, and we were pretty buzzed. We had something to eat, walked around some more, I was holding her hands at that point. It was still only like 12:30 and the night still felt young, so I had nothing to do. I asked her if she just wanted to hang out casually back at my place and meet my roommates or whatever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was up for it, we went back no one was home, we just sat in my room listening to music. She started dancing lol, it was funny, because she really couldn't dance well. I started dancing with her too, it was cute. We then just sat on the bed for a while just talking, and we were really close. I then asked her if I could kiss her, she was a bit shy but she said yeah. Then we kissed for a while, I tried to keep the groping to a minimum (did I mention she has a great ass). After a few minutes she just stopped wanting to kiss and just kept hugging me, groping my shirtless body. Then after like a half hour of that, almost passing out, we just sober up, and I decided it was time to take her home. She tripped on my backpack though (I really should have cleaned my room) and got a decent sized cut on her shin from the edge of my bed. I felt absolutely awful about that because I wasn't even thinking, all I was bothered with was about how big of a boner I had and how I was going to release it. Well we got it all cleaned up, got her a band aid. Took her home, opened the door for her and stuff, gave her my email address and phone number, then gave her a hug good night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've emailed her a few times back and forth throughout the week, but I was busy with school, and she couldn't hang out this weekend because her dad was back in town. She said she wants to do something during the week though. I'll see where this goes, but I don't want to really think about it until we spend more time together. I would like to spend more time to get to know her, but I feel like there's a bigger gap in maturity between 19 and 22 than I remember, and that she's just in a point in her life where a relationship probably won't be the best thing. I do hint a lot of insecurity, but I don't want to do any more speculative guess work without knowing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'll happily answer anything you guys have to ask me about this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR - pretty much the most normal date ever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/fakeblackguy&quot;&gt; fakeblackguy &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/ea9r5/update_on_the_blind_date_with_blind_girl/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ea9r5/update_on_the_blind_date_with_blind_girl/"&gt;[302 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TSA asking Americans not to boycott body scans because it would cause delays.

Reddit loves weed, but reddit hates bad drivers. Reddit hates cops but loves donating to those are in need of help. So I'm just wondering, how many of you do/like/hate something that Reddit, as a community, would usually love/hate/make fun of you for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, sometimes I'm pretty damn irresponsible on the road. I'm not a BAD driver(i can parallel park blindfolded) nor do I do stupid shit that could get people killed obviously but I do constantly speed(like 70-75 on a 60) and I have VERY little patience sometimes cutting people off who are doing a 45 in 60 lane and I use my horn like a gatling gun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about you guys? Hate weed? Find irresponsible cops hilarious? Don't give a shit about the new TSA rules? Not care about people who're in need?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downvote away if you want, I knew what I was getting myself into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/WarTamil&quot;&gt; WarTamil &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/ea477/lets_be_honest_reddit_how_many_of_you_are/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ea477/lets_be_honest_reddit_how_many_of_you_are/"&gt;[1079 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
