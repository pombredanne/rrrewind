&lt;p&gt;I was too drunk to handle at a party last night, and passed out in my boyfriend&#39;s bed. I woke up, and one of the guys at the party was inside of me. I don&#39;t remember what happened next, so I might have passed out again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This morning, I realized how sore I am, and that he probably tore the shit out of my vagina. I didn&#39;t tell any of my friends or my boyfriend what happened, because I feel so humiliated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were all sitting around this morning, and the guy laughed about him asking me if he could lie next to me last night, and me saying no and telling him to go away. So, I&#39;m positive that even in my sloshed state, I didn&#39;t give him an ounce of consent if I was able to. He played it off in front of our friends as if he was just the nice guy that was taking care of me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in a position to completely fuck someone&#39;s life right now, and for some reason, I feel wrong about reporting this. I went to urgent care an hour ago and got some medical advice from a nurse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say if I want to be checked (as in a rape kit), that the police will have to be involved. Their dilemma is that they could pull my boyfriend&#39;s DNA from me. If I say I don&#39;t know who did it, but want to be checked just for &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, the police won&#39;t be involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the best course of action here? I feel like he&#39;s an incredibly stupid and creepy guy, and he deserves what comes to him, but I also feel wrong about fucking someone&#39;s life like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I wasn&#39;t expecting so much feedback so quickly. Thanks, guys. I will report it, I&#39;m just super nervous about this. Also, if they pull my boyfriend&#39;s DNA instead of his, couldn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of me getting police involved? Wouldn&#39;t it then just turn into my word against his?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final edit: I&#39;m about to go to the hospital to have a rape kit used on me. Thank you everyone for offering support and advice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/crumpleandthrowaway&#34;&gt; crumpleandthrowaway &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&#34;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k4pbm/i_was_taken_advantage_of_last_night_what_do_i_do/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k4pbm/i_was_taken_advantage_of_last_night_what_do_i_do/"&gt;[1888 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Texas!

Thought about doing this IAmI for awhile and the timing seemed right. Here is an imgur link to the photos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are in our forties, were friends for years before we started dating (we were neighbors in a downtown loft apartment), and both of our families were thrilled with the whole situation. Here is a little background: I am originally from Michigan and came to the south on an athletic scholarship (hockey at University of Alabama in Huntsville) Yes it sounds crazy, but at one time very solid Div 1 program. My time and hockey career in Alabama was hell but I made some of my closest friends there. Some of the crazy racist shit that happened there? On my recruiting trip, I was at a keg party with current players and a bunch of students off campus watching a college football game. Opening kick off a guy runs one back...All at once, a guy in front of me yells &#34;get that Nigger!!!!!&#34; The room went SILENT and everyone turned and looked at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wife (then girlfriend) and I were jet skiing on a remote lake and a boat FULL of klansman (tattoos, rebel flag, one had an atrophied arm, etc...could not get more stereotypical) pulled up next to us and harassed us. Had a person walk up to us in the mall, grab me and say &#34;get your nigger hands off her&#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could go on and on with that stuff, but you get the idea. Because I was an athlete, most of my friends and teammates did my talking for me (nobody wanted to fight hockey players) which was cool, but there were times when I had to throw but it was rare, and I was always without my friends. Both of our dads were Docs (both passed away) and we had a lot in common. For her she never really thought of me as black, just someone she loved as a close friend. I knew I was going to marry her when while were driving in Florida and war pigs came on the radio; we both sang it word for word as it roared from my speakers. That was it for me! (put it on her &#34;pregnant CD&#34; and listened to that song on the way to hospital. Anyway, we have a beautiful little boy and live in a fantastic city (Nashville) where we don&#39;t have to deal with too much shit for the most part. Surrounding areas are completely different. As I said earlier, our 10 year anniversary is this month, and we could not be any more thrilled to be married..Who cares about skin color. I am chilling with my son as he plays mathblaster on his computer and wife is watching HDTV. I have carved out today to basically do squat so I have time to answer any questions you have. Nothing is off limits so have at it. As far as the pics go, they are for another project but seemed relevant...There area a LOT of them. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit:Thanks for all the compliments! Gonna make a drink and eat and check on fam. Be back in a few.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Had to hide the images, being BLOWN up from friends who had no idea I was a reddtor! Going to post link to a couple so you know it is legit, but not so much personal shit. Sorry, you guys have been too awesome!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit.
