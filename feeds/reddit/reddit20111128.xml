I can&amp;#39;t speak on the adoption process itself because it changes so frequently, and it&amp;#39;s already been 15 years for us. What I can speak of is our experience in raising 2 girls who were already almost 5 and 6 when we adopted them (they are biological siblings). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experience people have actually raising these children doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be addressed anywhere, so that&amp;#39;s why I decided to make myself available for people who want some frame of reference. You reach such a point of desperation during the infertility and adoption process that you truly believe that love can fix everything, and what I learned was how naive a notion that is. But there&amp;#39;s a sense of ungratefulness you feel when you&amp;#39;ve finally realized your dream of becoming a parent, and then things don&amp;#39;t work out happily ever. It&amp;#39;s my belief that that&amp;#39;s why this issue seems to be rarely discussed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have dealt with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Fetal Alcohol Effects, Reactive Attachment Disorder, arrests, drugs, failing out of school, lying, sneaking around, destruction of property -- go ahead and name it....we&amp;#39;ve been there. We&amp;#39;re both college educated, own a business and although we&amp;#39;re far from rich, we have both the resources and support of our families to have provided these girls with every opportunity, but instead most of it was spent on counseling, all sorts of programs, specialists, and a whole shopping list of other things, none of which ultimately made much of a dent. I look at two things very differently now: 1) nature versus nurture and 2) Freud&amp;#39;s assertion that personality is fully developed by age 5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My intention isn&amp;#39;t to discourage anyone from adopting -- it&amp;#39;s to provide maybe some perspective and resources that I wish there had been more of when I first set out so maybe I could have been more proactive than reactive. The question with ALL kids always is &amp;quot;if you had it to do over, would you?&amp;quot; And my answer after 15 years is a very weak and weary &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Wow. Wasn&amp;#39;t expecting so many responses so quickly. I&amp;#39;ll try to elaborate on the most salient points (which, as it turns out, weren&amp;#39;t the MOST salient so now they&amp;#39;re way down at the bottom): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SECOND EDIT: Double wow. I&amp;#39;ve been at this for hours now. I really wasn&amp;#39;t expecting this kind of reaction. But clearly there are lots of misconceptions so let me be more clear:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a woman (why do so many assume I&amp;#39;m the father?). My relationship with my husband was very strong before we decided on adoption, and although there have been some very bumpy roads, we&amp;#39;ve stuck it out mostly because we shared all the same core beliefs and values to start with, not just as relates to parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m NOT bashing Russia. I only mentioned Russia because so many asked, and Russian people happen to be wonderfully warm and hospitable so I&amp;#39;m not Russia-bashing. But Eastern Europe had opened for adoption, I was already close to 40 years old, I TRULY didn&amp;#39;t think adopting older kids or two kids at a time would be an issue (I mean, you&amp;#39;re parents...they&amp;#39;re kids...all you have to do is love them, right? tell me you ALL didn&amp;#39;t believe that before you became parents). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I love them. Of course I do! I see all their good too, you know. But the bad was SO persistent and unrelenting and soul sucking and eventually the bad just overtook ALL the good to the point where I had nothing left to give that I hadn&amp;#39;t already tried, and wasn&amp;#39;t going to make any difference anyway. My door is still open to them every time they call or text me (and for my older one, that&amp;#39;s few and far between but it happens) and yes, I support them emotionally but I no longer support them financially. I love them, I even mostly like them (or a lot about them) but I just don&amp;#39;t have any respect for either of them, and that&amp;#39;s what I wish I had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never expected or even wanted my kids to be perfect (whatever that might mean). But I &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; expect for them to have at least a minimal amount of respect for our home, our values, US.... Instead, from Day One, all we ever got was lying, sneaking around, broken promises (truth be told, they never once actually kept a single promise they made), they literally never followed one single rule, they compromised our safety and were physically abusive of us and destructive of our home, which we have busted our asses to provide for them. I didn&amp;#39;t just throw them out -- I gave them years and years of second chances, professional help (you HAVE to know when it&amp;#39;s time to admit you can&amp;#39;t do it yourself) and ALWAYS did what I said I was going to do, so it&amp;#39;s not like I &amp;quot;threatened&amp;quot; (which is merely hot air if you don&amp;#39;t actually back it up). Had they been &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; kids and just a pain in the ass but at least somewhat respectful and making decent grades in school and doing at least what is expected of a teenager, it would have been a completely different scenario at age 18, and now as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe we achieved &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; as parents simply because my girls -- while definitely having been involved in drugs, shoplifting, stealing cars, etc. -- never went so far as to make it a way of life at least. Although they tend to up and quit as soon as jobs get to be too boring or too stressful or whatever (both have only worked in foodservice), both have at least held jobs since they were old enough to do so, so to my knowledge and last I heard from her (3 months ago) my older daughter was gainfully employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Eastern Europe (in our case, Russia)? Because 15 years ago international adoption was still in its infancy and the rules there made it far less traumatic than it was in the US (there were far too many states that allowed the birthmother to change her mind within 1-6 months), and you could complete an adoption within a year (which ours took, almost to the day). We felt that we had all the resources available to us to help &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; children, but we knew our limitations if the child needed more than we could provide. Once our girls became available, we even visited them beforehand to make sure we could provide for their particular needs. Looking back, there were some issues (highly manic behavior in our younger daughter, and extremely narcissistic behavior in our older one) but we felt that love could fix everything. As I said -- very naive of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do they consider us their parents? Well, this goes back and forth a lot. I think that on an intellectual level they know that we took them out of a bad situation (both parents were alcoholics -- but only the mother&amp;#39;s alcoholism plays a factor in Fetal Alcohol issues -- and the father was a violent drunk who used to beat both his wife and the children. My girls are the youngest of 6 -- their 2 older ones were already being raised by the maternal grandmother, and the ones above them I don&amp;#39;t know about, so presumably they were no longer minors. My girls were removed by the police when they were 3 and 4 and sent to an orphanage). Needless to say, however, when it suits them they bring out the &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re not really our parents&amp;quot; card, but I&amp;#39;d say for the most part they consider us their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we love them? Yes, of course we do, but I am the first to admit that it took me A LONG TIME to bond with the two of them because they weren&amp;#39;t cuddly, adorable helpless little infants but rather loud, destructive and disrespectful youngsters. But over time I could see their good points -- of which there are many -- but the biggest problem with both of them has basically been their Attachment Disorder. This is something I read about before we adopted but too little was written about it. It stems from children not being able to trust (or attach to) their primary caregivers, who have repeatedly let them down (this happens a lot in the foster system and with divorce as well) and instead they attach to transient relationships -- practically to strangers. Later it tends to manifest itself by the child having seeming NO conscience in his&amp;#47;her actions (ie, not thinking for even one second how it might affect others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are they now? When my younger daughter turned 17 we sent her to a one year program at a tiny private boarding school (read: behavioral facility) that provided the 24 hour a day supervision she needed. Because of the structure and constant supervision she was able to get there (something that our local public schools COMPLETELY failed at) she was able to finally accomplish things she never had before (like passing her classes) because there were none of the distractions of drugs, juvenile delinquent friends, etc. that she had here. It was the right thing at the right time and changed SOME things, but not all of them. The one thing it did change -- eventually -- was her attitude toward us. Although we can&amp;#39;t live with her (she completely lacks Executive functioning, which means she can&amp;#39;t foresee what the consequences of her actions will be despite repeating them over and over and won&amp;#39;t listen to any advice we give her to help her in that area), but we still keep in touch daily by phone or text. From Day One, my older daughter flat out refused to follow any of our rules and by middle school had so frequently snuck out in the middle of the night, or snuck boys into her room when I&amp;#39;d be out walking the dog or whatever, that we finally had to install a security system in our house. Nothing ever fazed her, and she couldn&amp;#39;t have cared less how her behaviors affected the family. when she turned 18 and continued to refuse to follow any rules, we told her she had to leave. A year later she begged to come back, we told her once again that if she didn&amp;#39;t follow our rules she&amp;#39;d have to leave and within 2 months, we had to again tell her to go. She blames all this on me so no, we don&amp;#39;t speak. I&amp;#39;d love to have a relationship with her, but in her mind it&amp;#39;s everyone else&amp;#39;s fault which isn&amp;#39;t entirely true in this case, so that makes it difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would I have done differently? Unfortunately, the resources just weren&amp;#39;t there back then. None of the Eastern European adopted kids had really become of age, so you didn&amp;#39;t have anyone to ask about all the issues with teenagers and young adults. What I would definitely tell a newly adoptive parent though, is BE PROACTIVE. Find a QUALIFIED therapist now who can deal with the most serious of the issues -- PTSD and RAD. Don&amp;#39;t wait until they become teenagers to see if they &amp;quot;grow out of it.&amp;quot; Chances are very good that they won&amp;#39;t, and yet something will be haunting them that they can neither express, describe or overcome on their own. Unfortunately, the wonderful therapist I found came maybe 2 or 3 years too late when my girls were already well into their teens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/always-right&#34;&gt; always-right &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&#34;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ms55u/15_years_ago_we_adopted_2_girls_from_eastern/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ms55u/15_years_ago_we_adopted_2_girls_from_eastern/"&gt;[2709 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Record numbers of young Japanese do not have boyfriends or girlfriends, and many do not want one.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ms0g8/record_numbers_of_young_japanese_do_not_have/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ms0g8/record_numbers_of_young_japanese_do_not_have/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2011 14:35:38 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/neoronin&#34;&gt; neoronin &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&#34;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15915118&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ms0g8/record_numbers_of_young_japanese_do_not_have/"&gt;[2459 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Turns out college students really aren't using QR codes.
