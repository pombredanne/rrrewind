The PS3 comes with 8 cells and the Sony warranty only covers two, so if any of the other six malfunction is going to cost you a lot of money to repair your console but with the extended warranty from Best Buy you get full coverage and after a year we will perform a tune up to make your system run like it's new.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;- WTF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clueless Buyer: &quot;Ok&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cashier: &quot;Are you going to connect your console to the internet?&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clueless Buyer: &quot;Actually I'm buying this as a christmas present so I don't really know.&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cashier: &quot;That's ok, because if you buy the in-home gaming setup for just $100 (more or less) you can call us any day you want and we will go to your house to set your internet account, update the console, etc...&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;At that point I decided to intervene and asked the clueless buyer for who was the gift and it turn out to be for his fifteen year old son, I told him that probably his son already knew how to do everything Best Buy was trying to scam him into and if not he could with me a call to guide him through it step by step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saved the gentleman a couple hundred dollars and then received the silent treatment from the cashier when he was attending me.

But now that you are here, the meat:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/enwp5/girlfriend_wants_to_do_burlesque_and_i_feel/c19jcl6&quot; &gt;This little thread&lt;/a&gt; has me seething at the moment. It's from &lt;strong&gt;Relationship Advice&lt;/strong&gt; where a guy is uncomfortable with his girlfriend performing burlesque. Some of the reactions to this poor chap are outrageous. Accusing him of being a prude and telling him to stuff his feelings in a box and throw them away? Come on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a relationship, I don't consider my girlfriend my property or believe I have some sanctimonious right to tell her what to do. However, I do believe that a relationship is exclusive because both partners mutually choose to hold something for each other alone. What that specifically entails is for the couple themselves to decide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some couples allow each other to sleep around. Some aren't even ok with flirting with other people. How does expecting either of those make someone a bad person? It's just about finding someone like minded and not cheating on the covenant you enter. If you can't live up to the covenant, you always have the option to leave and find someone more in line with your tastes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm sick of people on Reddit saying stuff that goes: &quot;Jeez man, you are so insecure! Be proud she gets other guy's attention&quot; or &quot;Why don't you lock her up at home then you evil bastard?&quot; I date women &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; think are attractive. I don't give two shits about what other people think about my girl, positive or negative. I'm comfortable with a lot but I hold my SO to same standards I hold myself and I'm upfront about what those are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not ok with my girlfriend flirting with other guys. I don't think women who do this are evil/skanky/bored/whatever. It's just that I think flirting is something I'd like to reserve for the special woman in my life and I'd like her to do the same. It's just one more way for her to know that she's got something that nobody in the world will get. Does that make me old-timey and sentimental? Sure if you want to call it that. Does that make me a bad person? I don't think so. I'm clear about my needs in a relationship and appreciate women who are the same way. I've dated women who weren't comfortable with holding back the flirting. I'm comfortable enough not to fault them for that and actually appreciate the fact that they were upfront with their own choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what I'm saying is: I can't apply my standards to the rest of you and I don't expect to. What I can do is tell poor chaps like the OP in the R_A thread that he isn't some unreasonable asshole. On the same token, don't be dicks and throw around sanctimonious negative judgements onto your fellow Redditors. (Now obviously I will see more than a few trolls doing just that in this thread.) It's unfair and kind of irritating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening. Good night and good luck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Relationships are about two people who lay down a set of mutual expectations. Don't be sanctimonious about people who have different expectations than yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just to be clear I'd rather not talk about the specific R_A burlesque issue in this thread. If you have opinions on that, please go over to that thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/niton&quot;&gt; niton &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/&quot;&gt; reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/eo1zc/listen_up_im_not_an_evil_misogynist_for_asking_my/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/eo1zc/listen_up_im_not_an_evil_misogynist_for_asking_my/"&gt;[236 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Minecraft developer streaming live while coding</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eo29l/minecraft_developer_streaming_live_while_coding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eo29l/minecraft_developer_streaming_live_while_coding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2010 22:05:11 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/robertpohl&quot;&gt; robertpohl &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/&quot;&gt; programming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mojang.com/live/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eo29l/minecraft_developer_streaming_live_while_coding/"&gt;[138 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Doctoral degrees not worth it</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/enz1y/doctoral_degrees_not_worth_it/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/enz1y/doctoral_degrees_not_worth_it/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2010 17:45:13 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/in_question&quot;&gt; in_question &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/&quot;&gt; science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/17723223?story_id=17723223&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/enz1y/doctoral_degrees_not_worth_it/"&gt;[761 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Does Reddit begin to feel like one major circlejerk after a while?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eny0q/does_reddit_begin_to_feel_like_one_major/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eny0q/does_reddit_begin_to_feel_like_one_major/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2010 16:22:12 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems like 99% of people share the same opinion. Every once in a while a troll comes around and changes up the monotony. Reddit is still great for delivering interesting stories, but not as much for debate it seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: I'm gonna look for websites where the userbase shares opinions that are totally contrary to mine (and reddit). Maybe some good, real, debate can be had there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit 2: I once told a girl I was seeing: &quot;baby, you're becoming predictable.&quot; This sums up my thoughts about reddit. Maybe I'm just the type of person who needs constant change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a visual representation: Reddit discussion used to seem like this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/ocqcB.jpg&quot; &gt;http://imgur.com/ocqcB.jpg&lt;/a&gt; ; now many redditors come off like this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/kt8zq.jpg.&quot; &gt;http://imgur.com/kt8zq.jpg.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Possible solution: Many seem to say that the problem is that unpopular yet legitimate opinions get downvoted and buried. Maybe the opinions with the most upvotes and those with the most downvotes should go to the top (kind of like a parabola graph). This would mean that there also needs to be an &quot;irrelevant&quot; marker to mark as irrelevant comments by trolls, and people who insult others, so those will get buried. This would allow legitimitate opinions from both sides of the coin to be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the people saying they see this post every week: I realize this, but I'm not trying to complain. I think there is a way to improve this (see above). It seems like people discover reddit, become infatuated, and then get somewhat bored of it because of the circlejerkiness. Reddit is fed by constant newcomers. At a certain point, reddit will reach equilibrium and no new users are going to come. Once that happens, readership will decline, as well as quality. I think the admins should take this into consideration if they want this site to last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cynics are saying nothing will change, and they are probably right.
