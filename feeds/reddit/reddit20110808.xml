Frankly the fact that she is now accusing me of this makes me more skeptical about her claims against her father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like all cases of repressed memory, she started seeing a therapist a few months ago. She wanted to work through some feelings of anger that she had toward her parents that she couldnt reconcile. When she started talking, first about how her childhood was 'abusive' in general I cautioned her about how some therapists may interject or suggest things that may or may not be true. She claimed that was impossible with this therapist because she just listens and doesnt suggest things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several months later she tells me that alot of her personality and frustration and depression all fit the 'profile' or someone who was sexually abused. She has been talking to her sister alot and they both believe that they suffered abuse, mainly because they looked-up some list of 'symptoms' of abuse rather than direct memory of such events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the process of all this she has cut off visitation with her mother and father completely. She will not visit nor let them visit. She has blocked their email so they cannot communicate with her. And she has taken each of our kids and sat them down and explained that her childhood was abusive and without stating to them directly that she was sexually abused, she has told each of them that they sould tell her about anything that makes them uncomfortable either from violence or sexual abuse in nature - &quot;whether it is you dad or anyone else.&quot; She told me this is what she did, and I had no objection to it - we have often counseled them to always come and talk to us if someone makes them feel uncomfortable or touches them. I was not opposed to the &quot;whether its your dad or anyone else&quot; line because i thought it was just to illustrate that there is no authority figure that would be exempt from this reporting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So then last night she tells me that she thinks i could have sexually abuse my daughters and she uses the following evidence:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, our youngest (3 years old) frequently has her hands down her pants masturbating. if she is watching TV or sitting on the sofa, up goes the leg and she starts at it. We have been trying to get her to stop and have employed a system where she wears a sock on her hand that prevents it from happening, but my wife claims that this is evidence that she is likely to have experienced abuse. ( I am a physician by training and am familiar with the general experience of childhood development and i know that masturbation is not uncommon at this age and that she will grow out of it. I dont believe that there is a 100% causation link between sexual abuse and masturbation).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second example she makes of my likely sexual abuse is the fact that when my girls are toddlers I declare them to be my &quot;snuggle-bugs&quot; and enjoy snuggling with them if they jump into bed with me. This involves me hugging them while they are laying down next to me and eye level. I can only speak to my own motivations and experience and I know that this is not a sexual embrace, i dont derive or seek any sexual gratification from this embrace - I just really love my little girls and when they are sooo tiny and cute and loving i just have to snuggle them. It is just a way of showing paternal affection through an embrace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have already stated that it is not a sexual interaction for me. My daughters have never stated to myself or to my wife that this makes them feel uncomfortable and my older daughters have lamented that they are too big to be my snuggle-bug anymore, and when toddlers, my daughters love stating that they are daddy's snuggle-bug. Keep in mind that this is only something that comes up if they are jumping into bed with me and my wife (usually because they are afraid of the dark or just want to sleep in their parents room instead of their own room)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My wife now claims that this whole &quot;snuggle-bug&quot; interaction makes her feel very uncomfortable and that no other decent father would consider that to be appropriate interaction with their daughter. She further claims that since I dont seem to have a problem with it, then she cant trust me and I in all likelihood have abuse our daughters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So first there is the whole repressed sexual abuse from her childhood issue which i supported her on, but now that she is looking to find how I have abuse her daughters. I feel like she is assuming that she probably married someone just like her father (cause that is what psychiatrists and psychologists say that abused women do) and so she is finding ways to fit me into the mold that she is casting for her father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you guys think that the snuggle-bug is abusive? I feel like a stranger in my own home now - how do I protect this from blooming into a full-blown repressed memory accusation extravaganza?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the tip below - Elizabeth Loftus has done a great deal in this area in trying to scientifically document the plasticity of memory and its susceptibility to alteration or 'injection' (inception?) after the fact. She includes the full text to her key articles on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.washington.edu/eloftus/&quot; &gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am glad to hear that there are so many other snuggle-bugs out there! I also like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;cuddle-bug&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cuddle-bunny&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;snuggle-boo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;snuggle-bunny&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am home now and she is acting like it is just another day. I don't think she understands how devastating this feels. I can't defend myself, I can't complain, because then I just sound like a guilty person trying to avoid scrutiny. ..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;good article about a woman who accused her dad based on repressed memories and then later realized that she was wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/books/int/2010/09/20/meredith_maran_my_lie_interview&quot; &gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; - thanks coronalmassejection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/dinnadoo&quot;&gt; dinnadoo &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jckio/wife_believes_she_may_have_repressed_memories_of/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jckio/wife_believes_she_may_have_repressed_memories_of/"&gt;[792 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Home is..</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jcmno/home_is/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jcmno/home_is/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2011 18:16:05 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Minhimalism&quot;&gt; Minhimalism &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/&quot;&gt; funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkwpfnWyLi1qg0yl1o1_500.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jcmno/home_is/"&gt;[187 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introducing...
