I doubt that you'll ever read this, but I seriously and unironically want to thank you for what you did. Thanks to you, I was late to work yesterday. I couldn't drive in the rain without wipers, so I had to walk to halfords to buy new ones. At halfords, I was bought my wipers from the woman behind the counter, and she asked why I was so wet and angry looking. I explained and she offered to take me for a drink that night to drown my sorrows. We met up after work and sat talking for a good five hours. Then we met up for lunch today We're meeting up again tonight, and I know it's soon, but I am falling for this girl, hard. So thank you again for helping me meet someone who is, quite frankly, amazing.

I'll start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My family is pretty normal. Or so I thought until my sister did something rather unprecedented. My sister was in the home stretch of her senior year of high school. She is a smart girl, but she is lazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her freshman year of high school she started playing World of Warcraft online. My parents tried their best to keep it reasonable, but she got progressively sucked into the game. My parents had to even go so far as turning off her WoW account when she was not allowed to play (she managed to swing like 5 hours a day on schoolnights, 8 or 9 hours on weekends).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My sister started acting even weirder in her junior year. She wanted to buy a guy she had met online a $50 Christmas gift. We asked and asked if they were an item and she denied it. Apparently he had also bought her $50 worth of Steam games so she was just returning the favor. It was finally around the end of her junior year that she admitted she was &quot;dating&quot; the guy. My parents were rocked, but tried their best to be accepting, even going so far as to speak to the guy on the phone. Did I mention this guy was 26, and lives in Canada? My sister was still in high school!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gets better though. Last summer, between my sister's junior and senior year, my mom tripped on my sister's journal on the floor. Apparently my sister had MET WITH THIS GUY ALONE. She had lied to my parents that she was spending the night at a friend's house, and then took the car (that I share with her when I'm home from college), and drove downtown to the airport to pick him up and go to a MOTEL. Oh yes. He took her cherry. -&lt;em&gt;- Detailed journal entries... He had never flown before, let alone had a passport, yet he was dumb enough to come down to America to have sex with a high-schooler he met online. -&lt;/em&gt;- The kicker was she said she did this because she thought my parents would never let him visit, yet they had let him visit the very next month! And the 2 of them had pretended he had never visited America, etc. But again, my parents were shocked yet tried to be accepting. She was punished for it by not being able to talk to him for a whole weekend, for the extra weekend she spent with him at the hotel. It was at this point I knew there was nothing I would put past her, but still the worst was yet to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know a few females who have eloped, or done something similar, due to parental disapproval of their significant other, so we were all trying very hard to not provoke my sister into doing this. We told her over and over again that we loved her, she didn't have to do college if she didn't want to, and we really really just wanted her to finish high school!! My dad and my sister were going up to Canada to check out where here boyfriend lived (on a crappy salary in a house with a bunch of people where he can barely even support himself) and to check out the local Canadian college. My parents were going to let her go to Canada for college, and live at his place!!!!!!!! I swear she was served this as if on a silver platter! What more could you ask for?! To live with your boyfriend on your parents dime! (They had reasoned even if she WAS in a dorm she'd just spend time with him all the time anyways -_-) My sister had still applied to the state colleges, which are much cheaper for us being in-state. She applied to FIVE, each with a $60 application fee!! My parents even asked her again before they paid $300 if she really wanted to apply, even though we thought she'd probably end up in Canada anyways... Let alone even get ACCEPTED into these schools (UC schools, with a 3.6(?) GPA isn't very likely).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So off my dad and sister went to Canada for Thanksgiving. I spent Thanksgiving with my boyfriend as he had to stay at school for a football game (marching band), and my mom came up to visit for a day or so. We finally get a call from my dad (which was very strange, as it is expensive to call from another country), and I ask him what is wrong. My sister was not coming home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That little...girl told my dad the last day that she was not going home. My dad had to get on the plane alone. She could not wait a few extra months to finish high school. Just could. Not. Wait. -_- My dad was a mess :(. They had to take him to the emergency room because he was shaking so bad. All while I was stuck taking finals... My poor, poor dad... He was her advocate, and she just stabbed him in the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So she is livin the dream in Canada as an illegal alien. She is mooching off her 26 YO boyfriend's salary on the poverty line. She can't work. There is no guarantee of her ever being a citizen, even if they get married. Her bf is apparently her &quot;last chance at love&quot;, and the &quot;smartest person she knows&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that is my story Reddit. I know it could be (much) worse, but it is still pretty fucked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epilouge: They did visit for Christmas, and we were all quite civil (her bf was going to visit for Xmas as it was, but they had to get her an extra ticket of course). And she just completed high school online last week. Otherwise, she seems happy, and occasionally emails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: read the title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: A little about my parents. They are awesome parents. They did the best that they, or anyone, could have done in this situation, and if you say otherwise I probably won't be able to stop myself from (politely) flaming you (sorry). They have both given my sister and I the tools for success, while trying to teach us how to use these tools, and how to EARN success. Whatever they did worked great on me, I am a happy and hard-working individual. My sister just likes to be lazy, and is seemingly unappreciative of my parents love and hard work in raising the 2 of us. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/ucdavis_engineer&quot;&gt; ucdavis_engineer &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/i37s4/my_18_yo_sister_dropped_out_of_high_school_and/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i37s4/my_18_yo_sister_dropped_out_of_high_school_and/"&gt;[829 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>British Student Faces Extradition to the US for Linking to Copyrighted Material</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i2z8x/british_student_faces_extradition_to_the_us_for/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i2z8x/british_student_faces_extradition_to_the_us_for/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2011 15:53:00 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/maxwellhill&quot;&gt; maxwellhill &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeropaid.com/news/93775/british-student-faces-extradition-to-the-us-for-linking-to-copyrighted-material/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i2z8x/british_student_faces_extradition_to_the_us_for/"&gt;[296 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>IAMA Soldier who was Infantry yet also trained deploying units by playing roles as terrorists in small &quot;mock&quot; villages.

Irwin CA, NTC (National Training Center). Because of the location of Ft. Irwin (desert) they took advantage of this by building small mock towns and villages on the training grounds where we would play as terrorists (OPFOR - Opposing Forces) and units would come to test their SOP's (standard operating procedures) before deploying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My job was infantry half of the time, and terrorist the other half. Our units would spend two weeks every month living in &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Gn0Fh.jpg&quot; &gt;small towns&lt;/a&gt; and dressing up in Arabic attire. We would all be assigned families, names and job titles. Only a hand-full of us would be enemy combatants though. Roughly 60% were civilians. When the soldiers would come through on random patrols/searches, it was our job to deceive them, test them, teach them customs (which we were taught) and mainly point out their weaknesses by engaging them in fire-fights, blowing up their convoys, and trying to sneak into their bases (so freaking fun).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were also Iraqi interpretors who lived alongside us (women, men, no children) who mostly traveled from San Diego. They were paid &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; well from what I hear. However, they never played the role of terrorist and were just there to provide us with working knowledge of the culture, as well as to provide a more realistic environment for the units who were training against us. I've trained with special forces, SEALs and many, many units who have come through. Some of the best times and most fun I've ever had in my life happened out in those towns. AMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, do you want to to know the true definition of camping? LOL. To me, that's when we would be assigned roles as a sniper team, and were told that BLUEFOR (the soldiers) would be coming into town for a few hours to patrol. Wake up at 6am, grab your weapon, MRE, water and sneak into a 3 story building without being scene by choppers or scouts. Wait 5 hours, every few minutes peeking out the window to see if they've arrived. Keep smelling your buddies farts permeate the dusty 100 degree room that you're sharing with him. Wait until the patrol has moved into town and set up. Give it just a few more minutes of silence, just when the soldiers think that everything is cool, and then open fire from a dark room. Pop off as many rounds as possible without giving away your presence and then hi-tail it out of there once you've realized you've been compromised. Try to make it out the back of the building - jump in an F-150 and speed the fuck out of there before being cornered by 3 bradleys. Man, I miss it lol. :(&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://campbellbrown.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/18/an-americans-journey-from-us-soldier-to-top-terrorist-all-with-the-armys-blessing/#more-2949&quot; &gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on CNN detailing some of the training at Ft.
