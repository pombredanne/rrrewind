Anyway, I&#39;d been sent to bed but could still hear everyone talking about this and that, until the woman neighbour said &#39;Hey Digsy&#39;s Mum, do you remember when Digsy used to complain that there was someone in his room? Well there&#39;s a family that&#39;s just moved in to the floor above who have a three year old son. He is complaining of the exact same things Digsy did.&#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This creeped me out. I had no recollection of any of this, so the next day asked my Mum. Her first reaction was &#39;You don&#39;t remember?&#39; then she told me all about the weird stuff that used to happen, footsteps up and down the hall, shit going missing and stuff. She said the final thing to happen was when she was listening to a record one day, and it started to slow down, like someone was holding a finger gently on the platter till it finally came to a stop. My Mum said she snapped at this point, and started shouting &#39;WILL YOU LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE!&#39; As soon as she said this, the record went straight back to playing normally, and we never experienced anything again. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that since, and these days I&#39;m quite sceptical of such stories, but I believe my Mum. Strangest thing is how I found out about it, from someone else ten years later experiencing something similar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Reddit, Halloween is almost upon us. Now&#39;s your chance to share something freaky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/digsy&#34;&gt; digsy &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&#34;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l66m8/as_its_nearly_halloween_how_about_we_share_some/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l66m8/as_its_nearly_halloween_how_about_we_share_some/"&gt;[3174 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIL that in Russia there is a &quot;Temple of All Religions&quot; which serves as peaceful combination of different cultures.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l6dij/til_that_in_russia_there_is_a_temple_of_all/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l6dij/til_that_in_russia_there_is_a_temple_of_all/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 21:50:47 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l6dij/til_that_in_russia_there_is_a_temple_of_all/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l6dij.png&#34; alt=&#34;TIL that in Russia there is a &amp;quot;Temple of All Religions&amp;quot; which serves as peaceful combination of different cultures. &#34; title=&#34;TIL that in Russia there is a &amp;quot;Temple of All Religions&amp;quot; which serves as peaceful combination of different cultures. &#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/IAmAnOtterPhysicist&#34;&gt; IAmAnOtterPhysicist &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/&#34;&gt; todayilearned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_All_Religions&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l6dij/til_that_in_russia_there_is_a_temple_of_all/"&gt;[108 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>TIL that in Russia there is a &quot;Temple of All Religions&quot; which serves as peaceful combination of different cultures.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l6dij.png" /></item><item><title>The strangest and most intense animated short I think I've ever seen.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l629z/the_strangest_and_most_intense_animated_short_i/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l629z/the_strangest_and_most_intense_animated_short_i/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 15:34:11 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l629z/the_strangest_and_most_intense_animated_short_i/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l629z.png&#34; alt=&#34;The strangest and most intense animated short I think I&#39;ve ever seen. &#34; title=&#34;The strangest and most intense animated short I think I&#39;ve ever seen. &#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/archaeo-nemesis&#34;&gt; archaeo-nemesis &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&#34;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVkDrIacHJM&amp;amp;feature=share&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l629z/the_strangest_and_most_intense_animated_short_i/"&gt;[306 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>The strangest and most intense animated short I think I've ever seen.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_l629z.png" /></item><item><title>IAmA 15 year old who unschools, AmA</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/l65k6/iama_15_year_old_who_unschools_ama/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/l65k6/iama_15_year_old_who_unschools_ama/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 17:30:31 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;md&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unschooling is a schooling technique mostly pioneered by Grace Llewellyn who wrote the book &#34;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&#34;. The book is about the history and effects of structured schooling and a method by which students &#34;homeschool&#34; without the aid of parents. The idea is that children have a natural tendency to get interested in certain things, and because nobody is forcing them to go in any one direction they just go with what interests them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just got back from Grace&#39;s Not Back To School Camp where I spent one week with a group of other kids who are also unschooling, a great majority of these kids are unbelievably smart and directed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My personal history is that I went to public school from preschool to grade 8, where although my grades were top notch, but I was so depressed that I couldn&#39;t keep it up. I stopped feeling interested in anything. Eventually I got my parents to take the book seriously and let me drop out for a while. Since then my mental health has grown leaps and bounds, I have rediscovered my love for marine biology, made friends across the country, and become a more mellow person in general. I love life now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really hope I didn&#39;t make a small spelling mistake that I missed in proofreading this, just to have everyone judge my method of schooling based on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I don&#39;t go to school, I teach myself. I went from a depressed shell of a kid to someone who loves life and is less scared of the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS: I know there are other NBTSCers here on Reddit, do any of them read IAmA and want to help me out? If not I may only be able to answer a few questions since I do have to study for some psych stuff I have coming up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Okay, I have been refreshing my unread messages box and replying to as much as I can since I made this post apparently 6 hours ago in reddit time, I am gonna go take a break and play some TF2 or something, so I&#39;ll be back and answering questions in a few hours.
