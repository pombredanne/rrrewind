It's not a pro-choice/ pro-life argument. It's not because most of reddit is liberal. It's because we have (or used to) have something called decency and respect.

He got me pregnant. I have decided to get an abortion. Mr. Baby-Daddy isn't coming. I don't want to go alone. Is there anyone in Cherry Hill, NJ who would be willing to come with me? I'm terrified and can't do this by myself. But I don't have anyone else I can turn to...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: For all you self-righteous assholes giving me a hard time for having an abortion, keep it to yourself. I'm not here asking question about what I should do, I've made my decision already. I'm here because I don't want to go alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 2: removed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, random people sending me PMs about it. The reason my decision is non-negotiable: I may have Huntington's, my mom did. I'm not going to risk passing it on to anyone. Sorry if I ruined the perfect dismounts off all your high horses, but go to hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit again: I was trying to take all of this with a grain of salt. But really, do you people think that sending me hate mail will change my mind? For example, comment made by gnillortnailol: &quot;You are a stupid fucking whore. I hope you die from the procedure but, in case you don't, get sterilized while you're at it. I will put up the money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously? Because a malfunctioning condom means that I'm a person who has sex with people for money? Is that what being a whore means? I came here looking only for someone to help me, grow the fuck up. If you don't agree then move along, I'm sure theres an anti-choice subreddit here for you all to troll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit some more: First, a big thank you to everyone for offering to be there with me. I didn't come here looking for support, or to get torn down. I came here simply for someone to come with me while I had this done. Thanks very much to an amazing person on this site I won't be going through it alone. She asked to remain anon so there it is. I wasn't looking for affirmation for what I'm doing, but the kind words telling me that &quot;everything will be okay&quot; are very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, for the people saying they're going to stop by Cherry Hill and protest the clinic until it closes, I never said I was going to a place in Cherry Hill itself, nor did I say it's where I live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final Edit: I appreciate the people who said they would help. But this seems to have stirred up the hive mind quite a bit. To everyone that sent me hate mail or even the people calling me a liar and a karma whore: if that's what you think, go right ahead. It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change my decision. Specifically to the &quot;haters&quot; you are entitled to your opinions. But this thread was not a forum for you to spew venom about something about which you feel strongly. I'm sorry no one ever taught you to be more tolerant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all the love and such from so many people.

To everyone's amazement, he sticks it in his mouth, and somehow swallows it whole.
