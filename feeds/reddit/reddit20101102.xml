But whenever you see a politician pushing something, they always have an poll to go with it. Forget the fact, that pollsters are for hire, and will work for politicians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If X respected poll shows that 51 percent of Americans are upset with Health care, wouldn't that also create a strong social proof for the other 49 percent that might like the health care bill into thinking, well it's not so good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know polls can be accurate, but it just seems, more and more, that they are released to create social proof for somebody's agenda, just the way they are released, worded, and by who they are promoted by (X politician) or (X Media Outlet).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reading, I'm talking more about the power to create strong social proof amongst whatever the target audience. Not necessarily that somebody is tampering with the polls specifically (though I'm sure that happens).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The standard salesman at your local car dealership would use social proof to get somebody to pull the trigger.

Measure one of her necklaces to see what length she likes. Pocket one of her rings, take it to a jeweler and have them tell you what size it is. Write all of these sizes down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) At some point she will ask you to buy tampons for her. It happens. When you go to the store, buy 3 small packages of her brand. Give her one and hide the other two in your car (near the spare tire, she'll never look there). Next time she asks you to buy her some you can just go to the bar and have a beer instead of actually going to the store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Never buy a diamond. Cubic zirconia and moissanite look just as good, and man-made diamonds are getting easier to find every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: To clarify #3, there doesn't need to be any deception. It's just stupid to pay $1500 for a worthless rock. Go buy a $300 ring, propose, if she says yes then tell her that you bought a ring with a synthetic stone because you don't enjoy funding civil wars. If you still feel the obligation to verify your love with a poor financial decision, give her a $1200 gift certificate to a bridal store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit2: I thought of another one:&lt;br/&gt; 4) If your SO likes to spoon, but you're not in the mood to cuddle with a thermonuclear device, just follow wreckemtech's handy MS Paint guide to &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/2ePio.png&quot; &gt;Faux Spooning&lt;/a&gt;.

I thought you might be interested. I am registered at one of the precincts for people living in the dorms, at Illinois State University. I got there, and the line was unusually slow. There were open spots where people could have been voting, but everything seemed at a standstill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I heard a lot of talk about how a lot of people were registered there were not living in the dorms. A lot of talk about how people were not being allowed to vote for state or local elections, but could still vote in the Federal ones. This seemed very odd to me, but I had not been living in the dorms two years ago for the presidential election and things went off without a hitch, so I figured that I'd be fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it was finally my turn up at the desk, I told the girl my name, and she looked me up. Next to my name was a capital &quot;S.&quot; Suspended. She told me that they had sent some sort of renewal cards to everyone who was living in the dorms to see if they were actually still living there, or if they were living somewhere else. If nobody responded to the card, then registration is suspended. As I looked down the list that she had, all I saw was a long list of names, each one marked with a capital S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This does not make any sense. Under normal circumstances, you should be able to fill out a provisional ballot for both federal and state elections. I was only offered the opportunity to fill out one for federal elections. The average student at ISU does not realize that even if you move into the dorm next door to your own, you still have to re-register to vote. I'm a graduate student in politics and government, and even I did not know. When I'd gone to vote before, it all just worked out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to preventing people from voting in state and local elections, because the poll workers were having to make phone calls for nearly every individual who came through the line, everything moved to a crawl. It took me half an hour to move fifteen feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm very angry about this, but I have no idea what can be done about it. So I'm just telling everyone I can until I figure out what can be done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: I went back tonight to vote federally and to lodge a complaint as someone else suggested. At that point they told me that I could in fact get a provisional ballot, but there was some confusion about whether or not I could still vote federally because I now live in a different precinct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also: When I first came to ISU, I was told that I needed to register here at ISU so I did not have to go back home in order to vote, meaning that if I didn't register, I would be voting at a place other than where I was living. In addition, I didn't live in the precinct two years ago and I was able to vote without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/zengosm&quot;&gt; zengosm &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/e09gf/i_tried_to_vote_in_illinois_i_was_disenfranchised/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e09gf/i_tried_to_vote_in_illinois_i_was_disenfranchised/"&gt;[361 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Example of a good police officer.

Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit. Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so. Germany appeals to Britain that France has been looking at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it? Germany tells Russia to stop looking at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's looking at Belgium. Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper. When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria. Australia punches Turkey, and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway. Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting. America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault . While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/millard27&quot;&gt; millard27 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/&quot;&gt; funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/e090s/if_world_war_one_was_a_bar_fight/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/e090s/if_world_war_one_was_a_bar_fight/"&gt;[174 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>My classmate and her bf went as Neytiri and Jake Sully...the results were amazing.
