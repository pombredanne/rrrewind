This room also happened to be the location of the heaviest beer pong table known to man. Late in the night after copious amounts of alcohol had been consumed some wiseguy decided that the beer pong table needed to be relocated. He proceeds to push the adamantium table up against the wall with some force effectively shattering the PVC pipe. This is the middle of winter, so ice cold water starts spraying in a 6 foot radius out of the pipe dousing nearly everyone in the room. Girls are crying about their hair and clothes and the guys are yelling at each other about finding the shut off valve which took about 5 drunk minutes to locate. Meanwhile, I am standing bone dry on the other side of the room drinking a Natural Light (dont judge, it was college) and watching an impromptu wet t-shirt contest.

I was tomboyish, and not interested in boys at the time because I was too busy making friends and finding interests. However, he took a liking to me, and my group of friends, and began 'dating'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By that summer, he had destroyed my self-esteem, beaten me, ruined my relationship with my mother, and convinced me at the time he was the only one who could ever love me. I had no father-figure as my parents were going through a nasty divorce, and my mother was often ill in bed. He then began feeding me 'downers' so that his 'friends' could have their way with me, and he could make a decent profit of fifty dollars a person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The physical, mental, sexual and emotional abuse went on until my seventeenth summer, and when I was eighteen I finally got away from him for good. I have told no one, and went to the DA only once, but was treated as if I was making it all up, since I have no evidence. The only evidence I have are the journals of it I kept, and the memories. This is my first time speaking publicly about it, due to a self-therapeutic push to feel better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man in question's mother was also a part of the abuse, as work got around my high school at the time that I was a 'slut'. I didn't have the emotional strength to speak out, fearing my mother due to his success at destroying our mother-daughter relationship. He would cry to her, saying how he loved me but I wouldn't stop 'sleeping around'. Truthfully, his friends and strangers paid him to sleep with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I battled with this alone until I got fed up and told the next person I dated why I never enjoyed sex, why I was distant, and why I get upset and run away from situations when drinking. The support I was given, for the first time, was immense and have only recently been able to understand I was not the cause, or responsible, but instead a victim. The words 'rape' and 'sexual slave' never crossed my mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not a stupid person, I am very well-read and educated, however I did not understand the difference of it being my fault, and the fault of someone else as the man who did this often told me it was my fault. Since I never spoke to anyone about it, no one told me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I am twenty, in college, and plan on moving in with my now-boyfriend who supports my choices in joining groups for women who have been raped, and different methods of coping. I never enjoyed sex, or orgasm-ed because of the things I was put through. I didn't understand for a women to enjoy sex, it is both physical as well as mental. Since I opened up to him, for the first time in my life I lead a healthy sex life, and thankfully have no STDs from my younger life despite the constant stream of men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a big step in my life, and I would like to answer any and all questions you have, within respect and reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I often get sexually harassed, as most twenty-year-old girls do, and it kills me inside because some comments make me feel as if I am still on sale for sex, so please be kind and respectful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, my power cord died for my laptop, so I may be running this off of my mobile, so bear with me and be patient. I also have work at four and will be answering as quickly and frequently as I can from there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit : thank you for all the support I have received. It is helping in becoming more comfortable with speaking about it in person. I will post pics of my journal entries on here as soon as I get off work tonight, and am running this off of my mobile app so I'm sorry for typos or unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, thank you Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/herpettethrowaway&quot;&gt; herpettethrowaway &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jkmey/iama_girl_who_was_sold_into_prostitution_for/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jkmey/iama_girl_who_was_sold_into_prostitution_for/"&gt;[494 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>'They Were Truly Idiots' --- Mikhail Gorbachev, 80, discusses the last days of the Soviet Union, his failure to resolve problems with the Communist Party and the ensuing bloodshed he says still troubles him today.

Though never the less I took a step in to the shower after a hot and sweaty cross-country practice to try out my creation. Just by holding my ice-soap, I started to get goose bumps. I'm not going to lie, I was a little afraid, but it was too late to turn back. So I held my breathe and with the ice-soap in my right hand, I wiped it across my left arm. &quot;Wow&quot; I thought to myself, that wasn't that bad, so I did it again and again until I was lathering my whole body. I don't know why I wasn't freezing, maybe I was just excited, maybe the body wash wasn't as cold as the actual ice, but what ever the reason I didn't at all feel uncomfortable. Tiny bubbles appeared on my arms but my more hairy legs seamed to attract the soapy material. Before I knew it, my ice-soap was disappearing before my very eyes. For one thing, I feel as though I needed more of the ice in my ice-soap, because even though my arms were all right, there was not enough water produced from the ice to wash off my legs. So to the answer for the question &quot;does it really work?&quot;, my reply is yes. The use of the ice-soap was meant to cleanse your sweaty upper body after a sporting event to feel refreshed without having a shower any where in sight. This invention fulfills those needs even though I recommend a water bottle and a small towel to finish off the job. Bottom line, yes it works, it was nice to try it, but I still prefer my hot shower :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/NoobyNooob&quot;&gt; NoobyNooob &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jl2gq/iama_user_who_actually_tried_icesoap_this_is_my/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jl2gq/iama_user_who_actually_tried_icesoap_this_is_my/"&gt;[42 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>England: Four years' jail for inciting disorder on Facebook</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jkojf/england_four_years_jail_for_inciting_disorder_on/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jkojf/england_four_years_jail_for_inciting_disorder_on/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 17:57:01 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/f2u&quot;&gt; f2u &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/16/uk-riots-four-years-disorder-facebook&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jkojf/england_four_years_jail_for_inciting_disorder_on/"&gt;[322 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
