The owners have a little 7 year old boy who likes to come into my store to play games, use our electronics and I'll sometimes help him do his homework. He's a really good, VERY intelligent kid who speaks perfect English and Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So last night, Little Asian Boy (LAB as we'll call him) walks in the door with a shit eating grin on his face. We say our hellos and he suddenly breaks into the most stereotypical Asian voice I have EVER heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accent was executed flawlessly. He mixed his Rs and Ls like a master linguist with downs. &quot;Herro prease&quot; he said, &quot;Do you rike to pray carr of duty?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My coworkers and I were keeling over from laughter. His impressions went on the next couple minutes. If you can, imagine the most adorable LAB you've ever seen, who has a totally innocent demeanor doing this impression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I say to him, &quot;LAB, who told you to talk like that?&quot; LAB looks at me and with the most serious face I have ever seen a child make says; &quot;I have no idea what you are talking about, you guys are racist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then turned around, went out the door, walked brisky passed the front window... and gave all of us a big ass toothless smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was trolled by a little 7 year old Asian boy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm ecstatic the story about my little buddy became so popular. However, I don't get why this has turned into a racism/this isn't trolling circlejerk. I called him a &quot;little Asian boy&quot; because he is in fact Asian, a boy and little. It's not intended to be racist. I said he was trolling because he &quot;intentionally&quot; said what he did because he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that it was going to mess with us and our perception about him. He's a very intelligent 7 year old and said that to get a rise out of all of us. It worked very well because we initially laughed at his impression, but were totally taken aback when he called us racist. To me, that's trolling. Honestly, who fucking cares if your definition of being a troll doesn't match someone elses? Can't we all just enjoy a story about a funny kid without taking it too damn seriously?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/maverickrenegade&quot;&gt;

At my mall, there is an exit where the incoming cars have no stop signs, but the cars exiting the mall do. As you may have heard, there is a hefty bit of snow happening around the midwest, so stopping a bus in this mess is a tinge difficult. Anyway, We were rounding that corner coming out of the mall when a little sedan comes zooming up, trying to whip into the mall. The bus, already midturn, obviously isn't going to stop for this dick. The guy honks, and I'm sitting towards the front where I hear the bus driver(an African American individual) mutter to himself &quot;Bitch... I'm a bus.&quot; and keeps driving. I laughed out loud, unable to contain myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I want to say I just don't give a fuck, instead I proudly exclaim &quot;Bitch...I'm a bus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ex.) Today I jaywalked right in front of a cop because there was a tasty sandwich shop directly across the street. I had already started walking when I realized my faux pas. I hesitated a little, then decided it was snowing too hard to give a fuck. So I mumbled to myself &quot;bitch, I'm a bus.&quot; and kept walking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downvote if you want to, but I love my new IRL meme. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Holy crap! My inside joke has become an outside joke. :D I love you, reddit. And to clarify, the police car was stopped at a stop light, and I was walking between cars. It's not like I ran out into traffic. :P But thank you for the safety concerns!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT2: This has already become a running joke in my family...

His gravelly voice and jazz/blues and in his later years industrial/experimental approach to music took some getting used to, but he's now my all-time favorite. There's actually an urban legend that no matter how you feel, Tom has a song that captures it. I certainly don't doubt that. He runs the gamut from soulful and uplifting to visceral and gritty, from quirky and satirical to downright heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back, I don't know how the hell I wasn't listening to this guy sooner and I recommend him to... well pretty much everybody I meet, no matter what kind of music they're into normally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your turn!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/granola_brother&quot;&gt; granola_brother &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fdcch/what_one_thing_do_you_believe_is_an_acquired/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fdcch/what_one_thing_do_you_believe_is_an_acquired/"&gt;[1011 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cosmos At Least 250x Bigger Than Visible Universe</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fdcyg/cosmos_at_least_250x_bigger_than_visible_universe/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fdcyg/cosmos_at_least_250x_bigger_than_visible_universe/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2011 21:41:45 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/PENIX&quot;&gt; PENIX &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/&quot;&gt; science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26333/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fdcyg/cosmos_at_least_250x_bigger_than_visible_universe/"&gt;[55 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>WTF commercial</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fd411/wtf_commercial/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fd411/wtf_commercial/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2011 15:16:54 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/digitaltothem&quot;&gt; digitaltothem &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/&quot;&gt; WTF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfy1umTGjp1qgoz59o1_400.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fd411/wtf_commercial/"&gt;[66 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Okay so apparently my original submission caused a black hole in reddit that caused it to implode into itself.
