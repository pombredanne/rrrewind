And since she was a single mother, she had to take me everywhere she went, including the weekly grocery store runs. During this particular story, I was about 4 years old. In order to get me to behave in the grocery store, i.e. &quot;the grocery store is not your personal playground&quot; my mother would bribe me with a &quot;trip to the pet store&quot; if I acted on my best behavior. Now I love animals and always have. This bribe always worked for me. So one day, I was feeling particularly wild so my mother used the pet store bribe. I fell for it of course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the grocery store we went into the town's local pet store, which was about the size of two bedrooms. When we walked in, on the door there was a sign that read: &quot;Kittens for Sale&quot;. My mother remembered hesitating before taking me in but a promise is a promise and I had been on such wonderful behavior that it was only fair to take me in. My mom went and bought some bird seed for our birds (Finches) while I wandered to the back of the store. My mom let me wander in the pet store because she was standing in the check-out line right by the exit door so there was no way I could escape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While my mom was standing in the check out line I disappeared from sight. Then she hears from the back of the store me yelling, &quot;Ooooooo mommy! It's so cute! Soooo cute mommy. I want one. Oooo sooo cute. Mommy plllleeeassee can I have one? So cute mommy. Mommy pleasssseee?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mother recalls thinking, &quot;Oh god. She's found the kittens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five minutes pass and I am still hollering in my cute yet extremely annoying four-year old voice: &quot;Ooooooo mommy! It's so cute! Soooo cute mommy. I want one. Oooo sooo cute. Mommy plllleeeassee can I have one? So cute mommy. Mommy pleasssseee?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mom tells me to wait a minute and she will be there as soon as she pays. I however, cannot wait. My yelling becomes more insistent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FINALLY, she pays and walks to the back of the store fearing that I had found a kitten. However, much to her surprise, I was not begging for a kitten but rather I was BEGGING and PETTING a human dwarf. Yes, a real-live human dwarf. My mom said he was just frozen there while I was screaming and wailing about how cute he was and how I wanted to take him home. I was also petting him/stroking him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mother thus yanked me by the arm all the while apologizing to the man while I was screaming my lungs out about how I &quot;NEEDING IT&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have stories like these from their childhood? My mother says that she thought all children did embarrassing things like this. However my two younger sisters did not ever do such things. Am I the only one here??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/feeling_groovy&quot;&gt; feeling_groovy &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt;

It was obvious he couldn't bend down to get the boxes and they were just flying further away so I put my car in park, jumped out, and ran to help him. (There was a couple cars ahead of me so I didn't think I would hold the line up)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I picked all the boxes up in a jiffy and ran to the dumpster, then came back and pushed the cart for him. I don't think he spoke much english but he just kept saying &quot;Thank you thank you&quot; over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran back into my car, placed my order, and when I got to the window to pay the girl told me the car in front of me had paid for my order since I did something nice for a stranger, they wanted to do the same thing.

Thanks Reddit, I don't expect much, but if someone can crack this case, it would really change my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am female, and looking for my paternal Grandmother. My father was adopted, and his fruitless search for his birth parents obsessed him, and he passed away when I was one month old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He never did find his mother. I know that she tried to communicate with him when he was about 8, but his adoptive parents refused contact. I think my father's mother's story is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;She was a student at a college or University&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;She studied either law or medicine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;She gave birth to my father at Park East General Hospital on March 3, 1947.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;She was from New Haven.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see the implications if I do get in contact with her, I have to tell her that her son is dead, and that is going to suck. However, I do need to know for more than curiosity - medical history has become increasingly important for me to discover. And I would love to meet her, of course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem with this situation is the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vault where the records for Park East General Hospital was burned to the ground, and they have no records whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father's adoption was not completely legal, as things had to be shammed because the old age of his adopted parents disqualified them from adopting him legitimately. There was also something about the birth mother's request for her son (my father) to be adopted by a Jewish family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, this may mean she is Jewish. But I have also heard the opposite, that Jewish people never adopt Jewish babies - to prevent unwitting &quot;incest problems&quot; if two Jewish relatives should meet, unbeknownst to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do have specific names and dates (please pm me), but does anyone have a suggestion on how to find her? I was thinking starting out with the alumni of any universities or colleges that accepted women back in 1947 - and start from there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any other ideas please?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;edit adoptive parents&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edit - sorry, dead Dad was born as Samuel Curtis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edit - Her name is Beatrice Brock - unsure if name is maiden or married name&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;edit - New Haven Connecticut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;edit - Someone suggested that because she named my father Samuel Curtis, that maybe she named him after the dad? Maybe she eventually became Beatrice Curtis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;new info - (thanks fluffster)...Going on the info that not many colleges and universities were accepting women then, looking through Alumni seems an option: and apparently, Harvard just started accepting women in 1945, just around the time my Grandmother was rumored to be studying Law or medicine... list of school accepting women around that time: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/education.shtml&quot; &gt;http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/education.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;going to bed like a golden girl at 10:30 pm london time...thank you so much!!! i cant wait to uncover more scooby doo clues in the morning!!! thank you!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/K-Mo&quot;&gt; K-Mo &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/e9jks/reddetectives_looking_for_grandmother_my_dead_dad/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e9jks/reddetectives_looking_for_grandmother_my_dead_dad/"&gt;[108 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
