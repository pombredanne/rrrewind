When Humberto was 16, he was walking with his girlfriend, and they were approached by members of a notorious international gang with a strong presence in Central America. For reasons unknown to Humberto, they started pushing him around and harassing him, telling him that they never wanted to see him again. As the situation escalated, Humberto's girlfriend ran to her home, which was close by. The gang members ended up beating Humberto, pistol-whipping him, and told him that if they ever saw him again, they would kill him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Naturally, Humberto was freaked out and stayed indoors as much as possible. Other friends and acquaintances of his have had similar experiences, and after the gang beat and harassed one of his friends, they obtained a picture of Humberto's soccer team and found out where he lived. They came to his house one day with a gun and told his mother that they would kill him on site if they ever saw him again. Thankfully, this took place at one of the few times Humberto had left his home. After the gang murdered one of his friends, he decided to flee to the US with another friend who had been similarly threatened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were caught at the border, and Humberto's friend, who was 18, was immediately deported. Upon his return to Honduras, the gang killed him. As a minor, Humberto was shuffled around to various immigration offices and services before being released to an undocumented family member in the US. Since he came to the US, he has heard that another similarly threatened friend has been killed by the gang.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After doing a lot of research on this subject, I have found that the gangs in Honduras engage in systematic, indiscriminate violence to further their gang activity. They use violence to specifically extort or recruit or to create a general sense of such fear that keeps them in power. They utilize &quot;join or die&quot; tactics and sometimes inflict violence without first trying to recruit the target of their violence so that when they do make a recruitment offer, the target feels like he has little choice but to comply. Humberto told me of an entire family that was killed before a gang approached the sole surviving teenage male and demanded he join the gang. New recruits are moved to new neighborhoods in order to increase dependency on the gang and make it easier for them to inflict violence on others because they are in a new location where they don't know the people they are hurting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humberto didn't go to the police because he says (and my research confirms) that the police are either corrupt or scared. They either work along with the gangs, loaning out guns and uniforms so they can make hits easier, or they refuse to respond to gang-related crime for fear that the gang will retaliate against them. Plus, the gang is known to kill those who go to the police for protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had the opportunity to spend a reasonable amount of time with Humberto and have taken his situation very seriously and personally. I've had a friend die at the hands of gang members, and I want to do everything I can to help Humberto. Unfortunately, the courts are not very favorable to these types of asylum claims. To be granted asylum, you essentially have to show, among other things, that you were persecuted in the past because one of several reasons recognized by law (religion, political thought, social group, etc.). Our greatest chance for success is to show that Humberto is part of a particular social group, but courts have been extremely reluctant to recognize teenage males from Central America who have been subjected to gang violence (or even recruitment attempts) as a &quot;social class&quot; for asylum purposes. If they did, there is a fear that, because of the rampant gang violence, everyone in Central America would qualify for asylum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have read countless articles, watched documentaries, and contacted almost every person I can think of or find. I need to find someone who can provide an affidavit that testifies to specific issues relating to gang violence in Honduras. Also, I need an affidavit that testifies to the police's corruption or inability to protect Honduran citizens from the gangs. Everyone who I have contacted has told me that they don't have time to help or don't think they qualify as an expert. I know this probably won't amount to anything, but, like I said, I'm doing everything I can to help Humberto. If his asylum application is unsuccessful, there is a reasonable chance that he will be killed by the gang upon deportation. There is the possibility of relocation within Honduras for him, but from what I've read, there is still a good chance that he will be marked for a hit even if he moves to another city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took him to a psychologist who is going to prepare a report that testifies as to Humberto's psychological condition, and it was hard to see how much this situation has impacted his life. He has a scar on his face from being pistol-whipped nearly two years ago, he is terrified that the gang members (who still come by his house looking for him) are going to kill his mother, and because he speaks no English, he has very limited outlets that he can use to deal with his grief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you, or someone you know, can put me in touch with a person who can provide an affidavit about gangs in Honduras and/or police corruption as it relates to gang activity in Honduras, Humberto and I will be immensely grateful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any help you can provide. If you didn't/couldn't read it: &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR I need to find an expert to provide an affidavit that testifies about gang violence and police corruption in Honduras in order help a teenager get asylee status as he flees from a gang that has killed his friends and told him that he's next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Sascrotch&quot;&gt; Sascrotch &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fxco5/i_know_its_a_long_shot_but_i_am_a_personal/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fxco5/i_know_its_a_long_shot_but_i_am_a_personal/"&gt;[202 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Oh, sorry.
