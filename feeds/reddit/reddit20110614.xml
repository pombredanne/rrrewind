I was an aspie, a tomboy, and my only good friends were for some reason extroverted fashionistas. One was a guy...he'd been my video game buddy for years but when he came out of the closet, he transformed into a total douche that let me know DAILY that I looked like a lesbian hobo. The other was a girl I had been best friends with since first grade, and she decided one day that I was holding her back with my apparent disregard for social norms. She just stopped being friends with me. I was lonely, depressed, and self-loathing. So that's the set up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On some AOL video game message boards, there was this girl. Her screenname was Samui. I had a girl-crush, I guess. She was tomboyish like me, but cool about it, and funny as hell. Everyone loved her, and I wanted to be her, or at least as cool as her. Que Aspherger's syndrome: My response to this was to make up some cool people to be my friends so that people would think I was cool, too. It made sense at the time. However, it got WAY out of hand. I carried the facade into my real life. I told stories about these people. They had families, hometowns, friends of their own. A few had myspaces. I found out that I am one &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; liar. People believed me. Some of my friends developed their own friendships with them and chatted online all the time. One friend from school even bitched about me to one of them...that's when I got jealous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was jealous of my own imaginary friends.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happened? They were cooler than me! They were getting invited to things that I wasn't! Also, at about this point, I fucked up bigtime and started &quot;dating&quot; one of them that &quot;lived in Yorktown.&quot; He was very popular. Remember that girl who ditched me for not being cool enough? &lt;strong&gt;She told me to fuck off because she liked him. &lt;/strong&gt; She'd been talking to him with a sceenname that was different from her old one! I was about to be in my first girl drama! As proud as I was, HE WASN'T REAL! Fuck!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, time to fix things. I'm a writer, granted a young one at the time, but I had skills. One imaginary friend commits suicide. Everyone buys it, he'd been struggling with depression anyway since he'd been living with his brother after their parents' car accident. Tears were shed, my own parents ask if I want therapy. I bravely decline. One by one, I literally wrote these people out of my life. A couple of the fabrications who were old enough to enlist supposedly did that...I live in a navy area so that wasn't weird to anyone, either. It was hard work. I had to do tread carefully so as to not be found out. Becoming known as the craziest fucking liar to ever live was not something I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am 21 years old now, and people still ask me how so-and-so is doing. Please, please understand that I feel guilt to this day over this. When it started, I was just lonely. And weirdly enough, making up stories and keeping up with lies helped me learn how people work. I practically cured my fucking Aspergers with this. I REGRET NOTHING!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, I regret it a little. That is so messed up. Young me was batshit crazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: I made up imaginary friends to make myself look cooler, they ended up being cooler than me, shit got out of control, I had to take my life back. Also, I learned that I should go into espionage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't believe that this got such a huge response! And yes, there is a chance that someone I know will see this. I've decided that if I get called out on it, then in that case, I am adult enough to admit to what I did and face the damage. Reddit, you were my first real audience for this. Other than you guys, my fiance knows. He was actually the one to make the espionage joke. Apparently no one told him about putting dick in the crazy...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catharsis is a weird thing. I am so embarrassed by a lot of the details that have already been brought up, but I really do want you to ask anything. This lie started very long ago and fessing up to every bit of it was long overdue. &lt;strong&gt;AMA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/TheSixofSwords&quot;&gt;

I was in the &quot;public hacking scene&quot; for about six years, and I'm pretty familiar with the motivations and origins of these people. I may have even known several of their members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's look at a few of their recent targets:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pron.com, leaking tens of thousands of innocent people's personal information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Minecraft, League of Legends, The Escapist, EVE Online, all ddos'd for no reason&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bethesda (Brink), threatening to leak tons of people's information if they don't put a top hat on their logo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fox.com, leaked tens of thousands of innocent people's contact information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PBS, because they ran a story that didn't favorably represent Wikileaks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sony said they stole tens of thousands of people's personal information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If LulzSec just was about exposing security holes in order to protect consumers, that would be okay. But they have neglected a practice called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure&quot; &gt;responsible disclosure&lt;/a&gt;, which the majority of security professionals use. It involves telling the company of the hole so that they can fix it, and only going public with the exploit when it's fixed or if the company ignores them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, LulzSec has put hundreds of thousands of people's personal information in the public domain. They attack first, point fingers, humiliate and threaten customers, ddos innocent websites and corporations that have done nothing wrong, all in the name of &quot;lulz&quot;. In reality, it's a giant ploy for attention and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many seem to believe these people are actually talented hackers. All they can do is SQL inject and use LFI's, public exploits on outdated software, and if they can't hack into something they just DDoS it. That puts these people on the same level as Turkish hacking groups that deface websites and put the Turkish flag everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be a different story if LulzSec had exposed something incriminating -- like corruption -- but all they have done is expose security problems for attention. They should have been responsible and told the companies about these problems, like most security auditors do, but instead they have published innocent people's contact information and taken down gameservers just to piss people off. They haven't exposed anything scandalous in nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, reddit hasn't given these types of groups the credibility and attention that LulzSec is currently getting. We don't accept this behavior in our comments here, so we should stop respecting these people too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anything, we will see more government intervention in online security when these people are done. Watch the &quot;Cybersecurity Act of 2011&quot; be primarily motivated by these kids. They are doing no favors for anyone. We need to stop handing them so much attention and praise for these actions. It only validates what they have done and what they may do in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I made a couple comments &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hyrji/senategov_hacked_by_lulzsec/c1ziodv&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/hsvzj/bbc_news_qa_lulz_security_those_who_attacked_sony/c1y57zh&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about where these groups come from and what they're really capable of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; LulzSec hasn't done anything productive, and we need to stop praising these people. It's akin to praising petty thieves, because they aren't even talented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaylulz11&quot;&gt; throwawaylulz11 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/&quot;&gt; reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/hzu3p/reddits_fascination_with_lulzsec_needs_to_stop/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hzu3p/reddits_fascination_with_lulzsec_needs_to_stop/"&gt;[172 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>If Judge Walker should be disqualified from ruling on Prop. 8 due to conflict of interest because he's gay, shouldn't 95% of the Congress be disqualified from voting for tax cuts for millionaires?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzcy8/if_judge_walker_should_be_disqualified_from/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzcy8/if_judge_walker_should_be_disqualified_from/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2011 12:50:09 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/contents&quot;&gt; contents &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lefti.blogspot.com/2011/06/question-about-latest-prop-8-issue.html&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzcy8/if_judge_walker_should_be_disqualified_from/"&gt;[636 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>IAMA Request: Bill O'Reilly was once a high school teacher.
