Learned some interesting things when I got this response from Ray Ueno:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked with Gabe and team to develop the &quot;guy in the logo&quot; back when we first named the company, Valve (circa 1995/6), and needed to develop the visual brand vocabulary to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interesting that you should ask about the bald guy. Back then, the casting agencies we were using to find models only had &quot;supermodel&quot;-type talent. We kept requesting &quot;heavy-set&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; models, and they kept sending us &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;perfect&quot; headshots to review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, we finally asked them to just go out on the street and pull &quot;everyday Joes&quot; who were more &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, and for the bald guy, &quot;kinda big, heavy-set, and bald&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They went out to the streets of Seattle's Broadway district, took tons of polaroids of the types of folks we were looking for, and brought the shots back to us. We selected the bald guy from the batches of &quot;off-the-street&quot; polaroids—he was literally pulled out of a coffee shop or book store!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few days later, we brought him into studio and shot the image you now see at the beginning of our games. We also shot a 2nd image of a different guy with a valve in his eye using the same process (you might remember him as well—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.file-extensions.org/imgs/company-logo/291/valve.jpg&quot; &gt;attached below&lt;/a&gt;). The two comprised the &quot;Open your mind. Open your eyes.&quot; concept for our initial brand, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's been very long since we did that work, so we don't know who the models were. And the fact that they weren't professional models, would make it very difficult to find them—if not impossible for the bald guy (not facing camera).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope that answers your question. If you have any others regarding the Valve brand, please feel free to contact me anytime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your interest in Valve and the bald guy image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: After thanking Ray for the response and linking him here, he followed up with this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a few the comments that your post has already gotten, and one of them asked about the origins of the Valve name and &quot;why is the 'e' superscript?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretty good timing. One of the items on my to-do list is to write up that story—we get asked for the backstory from time to time. So once I complete it, I'd be happy to send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/vism&quot;&gt; vism &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&quot;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/guw36/the_guy_in_the_valve_splash_screen/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/guw36/the_guy_in_the_valve_splash_screen/"&gt;[203 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>After 5 years of surfing reddit, these are my favorite discoveries...</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/guktv/after_5_years_of_surfing_reddit_these_are_my/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/guktv/after_5_years_of_surfing_reddit_these_are_my/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 16:33:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In no particular order are the most interesting things I have found in surfing reddit for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25lprEvoFJ8&quot; &gt;Chemistry a Volatile History&lt;/a&gt; is a great review of science and how we got to where we are today.

My dream in life is to create something so entertaining and educational. I'm working on it but progress when you have a 9-5 job is maddeningly slow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it. The reason I keep coming back to reddit is for gems like these. I hope you enjoy them too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Wow! I had no idea this post would be so popular. I would have done a much better job or going through my bookmarks. I really just grabbed items from my reddit saved folder at random. I just assumed that everyone knew about Cosmos or KahnAcademy both of which are mentioned in the comments so I didn't include them. I should have included &lt;a href=&quot;http://fantasticcontraption.com/&quot; &gt;Fantastic Contraption&lt;/a&gt; because for mechanical engineers that game is like crack. That was one of the very first links I clicked on reddit that cost my employer productivity. Several people have asked how reddit has changed over the last 5 years. I can only say that I have seen a lot of memes. (I hope these will be helpful during the zombie apocalypse) I've noticed that reddit has become faster paced, more humorous and more noisy. It's made me into a faster reader. I only ever upvote. I didn't even know that the down vote was a different color until today. My browsing philosophy has been simple. Look for gems (posts and comments) and upvote them. Ignore reposts and everything else unless it is blatant spam. I learned to do this process very quickly or I would spend my whole day on reddit. I wish I had really witty or interesting things to post but I usually don't. Even after 5 years on reddit, I am still learning all sorts of interesting things. (Maybe at a slower pace. Could be reddit or could be me.) Somehow now I have reddit gold for a month. It's kind of cool. Do I get that because I made it to a top post? I'm a major tightwad so I'm not sure I would pay for it but it is kind of fun. Like that year that they made us all admins for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Marauder&quot;&gt; Marauder &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/&quot;&gt; reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/guktv/after_5_years_of_surfing_reddit_these_are_my/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/guktv/after_5_years_of_surfing_reddit_these_are_my/"&gt;[775 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Puddle reflection</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gupj7/puddle_reflection/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gupj7/puddle_reflection/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 19:10:35 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gupj7/puddle_reflection/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_gupj7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Puddle reflection&quot; title=&quot;Puddle reflection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/zeb1&quot;&gt; zeb1 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/&quot;&gt; pics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/2pKJe.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gupj7/puddle_reflection/"&gt;[162 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Puddle reflection</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_gupj7.png" /></item><item><title>IAmA Columbine survivor named Brooks Brown. I was friends with the killers, a few victims, was scapegoated by the police as being involved, went on to do lots of anti-bullying activism for many years before I gave it up. AMA</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gulaf/iama_columbine_survivor_named_brooks_brown_i_was/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gulaf/iama_columbine_survivor_named_brooks_brown_i_was/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 16:49:17 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that's the short version. The longer version is a bit of a pain to go over entirely. I was a senior at the time of the massacre, and was the guy Eric told to 'get out of here' because he 'liked me now'. My family was the one who reported Eric Harris almost two dozen times to the police for death threats and various things which they never followed up on. After the terrible day, my family and I went to the press to show the world that the police botched this one up - and instead the police lied, saying we never did such a thing, then they began telling the media and the families that I was involved in the killing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I quickly became a pariah in the area, lost all but a handful of my friends, and became a semi-regular news feature. I spent the next few years in front of TV cameras, working on documentaries of all sorts, writing my book, and going from school to school talking about the dangers of bullying. I also spent much time reading, studying, talking to psychologists, experts, and others to try to understand why it happened. It consumed my life wholly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I quit all of that to move to SF to work on videogames and leave all that shit behind. It's been liberating. A while ago my Reddit account got outed as mine in a post about the work I'm doing now, and since then I've been sent messages saying I should do an AMA. So, here I am. 12 years in, hundreds of miles away. So, ask me anything. (edited due to stupid wording I had used)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Submitted photo for the AMA to the mods. &lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/gy8wbbuj&quot; &gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;. glad to see it make the front page. Your kind words are fantastic to read today, and I know a bunch of other Columbiners who are on here and its good to know it's still in your thoughts. I'm answering as fast as I can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Finally reading through the discussions and they're pretty fantastic. At least the civil ones. That's why I love reddit &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 3: That's it for now. 4 hours straight on Reddit is well over my daily requirement. I'll try to read more and answer more throughout the day. I think I replied to many, and almost every one with more than a few upvotes. I certainly didn't expect 1500 comments. thanks for all the kind words you guys/gals. It's definitely helped :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit 4: So I don't have to answer a ton of dupe questions about the bullying, I'm pointing to two articles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm&quot; &gt;one from that year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8115&amp;amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;amp;PAGE=1&quot; &gt;and another from 7 years later&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8452&amp;amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&quot; &gt;the amazing response to that one&lt;/a&gt;. The bullying was real. the shooters were NOT bullies, and there is a TON of stuff to back it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Special callout to Spuds2600 and others for the Reddit Gold. I could NOT have answered as many as I did as easily as i did if it weren't for him. you rule!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Or1g1nal1ty&quot;&gt; Or1g1nal1ty &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/gulaf/iama_columbine_survivor_named_brooks_brown_i_was/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gulaf/iama_columbine_survivor_named_brooks_brown_i_was/"&gt;[2345 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Director of &quot;Restrepo&quot; and Photographer Chris Hondros killed in Misurata, Libya.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gupqx/director_of_restrepo_and_photographer_chris/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gupqx/director_of_restrepo_and_photographer_chris/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 19:18:38 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/workbench&quot;&gt; workbench &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/04/20/2011-04-20_restrepo_filmmaker_tim_hetherington_nybased_getty_war_photographer_chris_hondros.html?r=news&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gupqx/director_of_restrepo_and_photographer_chris/"&gt;[149 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>We're smoking reefer and you don't want no part of this shit</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/gugr4/were_smoking_reefer_and_you_dont_want_no_part_of/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/gugr4/were_smoking_reefer_and_you_dont_want_no_part_of/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 14:09:45 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/gugr4/were_smoking_reefer_and_you_dont_want_no_part_of/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_gugr4.png&quot; alt=&quot;We're smoking reefer and you don't want no part of this shit&quot; title=&quot;We're smoking reefer and you don't want no part of this shit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Nuuge&quot;&gt; Nuuge &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&quot;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1jk4F1757A&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/gugr4/were_smoking_reefer_and_you_dont_want_no_part_of/"&gt;[412 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>We're smoking reefer and you don't want no part of this shit</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_gugr4.png" /></item><item><title>REMINDER: A year ago, 4 million barrels of oil started leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.
