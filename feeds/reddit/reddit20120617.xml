Let our story be heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Bhandary is a United States citizen. Dr Bhandary has been practicing medicine for over 24 years. He had a pain management and psychiatric clinic in Oklahoma City for 15 years he is well respected and has a clean malpractice record for overall 25+ years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is currently in a German prison while on his way voluntarily to the US. His family is writing this post on his behalf of him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has been unjustly detained in a German prison for over 50 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;December 16th, 2009 – Federal Agents came to his medical practice and seized tens of original patient files without search warrants and with much intimidation, threats, and other unlawful behaviors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Dr Bhandary raised his voice about getting his patient’s files returned Federal Agents harassed Dr Bhandary, his patients, and pharmacies for 2 years. This took a great toll on his health and patient care also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Bhandary was forced to shut down his practice because of this harassment and without any notices’, hearings, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of January 2012, He left the country to take care of personal matters. At the time there was no indictment was issued against him. He booked his return date in early February for April 26, 2012. At the time of booking the return flight, an indictment was not issued against him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;March 19th 2012 – Dr Bhandary’s attorneys filed a Civil Lawsuit against Federal Agents. Can be read here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bhandarydefense.com/files/Civil%20Suit.pdf&#34;&gt;http://bhandarydefense.com/files/Civil%20Suit.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;March 21st 2012 - Grand Jury indicted Dr Bhandary on 53 criminal counts all of which were based on evidence that was seized without warrants. He was not invited to be present at the Grand Jury Indictment to present his side on the accusations. In fact he was not given any notice about such proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indictment claims 5 deaths. These are serious allegations. Why then did authorities wait for years before filing charges? Why did they wait until the doctor filed his lawsuit? Why was he not allowed to present his side at the Grand Jury proceedings? Why have the files, or copies of the files, that have all the evidence, not been returned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;April 26th, 2012 – Even though he was aware of the indictment issued against him, he tried to return back voluntarily to the US on a ticket booked in early February at the time that he had left. He wanted to return to prove his innocence in court as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon arriving in Germany en-route to the US he was detained in German prison on account of being arrested as requested by US authorities. He is now facing a lengthy extradition process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This detention in Germany is unneeded and unjust since he was voluntarily returning to the US and had announced to law enforcement his itinerary and return flights/date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has been more 50 days in German prison.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With no help from the United States government, Dr Bhandary is sitting in a German prison waiting to return to the US. His family is doing the best they can do to get him back to the US to prove his innocence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the seriousness of the charges in the indictment, why do the US authorities not want to bring Dr Bhandary to a US court as soon as possible? Is that not what justice is about? Both for the doctor and the patients he has &lt;em&gt;supposedly&lt;/em&gt; hurt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He intended to sell his house for legal defense expenses but was unable to do so because of a notice of forfeiture that was issued against his personal residence, declaring that he is a &amp;quot;Fugitive&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How could he be a fugitive if he was voluntarily returning back to the US and had announced his return also? This is yet another untruth that has been stated about him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please read more about his situation at &lt;a href=&#34;http://bhandarydefense.com&#34;&gt;bhandarydefense.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a cry for help. Please reddit community, help Dr Bhandary and his patients receive justice! Spread the story about his situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family of Dr Amar N Bhandary&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Doctor being persecuted by law enforcement after filing lawsuit against them. Upon trying to return voluntarily to US to prove his innocence, he was arrested in Germany and has been detained there for over 50 days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/bhandarydefense&#34;&gt; bhandarydefense &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&#34;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/v6o2z/after_doctor_files_lawsuit_against_dea_he_is/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/v6o2z/after_doctor_files_lawsuit_against_dea_he_is/"&gt;[79 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scared grasshoppers change soil chemistry: Grasshoppers who die frightened leave their mark in the Earth in a way that more mellow ones do not, US and Israeli researchers have discovered.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/v6smv/scared_grasshoppers_change_soil_chemistry/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/v6smv/scared_grasshoppers_change_soil_chemistry/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2012 19:24:14 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/davidreiss666&#34;&gt; davidreiss666 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/&#34;&gt; science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/06/15/3526021.htm&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/v6smv/scared_grasshoppers_change_soil_chemistry/"&gt;[90 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don’t let the state search my internet searches.

As you can see, this story is starting to get a tremendous amount of coverage: &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.google.com/news/story?gl=us&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=watchtower&amp;amp;ncl=d3b6eUxHMn_rN2MEf8eKOkxAmvkjM&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;scoring=d&#34;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;, as it should. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is more to this story than just how it affects Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses. Being an ex-Witness myself, I&amp;#39;ll admit that I have a dog in this fight. But even though this ruling has the potential to affect me in a positive way (by helping more JWs come to realize that their religion is not the &amp;quot;Truth,&amp;quot; at minimum), this is a bigger story than just the Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is, as I understand it, one of the largest monetary awards to have been given to someone who had been abused, at least partially because of a church&amp;#39;s malicious negligence. Is this what starts to help people realize that culpability of the Catholic Church? Does seeing a religious institution held responsible cause people to realize that perhaps religion in general shouldn&amp;#39;t have such a privileged place in society? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope that it&amp;#39;s a step in that direction. And, I hope that this story continues to gain traction. I know of people who have had their eyes open as a result of this story, along with others like it. This one is unique, though, in so many ways, and is a better opportunity than some that have come in the past for some of the reasons I&amp;#39;ve mentioned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that this HUGE group of people within &lt;a href=&#34;/r/atheism&#34;&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt; predominately want to see our society move closer to secularism. I think most of us want to see religion lose it&amp;#39;s position as an unquestionable entity, and it seems to me that we&amp;#39;re seeing that happen, one step at a time. A case like this has the potential to move these efforts forward in a big way. I hope we are able to give it the exposure and attention that it deserves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/Upliftingmofo&#34;&gt; Upliftingmofo &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/&#34;&gt; atheism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v70n7/ratheism_this_is_a_bigger_deal_than_memes_for_the/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v70n7/ratheism_this_is_a_bigger_deal_than_memes_for_the/"&gt;[70 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
