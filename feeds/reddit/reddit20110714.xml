I'm a regular redditor who is currently home alone, in a deserted apartment building, I just need something to keep me busy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2011/07/14/news/doc4e1f5b137b7f2237808506.txt&quot; &gt;http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2011/07/14/news/doc4e1f5b137b7f2237808506.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2011/07/14/news/doc4e1f1eb4c4292459878667.txt?viewmode=fullstory&quot; &gt;http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2011/07/14/news/doc4e1f1eb4c4292459878667.txt?viewmode=fullstory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I just heard a flash grenade or some kind of gunshot, not sure what's going on but something is definitely happening for the first time in hours...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 2: 8 shots total, I think he got mad they were advancing on the building. The cops on my end havent moved, but they were going toward the long side of the building he's in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 3: LOUD gunshots, breaking glass and very loud barking dogs...I have no idea what's going on...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 4: GIGANTIC boom, it sounded only what I can think of as a bomb. Theres tons of glass shattering sounds, and I hear statewide calls being made over the guys radios, but no other noise, not even the dogs anymore. I haven't been afraid for my life until just now, I have no idea what to expect, please pardon if my responses are slow...I don't know what to do right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 5: your responses have been dizzying, theres TONS of movement outside tons of talking and moving things out of vans...I dont know how much longer this is going to be, I just want it to be over like...now. Another cop came to my door and asked if I was taking video, because word was someone was shooting. I said no and disclosed that I was indeed taking still photos, repeating that 10 times so he heard me. He said from now on anyone pointing a lens will be assumed to be shooting video and I'm assuming thats a bad bad thing, so no more new pictures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update 6: my reporter/editor something friend at the trentonian has told me he shot himself in the head, but is alive and was taken from the scene. The cops left behind all their trash and waterbottles, and theres nothing here but city police squad cars. If everyone will pardon me, I REALLY HAVE TO PEE, I'm going to call the non emergency police (as I was instructed very nastily by a plain clothes cop) and request an escort the hundred yards to the main road so someone can come pick me up, hopefully very very soon...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FINAL UPDATE! There is police tape surrounding my parking lot, I'm assuming a car got shot because an officer is taking pictures of one. I just got off the phone with non emergency and I'm getting the hell out of here, via squad car or walking to the Ewing Diner. I'll come back and answer whatever anyone is asking later on, but I really need to get out of here right now. Thanks everyone, except the nasty people that think I would make something like this up. I'm gonna go hug my mom now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I LIED! I can't leave yet so here's an update! Joey Kulkin has been my contact at the trentonian, hes a reporter so Im sure that doesnt qualify as personal info. If anyone really needs proof of this, you can add me on facebook, LastMinuteLily and see the frantic, desperate interaction between me and friends trying to process the events of my day. I know people on Reddit lie for attention, but I'm the exact opposite. I was scared out of my mind and the people I wanted to be on the phone with were at a relatives house, with limited cell phone batteries. You can think this was fake all you want, and if anyone has any idea how I can prove I was the stephanie in the news story, past my facebook and hundreds of posts on there about today, I'll be more than willing to provide it. I was on reddit because I needed silent distractions, incase the police knocked at my door, thats why I wasnt listening to music or watching a movie, I was laying on my living room floor for most of the end, and needed to be paying attention, seeing as the police wouldnt use the doorbell, which is down by the main entrance to my building. To each their own, but in the end I thank the people that took this AMA for what it was, a simple distraction from a very tense situation by a very terrified girl. Thanks, Reddit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit edit edit edit...This has gotten so out of control. Cnet? Really? I wasn't looking for this to explode, and some people are very upset with me for some stupid reason, thinking I'd damn my soul for eternity by faking a story like this. I am leaving this post right now, and I'm not coming back, whoever bought me reddit gold, I really wish you didn't, but I would still like to know who you are. Send me a message. You guys can dissect this for what you will, but I really can't stay here anymore with all of the people thinking I'd make this up, it's just making my situation worse, I was told I won't be able to leave for hours and the fact that I will be alone for the rest of the night isn't helping any. Again, thank you to those of you who saw this for what it was, a distraction from a life shaking event..I didn't expect shit to go the way it did, and I did not expect anyone on here to pay this much attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Ellinika&quot;&gt; Ellinika &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/ipvbd/i_am_currently_holed_up_in_an_apartment_complex/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ipvbd/i_am_currently_holed_up_in_an_apartment_complex/"&gt;[703 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Instead of dressing up as wizards for the Harry Potter premiere, wouldn't it be way funnier to dress up as wizards trying to dress up as muggles?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ipyf2/instead_of_dressing_up_as_wizards_for_the_harry/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ipyf2/instead_of_dressing_up_as_wizards_for_the_harry/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2011 00:29:59 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/holytacoballs&quot;&gt; holytacoballs &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/ipyf2/instead_of_dressing_up_as_wizards_for_the_harry/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ipyf2/instead_of_dressing_up_as_wizards_for_the_harry/"&gt;[154 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>A cab driver in China drove me home for free in exchange for posting a picture of his long-lost daughter on the internet</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iq0s2/a_cab_driver_in_china_drove_me_home_for_free_in/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iq0s2/a_cab_driver_in_china_drove_me_home_for_free_in/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2011 01:57:25 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/7VXMy&quot; &gt;The picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His story: This girl was given up by her father, a cab driver in Quzhou, Zhejiang, China for adoption.

I understand it kind of sucks that they are asking for a little more money for the service, but when you really think about the service that they are providing do you honestly feel ripped off? We are talking about roughly 8 DVDs sent to your home every month and unlimited streaming on tons of movies/tv shows/documentaries etc. for only $16. Does anybody remember what it was like renting movies only 10 years ago? It cost on average about $5 per movie and you had to drive to a store. Now people don't even have to leave their home to get endless amounts of media sent right to them... for only $16 per month. I don't even have cable. I solely use Netflix and am completely satisfied paying $16 per month for their service. Anyone else feel this way? I just can't stop thinking about what Louis CK said: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk&quot; &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I don't work for Netflix and I'm not PR. The point of this post was not to complain about other people complaining, it was to find out more information and hear opinions. The couple of times I've seen posts on other threads it has mainly been against Netflix so I wanted to get another side to it and learn more about what is going on. If you are sick of Netflix posts then I really don't understand why you would want to come to this thread simply to complain about that. I don't spend a ton of time on Reddit and have probably missed a lot of posts. Just because you have maybe seen this side of the story articulated in a different thread doesn't mean that someone else has.
