My parents are very open-minded about it and they were supportive from the beginning. He decided that the best course of action after graduating from high school was to start going to gay clubs every night in suburban Florida and in that crowd he selected the worst of the worst for his friends. He failed out of college, he was kicked out of nursing school on the first day after he tried to cheat on a drug test, and last Christmas I found out he was turning tricks and not using protection, as well as starring in gay porn. He never has sensed the gravity of the situation, or understood the danger he was putting himself in, or the hurt he was causing his family, despite my attempts to communicate it to him. All he cared about was fucking strangers and smoking weed. I told my parents, obviously, and they did everything they could to bring him to his senses, but he fell back into the lifestyle quickly and disappeared for two months with no communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then one day he came back to my hometown and looked like he was on death's door, so my parents called him an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital and tested for HIV. Fast forward two months, it's a week before I visit my hometown with my new girlfriend and he calls me up to tell me. He says the words in the most monotone voice and I ask him to hand the phone to my mom. I go down to Florida anyway, and spend the week I wanted to use to introduce my girl to my parents hand-wringing over my brother. When I visited him, all he could talk about was how it sucked that he couldn't have sex anymore with random strangers and how smoking weed was great for the physical pain. Again, no comprehension of how much he has hurt the people who love him or regret at not listening to us when we told him he was acting like a psychotic teenage manchild (couched in nicer terms, of course). And now my parents have to take care of him for the rest of his life because he's unable to do it on his own, and his HIV treatments (paid for by my mother) cost so much money my family is going into debt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All I can do is feel absolutely disgusted and angry at him. My parents are good people and raised him well, they instructed both of us in sexual safety, and welcomed him with open arms when he told them he was gay. He was never sexually abused as a kid, although in high school he dated a heroin addicted emotionally abusive guy. He is completely self-centered and unaware of the damage he has caused himself and the people who care about him by acting so irresponsibly. But I can't fucking say it to anyone because when a family member has a chronic/terminal disease, you're supposed to be lovey and supportive because they will be gone. I don't feel like being lovey and supportive. I actually hate him, because my family is breaking apart over this and my dad is close to suicidal, and I want to know if you think I'm overreacting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;23/M&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: Of course, I don't plan on telling him this ever. I will put on the supportive face when I have to. But he may live another 20-50 years, and because I feel this way about him and because he is now the rotten center of my parents' lives, it's not possible to talk to them without talking about him. And it makes me rage inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway45831&quot;&gt; throwaway45831 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j99wh/my_brother_has_hiv_and_it_is_his_own_fault_im/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j99wh/my_brother_has_hiv_and_it_is_his_own_fault_im/"&gt;[440 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Celebrities at Comic-Con Sit Down For Quick AMAs</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/j8w3x/celebrities_at_comiccon_sit_down_for_quick_amas/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/j8w3x/celebrities_at_comiccon_sit_down_for_quick_amas/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2011 15:45:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/j8w3x/celebrities_at_comiccon_sit_down_for_quick_amas/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_j8w3x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Celebrities at Comic-Con Sit Down For Quick AMAs&quot; title=&quot;Celebrities at Comic-Con Sit Down For Quick AMAs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/jenakalif&quot;&gt; jenakalif &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/&quot;&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/celebrities-at-comic-con-sit-down-for.html&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/j8w3x/celebrities_at_comiccon_sit_down_for_quick_amas/"&gt;[143 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Celebrities at Comic-Con Sit Down For Quick AMAs</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_j8w3x.png" /></item><item><title>I came here to flip cars and get bitches...</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j9820/i_came_here_to_flip_cars_and_get_bitches/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j9820/i_came_here_to_flip_cars_and_get_bitches/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2011 21:27:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j9820/i_came_here_to_flip_cars_and_get_bitches/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_j9820.png&quot; alt=&quot;I came here to flip cars and get bitches...&quot; title=&quot;I came here to flip cars and get bitches...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/ZeGermanVon&quot;&gt; ZeGermanVon &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/&quot;&gt; pics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/z0tEy.png&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j9820/i_came_here_to_flip_cars_and_get_bitches/"&gt;[142 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>I came here to flip cars and get bitches...</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_j9820.png" /></item><item><title>Am I being unfair or was this mod just damn rude?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j8sk9/am_i_being_unfair_or_was_this_mod_just_damn_rude/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j8sk9/am_i_being_unfair_or_was_this_mod_just_damn_rude/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2011 13:50:58 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I'm reeling a little from my experience with one of the mods from r/favors. I won't name who it was but basically I requested some graphic design assistance for a charity event my girlfriend is organising. She is fundraising for the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) who have pre-designed posters on their website with white space for details. We just need someone to add the text about where our event is being held, what will be happening and other details. We need 2 separate posters because we need to advertise in two very different places. About 7 lines of text roughly on each one, maybe a bit more. The following exchange occurred:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Him: Dude, you're asking for like 6 hours of design work for free. We don't do that here because we value our artists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me: (I actually can't access my reply to him in my messages- does anyone know why? Anyway what I said was it wasn't actually six hours because the posters were pre-defined so I needed no serious graphic design work just someone to arrange the key details in the white space on the poster. I even said it didn't need to look amazing just better than what I can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Him: I read your fucking post. You're asking for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-2 or more posters, &quot;formatted correctly&quot; with half a page of bullshit on them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-2 or more leaflets to match said posters, but need to be different&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IN A WEEK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to fucking Kinko's. You're not doing that, though, because you know they'll charge you $30 to design a fucking business card. This shit? You're not looking for a poster, you're looking for a bloody campaign. IN A WEEK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Respond to this reply in any way and I will ban you. Now go away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then followed up with this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, please don't sulk and appeal to the rest of us mods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a policy we have had since fall last year, and have been enforcing consistently and constantly since then. Free design work is out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is nothing new, nothing unusual, and not up for debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, just to reiterate, I really wasn't asking for anything like what he is suggesting. It would have taken about an hour or two tops for someone to do. Even if noone could do it - and I fully understand if that is their policy - it just came across as so rude and not what I'd really come to expect from reddit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Am I being unfair?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; EDIT: Screenshot available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/i1m8d.png&quot; &gt;http://i.imgur.com/i1m8d.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; EDIT 2: Original post request: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Ih1aj.png&quot; &gt;http://i.imgur.com/Ih1aj.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; EDIT 3: &lt;/strong&gt; If anyone wants to create an alternative to r/favors I'll post it here. I would but I am snowed under at the moment. I would like to see a subreddit where the users vote on what they want accepted rather than the mods. And since some people here don't mind giving an hour or so to help those with graphic design needs, I think we should allow that on the new subreddit as I imagine lots of people could benefit from those who can offer the help. If you can't, or don't feel you should, no problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; EDIT 4: &lt;/strong&gt; I understand where people are coming from when they say some people expect graphic design artists to work for free. I am a copywriter so I know what it's like for people to think what you do takes no time at all. That's why I didn't ask for lots and lots of designing work and specifically said we could use the pre-designed posters as I knew adding text wouldn't take that much time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 5: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/ineedafavor&quot; &gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/ineedafavor&lt;/a&gt; has been created&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 6: &lt;/strong&gt; ytknows (who is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; repeat &lt;strong&gt; NOT &lt;/strong&gt; the moderator responsible) has commented on the issue.

Please do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; send him hate-filled mail. It helps noone at all. I was in two minds about whether to post his name. However, since he has been outed already, and his name is freely available in this thread, I am doing so to prevent other moderators being bombarbed with pretty nasty messages. Again, however, don't message him nasty threats: it does not help. If you can't be polite, don't send messages at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 8: &lt;/strong&gt; Related thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j8u7z/request_identify_the_mod_responsible_for_this_and/&quot; &gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j8u7z/request_identify_the_mod_responsible_for_this_and/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 9: &lt;/strong&gt; Many thanks to everyone who volunteered to help with the posters.

I convinced Senator Karen Peterson to sponsor SB 70 to repeal the LSEA. I’ve organized students, business leaders, scientists, clergy, and teachers in support of a repeal. I’ve spoken at schools and to organizations across my state. I’ve also convinced major science organizations to back the repeal including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest general science organization in the world, with over 10 million members. I’ve also gained the backing of over 40 Nobel Laureate scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve also called out presidential candidate Michele Bachmann for making stuff up. Congresswoman Bachmann has claimed that “there is a controversy over evolution... hundreds and hundreds of scientists, many of them holding Nobel Prizes, believe in intelligent design.” Given my background with Nobel Laureates supporting evolution, I’ve called on the Congresswoman to match my Nobel Laureates with her own.&lt;/p&gt;
