I knocked on their door and asked why they had my trash cans. I had a calm rational conversation with them and they apologized and gave them back. After which I spraypainted my address on them just to be sure it didn't happen again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason I say this is that I feel like I should post an example of the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing to do when someone wrongs you. I have seen people react the wrong way to this type of scenario. For instance, my mother in law's neighborhood is a hotbed of intrigue and vengeance that would make Desperate Housewives look like leave it to beaver. They call child services on each other and make up horrible stories, they sabotage each other's AC units, they even tell their kids to pick on each other. All in the name of escalating their game of revenge step by step.&lt;br/&gt; It even happens here. I see people posting stories of revenge and asking for revenge advice and using the internet hate machine to get revenge on whoever they feel like. And people just gobble it up because they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have an excuse to be an asshole. &quot;It's okay to harass the shit out of this guy! I saw a video of someone throw a dog off a bridge and &lt;em&gt;some guy on the internet&lt;/em&gt; told me this was his phone number! Let's &lt;em&gt;ruin his life&lt;/em&gt;!&quot; &lt;strong&gt;edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt; clarifying this part because some of you missed the point. I'm not saying bad people[tm] shouldn't be punished. I'm saying not everything &lt;em&gt;some guy on the internet&lt;/em&gt; says is true. The person whose life you ruin might not actually be the guy from that youtube video. Doesn't anyone remember when this actually happened?&lt;br/&gt; Sorry if this lecture is a little pedantic, but I feel like some people need to read this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: wow, you all popped my front-page cherry. I don't know what to say, I'm getting all ferklempt. &lt;br/&gt; Side note, it is funny to me how many responses have implied that I'm a stuffshirt boring know-it-all. But given my username and misleading title, I guess I can understand why! That's what I get, I guess. :-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit 2: Some of you want to know what their excuse was. C/P from a below comment:&lt;br/&gt; They own a shop next door and claimed that the employees must have gotten them mixed up with mine somehow. Which still doesn't make total sense because they were &lt;em&gt;across the street&lt;/em&gt;, but whatever. Could've been a windy day or something, and I forgot my sodium pentathol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Manners&quot;&gt; Mr_Manners &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/&quot;&gt; reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/c3rbn/after_trash_day_my_trash_cans_were_missing_the/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/c3rbn/after_trash_day_my_trash_cans_were_missing_the/"&gt;[548 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>...Actually Facebook, no.

Not just doing anything to secure this information, but to SELL it to anyone who ponies up the cash, outright cooperation with law enforcement (WITHOUT a court ordered search warrant) for member's information and Facebook's own EULA policies that state amazing (and scary) things such as the pictures your post on your Facebook page are now OWNED and the PROPERTY of Facebook and can and will be sold to stock imaging companies, paying you ZERO royalties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I honestly can go on and on but I, as well as many others, have just about enough of this crap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Mark Zuckerberg has created an online database of your information, provided by you, claims he owns your information and can make profit from it.

I visited the war market there, where I purchased a dog tag. I thought it would be cool to have a dog tag from Vietnam that was in the war, kind of have my own little piece of history, but the more I thought about it the more I would like to return it to the family or person (if still living) that it belongs too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways here is a scan of the dog tag. &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/csfLa.jpg&quot; &gt;Dog tag&lt;/a&gt; A couple of things that I have questions on that I was wondering if someone could answer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What does the ROM mean down the right side of the tag?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;USMC is obviously United States Marine Corps. What does the UMC mean below it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;On the name does it go First name top, Last name bottom? Or is it the other way around?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a good article about the history of the dog tags over in Vietnam. It's a bit lengthy but in summary it says that the dog tags are real and that they have done tests to confirm their authenticity. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historynet.com/dog-tags-lost-and-found-in-southeast-asia-an-update.htm&quot; &gt;Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also I could be wrong but this is who I think it is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewall-usa.com/info.asp?recid=46337&quot; &gt;page 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vetfriends.com/memorial/honoree.cfm?hindex=85781&quot; &gt; page 2 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure if this is the right guy or not. But now I'm kind of stuck. I'd like to do is check the serial number to the name and make sure that this is the right man. And if it is, I'd like to find a way to return the dog tag to the family. (if there is a way to contact the family please PM me)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help Reddit!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;15:45 EDT edit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From reading your comments. Yes I believe it to be real based on several articles around the internet. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historynet.com/dog-tags-lost-and-found-in-southeast-asia-an-update.htm&quot; &gt;THIS ONE&lt;/a&gt; in particular made a pretty compelling argument. I'd like to presume it is real, unless beyond a reasonable doubt, that it's fake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes my initial assumption was wrong. It was not Gregory J. Scott but rather Gregory R. Scott and there is no record matching Gregory R. Scott being killed in Vietnam. So therefor he still could be alive. MisguidedChild gave me a great resource to see if I can find a match. I'm going to try that route, also a bunch of other links that you guys have submitted as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this solider is still living, I would still like to return it to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Kenadian&quot;&gt; Kenadian &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/c3ovg/could_reddit_help_me_return_a_dog_tag_that_i/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c3ovg/could_reddit_help_me_return_a_dog_tag_that_i/"&gt;[167 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Just got totally Mind-Fucked today at school...

But today I realized that I haven't been truly learning. From year 1 all the way to 11, I have treated school basically as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&quot;Copy down notes, memorize a week before exam, pass&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially in Maths and history. I will intentionally seek out formulas and dates to learn, but I wont really analyze what I am learning. I have recently found myself applying logic to all subjects. In maths for example, I am beginning to question why a formula exists and its purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite previously doing well, I feel like i've wasted those years by not trying to understand what I was learning...Has this happened to anyone else?
