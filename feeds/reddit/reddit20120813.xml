Paul Ryan in Wisconsin&amp;#39;s 1st Congressional District. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To my old redditor friends - THANK YOU!&lt;/strong&gt; Since doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://redd.it/nu501&#34;&gt;my AMA&lt;/a&gt; some 8 months ago, the outpouring of support from the reddit community has been overwhelming. I cannot express how truly grateful I am for each and every one of you. You joined this fight, not because it would be easily won, but because it was the fight Paul Ryan deserved. When others would not, you believed in me and this campaign, and I have been truly humbled by your efforts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of you have reached out in the past 48 hours to inquire about what this means for my campaign. While the enormity of Ryan&amp;#39;s VP nomination and its affect on my Congressional campaign will not be entirely realized for some time - I can definitively tell you this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Ryan is running for reelection to Congress while simultaneously seeking the Vice Presidency.&lt;/strong&gt; Ryan will appear on the top of the ballot as Mitt Romney&amp;#39;s running mate, and again down ballot, opposite of me. Every Democrat at the local, state and federal level will be running against Paul Ryan&amp;#39;s infamous budget this fall. I will share the unique distinction with President Obama and Vice President Biden, as the only other candidate actually appearing on a ballot opposite of Paul Ryan himself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For nearly 14 years Paul Ryan has gone unchecked. He would talk a moderate game in his home district before heading back to Washington D.C. where he has been one of the most radical, most partisan and least effective members in the United States House of Representatives. Ryan will no longer be able to hide from his constituents - they will soon know exactly who Paul Ryan is, and who and what he&amp;#39;s really been fighting for the last 14 years in Congress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This campaign is unprecedented in American political history. The fight is now more important than ever, and I sincerely appreciate your continued support.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please, visit my website, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robzerban.com/&#34;&gt;www.RobZerban.com&lt;/a&gt;, to learn more about me and the campaign. Also, you can follow the campaign on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/RobZerban&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/robzerban&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
