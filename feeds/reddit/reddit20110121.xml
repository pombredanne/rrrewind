Should I sue?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f6ksi/was_i_right_in_calling_this_sexism_and_demanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f6ksi/was_i_right_in_calling_this_sexism_and_demanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 17:24:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize but this is long:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the gym I go to, the treadmills are usually packed at dinnertime (mostly with women) and a line usually forms. I was the only guy in the line and was dazing off in the direction of the treadmills thinking about stuff to do. The supervisor then came over to me and said &quot;Sir, I'm afraid you're going to have to leave this area, you're making the women feel uncomfortable.&quot; I was completely dumbfounded and asked the supervisor what I did and she couldn't answer me. I had been waiting a good 20 minutes for the treadmill and told her if she could not provide a legimate reason then I refuse to leave. She made this pissy face and left. I heard muttering in the line calling me a &quot;pervert&quot; and a &quot;creep&quot;. I'm almost 40 and I have a wife. I go to the gym to workout, not to gaze.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This situation felt so utterly surreal. The manager came over with the supervisor and she told me I had to leave the premises and that the gym &quot;wasn't a place to ogle&quot; even all the women were not so good looking middle aged people. To add insult to injury, she also stated that I should have let all the women behind me go in front of me &quot;like a gentleman&quot;. I immediately asked her for a refund of my gym membership as this was clearly (in my opinion) a case of sexism. She refused even though I wasn't technically allowed to use the gym which was what I paid for. At this point I couldn't stand to even be there anymore and decided to head to the lockers to get my stuff to leave. The manager blocked my path and told me to head out that instant in my shorts and shirt even though my personal belongings were in the locker room. I raised my arms in the air and shouted &quot;I am going to get my belongings from the lockers&quot; and it was only then she stepped aside (everyone was now looking). While I was getting my stuff I turned on my cellphone's recording function and came out changed. The manager went apeshit started calling me a pervert and such (recorded) and then I discretely summarized the entire situation while secretly recording and asking her what exactly did I do wrong. She verbally agreed to the accuracy of my statement without knowing and sidestepped the question and loudly asked if I joined the gym to be a peeping tom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point some of the women were shouting at me and calling me names as well while one guy working one the weights across the room told them to shut it cause they didn't know what they were talking about. I showed her my phone and said this was all being recorded. She went white in the face and tried to snatch it out of hands but I was too quick. As I left the premises a cop car pulled up. I explained the situation but they didn't believe me as the manager gave a whole nother story. I sent my audio recording to myself and then showed them my phone (in case they confiscated it) and when they heard it they just mumbled something and let me go. The supervisor (trying to keep her job) told them I took perverted photos of the women, but none were found so they let me keep my phone. I went home and started crying for the first time in ten years in front of my wife. This was the most humiliating experience I have ever had in my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am seriously considering a lawsuit but I need to know. Was I right in thinking this was sexism and should I sue the gym? Has something similar ever happened to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Thanks for all your support. Police officers came to my home an hour of ago to question me (again). One of the regulars gave the supervisor my name (I chat with a lot of the regulars at the gym when I work out) and they apparently looked through their membership records and phoned the police (they refuse to let this go). The officers were straightforward and told me I was accused of sexual harrassment. Once again I showed them the recording but this time these guys took pity on me. One of them even suggested suing the gym (ha). I know some of you think this is fake, but for me this situation is as real as it gets. The last thing I want is to be branded a pervert in my community. That being said, I contacted my lawyer (who is also a family friend). He agreed that suing was justified but that I shouldn't post the recording or &quot;defame&quot; them before everything is in order. That being said, I can't name the gym until I get the good to go signal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPDATE2: In response to the top question, I don't understand how it works but the cops came and specifically used the words &quot;sexual harassment&quot;. Explains why my lawyer was confused when I told him... The gym is privately owned but recently changed management, which included offering free trials (which is why it was so crowded) and changing the entire staff. I've been going to the same gym for the last 3 years before it changed management 2 months ago. I tried calling the gym and demanding to speak to the owner but apparently he's too busy all the time and can never talk to me. My lawyer said he's going to make the suit official on Monday. I was planning to go to the gym and ask for the owner but once again my lawyer advised against it. I understand how people can see this as a troll-fest. Honestly if I read this, I wouldn't believe it either. It's just a series of incompetence and absurdity that should just not have happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To my wife Sharon (also a Redditor), if you read this I want to thank you for taking care of me that night. I was in shambles and you helped me get back on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/darthkanututu&quot;&gt; darthkanututu &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/f6ksi/was_i_right_in_calling_this_sexism_and_demanding/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f6ksi/was_i_right_in_calling_this_sexism_and_demanding/"&gt;[3279 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>These two guys create a top 40 pop song in 8 hours (including a burger break) to show people the garbage they subject themselves to.
