My younger cousin (14) had questions about sex and condoms and had all the wrong knowledge from what she was telling me. I taught her and told her to be safe and how to be safe if she's considering sex. I also reassured her talking about my sex life and how I'm on birth control and I'm safe and that she should be too. Now her mom (my aunt) absolutely despises me and blames me for her daughter's possible promiscuity. I'm not positive whether she's truly being promiscuous or whether her mom is exaggerating, but that is what my aunt was implying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told me it wasn't my place to tell her daughter these things. She's right, I guess? But she would have had sex without knowing anything about these things! I'm just glad I informed her. But I feel super guilty about it! I also taught my cousin about using tampons and encouraged her to see her doctor about her heavy periods - she doesn't tell her mom these things according to her!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, my aunt is going around telling everyone that I'm a whore who's teaching young girls about my whoreness. She's even told my grandmother all this. Mind you, I'm in a monogamous relationship with the man I lost my virginity to for six years now....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did my aunt find this out? Well, my cousin and I were having our conversation via text. She READS her daughter's text messages. I suppose she has the right to being that she's a minor.

I was injured during a mortar attack on the FOB I was stationed at. My injury was a fractured hip and a torn labrum. My surgery involved a surgical dislocation, labrum repair, breaking and resetting of the femoral head, and 3 screws permanently in my hip. The Army opted out of a full hip replacement because of my age and they felt it unnecessary. During the surgery a nerve that runs past my hip was severed and I lost feeling in the medial part of my left thigh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After months of physical therapy, countless doctors appointments, a handful of nerve tests (involving needles stuck way into me), and being found unfit for duty I was given a 10% rating for my hip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of my limitations are as follows: can not run, jump, jog, walk down stairs without aid, carry more than 20-40 lbs depending on the pain that day, stand on my left leg and maintain balance or have no pain. I can't put on shoes without sitting, I have to sit while I shower 60% of the time, I can no longer stand for more than a half hour without severe pain, I can't cross my left leg over my right. I can't rotate my left foot inward at all. I can't squat and maintain balance. .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason the rating is only 10% according to the legal attorney I just got done seeing while trying to dispute the rating is &quot;Wow these ratings suck, I haven't had a hip patient in here for years but, compared to the rest of the ratings these are the lowest I've seen. They must not have updated the hip ratings the last time they went through the book&quot; me: &quot;So what can I do?&quot; her: &quot;There really isn't anything you can do unless you get a range of motion test and in order to get 30% you have to have &lt;strong&gt;under&lt;/strong&gt; 10 degrees movement in the hip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The magic number of 30% (for those who aren't familiar with it) is the rating you need from the &lt;em&gt;Army&lt;/em&gt; to keep your benefits. Such as Tri-Care for your family, commissary and post exchange use, disabled veteran license plates, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can I get injured &lt;strong&gt;in combat&lt;/strong&gt;, spend over 2 years re-teaching myself to stand, then step, and then walk with crutches/cane/nothing now and end up losing everything. I understand it comes down to what the book says, but if you look into the ratings for hip injuries, they are a joke considering your hip is a &lt;strong&gt;major joint&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm sure I've rambled on and on and on, but I need some help Reddit. I've been in the military over 5 years now and wanted to stay in. I'm stuck doing nothing while I watch it all just vanish, all because I got injured in Iraq. This makes no sense to me, what can I do. I need some help Reddit. You're the last person I have left to turn to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;Injured in Iraq in combat, rating system for my particular injury is out of date, I'm getting way under-rated and I'm going to lose all of my military benefits after serving 5 years and getting injured in combat. Help please.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT1: Wow, thanks for all the replies everyone. I've contacted my local Congressman, and left a voicemail. I'm also contacting DAV and a Patient Advocate in the morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT:2 Reddit, you never cease to amaze me. I want to thank you all again for your support and information you have posted. I don't think I clearly stated what I'm trying to get done - My VA Rating was 40% (10% for the hip and 10% each of 3 small things) This made my Army rating 10% (only the hip was rated). According to the book they go by, that is all I'm eligible for due to the ridiculously low ratings available for hip injuries. I know I can get the VA rating raised once I'm out and all of that stuff. I'm trying to get my army rating raised to at least 30%... Not even for the money but for the fact I want to keep my benefits for myself and my family. I mean come on, I was injured &lt;strong&gt;in combat&lt;/strong&gt;. How can that not count for something?
