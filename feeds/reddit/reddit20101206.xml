Thank you all so much for your help, and all you do as a community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Article TL;DR: George Aldrich has been missing since 11/27 and was last seen at Eric's Bar in Aspen at around 10:30pm. He was then seen boarding a bus and exiting at the Truscott stop (which was not the stop he wanted). He is 5' 9, 140 pounds, shoulder-length wavy brown hair, has a beard, blue eyes, and was wearing a plaid jacket the night he went missing. Please help with any info. Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #1 removed to avoid further conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you all SO incredibly much. I'm just going through all the comments now, but you have no idea how much we all appreciate your help. Words really cannot describe my gratitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update from the family:&lt;/strong&gt; Bloodhounds picked up George's scent. They were able to follow it about 20 minutes down the main road. His scent disappeared around another shuttle stop. Maybe he got on another shuttle or someone picked him up? Police are now looking at a smaller area around Snowmass Commons Village. About a 2 mile radius around that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/ThinkTwice&quot;&gt; ThinkTwice &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/eh37a/family_friend_missing_in_aspen_co_without_many/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eh37a/family_friend_missing_in_aspen_co_without_many/"&gt;[270 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Light passing through objects of certain shapes creates 'lift', much the way air buoys the wings of planes.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/eh9d2/light_passing_through_objects_of_certain_shapes/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/eh9d2/light_passing_through_objects_of_certain_shapes/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 21:57:13 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/bnshv&quot;&gt; bnshv &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/&quot;&gt; science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19818-lightfoil-soars-on-a-stream-of-photons.html&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/eh9d2/light_passing_through_objects_of_certain_shapes/"&gt;[76 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Browsing the &quot;Free Books&quot; at school, was wondering how relevant this really was....</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eh5sr/browsing_the_free_books_at_school_was_wondering/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eh5sr/browsing_the_free_books_at_school_was_wondering/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 19:01:11 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/nyxin&quot;&gt; nyxin &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/&quot;&gt; programming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/2YjPQ.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eh5sr/browsing_the_free_books_at_school_was_wondering/"&gt;[316 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wired's Danger Room Answers Your Top Questions</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/eh2kd/wireds_danger_room_answers_your_top_questions/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/eh2kd/wireds_danger_room_answers_your_top_questions/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 15:53:47 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/dangerroom&quot; &gt;Danger Room&lt;/a&gt; team (Noah Shachtman, Katie Drummond, &amp;amp; Spencer Ackerman) answer your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/drp5e/wireds_danger_room_team_is_doing_a_video_ama_next/&quot; &gt;top questions&lt;/a&gt; about military technology, national security, cyber war and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watch the full interview on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU&quot; &gt;youtube.com/reddit&lt;/a&gt; or go directly to the responses to individual questions below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Danger Room team, also wants to hear what you want them to cover next.

We have all of this fancy technology over there to fight people who plant bombs in the dirt that they trigger with a 10 year old cell phone, and fire unguided RPG's left over from the Soviets, or shipped in from North Korea that brought down a helicopter this week, and they blow up the supply lines at the border crossing in Pakistan.

The same war that the US is having difficulty conducting with all it's technical and military resources and then Pakistan with its limited air lift and CAS capability is expected to provide even better results on its side of the border? When at a time, the Taliban are engaging in talks with Karzai with the active support of the ISAF, why are Pakistani talks with Taliban groups looked down upon? Clearly, Pakistan cannot crush all the various Taliban groups and will have to negotiate with some of them at some point. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=10m31s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tootie&lt;br/&gt; When can I buy a BigDog to carry my groceries? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=13m40s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VivaKnievel&lt;br/&gt; Why was the XM-8 nixed?

Are there any recent, known cyber operations carried out by the United States? Which agencies carried them out and to what purpose (ie. espionage, infrastructure damage, etc.)? For someone interested in this, which would be the best agency / military branch to pursue?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=18m31s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;roland19d&lt;br/&gt; With the exception of your Senior Editor, I don't really see any obvious previous connection/interest in military hardware in the profiles of your writers/contributors. Are you gusy writers cutting teeth on milspec or are you milspec people who just happen to know how to write? If the former, how steep was/is the learning curve? On the topic of cybersecurity/information warfare, one of the greatest sources of confusion for me is determining areas of responsibility between service branches and their associated units. Add in the other DHS agencies and it becomes a nightmare of alphabet soup to try and sort out. Who is supposed to be covering what area? What role does each organization play? Where is the overlap? Could you do an article spelling that stuff out clearly? (This presumes that the agencies/branches know their own roles and where they fit in the US cybersecurity puzzle of course.) &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=21m40s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ieatcerealfordinner&lt;br/&gt; How often does it occur that you learn about new tech/info but are unable to report details about it? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=24m35s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;phantasmagorical&lt;br/&gt; Wired has traditionally been a magazine geared towards technology, computers, and pop culture, but the popularity of Danger Room suggests a growing trend in media moving outside of their traditional markets and into more &quot;niche&quot; categories. One big example is Rolling Stone, a magazine that is geared towards music-lovers, winning National Magazine awards for writing on the first Marine battalions in Iraq and breaking a story that ultimately cost the top commander in Afghanistan his job How do you guys feel about this trend in media right now, where smaller markets are covering and breaking stories outside of their usual sphere of influence? Is that something you intended or anticipated from Danger Room's inception?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=27m35s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;prahu&lt;br/&gt; What is Wired's policy concerning anonymous military sources?

This included decrying the administration's plan to assassinate Anwar al-Awlaki, reporting on Omar Khadr's unjust military commission at Guantanamo Bay, and the denial of habeas corpus rights to non-Afghan detainees held at Bagram. In your new position at non-political Wired, it seems as though the focus has moved towards military technology, tactics, and organization. My question is: is there any pressure from your superiors at Danger Room to avoid writing about issues from a 'liberal' perspective? I ask this as a long-time admirer of your work. -bigbopalop&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUaTewhjKU#t=31m20s&quot; &gt;Watch Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/hueypriest&quot;&gt; hueypriest &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/&quot;&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/eh2kd/wireds_danger_room_answers_your_top_questions/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/eh2kd/wireds_danger_room_answers_your_top_questions/"&gt;[65 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Man Creates Working Star Trek Door</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ehb3m/man_creates_working_star_trek_door/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ehb3m/man_creates_working_star_trek_door/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 23:34:30 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/F0REM4N&quot;&gt; F0REM4N &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/&quot;&gt; science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVtB2Lrd1vg&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ehb3m/man_creates_working_star_trek_door/"&gt;[85 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Serious question: Are there any good alternatives to reddit?

Every thread seems to be dominated by puns these days. And they're usually not even clever. Almost any link I post is immediately downvoted. I could post that I found a cure for cancer and it would get downvoted into oblivion. It just seems like the place is dominated by middle school trolls, and it's really lost its appeal to me. I can deal with differing opinions. But I just can't take all the childish bullshit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my question is, are there any alternatives?
