My first week of driving in service I drove a route that passed a methadone clinic. One lovely gentleman was kind enough to get on, pay his fare, sit down, take his entire weekend dose, and promptly pissed himself like a racehorse wearing pants. It ran down the isle at the first stop I made, flowed down the steps and out the door. Welcome to Metro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since I know this is going to be asked... &lt;strong&gt; Uncle Sal's Guide to catching a bus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov&quot; &gt;Trip Planner&lt;/a&gt; Most major agencies have something like this.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track your bus:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; a) If you have a smart phone download &lt;a href=&quot;http://onebusaway.org&quot; &gt;OneBusAway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; b) If you don't call 206-456-0609 or text &quot;onebus [stop_number_here]&quot; to 41411.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go to the bus stop, stand within &lt;strong&gt; 10 feet &lt;/strong&gt; of the sign, with any bags or boxes you have in front of you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get your fare out and unfolded in your hand. Face toward the direction the bus is coming from.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;When you see a bus;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; a) Human eyes are set up to detect motion: Don't just stand there, move around a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; b) Make and maintain eye contact with the driver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; c) Wave vertically (&quot;HI&quot;) if you want the bus, maintain eye contact and move toward the sign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; d) Wave off (Horizontally, like you are wiping a table) if you don't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get on the bus, smile, and pay your fare:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;a) If you are leaving downtown and it is between 6am and 7pm, pay as you leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b) Otherwise, pay as you enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park your butt on a seat and pull the cord two blocks from your stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Say &quot;Thank You&quot; when you leave. I do notice and do appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Examples of what NOT to do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;DON'T turn your back to the bus if you want it, this is a sign that will get you passed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DON'T wander around kinda by the bus stop. I can't tell if you are out for a walk or if you want me. Especially if your back is turned to me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DON'T wave like you want me, then walk away.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DON'T leave any bodily fluids or items on the bus.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that out of the way: Feel free to AMA. I've got to go play in traffic later this afternoon, but will try to answer on breaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Time to go play in traffic.

Sometimes it seems like even when you try to go the extra mile and help someone out you just get shit on for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple months ago though, my heart really went out to this older lady client. She was having trouble communicating, she explained that she recently suffered 2 strokes and was having difficulty with writing and letters, and finding the right words. The reason she was in to see us was because her netbook that her daughter had bought her a month ago showed no signs of power. After confirming this, that it wasn't the battery or adapter, or something that just needed to be reseated, I explained that she had a manufacturers warranty that would cover repair and that we would need to send it out to get fixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She started to get teary eyed (not angry), she said that was okay but she was sad because that was the only way she got to see her daughter and son-in-law as he was deployed and she was stationed in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking, 'She only had this a a month and it's only a little out of the exchange policy and she obviously is having a hard time, I'll see what I can do.' Ended up that I exchanged it for her, spent a little longer setting it up since she was having so much trouble with language. She had a paper that someone had written out her usernames and passwords for everything trying to help her so I entered them in to all the sites she frequents and saved them so it could be as easy as possible for her and downloaded skype. She was really grateful, and left happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I'm working in the back and one of my coworkers says that someone is here to see me specifically. I automatically get scared, because this is hardly ever a good thing. I brace myself, walk out, and it's the lady. She's holding a teddy bear with a hula skirt on it and a card. She says that what I did meant so much to her and her family that she called our corporate office and told them what I did, and that her daughter sent up the card and bear as a thank you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR I took care of someone who needed help with her computer and she brought me a teddy bear. Not everyone takes advantage when you offer good customer service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you everyone for the support and your stories, it is truly refreshing to hear about the good things that come to us. I also want to say that I'm a lady technician :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's a link for a picture- &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/WJXSo.jpg&quot; &gt;http://i.imgur.com/WJXSo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; (sorry it's sideways, I'm in a hurry to get to an appointment)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: last edit.

I also learned that my father was adopted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;None of these things changed the way I view my parents. I did find it slightly overwhelming, as this was all dumped on me in a 2 day period. My family is very open. To the point of embarrassment on most occasions.
