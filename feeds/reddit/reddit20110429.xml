&gt;AMA&lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was 19 I got my girlfriend pregnant. We were engaged a few months later, and broke up when my daughter was 5 months old. I was only waiting tables and putting myself through college at the time so I had no real source of income or support for my child. I subsequently joined the Air Force as a 3C0X2 (Communications Computer Systems Programmer) and left for basic when she was 10 months old. While in the Air Force my ex let me have minimal phone contact with my daughter. The only reason she even knew who I was is that my ex would use my parents as baby sitters so she could go out and party and my Mom would constantly show her pictures of me and talk about me. A couple years later I accidentally broke 1 knee and fractured the other slipping on some ice on my way to work. I ended up receiving a medical discharged because I couldn't properly run and pass my physicals after that. I landed a nice software dev job back home. Upon coming back home I learned my ex was heavily into drugs (meth) and I took her to court for custody of my daughter. I was temporarily granted full custody pending a court hearing because of the danger to my daughter involved. After hiring a PI and catching my ex doing/buying drugs as well as lying to the judge, I was granted full custody. My ex was awarded supervised (by her mother, my daughters grandma) visitation every other weekend. We caught my ex's mother just dropping my daughter off and leaving. This was just a few weeks after court. Her visitation was revoked and for all intents and purposes she has basically disappeared. She doesn't call on holidays or birthdays, and in fact only tries to call like twice a year, if that. She is also over 20,000$ behind in child support and is also awaiting trial on several felony drug charges and just got out of a stint in prison due to failure to show and failure to obey her probation rules. I am lucky I make good money and did not need to worry about the child support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After being a single father for a couple years, I met a wonderful woman (yay internet!). We were married about 3.5 years ago and she is Mommy to my little angel. They are great together! Daddy has taken a back seat now hahaha =) My daughter turned 8 last Nov and her life is looking brighter every day!!! She is incredibly intelligent and there aren't any after effects of being removed from her mother or any potential exposure to drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDL: My ex was a meth addict and I received full custody because of it, after which my ex disappeared. I was a single Dad for a couple years and am now married to a woman who is a great Mommy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AMA! =)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: If anyone has any suggestions about how to verify myself &quot;Confirmed True&quot; I'd love to hear em :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT2: When I get home today I will take a pic of my daughter and I and I will send a link to a court doc to a mod to verify :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/TuhMuffinMan&quot;&gt; TuhMuffinMan &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/h0dd5/iama_man_who_received_100_custody_of_his_young/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/h0dd5/iama_man_who_received_100_custody_of_his_young/"&gt;[205 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Just got rejected from med school.

TL;DR at the end I promise. Pardon me if I ramble a bit. This is one of the hardest things I've ever done. Also, I'm sending a message to the mods to provide proof.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm writing this today because based on my testimony; I was able to liberate my last sibling from her custody. I thought I had put all of this behind me years ago and I thought I was generally ok. After having to lay out all the details to a stranger today, it turns out I'm not. It brought back a lot of shit and I'm hoping sharing this can drive it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, from the beginning then? I'm going to refer to that &quot;individual&quot; as crazy lady from here on out. She lost all rights to the term &quot;mother&quot;. As far back as I can remember, crazy lady has been physically abusive to her children. Being the oldest, I took the worst but certainly not all of it. I don't mean the kind of abuse where someone got a little carried away with a paddle or got a little slappy. I mean abuse as in throwing your 5 year old child to the ground, kicking him in the ribs repeatedly and then slamming his face into the floor until you saw blood. As we got older, she got more inventive. At least with me. She got very good at making up stories, coaching us on what to say and hiding the worst bruises. At some point a switch flipped and these went from just beatings to bat shit crazy tirades and torture. She started stripping me naked in front of my sisters and then beating me. She began telling me that all men rape women, that they don't have relationships or sex with men. Men trick them and rape them. All men. I was 9 when she started doing this. it continued until I was about 13 and started to fight back. At that point, she just got her husband (step father #2) to take her place. At least all he ever did was hit me. Part of me understands why he did. You can only take so much of her before you snap. And he had to take her shit constantly. How her kids didn't respect her because of him blah blah. It was his way of making us respect her I guess? As far as I can remember, he never put a hand on my sisters. He did scare the shit out of them though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's weird how kids work. No matter how badly she beat us, an apology one hour later made it all disappear. Like it never happened. We'd defend her to social workers, deny any kind of wrong doing on her part, we'd flat out lie when asked. And I never once thought of it as lying. Not once. I have no explanation for that at all. At one point I was getting stitches and I could tell the doctor wasn't buying the &quot;I fell&quot; excuse. But I stuck to it and didn't even for once think about telling the truth. Again I didn't see myself as lying. And I forgave her like it was just normal. Like this is how you raise kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we got older, she spiraled more and more intro crazy. Everything was demonic (she was a die hard Baptist). Everyone was out to get her. She was being stalked constantly, harassed, threatened etc. Everyone was out to rape her and her children. And no she was never sexually abused by anyone ever. She likes to claim she was by her entire family but it's bullshit. She had a privileged upbringing. We were all plotting against her in some convoluted scheme that made about as much sense as Sarah Palin's last speech. Shortly after I turned 18 (about 4 months after), she accused me of sodomizing my then 4 year old sister. I was at a complete and utter loss for understanding. The person I was supposed to be able to trust the most in the world just betrayed not only me but my very manhood. I was sent off to live with my step dad (he had managed to get custody of one of my sister's a few years prior to this as well). I also got a lesson in &quot;justice&quot; and what it's like to be accused of sexually abusing a child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I didn't think it was going to go anywhere (and I was glad to be out of her control in a stable environment). That all changed when I was charged. I then learned that there was physical evidence (tears and bruising. She actually sodomized my sister with an object to cause this. To this day it kills me inside. Had I just moved out when I was 18, she never would have done that to my sister) and that the crazy lady was claiming she witnessed it. Like I said, she had perfected the art of coaching her kids to say anything she wanted so she was also able to convince my sister to say I did it. I was interrogated for hours. The cops kept saying over and over that they knew I did it, that I was lying, that I should just admit it. I denied it of course. Even when they tried some &quot;let's say hypothetically this happened&quot; game. Like &quot;what if she sat on your lap while you had an erection&quot;. I'd say &quot;well I'd take her OFF my lap&quot;. They immediately responded with &quot;And then what did you do?&quot;. Nothing, that NEVER happened. They kept trying to trip me up with this until I didn't know if I was coming or going. In the end they sent me on my way and made up a fake &quot;statement&quot; that really wasn't all that condemning. They would later claim in court that they lacked the funds for a tape recorder so they couldn't record the conversation. This was the mid to late 90's. Tape recorders were $20.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't begin to describe to you what it's like to be accused of something like this. Having no self esteem already from years of abuse, I thought no one believed me. I looked at my own family and believed that they thought I was guilty. Even though they were fighting for me and doing everything they could to prove I was innocent, I thought I saw a judgment in their eyes that was never there. There was a point where I had no contact with anyone for about 4 years because I thought deep down they believed I was guilty. That I could do something like that. As for the courts, I was facing two charges that carried 20 to life each in a state that had NO parole. I had to convince 12 people that not only could a mother make up such a story about her own such, but that she could also sodomize her own daughter to create evidence. And she was very convincing. Thankfully, two days before the trial was to start, she accused her husband of raping her. The DA, instead of dropping the charges against me, offered a deal. I could plead &quot;Alford&quot; guilty (Maintaining my innocence but saying the state had enough evidence to convict me) to a misdemeanor assault and battery, get counseling (I'll go into that below), serve a year of probation and see no jail time. I took the deal. I was 18, I knew I would die in jail within a month and I knew it would be tough to sell a jury on the truth. That was the last I saw of her for 10+ years (not going to be exact for obvious reasons).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My sister and I (the victim in the trial) have a good relationship today. I had to wait until she was 18 (she moved out the very hour she turned 18) to really see her again. She knows that I don’t blame her for anything. None of it is her fault. It does kill me to see her struggle with a lot of the same issues I struggle with. That I couldn’t be there to be her big brother. We had one last sister that she retained custody over. We all tried over and over to get her removed but anytime social services would start to catch on, crazy lady would move to a new county and we’d have to start all over. Well, she finally got sloppy and left marks. My sister went to the police right away and she was removed that day. Today, I spoke with social services and gave them everything. I thought it would be easy. Like “I’m over this”. As soon as I got off the phone I lost it. On the plus side, they’re filing a protective order against the crazy lady and the eldest of my sisters is getting custody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Don’t do PCP. If you do, don’t have kids.

For half a mile nearly everything is gone, but somehow his place is still standing. Yesterday, we walked about a mile down 15th to go and pack up some clothes from his place....it's really hard to put into words what we saw. He returned to his apartment less than an hour after the tornado so I am hoping he will come on here to share what he saw immediately after. The stories are haunting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The street was unrecognizable as were what used to be dozens of restaurants, shops, business, and homes...all just ruble. Water is contaminated because 2 towers were hit along with a water treatment facility. It is utter chaos right now and people really need help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, If your able please help.
