I am an 18 year old girl, just graduated high school in June. I have had battles in my earlier teens with depression but have since over come them and I am now one of the more positive people you will ever meet. I am really big into music and art and I am still looking at pursuing a career in graphic design. But yeah heres the story. (This happened in november but its still really hard to even write about so please don't get too bent out of shape for spelling or gramatical errors.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had a very good life, parents who have always supported me in anything I ever wished to do, some close friends and a love able 6 year old sister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a friday night in early november my parents went out to go to some office party and the next time I saw them was in coffins a couple weeks later. That night was as normal as any, I think I was just at home playing xbox and probably actually browsing reddit on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got a phone call at around midnight, I was told what happened to my parents. The feeling I got is almost indescribable. I was completely lost and overwhelmed in sorrow, anxiety, pressure, etc. It really felt like the room was getting smaller and crushing me. I blacked out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dont think I even said anything to whoever was on the phone before blacking out. But when I woke up at about 2 am I had a couple seconds of calmness before I remembered why I woke up lying on my kitchen floor, then it all came flooding back and I stumbled to the bathroom and threw up while sobbing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to collect myself and i did eventually calm down a little at about 5 am. The next gut wrenching, crippling thought I had was that I was going to have to tell my little 6 year old sister why mom and dad were not home yet. I actually thought about lying to her and saying they decided to spend the night at a friends or something. But I knew what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I went up to her room where she was sleeping like an angel, I crawled onto the bed and cuddled up with her, I couldn't take my sight away from her face. Her calm sleeping face made me feel like everything was going to be okay. And you know what? Looking back on this I think i was right to feel that way. But anyways I told her what I was told later when she woke up, I could see her heartbreak all over her face and body. It was the most horrible thing I have ever done or had to witness in my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn't get much sleep at all for about the first month and when i did drift away I would have horrible, horrible dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then though things have gotten progressively better and right now I am pretty comfortable with my situation. There is always a dull pain in me but I cope. I miss them everyday, every second of my life and I will never forget all they did for us. I feel like they still live on through me and my sister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But yeah ask me anything, don't worry about my feelings. I think the more difficult it is to talk about the better because I feel like ive kind of been bottling my emotions up lately. Thanks for everyone who read through this novel :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Please everyone for the love of whatever you believe in, do not take your parents for granted. They love you, please love them back. You never know when the last time you see them will be as sad as that is. Sure you might get in arguements and fights but always make sure they know you love them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: sorry for the delay in some responses, I had to go out for a few minutes. Im back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Jeez I didnt expect this. The one time I make it to the front page and its a throw away account, go figure :P But thank you guys SOOO MUCH, seriously you are all making me feel so much better about everything. I honestly feel so great right now that so many people care. I apologize if it takes some time to answer all the questions, theres a lot to go through!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Sorry guys I gotta stop for awhile. But keep sending those questions ill answer them either later tonight or tomorrow after work! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. Its mind boggling.

Most of these kinds of AmAs don't even get any questions! What are we supposed to ask someone who snowboarded on LSD besides &quot;dude, what was it like?&quot; It's great that people want to share their stories, but that cool thing that happened to you doesn't warrant an entire AmA. You can submit it to /r/reddit.com or /r/funny or whatever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lots of these posts are also asking for advice, which seems to be the opposite of what /r/IAmA is for. I know lots of these are very serious situations where people really do need someone to talk to or some advice, but this just isn't the right place for it. We do have a subreddit called /r/advice just for these kinds of situations. It's tragic and very depressing that an 18 year old went to have an abortion, but the support she needs isn't coming from people asking random questions about her life. Nobody even asked her anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/noweezernoworld&quot;&gt; noweezernoworld &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fsl6s/a_question_on_how_were_running_this_community/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fsl6s/a_question_on_how_were_running_this_community/"&gt;[337 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIL Bill Clinton used to have a beard.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/fstqf/til_bill_clinton_used_to_have_a_beard/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/fstqf/til_bill_clinton_used_to_have_a_beard/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2011 21:57:28 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/fstqf/til_bill_clinton_used_to_have_a_beard/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fstqf.png&quot; alt=&quot;TIL Bill Clinton used to have a beard.&quot; title=&quot;TIL Bill Clinton used to have a beard.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/johanneshint&quot;&gt; johanneshint &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/&quot;&gt; todayilearned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisisnotporn.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Bill-Clinton-and-Hillary-Clinton.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/fstqf/til_bill_clinton_used_to_have_a_beard/"&gt;[96 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>TIL Bill Clinton used to have a beard.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fstqf.png" /></item><item><title>Yeah you won.
