I've got nothing better to on easter (forever alone) so I figured, why the hell not, it's been kind of interesting, if totally pointless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So to recap the original thread above, I tend to organize thus:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Front Right: Phone &lt;br/&gt; Front Left: Keys/Pens/Headphones &lt;br/&gt; Back Right: Empty/Wallet&lt;br/&gt; Back Left: Empty/Wallet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(I switch back pockets because sitting on my wallet gets pretty uncomfortable.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do also have a few pairs of non-jean (?) pants with cargo pockets on the side, in which case I usually put my phone there and then split up my keys and pens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how do you organize your must-have items, Reddit?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: unintentionally helped spark a comment thread, figured I'd make it a thread proper because I have nothing else to do today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Holy shit, this blew up.

I quit doing it a couple of years ago. I did it for about 5 or 6 years. It was easy for me because I am barely five feet tall and I look like a sweet, innocent girl. I do have regrets about it now, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit- tons of questions! I'll try to answer them all, and I'm sorry if I accidentally skip yours. I'll go back after I'm done and double check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another thought- if you're here just to say &quot;Fuck you, you're awful&quot; just go upvote one of the 2 billion comments that already say that in this thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/piperpickedapocket&quot;&gt; piperpickedapocket &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/gwl0i/i_was_a_pickpocket_ama/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gwl0i/i_was_a_pickpocket_ama/"&gt;[886 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIL that I can trade games with Redditors!

I emerged stronger in my identity.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gwala/iama_20_year_old_gay_male_who_was_coerced_into/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gwala/iama_20_year_old_gay_male_who_was_coerced_into/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2011 13:48:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 14, I was coerced by a psychiatrist to come out to my mother, against my will. I faced immediate disapproval and spent years in a downward spiral of ex-gay therapy and denial of my identity. After my freshman year of college, I finally came to my senses and accepted my one and true identity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This post was at the request of a handful of Redditors who were interested in hearing positive/horror stories from someone who had been through this type of therapy. So for those who have made comments asking why this IAmA was created, I felt compelled to share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The psychiatrist was a renowned and respected mental health professional at a behavioral outpatient program for adolescents. I have been told by even some of the most moralistic mental health professionals that his ultimatum of &quot;outing&quot; me to my mother was what caused the most damage, and he wasn't even a Christian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most questions pertain to religion, interestingly enough. I am a very spiritual person. I chose to walk away from Christianity because of it's claims about my identity, but I attend a Christian college in the Midwest and still value some of the spiritual virtues of the faith. I know many of those who have commented are Atheist, and power to my Atheist brothers and sisters. The Atheists in my life have always been very supportive. To those who have asked about my theological beliefs, I do have belief in higher power. If I had to classify myself as anything, I would call myself a Hicksite Quaker - peace, anti-war, spiritual pluralism, and a concern for the rights of every human, including those Redditors who are homophobic and awfully rude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, the therapy is UTTER tomfoolery. I was introduced to Cross Ministries out of Raleigh, NC, Exodus International (the most infamous), and was told that I needed to read materials. Most of the adult men I was introduced to by my youth pastor and mother claimed that they had been healed, and that they decided that this &quot;was not the lifestyle for them.&quot; They never denied that they had &quot;temptations&quot; from time to time, but they certainly denied having any doubts about trying to be with a woman. The interesting thing about it, most, or all, of them had chosen horrible paths as gay men (drugs, unprotected sex, etc.) and thus would make anyone unhappy. This is not the path I have chosen. As to questions about techniques, there are none. Ex-gay refers to the more Christian aspects of the opposition to gay rights, etc. Reparative therapy is the more &quot;scientistic,&quot; as we call it (because it mocks concrete science as a virus), therapy which applies &quot;techniques.&quot; My experience with reparative counselors was strange. Most of them focused solely on the issues that I had with my father, which they believe is the cause of homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my mother is now a staunch ADVOCATE! Yay! She started attending an open and affirming UCC church and has repeatedly asked for my forgiveness for her mistakes. She's my hero, and I can't wait to walk her down the aisle - once I'm legally allowed to marry. My father, well, that's another story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And no, I have never had sex with a woman. Although my guy friends (who are straight) have told me that I should try it at least once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am now a junior at a Christian liberal arts university in the Midwest, although no longer Christian, studying Psychology and Political Science. I have started a group on my campus, with much unexpected support, known as Safe Space. We provide a loving, affirming, and accepting space for students who identify as LGBTQ and their straight allies to come and discuss issues like these!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**As a sidenote, the bullshit I've put up with for roughly 10 years makes your silly, ignorant, anti-gay trolling comments quite humorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
