Let's make it so!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;To those who may say this change can't be made; that the symbiotic relationship between government and corporations is just the way it is and can't be changed, I say: the symbiotic relationship between religion and government was &quot;just the way it was&quot; since time immemorial until the American founders changed things. We can do the same.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Forget my previously proposed amendment (&quot;Congress shall make no law designed to support or prohibit the activities of specific business entities or industries&quot;) -- it was confusing the issue. Let me be clear: the intent of this proposal is to prevent corporations from currying favor with government.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For those saying an amendment such as this would allow corporations to have free reign and do whatever they wish: no, you misunderstand the intent. This amendment would bar congress from passing laws aimed at &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; companies and industries. Illegal activities (such as polluting, vandalism, larceny, etc) would obviously still be illegal and enforceable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent question from anorexia_is_PHAT: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you propose for specific industries? If you make a blanket law that all companies must be regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, obviously most companies wouldn't need it. So either every company has to submit unneccessary paperwork to every single regulatory agency in existence, or the language of every regulatory agency's regulations has to have a bunch of ifs or cases to exclude companies that it obviously has no business regulating. Both of these would be messy and time-wasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; The short answer is: such an amendment to the constitution would in no way prevent the government from regulating potentially dangerous or harmful activities -- it would simply prevent the government from artificially propping up or unfairly persecuting specific businesses. For example, nuclear reactors are really dangerous and if you want to operate one you should have to jump through special hoops to do so. This would be true whether you're a corporation, non-profit organization, church or individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pstryder says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment that will solve the problem is an amendment specifically worded to deny corporate personhood. Something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Only real, human persons are guaranteed these rights; these rights do not automatically apply to legal entities such as corporations, trusts, or any legal entity that is not a singular, real human person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fswmacguy suggests: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No representative shall be influenced by the interests of corporate power, and shall not receive unnecessary personal funding, under penalty of investigation, suspension, and indictment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; I applaud the sentiment, but &quot;no representative shall be influenced&quot; seems hard to quantify and enforce. This is a good start, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ColonelPanix says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with you, 100%. I'd also add a constitutional provision that no government, Federal, state or local, can ever be a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Good point. NotTheDude, rational1212 and Dragonshadow also pointed out the fact that our various governments and parties have themselves become corporate entities. Does this give anyone else a chilling feeling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Several folks have taken issue with use of the term &quot;Corporation&quot; and a focus on corporate personhood. Many valid points have been made and perhaps (as suggested by zylogz80) the focus should be on &quot;Separation of Commerce and State&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;To up the idealism ante, jakepin says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... I think we should propose an additional but supplemental amendment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Representatives of the People, duly elected to serve in the Legislature or the Presidency, shall give up all rights to personal property in perpetuity, for as long as they shall live. They shall be provided domicile and sustenance by the United States but shall possess no property nor monies of their own, thereby freeing them to govern the affairs of Commerce in an unbiased manner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having elected officials capable of participating in the free market they regulate/protect is like allowing football referees to bet on the games they officiate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; I don't completely agree with it, but it's a fascinating suggestion. I do like the idea of a congress populated by leaders dedicated 100% to serving the people. That is, dedicated to the idea of a representative being a servant of the people, not a power broker well-positioned to fatten their own pockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/rsbrown&quot;&gt; rsbrown &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; politics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/eibqx/the_bill_of_rights_gave_us_the_separation_of/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eibqx/the_bill_of_rights_gave_us_the_separation_of/"&gt;[1118 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>WikiLeaks cables: Shell boasts it has infiltrated Nigerian government</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eij37/wikileaks_cables_shell_boasts_it_has_infiltrated/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eij37/wikileaks_cables_shell_boasts_it_has_infiltrated/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2010 21:44:21 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/zalmoxes&quot;&gt; zalmoxes &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eij37/wikileaks_cables_shell_boasts_it_has_infiltrated/"&gt;[194 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>US takes break from attacking wikileaks to announce world press freedom day.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eia6l/us_takes_break_from_attacking_wikileaks_to/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eia6l/us_takes_break_from_attacking_wikileaks_to/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2010 14:06:56 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/peter_riviera&quot;&gt; peter_riviera &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/&quot;&gt; WTF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wonkette.com/431902/u-s-state-department-hilariously-announces-world-press-freedom-day&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eia6l/us_takes_break_from_attacking_wikileaks_to/"&gt;[688 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>A table that should exist in all projects with a database</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eie3z/a_table_that_should_exist_in_all_projects_with_a/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eie3z/a_table_that_should_exist_in_all_projects_with_a/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2010 17:40:06 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/cherouvim&quot;&gt; cherouvim &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/&quot;&gt; programming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cherouvim.com/a-table-that-should-exist-in-all-projects-with-a-database/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eie3z/a_table_that_should_exist_in_all_projects_with_a/"&gt;[200 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why is there a &quot;gay&quot; accent?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/einy8/why_is_there_a_gay_accent/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/einy8/why_is_there_a_gay_accent/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 02:13:54 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not asking this in an offensive, way, I'm just curious.

Me and a few friends quit because some things that were going on were making us uncomfortable, and overall it was just heading in a direction we didn't like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, once we quit, they should've left us alone, right? Wrong. We just got ahold of an email a brother sent out with a plan to blackmail us for 'selling drugs' to make sure we didn't tell the school about the fraternity's actions. To be clear, we don't do drugs, nor have we ever sold them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only logical response we saw to that was to meet with the head of greek life on campus and get ahead of the potential issues. We met, explained the message we saw, the blackmail/slander, and more. We explained how our rooms had been broken into and vandalized (&quot;Faggot&quot; spraypainted on wall, holes punched in walls in penis shape), how they lost a book full of SSN#s and other information of all former brothers, how they underground pledged people to avoid having to pay their fraternity fees or insurance fees, and a few other things. We explained our fears of more retaliation, and how their actions were putting people in danger (vandalism, blackmail, no insurance, ssn#s). The head seemed to agree with us, and said it would be figured out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that day, however, it seems she met with a few members of the fraternity, told them what we said, and said that as head of greek life, her job was to protect the greeks, not the non-greeks. She would protect them from what we told her, they don't need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, a representative from nationals called the fraternity and said he heard about it all; he will protect them. If we even try to meet with someone and make allegations of hazing, he will show up and &quot;stop it.&quot; We don't know what that means, because he isn't even here so he doesn't know what the fraternity does, but he also assured them they will be fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: heading to night class for 4 hours. be back to answer more questions after that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So WTF reddit?! We don't even know what all of this means. Anyone able to explain why they're able to do this, or what we can do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/DontTrustDeans&quot;&gt; DontTrustDeans &lt;/a&gt;
