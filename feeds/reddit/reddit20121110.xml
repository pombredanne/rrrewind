And no, I have no clue what that means. At one point he said that &amp;quot;she did more for Slovakia than the entire cabinet.&amp;quot; She had no political training. She was an opera singer, and an alcoholic suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It&amp;#39;s on record that she told reporters that she expected me to become the prime minister of Slovakia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was born 1991 in Bratislava, Slovakia. I grew up in what amounted to complete hermetic isolation in mansions and hotels. My parents were barely present and I was raised by staff, babysitters and bodyguards. I was so emotionally neglected that my first spoken word was &amp;quot;auto&amp;quot; instead of mom or dad. I barely have memories of spending time with my parents outside of being dragged to political events in little tuxedos and Christmas. Completely alienated from the world around me, I sought refuge on the internet starting at the age of 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, the trouble began when I was around 7 years old. There was increased pressure to become secretive, and I realized that there was something wrong about the fact that I was never allowed to go anywhere without two tall and heavily armed men following me around. My father was wary of everyone, including my classmates. Nobody was allowed at my house, and I was not allowed to go anywhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remember my greatest accomplishment of &amp;#39;freedom&amp;#39;, which was when I was actually allowed to go outside and only had to go with ONE bodyguard to pick up a Big Mac. I was forbidden to go outside due to continued threats on our lives, which included dead animals being mailed to our house. At one point I witnessed a carbomb being defused from a car that they falsely assumed was ours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around this time, my father began to exhibit signs of poisoning and had to be hospitalized. The diagnosis was heavy metal poisoning, possibly infused into his food or drinking water. Thankfully he recovered. There were numerous scares about snipers, and I was told to keep away from windows anywhere else except our house (because ours were custom built and bulletproof, as was our main car).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year later we had to leave Slovakia in the middle of the night, staying in a hotel in Austria for several weeks. Why we had to move was unclear to me at this time. I was not frightened, but confused. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what was going on, so I had no reason to be scared. Apparently Austria had granted my father asylum for the charges he faced. It took a decade of expensive and difficult legal proceedings to finally clear his name and get the government to admit that the charges were fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mom began acting increasingly irrational. She locked herself out of her car multiple times, burst into tears randomly for no reason, and threw away jewelery and clothing in excess of $5000. One time she put a $10,000+ opera dress into the donation bin. Some homeless person must be looking quite snazzy by now. Humor: an easy way to cope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One night in October 2000, when I was 9 years old, my mother burst into my room while I was sleeping. &amp;quot;DIE!&amp;quot; She screamed at the top of her lungs. The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was her wielding a large kitchen knife above her head and her cross necklace swaying as she ran towards my bed. She tore the blanket off me and began stabbing me in the chest repeatedly. I tried to defend myself with my hands and severed a finger in the process. There was blood everywhere. The walls and the bed were painted crimson, and it trickled onto the carpet. I felt serene and stoned off endorphines. Everything was blurry and dreamlike. It didn&amp;#39;t seem like any of this was actually happening to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father heard me scream for my life, ran downstairs (they were sleeping in separate rooms), and threw her down the stairs before calling the ambulance and the police. According to news reports, she then stabbed herself in the stomach and jumped out of the first floor balcony, breaking several ribs. My last memory of this night was passing out on a gurney while the EMTs talked at me in German. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily they managed to save my finger. I spent 6 months bedridden in a hospital. I had to relearn how to walk because she had damaged my spine. The knife went all the way through my body, and there are scars on both my front and back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When reporters asked me how I felt, I said I was upset that my body was damaged and that I wished to murder my mother with a brick if she was ever released. My mom survived the jump and stabbing herself in the stomach and was put into a high security mental hospital. She was there for a year. During that time her sister tried to steal from us, and our housekeeper had to kick her out, literally throwing her suitcases on the street. My dad started taking sleeping pills because he had nightmares. Around this time he began sleeping with my former nanny. My aunt decided it would be a good idea to tell my mom about this affair, and my mom hanged herself with a bathrobe in the hospital. She didn&amp;#39;t survive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad later married the nanny, and now they have a daughter. My stepmom has completed her law degree and now has a prominent law firm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every school I went to, this story followed me. Even though I WAS THE VICTIM, they were afraid of me and I was expelled for &amp;#39;bad publicity&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;scaring other students&amp;#39;. Teachers did not respect my privacy, and took any sickdays that I had as an opportunity to tell my story to the class at great lengths. I had to go to 7 different schools as a result of this. Their rationalization was that I would likely stab someone because it happened to me. At one point a school official asked for a considerable bribe to keep me in school, but my father&amp;#39;s assets had been completely frozen, making him unable to pay even if he wanted to. We went from millions to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note: There&amp;#39;s a lot I left out due to space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was forced into therapy, mental hospital stays, and medication. I was diagnosed ADHD and schizotypal. I&amp;#39;ve tried 25 different antidepressants for my chronic dysthymia/anhedonia, but the only thing that helps is trees. Now I work from home as a writer, copywriter and translator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are photos of my scars, 11 years after the incident (possibly NSFW). Excuse my unkempt appearance, I just woke up and made no effort to shave/prepare. &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgur.com/a/CQC3i&#34;&gt;Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR - My family who were once part of the government of Slovakia ended up being chased out of the country, lost their wealth, my dad was poisoned, and my schizophrenic mom stabbed me multiple times when I was 9.

It&amp;#39;s a movie that I have seen a few times and I&amp;#39;ve also read the book. So while thinking about the movie this is what I realized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you hopefully already know, the overarching premise of A Clockwork Orange revolves around Alex, a violent miscreant with a fondness for Beethoven. After being arrested for murder and rape he is put into a program that is intended to cure him of his violent tendencies. For this program, Alex is forced to watch films of &amp;quot;ultraviolence&amp;quot; while under the influence of a drug that makes him feel terribly sick. Unfortunately, accompanying these violent films is the music of &amp;quot;lovely lovely Ludwig Van&amp;quot;. This causes Alex to develop the association of sickness with not only violence, but also his favorite music. Rather tragic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, if you think back to one of the first scenes of the movie, in which Alex commits the crime that eventually gets him jailed, while Alex and his droogs are brutally beating a crippled author and raping his wife, Alex sings a particular tune. This tune is &amp;quot;Singing In The Rain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that this scene is for the viewer, what the treatment is for Alex. Ever since watching A Clockwork Orange for the first time I have associated &amp;quot;Singing In The Rain&amp;quot; with one of the most disturbing and violent movie scenes that I have ever encountered. As the viewer of this movie I received a side effect almost identical to the one that drives Alex to attempt suicide. Also, having read the book, I can tell you that there is no mention of Alex singing any particular song while beating and raping people. This addition to the story is yet another example of the genius of Stanley Kubrick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If that didn&amp;#39;t blow your mind, nothing will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/Winslowa12&#34;&gt; Winslowa12 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/&#34;&gt; movies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12zd7g/i_just_had_a_major_revelation_about_a_clockwork/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12zd7g/i_just_had_a_major_revelation_about_a_clockwork/"&gt;[196 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Today only, Skullcandy is donating 100% of their online sales to aid those affected by Sandy.
