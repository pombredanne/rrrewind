&lt;p&gt;I started an AMA a few days ago before things got way out of hand. Since then, well, everything has escalated and so has interest in this topic. I saw a post from another Bahraini citizen that I felt was attempting to skew the debate with false information from the pro-government side of the debate, so here I am again, with a new AMA. Ask me anything, I will provide you with facts. I will summarize what was said in my last AMA now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adressing concerns of bias up front: While I am an Atheist, my family is Sunni. My family and I, however, are 100% with the protesters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ask me anything you want. The following points below are simply a summary of the reasons for the uprising - &lt;strong&gt;you don't need to read them if you don't want to&lt;/strong&gt;. They're here for background information and lurkers. Simply ask and I will try my best to answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Shia population of Bahrain comprises 70% of Bahraini citizens.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The ruling family of Bahrain is Sunni.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The government persecutes and marginalizes the Shia population through a variety of methods, including: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Capturing and torturing political prisoners&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Importing massive amounts of unskilled laborers, especially Sunni Muslim laborers, or those who agree to convert / pretend they are Sunni Muslims, and giving them Bahraini passports. This inflates the Sunni population statistics, provides the government with a large and subservient police and army force (the police force is in fact mostly made up of non-Bahrainis from other Sunni Muslim countries) and provides guaranteed buffer votes for the government during elections (more on elections later)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Prioritizing Sunnis, the wealthy, the well-connected, and the government supporters over the poor (who are largely Shia, due to the difficulty in acquiring proper jobs as a result of discrimination) when it comes to social programs that are meant to treat problems the poor have in Bahrain. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A good example of this is a social program meant to provide homes to the poor. The service has a waiting time of a few years, but knowing the right people, being Sunni, or having a bribe helps immensely. Additionally, expats are often pushed to the front of the queue after being naturalized, and so take up valuable resources from the poor of the country who's resources are being used.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fraudulent elections. Bahrain's current political system is an absolute monarchy with a &quot;constitution&quot; (and I use that term extremely loosely) that lays out how politics in Bahrain works. The Bahraini parliament is split into two houses, the lower and upper house. The lower house is an elected house of representatives of the people. The people vote on election day for representatives of their choosing. However, the government engages in massive vote-rigging during these elections. It also intimidates voters, and specifically orders government workers to vote a specific way. This holds true especially for the police and armed forces. They are literally told to vote for a specific person that the government has chosen. Barring this, the government also imports and naturalizes unskilled laborers from around the world (as described above) that they coerce into voting in lockstep with the government. This is all really just to give the government an aura of legitimacy, however. The lower house of parliament's powers are entirely eclipsed by that of the upper house. The upper house of parliament is appointed directly by the King and his aids. The upper house has the power to veto any decision made by the lower house, and they must approve any decision passed by the lower house in order for it to go into effect. &lt;em&gt;Edit: I previously had a statement here that the upper house could vote laws in without lower house support. I was mistaken, and I apologize. However, since royal decrees take precedence over any laws and can be passed directly by the king with no support, our parliament is still meaningless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There is widespread corruption in governmental affairs. &quot;Wastas&quot;, an arabic word meaning &quot;connection&quot; are essential to getting speedy service with anything that involves the government (bribes work as well). However, the corruption is on a &lt;strong&gt;much more massive scale&lt;/strong&gt; when considering things like land distribution. Land is doled out by the government to whomever it wishes. As a result, the ruling family can and often does take large swaths of land as a gift from the government, and then sells that land to a private contractor, pocketing the profit. This is not a fringe issue, and this is not a rare occurrence. &lt;strong&gt;The government of Bahrain frequently uses their power over land distribution to generate obscene profits for the ruling family by selling off Bahraini land that they gift to themselves.&lt;/strong&gt; They sell Bahraini land for their own profit, the land that is owned by all Bahrainis, including the Shia of Bahrain, who receive nothing when their land is sold for absurd profits by corrupt royalty.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The protests are overwhelmingly peaceful and have not adopted a sectarian tone. The large opposition blocs that make up the protests have all agreed to a unifying message, often chanting &quot;La Sinni Wala Shee3ee Fa8a6 Ba7raini&quot; which means &quot;Not Sunni, Not Shia, only Bahraini.&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The protesters main demands revolve around equality and human rights. They wish to see the corruption endemic to our government abolished. They wish to see equality for the Shia population. They wish to see more sensible laws regarding naturalization of citizens (an important point, as &lt;em&gt;50% of Bahrain's population is not Bahraini, and instead mostly unskilled laborers from southeast Asia and nearby Muslim countries&lt;/em&gt;, which is a major issue considering the level of poverty many Bahrainis live in). They wish to see equitable and fair distribution of the wealth gained from the exploitation of the land's natural resources, especially in regards to land distribution (as explained above).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those are just a few points. Ask your questions, and I'll see if I can answer :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/TigerTrap&quot;&gt; TigerTrap &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt; IAmA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fpp8v/iama_bahraini_citizen_and_i_will_tell_you_whats/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fpp8v/iama_bahraini_citizen_and_i_will_tell_you_whats/"&gt;[352 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Playable Angry Birds birthday cake</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fpka6/playable_angry_birds_birthday_cake/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fpka6/playable_angry_birds_birthday_cake/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 14:34:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fpka6/playable_angry_birds_birthday_cake/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fpka6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Playable Angry Birds birthday cake&quot; title=&quot;Playable Angry Birds birthday cake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/cullen9&quot;&gt; cullen9 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&quot;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hwVRzaQNkA&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fpka6/playable_angry_birds_birthday_cake/"&gt;[469 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Playable Angry Birds birthday cake</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fpka6.png" /></item><item><title>What's the heaviest thing I can buy for $10?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fpr1h/whats_the_heaviest_thing_i_can_buy_for_10/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fpr1h/whats_the_heaviest_thing_i_can_buy_for_10/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 19:57:42 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question popped into my head and I thought it would be a good one to ask the crowd here.

We have been dating for about 4 years now, and two years ago she told her mom. Since then my girlfriend cannot call home without hearing about all of the reasons why she she should not be with me: &quot;How can you do this to me?&quot;, &quot;You may be making mistakes like I did with your father&quot; &quot;I was robbed by a black guy and he kind of looks like your boyfriend.&quot; Now that her mom is having actual physical symptoms, I am wondering if the stress that she is putting on herself will actually cause long term damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I swear I'm a nice guy. I'm confident that I could win over even the most discerning parent, yet I'm wondering if it is possible to win her over when my girlfriends mother has mentally turned me into the boogeyman. I would like to get married, but marriage should really involve both families working together, and I'd hate to go ahead with only my family supporting our union, but its looking like that is the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does anybody have any similar success stories they could share or perhaps ideas of what I could do going forward?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you guys for all of the advice, I've never really done this reddit stuff before so I don't know if I can get to the bottom of this post tonight, but I will read everything and reply when I have more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/tads&quot;&gt; tads &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fpqt2/my_korean_girlfriends_mom_is_having_panic_attacks/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fpqt2/my_korean_girlfriends_mom_is_having_panic_attacks/"&gt;[1027 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Skydiver's near impact and landing on top of a mountain</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fpl2l/skydivers_near_impact_and_landing_on_top_of_a/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fpl2l/skydivers_near_impact_and_landing_on_top_of_a/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 15:21:16 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fpl2l/skydivers_near_impact_and_landing_on_top_of_a/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fpl2l.png&quot; alt=&quot;Skydiver's near impact and landing on top of a mountain&quot; title=&quot;Skydiver's near impact and landing on top of a mountain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/eaglex&quot;&gt; eaglex &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/&quot;&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiGdqPfztsc&amp;amp;hd=1&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fpl2l/skydivers_near_impact_and_landing_on_top_of_a/"&gt;[274 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Skydiver's near impact and landing on top of a mountain</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_fpl2l.png" /></item><item><title>Yesterday I had the urge to photograph wolves.
