After we handed off the rest of the island to the army, there was a film crew right on the beach filming us getting into the amtracs, on our way back to more fighting on Peleliu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Seymour Levy and I saw the film crew, we broke rank for about a minute and started cutting up for the camera. The dance? It was called &amp;quot;Truckin&amp;#39;&amp;quot; in those days. It was probably the last &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; moment we had before losing it all forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the film exists because someone claims to have seen it a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At any rate, the film would be worth a lot to me, to see myself again at 20 years old with a very good pal of mine. I&amp;#39;ve looked at the Critical Past and various other internets, but I have not found it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Help if you can.

Here&amp;#39;s some tips from someone who works at a theater to help you with your experience and at the same time hopefully helps prevent future issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you ABSOLUTELY must check your phone, which should be kept on silent at the very least, for a text or missed call, take it outside or keep it VERY well hidden. Taking it outside is your best option, however if you&amp;#39;re in the center of a crowded theater, don&amp;#39;t interrupt the entire row&amp;#39;s viewing experience.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, my mother usually babysits my son whenever I decide to go watch a movie. I will usually check my phone if it vibrates by keeping it where my hip meets the seat, with the screen at its lowest brightness setting, and an article of clothing to cover the light from above. This allows very few, if anyone to see the light. I don&amp;#39;t want to miss an important text of some sort of accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you decide to bring a noisy infant with you, expect complaints to be made about you, or management to ask you to leave. Sometimes both will happen. Find a babysitter or don&amp;#39;t go to the movie at all.&lt;/strong&gt; I for the life of me don&amp;#39;t understand the logic in bringing an infant to the theater. I&amp;#39;m already afraid I&amp;#39;ll have to learn sign language because in 15 or so years, tons of teenagers will be near deaf, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to sign with my hands for &amp;#39;I want a number 10 with no onions&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best thing to do if something is wrong with the picture or a customer is bothering you is to tell management. Don&amp;#39;t ignore any problems.&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;re there to help you. If there&amp;#39;s something wrong, we need to know. If the picture is out of focus, tell us. If there&amp;#39;s a customer constantly on his phone, come tell us. As busy as we can get, we cannot watch the crowd the entire movie. Don&amp;#39;t ignore the problem and complain about it after the movie, because at that point, we probably can&amp;#39;t do anything to correct it now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you must leave via an emergency, notify management. Don&amp;#39;t leave and call or come in 3 days later asking for a refund or passes.&lt;/strong&gt; With my company, refunds can only be handled the same day the tickets are bought for. I.e, if you bought a ticket for a movie playing the 17th, we cannot give you a refund any day after the 17th. Any &amp;#39;late&amp;#39; complaints are treated with suspicion and in many cases WILL NOT be given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaints about prices will get you no where. It&amp;#39;s the same as going to an amusement park: you have to expect marked up prices.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we know we sell expensive food. You could get the same candy at a gas station for a fraction of what you pay at a theater. Complaining and fighting about prices only slows down a concession line, with only hinders the customers behind you even more. I would much rather people call in asking what certain combinations of food would cost, than spend 5 minutes holding up a line of people, telling us about highway robbery. &lt;em&gt;For those who don&amp;#39;t know, most theaters only make their income from the concession stand. I believe we only receive about 5-10% of ticket sales, where the rest of that money goes to the studio and the other factors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your belongings before you leave the theater.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t understand how people leave their phones, car keys, hell even wallets at the theater. There is a policy that states &amp;#39;we are not responsible for lost or stolen items&amp;#39; for a reason. That $300 iPhone you brought in? Someone probably took it. The wallet with a stack of cash you left behind? It&amp;#39;s probably gone if it&amp;#39;s not turned into the lost and found. Don&amp;#39;t be dumb, check yourself before you leave. I hate having to tell people that their brand new phone hasn&amp;#39;t been found, or that their wallet wasn&amp;#39;t turned in. Ushers and managers DO look and try to locate your items, but sometimes their picked up by other patrons. I had a customer that lost his iPad recently and wanted the theater to take responsibility of it. I simply told him, &amp;#39;sir the iPad was your responsibility to take out when you leave, if it isn&amp;#39;t there when we clean the theater, then someone took it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment cards are some of the most powerful tools a customer can use, and abuse.&lt;/strong&gt; Corporate takes comment cards and customer feedback seriously. I&amp;#39;ve watched many people be fired due to comment cards about their bad service, and in each case it was honestly the truth. I&amp;#39;ve personally received a raise because someone wrote in about the exceptional service I&amp;#39;ve provided. If you have ANYTHING to pass along to corporate, comment cards are your best tool. Do not abuse them and write about how we carded you and didn&amp;#39;t let you into a R rated feature. Corporate will only tell you we&amp;#39;re doing our job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R Rated policies are enforced for a reason.&lt;/strong&gt; If we catch you sneaking in, don&amp;#39;t get angry that you&amp;#39;ve be caught. On the other hand if you notice kids obviously sneaking into your R Rated movie, get management to deal with it.** Employees and Managers alike only have so many eyes. Sometimes we do miss people sneaking in, and we will handle it if it&amp;#39;s brought up to us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can address your problems without being rude, and without yelling.&lt;/strong&gt; Have a complaint about our service, our food, our company? Express your concern in an orderly manner. Being the louder person does not make your opinion any more or less valid. Far too often do people believe that complaints need to be voiced with the rudest most loudest attitude. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last but not least, the friendlier you are to staff, the more good karma you receive the more you show up.&lt;/strong&gt; This really doesn&amp;#39;t apply everywhere, but if you&amp;#39;re a nice and friendly regular, who abides by rules and overall are a nice person, you will sometimes be rewarded. We usually will let regular customers who are friendly in for free or give them a free concession item once in a while. It truly does pay to be friendly to employees and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Holy crap guys this is turning into an AMA.

He started around June. He&amp;#39;s a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, for the past month or so, he&amp;#39;s been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he&amp;#39;s very qualified for what I&amp;#39;ve assigned to him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a tough boss, and I&amp;#39;ve never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says &amp;quot;Get to work!&amp;quot; anonymously? He&amp;#39;s a good kid, he&amp;#39;s just been lazy lately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; OP has not abandoned you all, don&amp;#39;t worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it&amp;#39;s for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/prairie_dog.gif&#34;&gt;The hour of reckoning is near.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Edited the poor bastard&amp;#39;s name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won&amp;#39;t be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He&amp;#39;ll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Guys, we aren&amp;#39;t hiring right now. I&amp;#39;m sorry :( Please don&amp;#39;t PM me, I can&amp;#39;t get you a job. If I could, I would - but you&amp;#39;d probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I&amp;#39;d have to come to &lt;a href=&#34;/r/askreddit&#34;&gt;/r/askreddit&lt;/a&gt; on how to deal with the situation. And then I&amp;#39;d get more PM&amp;#39;s asking to be hired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/iaacp&#34;&gt; iaacp &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&#34;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/"&gt;[2929 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gaben in his natural habitat.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x19ey/gaben_in_his_natural_habitat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x19ey/gaben_in_his_natural_habitat/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 20:40:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x19ey/gaben_in_his_natural_habitat/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ArYqjDmLgoQUjBUN.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gaben in his natural habitat.&#34; title=&#34;Gaben in his natural habitat.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/the_dragon01&#34;&gt; the_dragon01 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/&#34;&gt; gaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgur.com/PuVJd&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x19ey/gaben_in_his_natural_habitat/"&gt;[418 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>Gaben in his natural habitat.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ArYqjDmLgoQUjBUN.jpg" /></item><item><title>TIL: Chipotle works with the food donation connection and donates their excess food from everyone of their locations to local charities and non profit organizations to help feed the homeless and less fortunate.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/x179s/til_chipotle_works_with_the_food_donation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/x179s/til_chipotle_works_with_the_food_donation/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 20:07:01 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/x179s/til_chipotle_works_with_the_food_donation/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://e.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tBwAuvcXD1mQskeX.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TIL: Chipotle works with the food donation connection and donates their excess food from everyone of their locations to local charities and non profit organizations to help feed the homeless and less fortunate.&#34; title=&#34;TIL: Chipotle works with the food donation connection and donates their excess food from everyone of their locations to local charities and non profit organizations to help feed the homeless and less fortunate.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/zwillam&#34;&gt; zwillam &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/&#34;&gt; todayilearned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foodtodonate.com/Fdcmain/Testimonials.aspx&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/x179s/til_chipotle_works_with_the_food_donation/"&gt;[157 comments]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><media:title>TIL: Chipotle works with the food donation connection and donates their excess food from everyone of their locations to local charities and non profit organizations to help feed the homeless and less fortunate.</media:title><media:thumbnail url="http://e.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tBwAuvcXD1mQskeX.jpg" /></item></channel></rss>
