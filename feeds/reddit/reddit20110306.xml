Long story short, what I may have found is a crime scene belonging to a serial killer possibly as early as 1967.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the original story from the link. What should I do about this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following story is entirely true: In college I knew a local technician on campus who had a master key to every room on the whole campus. He would walk around and find doors he hadn't opened for fun just to see what was behind them on his off time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some friends of mine and myself all met the local technician in the technology building after dark, and after a bit of deliberation decided that we wanted to explore the depths of the tech building. We began our journey by going into a well used auditorium in the building with a door off to stage left. It went into a staircase that went down into the boiler room. The boiler room looked like you'd expect, except for a huge duct that required you climb a ladder to get into. The duct was not well lit at all - a lightbulb every 10 feet if we were lucky. The duct dead-ended and made a 90 degree turn to the right. It was there that the local technician (who had done time in the service) insisted that someone else take the lead since that was as far as he had ever gone on his own and was a bit uncomfortable going first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I offered to go first and went down the scarcely lit duct with my cell phone as my only source of light. At this point in the hall most of the bulbs were burned out which led to a near perfect darkness besides the few flashlights and cell phones that we had brought with us. After walking about halfway down the duct, I noticed that the hall we were in had a small room. I saw a very old looking chair (see picture 1) but it didn't hold my interest for long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I continued walking until another member of the group called to me and directed me to come back and look closer at the room with the chair in it. We noticed the chair pushed all the way against the wall, and small piles of cloth on the ground next to the chair. Boxes littered the ground near the cloth. The cloth was turning a weird pink hue (see pictures 2 &amp;amp; 3) possibly from age(?) They were also covered with dirt from decades of being left there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked at the largest of the boxes on the ground and found a date, (see pictures 4 &amp;amp;5) June 24th, 1943. These boxes had been here for a very long time, and it looks as if they hadn't ever been seen since then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most frightening part of this whole scene was the situation of the chair though...Please note that the scene in picture 1 had not been altered in any way before or after we took the photos. If you look closely at the chair - and more importantly the wall behind the chair, you'll notice thin metal wiring protruding from behind the chair on either side. You'll also notice that it's about the same height on the wall that you would expect to see it if you were to tie someone's arms to the wall using the gauze that we found in piles on the ground. I hope you liked the story and the pictures. This was the absolute creepiest thing i've ever seen in my life, but it was an amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Went exploring one night on campus and found a place deep inside one of the basements of a building where i'm reasonably sure that someone was tied to a chair sometime around 1943.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Added TL;DR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NEXT DAY EDIT: This post prompted me to do a bit of research on what I found. The building this is in was built in 1965. In 1967 there was a series of murders involving women being abducted. The first victim was from my school and was missing her hands and feet when her body was found. Also multiple stab wounds were determined as the cause of death. I have no idea what to do with this, or if it's anything at all. Can anyone make a really rough guess as to if the medical bandages have blood on them or not just by looking at them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what should I do here? The obvious answer is to take it to the police, but I found this 3 years ago. Is it even worth it? I don't even know if it's related or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT :&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are asking about the pictures. I linked to the thread that contains the photos on the first link at the top of is comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I've called the local police, and they told me to call back in 30 minutes after their roll call is done.

He tell me that he punched the guy in the face, which gave him enough time to escape... he knows not to drink and drive but between staying with a rapist and driving he chose the latter. Not knowing exactly what to do I tell him to pull over in the nearest parking lot, which he does. He says he wants to report it to the police but 1. he's so tired and doesn't want to deal with it any more that night, and 2. he is in a car drunk, which will be an issue if he calls the police or if he goes to the station and they ask how he got there if he appears intoxicated. He goes to the backseat of his car to lay down and passes out while I'm on the phone with him. He wakes up a few hours later and texts me that he is driving home, though he is low on gas and the rapist has stolen all the money from his wallet, as he found out when he went to the pump. I later confirm with his roommate that he did indeed make it home. It has been less than 24 hours since this happened and I need some advice on what I can do for him or what I should advise him to do. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note: He said the guy did use a condom, so I'm not overly concerned about an STD (though, of course, he should be tested just in case).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note 2: My friend has virtually no money (kicked out of his house at 17 for being gay; he is 22 now), so he can't afford a doctor visit unless things like this are free (such as if the police refer him to a doctor for examination). I have no idea how this works or if money is involved with such an examination in cases of rape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note 3: This happened in a city an hour away... should he report it to the police here or will he have to go back to that city to file the report?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note 4: I sincerely believe this event happened the way he stated as I know him well and he is not one to lie or exaggerate situations, especially not like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/concernedforfriend&quot;&gt; concernedforfriend &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/fyj6s/my_male_friend_was_raped_last_night_by_another/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fyj6s/my_male_friend_was_raped_last_night_by_another/"&gt;[312 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bear Grylls' worst enemy</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fyn1b/bear_grylls_worst_enemy/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fyn1b/bear_grylls_worst_enemy/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2011 23:18:59 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/ten_twentyfour&quot;&gt; ten_twentyfour &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/&quot;&gt; funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/qyrex.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fyn1b/bear_grylls_worst_enemy/"&gt;[56 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free internet access to people inside Libya - spread the info.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fyema/free_internet_access_to_people_inside_libya/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fyema/free_internet_access_to_people_inside_libya/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2011 14:34:27 +0000</pubDate><description>submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/Codeworks&quot;&gt; Codeworks &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt; worldnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dovenews/status/44400001341865984&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fyema/free_internet_access_to_people_inside_libya/"&gt;[61 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Video interview with Scumbag Steve -- filmed by a redditor.
