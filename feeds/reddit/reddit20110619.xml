It's not bloodhound level of anything, but definitely above most humans. Not only do the normal smells everyone else experiences seem more intense (ruling out New York in the summer), but I pick up on other things other people can't. I can also detect the individual scents of other people. Not perfume or deoderant or this like but the actual scent of the individual. It's impossible to explain it to people who can't experience it for themselves, really. I've seen several doctors about this over the years and have received no cogent explanation as to why. The best theory I've heard was from my gp. You see, I've had chronic, severe nosebleeds my entire life, and according to him this has caused the lining of my nose to become extremely sensitive, becoming more and more so every time it has to regrow. Some practical applications: If there are a bunch of cups people have sat down on a table and no one can tell whose is whose I can smell the cups and tell which cup belongs to which person. I settled an argument between two friends about whose bill a ten dollar bill was by scent. One time I realized that my girlfriend was cheating on me with one of my friends because I went over to his apartment and smelled her on his bed. so, yeah.

A couple months ago he was diagnosed with cancer and because of other medical issues there is little hope that he will live to the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mother was very sick when I was a youngster and my father worked out of town. While all the other kids were out playing soccer I was shooting pool, making bets on sporting events and learning how to mix drinks.

No legal action happened, we kept it all within the family (for better or worse) and most of our relatives told my family to not interfere and warned my parents into not helping him out. But my parents, being awesome, were like, 'fuck that' and we decided to help him out as much as we can, to at least morally support him in a way that his parents have failed to do so. My mother actually had to talk to my grandparents to convince them to help him out as well, and after my uncle took the car back in exchange for my cousin's computer, my grandparents gave my cousin a car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So anyway, my cousin (we'll call him B just to make it easier), with the urging from my brother, applied and got into the same college my brother attends, which was out of state. We thought that by him going there, he could start anew, a blank slate. We made this assumption that he had already hit bottom (being kicked out from his family and all) and the only thing we really told him that he MUST do, was to do well in school and to prove everyone wrong. To get a degree, a good job, and basically just be successful (his family and our relatives kept warning us that he wasn't going to amount to anything and that this was a waste of time). My parents made it a point to not lecture B about the things he did wrong, and decided to just trust him. We sent him off to school with our blessing, hooked him up with a place with reduced rent and reliable room mates who are my brother's friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it's been a year. And I hate to say this, but I keep picturing B's bitch ass stepmother sitting there going, 'But what if he fails?' with an 'I told you so' look on her face.' Because she may be right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First off: my uncle was not lying, that kid is addicted to games. Despite his constant complaining of money problems or his need to find a job, he has not yet found a job, work study or otherwise (at first complaining that he didn't want a job that paid merely minimum wage) and then he dropped $50 to buy the European key to SC2 so he could play with his online friends from there. There was one week when my brother logged into steam and saw that B had more than 100 hours logged in for that one week. He has this refusal to communicate with us, and whenever I called him just check up on him, the only time he has ever picked up the phone on me was the first time I called him and he didn't have my number saved on his phone. He has never called me back. He ignores instant messages and emails. Basic communication is made through my brother's friend (B's roommate) and he has to get up and physically grab B for us (it's not like we don't know where he is- he is always at his computer). OR, my brother will have to go online, find some girl who's his online friend, and have her pass a message along. I'm fairly certain he's lying to us about his grades and is most likely failing and is on academic probation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We've gone and stopped by the place to check up on him several times, and every time we find out he hasn't done the basic things that we told him that he should've done the first week he moved there, i.e., change his license to that state so he could change his car insurance because it would be cheaper. He hasn't admitted his failures or his bad grades to us, and whenever we'd talk to him face to face about short term goals and long term goals he'd present himself in a convincing manner, yet when we'd check up on it, nothing would be done. Even when we just asked that he pick up his phone or to call us back, he can't even do that. But at least he can pay his bills on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I kinda just wanna punch this kid in the face, you know? It's like, my parents went out of their way to help you, and here you are, shitting on your second chance- are you in no way humbled? I'm not saying that B should be groveling or sucking up to us since we helped him out, but good god, if you're gonna lie to us and not even try to make yourself a better person or at least quit games enough to pass your classes, then maybe we did make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; You know those stories where you go and help someone in need, and then they go and be awesome and come back super successful? That does not always happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; The last post I made, B actually saw it, and I was a little embarrassed to be airing the family laundry on the internet. Also, my brother found my reddit name. But yo, cousin, if you read this one, I just called you like, 8 times- I know you're awake and hitting ignore; call me back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTW, EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Not sure if this was mentioned in the original post or not, but: he is financially independent and has been for a while. It was his own decision to go back to school. Nobody is making him do anything, he is where he is because he chose to continue his education and we are supporting that decision. If anything, we just wanted him to get at least a part time job so he can continue putting himself through school. If he does fail out, there is nothing else for us to help him with. We know that. Please stop assuming we're &lt;em&gt;forcing&lt;/em&gt; him to adhere to this path. &lt;strong&gt;PLEASE READ THIS EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/otherself&quot;&gt; otherself &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/i3ohm/one_year_later_update_to_my_cousin_got_all_of_his/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i3ohm/one_year_later_update_to_my_cousin_got_all_of_his/"&gt;[170 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>WHY DIDN'T THEY FIX THIS.
