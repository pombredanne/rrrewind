That link can be found here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/17w4lj/i_am_an_atheist_my_religious_family_is_bringing/&#34;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/17w4lj/i_am_an_atheist_my_religious_family_is_bringing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s a little backstory. I am 25 years old, and I have a son who is 2 years old that I will be taking to church when he gets old enough to understand. I am an atheist, though I have studied in many different religions. I do not wish for my son to be religious, but I do want to take him to different religions and churches throughout his life so he has a choice, which is an option most religious families do not offer (this is not right now, mind you, this is when he is older.) My mother disagrees. She wants to take him to her Christian church starting right away, and wanted to bring me to a church group to restore my faith. If I went to one group, and my mind did not change, they drop the subject all together. I agreed. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to record the audio, though I was taking what everyone thought were “notes” but really it was just for you redditors! Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I entered the church group, I did let them all know of my intentions. They asked why I did not believe, I told them because I need more physical proof. I believe in evolution, and even tried to reason with them. Even when I did grow up religious, I never took the bible literally. I took everything metaphorically. How many times can a book be translated, burnt, and re-written for people to not take it literally? I believe the fire and brimstone that rained on Sodom and Gommorah was the act of Santorini Volcano that was said to have erupted in 1628 BC. I also believe that Moses was a genius when it came to warfare and geographical knowledge. I do not believe he parted the ocean, but I believe he waited for the current to drop, exposing a land strip between the two large bodies of water (which was actually there at the time,) then crossing, then the water current rose afterwards, drowning Pharaoh’s army. Many of these theories have been stated, and I believe them through other means of extended research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group looked at me like I was stupid, and one girl actually said, “Do you actually believe that crap?” in which I held back a smile. They continued to say that everything in the book is to be taken literally. When I inquired about what we always inquire about, the Old Testament about slavery, women shouldn’t speak, women’s rights, killing for disobeying children, (I Corinthians 11:3, I Corinthians 11:8-9, (Leviticus 21:9), etc.,) only THEN was it ok to be open for interpretation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One man stated, “God is everywhere, he is all knowing. You are not supposed to question him, just have faith in the Bible, and have faith in him, and you will be rewarded.” “I respect that you believe in that, though I need something with harder evidence. There are many loop holes and open ended questions, also there are so many different beliefs between religions that is causes chaos and hatred, which is the exact of what religions are supposed to teach.” One girl, and she was the roughest out of the bunch, stated that there wouldn’t be so much hate if the other religions and if the sinners would stop. She said it is not our fault that god hates them. Here is when I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I ranted for a while. I told them that their bible says that their god will purposely confuse people of his identity, which will lead to the 4th biblical beast of the apocalypse. The beasts of the apocalypse are sometimes, and very arguably, related to religious wars fought by man. Now, if that is true, then god purposely confuses the people of the world to fight one another in his name, meaning any religion is the same religion with the same god, but different as to how, why, what they are worshipping. The bible also states that “whatever spiritual laws you hold on Earth, god will uphold in heaven.” This means whatever you believe for your religion, god has to accept it, since it wouldn’t be your fault if you were raised into believing a potato was god. Since all religions are the same religion, which is stated in the bible, then god has to uphold the beliefs of all religions. That means extremists that are blowing themselves up in the name of Allah will meet you in the same heaven you are going to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, they did not like that. My old pastor smiled a bit, he was actually always supportive of my knowledge and liked it when I questioned him when I was younger. Everyone else was yelling that it’s not true, god hates those people, blah, blah, blah. I told them I will gladly admit it is not true and they are correct if they can find and show me ONE verse in the bible that says, “God hates…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another person said it was still murder for abortions, and protesting outside of the hospitals is ok to do. I told him it was not, because the protest is out of anger. I told her that Jesus once walked into the temple and saw gambling. He acted out of anger and tipped over the tables infuriated. That is understandable, because it was the temple, and even then he prayed for forgiveness. Jesus did not go to a casino and act out of anger, hence, there should be no protesting at hospitals, but if they bring that to your churches, go ahead and kick them out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same chick asked if I was a Satanist. I replied that I am not a Satanist because I do not believe in Satan. I even said that Satanists are actually Atheists who do not worship Satan, but follow the Satan ideology of thinking for yourself with your human mind’s free will, to question things, and to treat others with human morality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned gay marriage, my exact words were, “I support gay marriage, but we are not even touching that subject tonight. We might as well play a game of Risk if we wanted to be out that late.” I actually referenced a Dali Lama quote that I saw was posted on Reddit a while ago. “All the world’s major religions, with their emphasis on love, compassion, patience, tolerance, and forgiveness can and do promote inner values. But the reality of the world today is that grounding ethics in religion is no longer adequate. This is why I am increasingly convinced that the time has come to find a way of thinking about spirituality and ethics beyond religion altogether.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They told me that I needed to believe in Jesus to forgive my sins. I told them I believe Jesus was a man who existed, but not the son of a god. My response was a theory I wrote for one of my college essays. I gave the short explanation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you dig into the bible, every “miracle” in the old testament can be explained through science and common sense. The only thing that can’t be explained were the miracles Jesus performed. So my theory, Jesus was not the son of god, but a genius when it came to the Jewish religion. For the sake of argument, let’s say there was a god, he did exist. Jesus knew the rule “Whatever law you hold on Earth, God will uphold in heaven,” so he came up with a plan and got his disciple buddies in on it, too. He explained to them what he would do. He knew in that religion there is no redemption for sins. If he could convince everyone that he is the son of god and born from a virgin, people would believe it if he performed “miracles” or, at least, led them to believe he did. If they believed enough that they would be saved by his sacrifice, god would have no choice but to uphold that in heaven. So Jesus was not the son of god sent to Earth to die for our sins, but if you believe it enough, then he did die for your sins. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mind fuck, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rest of the meeting went this way, everything they said to try to prove god’s existence was shot down, but respectively. We went through evolution, how the Earth is not 6,000 years old, and I even told them that if you didn’t take the bible literal, it would be more believable to say a higher power created the Earth in 7 days, however, realize that it is not fact, it is story telling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That SAME girl told me that nothing good can come from being atheist. She was getting on my nerves. I would like to thank Reddit, once again, for showing me the story behind this quote. I could not find the original quote, so I’m just typing how I think it went exactly. “Whenever someone of a religion does something morally ethical, it is because they have a higher power telling them to do so. They have a reward they are aiming for, or a punishment they are avoiding. When an atheist does something good, such as donates to charity, holds open a door, shovels their neighbors sidewalk, they do not do it because there is a book telling them to do so. There is not a god telling them to do nice, nor is there a hell they will be sent to if they do not do these good tasks. They do it out of their own sense of self morality. That is a value that every religious person can learn from.” The night was a long, calm debate; however, I could see the frustration in many of their eyes. My old pastor and a few of the students there were the only ones actually interested in my other views. The main reasons I explained that I did not believe in a god was that nothing has ever shown itself to me to prove of one’s existence. Everything else that disproves the bible is fact, such as fossils, geographical time lapses that shows the Earth is much older than 6,000 years, the Higgs Boson particle, and evolution (though still technically a theory, but let’s face it, when we find missing links, more missing links will keep appearing. It’s like we need enough to make a flip book for these people.” I told them I do believe there is something, possibly, but probably not, an energy level that we evolve into on another plain of existence within the same dimensions, but I did not feel like going into detail of space/time and wormholes, how thoughts and dreams can be explained, and how conscious minds can communicate on a certain brain wave, etc. (If anyone is curious about these theories, check out Spirit Science on YouTube. Not sure if it’s true, but very interesting nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Either way, through my explanations and my ideas and reasoning, I was respectfully dismissed from my family trying to force my son to go to their church. I kept a level head, counteracted their accusations of what was evil, and explained my reasoning behind my beliefs without being preachy (no pun intended.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ok, I get I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said technically a theory. I am not a science major, so I guess I did not completely understand the power behind the word &amp;quot;theory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/user/apierson0&#34;&gt; apierson0 &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/&#34;&gt; atheism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/17y85v/i_am_an_atheist_my_religious_family_is_bringing/&#34;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/17y85v/i_am_an_atheist_my_religious_family_is_bringing/"&gt;[1448 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIL of a plane crash caused by a smuggled crocodile.
