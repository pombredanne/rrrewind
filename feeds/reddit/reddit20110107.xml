How do I get motivated?</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/exzji/sigh_live_at_home_college_dropout_forever_alone/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/exzji/sigh_live_at_home_college_dropout_forever_alone/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2011 17:12:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's face it, we see these posts every day. Here is VeggieLover's guide to getting motivated when you're acting all emo:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wake up in the morning, not the afternoon - I know this sounds crazy, but start a routine where you wake up and shower in the morning instead of at 4pm. It's important to be awake when most other people are if you expect to accomplish anything. If you don't have a job, start living your life on a 9-5 schedule.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Brush your teeth, comb/brush your hair, shave, and dress nicely. If you don't have nice clothes, go buy some. If you don't know what looks nice, check in magazines or online (or ask a friend).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Now you look nice. Doesn't that feel good! Looking nice is a great way to have self-confidence when you're out and about.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make a list. What do you want to be that you aren't right now. Fit? Employed? Sober? Evil Genius? Go crazy!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Order your list by priority (what you want to be most of all).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your goal at this point is to get off Reddit, get off video games, and just plain stop doing other things until you reach your goal. If you want to be fit, go see a personal trainer and make a plan. Get a buddy to go with you. Make a habit of accomplishing your goal. If you want this that badly, start prioritizing it in your life (not just on paper). Motivation is a mindset.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get off drugs/alcohol and other depressants until you become the person you want. Nothing kills motivation like a hangover or being high. Additionally, masturbation is fine in moderation, but if you jerk it 6x a day, you will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be motivated. Cut it back to once a day or less to have more energy.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Repeat until you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the list.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know a lot of this seems like common sense, but people tend to get in a funk and don't actually think this through. &lt;strong&gt;You are the only person who can make positive changes in your lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're depressed, see a therapist. If you're forever alone, build your self-confidence by dressing nicely and then go find some meetup groups that you're interested in attending. You want to meet people that you have something in common with so that there's some easy ice breakers in conversation. You have to put yourself out there to get positive results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's scary, but damn it what's the worst that can happen. You have one life, now go live it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tldr; Change is hard work. Do or do not, there is no try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/VeggieLover&quot;&gt; VeggieLover &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/&quot;&gt; AskReddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/comments/exzji/sigh_live_at_home_college_dropout_forever_alone/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/exzji/sigh_live_at_home_college_dropout_forever_alone/"&gt;[599 comments]&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Too far.

Being the upstanding citizen I am, I pulled into the nearest parking space and placed my hands at ten and two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ma'am do you know why I stopped you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;No sir, I don't.&quot; (I didn't have a clue. My husband was home with our kid and I needed to get her bathed and ready for bed. School starts early these days. Maybe I'd been speeding? But through the parking lot? Not likely...)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;You cut through here lot to avoid a red light.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Um-I what? Is that even illegal--probably so, he's a cop. He knows the laws, right? &quot;Oh, no sir. I was just pulling in for coffee and changed my mind last minute. Resolutions and all that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I need to see your license and proof of insurance. You cut through the parking lot to avoid a red light.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At which point I proceeded to explain to him that I didn't. This went on while I dug out my driver's license and insurance. (I know better than to try to argue with a police officer--I just REALLY didn't do anything wrong, and was frustrated he wouldn't believe me.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He took my info and asked if the address on my license was current. It wasn't. We moved a year ago, and I haven't updated it. (I should've just lied.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then wrote me 2 tickets on some electronic thingy and asked me to sign it with a stylus. There wasn't anything to read, it just had the list of the tickets I was receiving and then an X____. I felt very uncomfortable signing because I'd never seen this before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't understand what I'm signing? This isn't a ticket like I'm used to getting, and there's no text. It just says for me to sign?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Just sign it. It's just like every ticket you've ever gotten.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm not so sure about this. Is there any way I can see what I'm signing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fine, lady--whatever.&quot; He sauntered back to his car and I texted my husband to let him know he'd probably need to get the kiddo into the bathtub. The policeman brought me a printout of what I was about to sign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was telling the truth, it said that I wasn't admitting anything, and I was just agreeing to appear in court. Fine and dandy, I signed and went about putting on my seatbelt, taking a couple of deep breaths, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I was backing out of my parking spot, he gunned his car--cutting me off. I slammed on my breaks and barely missed him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What. The. Hell?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat in my car, waiting for him to move and calling him every dirty name I could think of. (Under my breath.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tap tap tapped on my window with his ridiculously bright flashlight. &quot;Don't move. I just ran your name through our computer and I am showing a state-wide warrant for your arrest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I panicked. I'm just a normal, mostly law-abiding citizen-- I taught school for years and now I stay at home with our kid. I spend most of my free time volunteering at her school, and this just wasn't something that happened to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cop went back to his car and I texted my husband. &lt;em&gt;This cop says I have a warrant out for my arrest. Please keep your phone next to you and answer it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hubs then call/texted me-but I told him to chill out. I'd let him know what was up as soon as I could.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cop returned to my car and asked me to step out. I saw the handcuffs, and asked him if he was arresting me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told me he was and asked me to turn around. I asked him if there was any way we could NOT do the handcuff thing since I was about a mile away from my house in a busy parking lot and scared my daughter's friends or their parents might see me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He just shook his head and motioned for me to turn around. When he cuffed me, it hurt. I'm short (5ft) and have short arms. The way my arms were turned when he cuffed me (thumbs facing away from each other, behind my back) was a pretty impossible position, and the cuffs dug in in. I told him it was hurting me and he told me that I was wrong, and it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It hurt so bad I started crying. I said over and over again, &quot;My arms aren't long enough for this and it's hurting me. Is there any other way to cuff me? Please, this hurts me. This is causing me a lot of pain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told me to shut up and get in the back of the car. I continued crying and telling him that the handcuffs were really hurting me. After five or so minutes of sitting in the back of the squad car with the cuffs on, he opened the door and undid one of the handcuffs and cuffed them in front. THANK GOD because seriously, that shit HURT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then went over to my car and dug through my wallet. I asked what he was doing and he said my car was being impounded. Why? He said it was standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Can I please call my husband and ask him to come and get it? I live less than a minute from here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;No. This car's being towed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Awesome. He then went and dug all around in my car. I asked what he was doing and he told me he was looking for anything suspicious. (Unless car seats and goldfish crackers are suspicious-I figured I was probably in the clear.) We waited in the busy parking lot for half an hour for the two truck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point, I convinced him to let me call my husband and make sure he was giving our daughter her allergy medicine. (He's notorious for forgetting.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told him the dosage, and that I was on my way to jail. He asked me what for. I still didn't know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I asked the cop what I was being arrested for, and he told me he didn't know. It was just showing up as a misdemeanor from a different county, and he was taking me in. I asked if I was being officially arrested and he told me yes. (This surprised me because he didn't read me my rights. I guess I've watched too many cop shows-I thought they were supposed to do that.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He droveto the police station. (Did you know they have a super secret back entrance for people going to jail? I had no idea.) Then we waited around for a fax from the other police department my warrant was issued from. (And I mostly alternated between crying and trying not to throw up. I was in REAL FREAKIN' JAIL for crying out loud.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, there was a shift change or something, because they lost the paperwork, and it had to be resent. We waited another half hour, and the cop behind the counter asked him to uncuff me, so he did. I took off all my jewelry, and wasn't allowed to touch my phone. When I asked what was going on, they told me nothing yet-- they were still waiting on that paperwork, but I wasn't allowed to use my phone or call my husband.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I waited. When the fax finally came in, it turned out that I'd been pulled over in a town an hour away for an expired inspection sticker, and (over a year ago) when I'd sent them the check along with the proof that I'd gotten my inspection renewed, it never made it to them. (Side note: from now on, I will always pay my tickets IN PERSON-lesson learned.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My fine was $364 dollars and I was allowed to call my husband and tell him to bring that EXACT amount to the police station. (Apparently cops are too dumb to make change.) Then they took my stuff away, put it in a little locker and took my mug shot, fingerprints, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point they told me my mug shot would be available for viewing on line as long as I was being held, but then it would come right down as soon as I was released. I assume this is true, because I haven't been able to find it anywhere. (Thank goodness.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I had to sit in a dirty jail cell and wait on my husband to bring the cash. He wasn't able to secure a sitter for our daughter last minute, so he had to bring her with him. (It was well past her bedtime.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he got there, he was told she wouldn't be allowed to go back with him, and that she just had to sit out on the bench... of the police station... alone... at 11pm. So, he convinced some lady cop to sit with her, and she drew a picture while he brought me the cash back where I was being detained. (They wouldn't take a credit card.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, I had to fill out paperwork, and they wouldn't let him go back up with our daughter until they'd released me. (Something about how he was locked back there with me, and they didn't want to press the buzzer more than necessary.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which meant, that I was blindly signing stuff and freaking out about my kid sitting out front with a stranger. (My husband said she was already pretty freaked out about having to leave the house so late.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The copies they gave me of the paperwork I signed are pretty illegible, but I think at some point I have a court date in the other county for my expired inspection ticket. I did some research today, and no-the check I sent them for 20 dollars hadn't been cashed. Crap. I screwed the pooch there by not following up, eh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We got my car out of the impound lot (which is just some towing company's lot in a sketch part of town, btw) and that cost us $150 bucks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After midnight, we got home and put our daughter to bed. My wrists were still swollen from the handcuffs, and today they're bruised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still can't believe I got arrested. But I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called a lawyer today (because that's what you do when you get arrested, right?) but they told me they wouldn't help me. The receptionist actually said, &quot;We wouldn't want to file a complaint against the police or anything. We use our relationship with them to get probation and such for our clients, and you don't bite the hand that feeds you. You know what I mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, now I don't know what to do. Should I just pay the fines and pretend like it never happened? I want it to go away, but I am also feeling pretty violated right now...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tl;dr got arrested last night for an expired car inspection, and I don't know if or how I should go about fighting it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: The check that didn't clear was for $20. I just had to pay the fee after I renewed the inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/ArrestedMom&quot;&gt; ArrestedMom &lt;/a&gt;
